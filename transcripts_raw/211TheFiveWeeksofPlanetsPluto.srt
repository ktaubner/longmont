It's repulsive?

39
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,820
It's nasty.

40
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Signing hats and selling...

41
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:15,060

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060

43
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,060

Sell two hats for $30 and you're going to sign them for $60?

00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,300
Depends on the hat too, because some of them are the Ebbets hats that I was either given,

46
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,020
I was given all of them.

47
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,260
You never bought a hat made?

48
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,260
No.

49
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,260
No, they're too expensive.

50
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,260
They're too expensive.

51
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,260
I never bought a hat.

52
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,900
You guys ever do flat bill brim hats from New Era?

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,580
I've never worn a flat brim hat in my life.

54
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,580
And you ride on the brim?

55
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,580
Mine said ex-vegan-ex, man.

56
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
Oh, you did one of those?

57
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,580
Oh, for real.

58
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580
Oh my God.

59
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
I used to wear it.

60
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,460
This is my daily driver outfit, ready?

61
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:53,180
I would wear a flat bill hat, new era hat that said X Vegan X on the bottom. What

62
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,380
team was the don't remember couldn't for the life of me remember what team it was

63
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:01,020
had that it might have been just a blank one. Actually, oh, that's even blamer.

64
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,460
Is that crazy? I think you went to lids. I went to live at the thirty dollars on

65
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,060
the play, but I was like sports or game. Yeah, whatever nothing so that right

66
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:22,140
Abercrombie sweatpants that had the tattered, the tattered pros down the side of it that

67
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,140
said Abercrombie.

68
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:27,780
I know the ones you're talking about, the wool ones that are really worn.

69
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
They were comfy.

70
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Wasn't that like...

71
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,780
Aero-possil t-shirt.

72
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
Aero.

73
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,780
Wasn't that like a thing that dudes in the hardcore scene would do though?

74
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,780
I'm not done, man.

75
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Yeah, dude.

76
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,780
And you need one that you grew up in.

77
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
Yeah, and here's what I'd do, bro.

78
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,780
I'd take my sweatpants.

79
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,100
This was the wave in Myrtle Beach, Myrta Beach.

80
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,660
Myrta Beach hardcore.

81
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,260
you would take your waistband on your sweatpants, you'd roll that bitch about

82
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,200
forty times. You roll up your waistband, right? None of this. Who came up with

83
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,420
this shit? Yeah. Who decided that this looked good? This sounds like they

84
00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,140
gonna be rude to say, but it sounds like somebody saw a special needs person and

85
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:05,340
said, I love that guy's swag. I love his swag. We need to, we need to,

86
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,220
and then... We need to do this in the hardcore scene. Dude, and then some...

87
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,060
Yeah, that guy's moshing like crazy. And then either some old schools,

88
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,600
I'd get the old school vans or I'd have some like DC shoes with the laces taken

89
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,100
out. Which DC, like DC court graphics. The one with the big, the heel.

90
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,540
Something big. The DC heel logo. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's the court graphics.

91
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,380
Something big, man. With that big tongue. Yeah. Big puffy tongue, man.

92
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:33,380
I was wearing like, when I was like probably around the same age as you,

93
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,580
I was wearing like three quarter sleeve shirts,

94
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,620
like the fucking those ones. Oh yeah. And then like the,

95
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:46,900
I was wearing like high water pants, dude. I need to see that. Oh my God.

96
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,140
You could not believe I had like, I would put pomade in my hair and shit.

97
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,420
Dude, I used to put pomade in my hair. Yeah.

98
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,980
I can't, I think that you used to,

99
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,460
when I'm picturing you at the same age, like the same age that we're describing,

100
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,660
what age are we talking about? Like 16, 17, something like that. I was fucking 11.

101
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,220
Oh, you were 11 doing that? Yeah, my brother dressed me up like a doll

102
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:14,180
Every day, man. He took me to the mall. I used all my Santa gift cards at the mall, and I'd

103
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,620
just dress like him and his friends.

104
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:23,420
There was a specific type of wave that skaters were on in 2014 where every single one of them

105
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:27,020
was slicking back their hair, wearing these fucking high water pants. You could see your

106
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
socks.

107
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,700
I've had so many insane eras, man. I had a crazy ass Christmas sweater I used to wear

108
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,180
every day when I was 15.

109
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,860
Don't even try to play on me.

110
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,580
I didn't play with that shit man. Don't even try to play. I had three of them. I'd wear

111
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:44,900
these like. Mine was from Urban Outfitters dude. I've had a lot of eras too. I used to

112
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,060
dress like Mercury and I dressed like Venus for a while. I feel like I had a Mars era

113
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,140
for a minute. What era do you feel like you're in these days? Honestly? Be real with me.

114
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:01,220
You looking mad Plutonian. Probably Pluto. Pluto I could see that. I'm thinking about

115
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,740
it and I feel like, I'm not sure it's going to stick. Yeah. But I feel like I'm like Pluto

116
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,540
last three days. Did you have any errors like this when you were younger like we're talking

117
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:17,140
about? Well, I think you can probably guess that I was, you know, new balances. Yep. Cargoes,

118
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:24,220
cargos or glasses, full pajama pants, glasses, tape in the middle, glasses, pocket protector,

119
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:31,840
sweater vest. No, I would not wear anything that I the least it just might not as well

120
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll not even be clothes. Yeah, okay, could you were full PJ you dress like a

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,600
slug? PJ PJ. Oh yeah, you dress like the cookie monster. I bet like I just woke

122
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:40,880
up

123
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,600
four days. I bet cookie monster sweat pans and he was walking. Imagine walking

124
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,520
behind him in school and seeing that that that that meat that meat way through

125
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,600
those thin ass pants.

126
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,480
Thin as pants of all time. Yeah, I really went to school. My pajamas every

127
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:59,400
day showed the print. Yeah, you had the print a huge print. Yeah, huge print.

128
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,640
yeah, that middle school print three prong print. What happened to my print?

129
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,720
My print was bigger in middle school than it is now as an adult. Yeah,

130
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,560
what ratio of your legs? I think that

131
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,920
my print got smaller. My print doesn't look small. You're a big pricks or

132
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,200
little

133
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:20,200
bro. My print, my print, just a dot. You got that dot my print. My print

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,000
looks like it's like you get your like wearing a glove, like a knuckle and a

135
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,600
glove. Looks like I brought my own eraser. My print that I'm walking around

136
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,460
both. I got the damn the the freaking Larry David poorly fitting pants. Oh

137
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,100
yeah, I'm talking about that. I know that. Yeah, I got it. Probably got it

138
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,400
right now. Yeah, I had that shit the other day in the airport and I look at

139
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:42,600
my

140
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,320
I'm seeing your tent bro is

141
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
strong.

142
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,560
Oh, my God, get that shit away.

143
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,880
Next thing man, we have to be done with the gray sweatpants challenge in the

144
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,480
print the dick print in the yoga pants and whatever.

145
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
What you got to do?

146
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Whatever the fuck.

147
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,480
No, you know what the best is?

148
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,480
It's about the tent nowadays.

149
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
The tent, the best thing, the best pants.

150
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,600
The tent pole.

151
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,920
You got to go to the thrift store.

152
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:10,600
You got to find these like, you got to find some corduroys from like 1990, like a Joseph

153
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,400
A. Bank style corduroys that were meant for a corduroy suit.

154
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,440
Okay.

155
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,080
Those are going to, you're going to get a huge tent from those.

156
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,080
I don't want corduroy.

157
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,720
I want, if I can get a tent.

158
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,840
I can get a tent and literally any pants I wear because of the weird shape of my

159
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,960
body. That's true. It's all happens to me. There's yeah. There's extra room

160
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,680
there. Yeah. I think that the best looking ones for a print would be

161
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,640
something like corduroy, but it goes the other way, because you have that sideways

162
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,200
like a lot of that horizontal. It looks like it's moving back and forth.

188
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,000
through his hand. It's not his nail. I mean it may be well. It was made

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,660

190
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,580
carpenters.

191
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:39,080
Guy who's got like a hammer very

192
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,020
that's how you I mean well, that's how you you you be like it's not my nail.

193
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,460

196
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:00,820

199
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:12,180

200
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,320
Yeah, a lot of that stuff is scary. How the hell does he roll the pussy posse

201
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,920
with a pussy? Pussy posse was a Leonardo. I didn't know he was in the pussy posse.

202
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,120
It was Leo DiCaprio, Toby Maguire, who named it. That's just two guys. Hardly.

203
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,540
There was other guys, too. David Blaine. And there's more to those. I knew where

204
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:32,980
the tree you pull up was a posse. Google pussy posse. You look, can you look them

205
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:37,740
up there? They made some movie that they have tried to scrub from the world

206
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,880
about being a pussy about

207
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,780
be it's a movie where the coolest guys in the club, the guy the ones having the

208
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,140
most fun, but they were also assholes fucking hooligans

209
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:55,980
way. Oh, Don's Plum is the movie. Kevin Connolly Don's Plum is the movie and it

210
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,660
just makes Leo DiCaprio look like the worst person. Look at that pick, bro.

211
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,620
Yeah, there's blame. They're all coming. That's the pussy posse. The pussy posse.

212
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,020
That's what that's what you look like when you're running around getting in

213
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,340
I know people say it all. Every time the Pussy Posse comes up, somebody says it, but it's

214
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,180
so funny that Tobey Maguire was in the Pussy Posse.

215
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
Oh yeah.

216
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
Look at him, dude. He was a hot piece of ass.

217
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,500
He was getting it, man.

218
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Bro, he was Spider-Man.

219
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,780
He was Spider-Man. Everybody wants to fuck you if you're Spider-Man.

220
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,780
Yeah.

221
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,140
No doubt, man. I can take it two girls.

222
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,140
Yeah.

223
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,140
Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy.

224
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,140
Gwen Stacy.

225
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,140
Gwen Stacy.

226
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,380
Hey, Mrs. Stacy. Tell me how you been.

227
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,380
Wow.

228
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,380
Yeah. My song.

229
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,780
That's a song you wrote about Gwen Stacy. If this shit doesn't taste like Wumpa

230
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,740
fruit, I don't even know what the fuck does. Crash Bandicoot 4. I wish I could

231
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,580
take a sip of that right now bro. I already had, no I'm trying to lower my

232
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,660
caffeine intake. One sip man. You wouldn't say something like that if you

233
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,900
weren't gonna drink it. Yeah. I wish I could have a sip of this right now.

234
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,940
I wish I could have one sip. That was a big sip. I wasn't, at a different date. You were

235
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,460
begging to get peer pressure. Oh that's disgusting. You were asking permission.

236
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:05,340
you like one per for that is so bad from crash bandicoot for it's about time that

237
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,300
is so disgusting. Why what style of for the one per it doesn't taste like a

238
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:13,700
mango. It looks like a mango, but it gives you points. Yeah, I don't exchange

239
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,940
them. It tastes exactly. It tastes like they mixed mango and cotton candy.

240
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:22,260
So you don't touch it. Oh, I don't touch Cameron. I had a new apple.

241
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,700
Recently, I'm going to touch it. Don't touch it. I don't like touching that

242
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,660
type of thing. Don't even take a sip. I don't want it. Had a new apple recently.

243
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,080
You had an apple cosmic crisp you're bragging.

244
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,880
Never ever heard of you know I'm allergic to the what it's a called

245
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,080
something Jen specifically cosmic crisp.

246
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,880
I'm allergic to cosmic crisp bro.

247
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,580
That's it.

248
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,080
Yeah, it's a new breed though.

249
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,380
They drop it.

250
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,680
Yeah, and last couple years.

251
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,880
I've been on the golden delicious back on the golden delicious.

252
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,380
Oh delicious is my favorite Apple.

253
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,180
I know it's old as fuck.

254
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,180
That's I haven't had one in a while, but I back on back on that's like 3G man.

255
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,480
Yeah, I know that's not how could I be back on them?

256
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,400
if they were new. What's that? They're old, man. Oh, Fuji apples are still the goat? Shut

257
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,200
up, man. No, what are you talking about? Those are the crispiest ones. Try Honeycrisp. Honeycrisp

258
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,840
is fire. Wait, wait, wait. Cosmic Crisp now is up there with Honeycrisp. I want to try

259
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,760
Cosmic Crisp. I didn't even know it dropped. Cosmic Crisp, I will say, man, the flavor,

260
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:24,440
less good than a Honeycrisp, but the crispness of it, out of this world. I usually go to

261
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,040
a Honeycrisp, yo. And because of this whole planet shit that I've been on, this new kind

262
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,920
a wave. I don't know if you guys have been on the show. I'm eating more cosmic

263
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,040
things, cosmic brownies, I'm eating more things from other planets or at least it

264
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,240
seem like they are like, for example, one per fruit, which I don't think crash

265
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,440
bandicoot is on Earth. I don't know the UN would allow space cake space cake

266
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,320
space cake sounds good as fuck to me. I've been eating a lot of we had we had

267
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,480
a galactic ham galactic ham. We did have a galactic ham because it was as big as

268
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,560
a galaxy Mars and cheese. We had Mars and cheese galactic ham green bean

269
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,920
green bean, asteroid, blast roll,

270
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,540
sprouts again, green bean, asteroid, blast,

271
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:10,460
you know, like an asteroid blast yeah, yeah, no, I got a rocket blast role.

272
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,740
Well, I don't think you need it.

273
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,380
They're worried in it. Green bean, asteroid, rocket, blast, maybe it would

274
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,180
work, maybe like green men, green men, green men, casserole, green men, little

275
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,580
green men, casserole. I'm not eating green man. You already did, bro. You

276
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,780
like that shit yesterday. I guzzled it

277
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:34,140
pumpkin, guzzled it down bro pie pumpkin space lot. I can pies in the number man

278
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:37,100
or pumpkin space lot is good, but we didn't have that for thanks. You know we

279
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,100
didn't well. You could have had it in the morning. Well, I didn't though, but

280
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,140
yeah, morning on the way to okay. I said a cup of coffee. Yeah, I coffee I had a

281
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:51,100
Mars fee. I had a Celsius. That was that already sounds like a planet. Yeah, yeah,

282
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:55,840
the Celsius. Here's how fucked up this Celsius versus Fahrenheit shit is right

283
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,300
today. It's what thirty some degrees. It's like fifty fifty yeah right. You go

284
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,300
up to Canada. It's seven. What the hell that pisses me off. That's kind of nice.

285
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,100
So cold there. It's so cold so much colder. It's seven there. It's seven

286
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,640
here. It's much cold. No, but if you're from Canada, I picked up my friend from

287
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,220
Canada today. If you're from Canada, you touch down and say, oh, it feels like

288
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,120
seven out here. You shut up this and this is seven touch down man. Have you ever

289
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:23,560
talked

290
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:28,500
ever been a conversation? What is going on right now? Touch down all right walk me

291
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,540
through the fit. What do you got? I would just looked at the first picture of

292
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,200
Pluto on Google images and I saw it had elements of white and blue and brown and

293
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,560
this was kind of the closest thing I had to that. It was a reddish brown like a

294
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,640
patina to brown. There was a bunch of different all these planets man. When

295
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,260
you Google them, they have they everyone nobody wants to give it to you straight.

296
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,420
those conflicting answer. They go all the pics are spectrographs and enhanced

297
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:54,420
color and whatever the fuck it's. I don't want to reach colored, but I will

298
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,440
say always they're like okay. This you look at it's like oh wow, it's bright

299
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,140
purple and it's like actually the colors on this picture represent how gaseous

300
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,740
the atmosphere is. Yeah, that's not what colors I hate that when they colorize an

301
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,460
old photo to yeah. I will say Pluto is the definitely the coolest looking

302
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,660
planet, most interesting looking one. I find that to be Neptune. Personally,

303
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,900
Neptune is just completely blue. That's cool. It has different elements of blue.

304
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,340
Yeah, it does have different shades.

305
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,340
And it's got rings.

306
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,340
Pluto looks like multiple...

307
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,340
A golf ball, bro.

308
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,340
No, no.

309
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
It's got like a red corner.

310
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Pluto looks like the Grateful Dead logo.

311
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,340
Pluto looks like a Star Wars video game planet.

312
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Yeah.

313
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
It looks cool, man.

314
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
That's why it's a beast.

315
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
It's got red and blue.

316
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,340
That's why it sucks that they got rid of it as a planet.

317
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,340
What do you have?

318
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,340
What do I got on?

319
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,340
I have on a...

320
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,100
Well, I saw the photo that I saw.

321
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,900
It looked red, white, and blue, so I put on blue mostly because when I was a kid, I was

322
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,100
told that Pluto was blue like Neptune. I thought so too. I thought it was fully blue until this

323
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,500
week. Yep, me too. So I put on, I've got red here. I'll never forget that Thanksgiving

324
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,740
2023, I found out that Pluto was not completely blue. Yeah. Took me most of my life to get

325
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:02,220
there. Yeah. I hope this is just my life. We all looked at a photo of it and went, oh.

326
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,900
Yeah. And then that was it. Yeah. Even though it looked cooler than I thought. It was the

327
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:11,900
whole thing. You know, you got blue, a little red on the hat. Me, you know me man. Abstract.

328
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:21,400
Okay, what do we know about Pluto? I see no keep going man. Well, you small readers

329
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,200
small. Okay, or my smallest shirt. Okay. What does it say on your shirt? So skater

330
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,000
and ice skater. There we go. Wow, another element. I was about to get to that man.

331
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,800
Yeah, I was trying to alley up you man. It was that I see you alley up yourself.

332
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,900
Oh, I got I know you didn't you didn't catch. I didn't catch on. I got to do it

333
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,700
nice on to that is a crazy thick chain. I know for a white guy. What the hell

334
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:49,940
barbed wire, bro? Yeah, my house. We gave it to me supposed to go thin man.

335
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:53,700
Yeah, I don't know why that was like a robot's arm. I think it was a beast.

336
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:59,580
This is a Halloween costume. What the hell? Well, I had to be iced out like

337
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,740
Pluto. He got the Greek. Mm. You're completely Greek. Yeah. So there's a lot

338
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,820
of big changes going on in my life. Now you became Greco came Greco. Holy shit.

339
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,820
Holy shit.

340
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,740
Well, I'm wearing a tiny shirt.

341
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:13,740
I'm wearing a tiny shirt.

342
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,580
All right, give us a planet report, man.

343
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,380
I need to learn about this fucking planet right now if it's the last thing I do.

344
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,380
Wumpa fruit.

345
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,380
What ever this is.

346
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,380
Travis was again on a five week collapsive journey through our solar system.

347
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,380
What the hell?

348
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,380
Be prepared to learn and to laugh at the truth.

349
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:25,380
And now the planet report with Cameron Fetter.

350
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,380
I liked it though.

351
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,380
Yeah, I loved it.

352
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
I was going to just do the fast part.

353
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
Well, just play it twice then.

354
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,380
Travis was again on a five week collapsive journey through our solar system.

355
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,380
Be prepared to learn and to laugh at the truth.

356
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,380
And now the planet report with Cameron Fetter.

357
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,380
You still get all the stuff from it.

358
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,380
Be prepared to learn and to laugh at the truth, and now the planet report with Cameron Fetter.

359
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,780
get all the stuff from yeah, I got a last time. I like the song. You still hear the

360
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,660
song. It's just Michael and I like my core.

361
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,880
So I'm doing a little different today. Okay,

362
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,500
and I know I've been doing these planet reports, but I'm actually doing a

363
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,600
different type of report today. That's still Pluto related. There's better be a

364
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,340
book report. It's not a book report. It is a book report.

365
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,940
There's part of it. That's a book report. Oh shit,

366
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:07,780
Michael E. Brown, a loser report.

367
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:13,180
Michael E. Brown is an American astronomer from Huntsville, Alabama.

368
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:19,100
He is a professor of planetary astronomy at the California Institute of Technology, and

369
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,340
he is the author of the 2010 book, "How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming."

370
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,580
No, it was a book report.

371
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,180
One of the people responsible for the demotion of Pluto to dwarf planet, but being one of

372
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,940
the people isn't enough for this nerd.

373
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,020
He has to claim all the credit.

374
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,580
So let me share some quotes from reviews of his book on Goodreads.

375
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:47,500
I actually care less about the topic now that now than I did going in.

376
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,960
Mike Brown is an engaging scientist from Caltech, but this book is incorrectly titled and misleading.

377
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,140
It includes a great deal about his personal life, especially his obsessive interest in

378
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:02,680
his newborn daughter, Lila, and very little about planetary science and the decision to

379
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,160
the very minor role that Brown played in it.

380
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,680
And here's the last review.

381
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,320
Horrid bad book, boring high hubba bobbin,

382
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,000
hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba,

383
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,040
Bob bluff, hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba, hubba,

384
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,880
bye, hubba, hubba.

385
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,200
Michael E. Brown, you are a clown.

386
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,040
- Wow.

387
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,800
- Your work in the field of astronomy is irrelevant.

388
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,920
Your book is a flop and you were ugly,

389
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,840
not just on the outside, but the inside.

390
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,320
Big whoop, you discovered the dwarf planet Eris.

391
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,520
How about you discover some platform shoes?

392
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,280
You don't need a telescope to find a dwarf.

393
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
You just needed a mirror.

394
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,280
I don't know if he's short or not, but he is, man.

395
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,920
I can tell based on his name.

396
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Anybody who needs that middle initial is short.

397
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,100
That's right.

398
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,300
The plutonians are coming for you, Michael.

399
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:51,040
You picked the wrong galactic army to fuck with.

400
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:55,640
I hope you like being zapped with electricity because they have electric powers.

401
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Wow.

402
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
The plutonians do?

403
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Yeah, their army does.

404
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
That's amazing.

405
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Just the army?

406
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
Yeah.

407
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,180
watch this report out, I'd actually just like to promote my new book. It's

408
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:09,740
called How I liquefied Michael E Brown into a boiling slurry of deconstituted

409
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,620
flesh and nerves with a pulse rifle and why his wife married me afterward.

410
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,140
It will be out very, very, very soon, but you're only part of the team that

411
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,860
destroyed. Yeah, I'm a minor and it's mostly about my family.

412
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:27,700
So he wrote this book about how Pluto was sucked a dick, but he mostly talked

413
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,080
about his daughter. Yeah, is it like oh my god, I guess you haven't read the

414
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,740
it's about I read the like the like blurb for the book is like it's like a

415
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,380
witty account of one scientist and it's that like it's like oh, I was the so the

416
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,820
way that he that they de planetized Pluto is because he and his team

417
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,100
discovered a new planet that was bigger than Pluto, called Eris and they were

418
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:51,420
like okay. So if there's something bigger than Pluto, Pluto can't be a

419
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:55,180
planet. Why not just add errors to the mix of there's a whole bunch of there's

420
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:59,460
a whole bunch of crap, go commercial, taco commercial. Why not both man yeah

421
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,140
yeah, okay, okay, no, they should have, but they didn't and that's why this guy

422
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,480
is a dick head, but I guess, but the book is like and but like even when we

423
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,960
were working hard, like what was more important was like the discovery of

424
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,460
human life and like it just like very like yeah, it found human life on

425
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:19,260
Pluto. They found human life in his family. Oh, and his wife's stomach.

426
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,180
Whoa yeah, I feel like without that the book is probably that big yeah, that's

427
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,140
literally all the found a bigger one. The reviews that are positive are like

428
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,980
yeah, this book is like more than half about his wife, like how much he loves

429
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:34,020
his wife. I hate that shit man terrible to any literally. They also said all

430
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,040
the science stuff is just that it's just just hear him writing like we looked at

431
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,680
the data when we didn't see anything. Then we looked and we thought we saw

432
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,220
something and then there wasn't anything and then we kept looking and we didn't

433
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:47,240
find anything and then we found eris shit pissing me off man terrible bit

434
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,180
like cash in Bill Simmons book, the big book of basketball, barely about

435
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,380
basketball. Mostly is about fucking his oh me and my dad used to go to the

436
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,960
basketball games. Talk about why the ball bounces yeah. Why how does it bounce

437
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,680
what it's got air in it? There's air outside the ball. It's all friction from

438
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,700
the air. There's air. It's probably the same amount. I think it's because the

439
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:13,780
balls made of rubber. Yeah, but what's it? Why is it got air in it to bounce?

440
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,980
Fill the ball, but just fill it with more rubber. If it's so fucking bouncy.

441
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:22,300
Oh yeah, but it'll be too bouncy. Yeah, you put air in it so you can control the

442
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,380
bounce. Okay, less bouncy. You guys should have written the book and not

443
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,500
fucking bill simon. We basically I went to the I went to the Celtics games in

444
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,620
the seventies and oh no all the entire book is him going yeah man. We used to

445
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,180
go to the seven in the seventies. We go to the Celtics and no nobody was racist.

446
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:40,780
He's like oh yeah, everybody says it was racist. No one was racist. Talk about

447
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,580
the ball yeah and the net. Why does it happen? Why did he did about the

448
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,180
orange was pissing me off too because he the even all the reviews are like yeah.

449
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,340
He didn't even do anything. He was like put one member of the team. He writes a

450
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,520
book called How I Killed Pluto. That's like did your parents hate Al Gore when

451
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,160
you were a kid? Yeah. Yours definitely did. Did your parents? I don't think I

452
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,580
remember hearing about Al Gore at all. My parents talked about Al Gore. Why did

453
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,220
their parents talk about Al Gore so much? 'Cause of Inconvenient Truth. Why

454
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,580
the fuck? 'Cause of that, that movie came out and they were like, "Well, now

455
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,600
we gotta, now our cars have to be gay." Yeah, my, my fucking mom was complaining

456
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,700
about Al Gore was the, probably Al Gore's name was said in my house probably once

457
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,860
every day. I got it. From the time I was born to like 2010. My mom complained

458
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,720
about Hillary more even before the 2016 like even before Benghazi and stuff like

459
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,040
my mom was saying that Hillary Clinton is a lesbo bitch. She was a stuff like

460
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:36,560
that whom Abedin saying like she hates her and Bill Clinton. I didn't know why I

461
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:42,160
still don't really know why my mom hates her that much, but I get it. Well, she's

462
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,440
a pedophile. Yeah. No, I know why your mom's a pedophile. Yeah, she doesn't and

463
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:49,280
She doesn't like Democrats. That's the other. It's not really why she doesn't

464
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,880
like her, but yeah, your mom is a pedophile. My mom's a complete

465
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,880
pedophile, which I feel like her and Hillary would have got along then.

466
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Yeah.

467
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:06,400
Yeah, my mom, the thing was that my parents would make fun of Al Gore all

468
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,560
the time. Like South Park. Well, it was maybe South Park. Yeah, but also like

469
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,520
if I would, if my mom was like, "Hey, did you do the dishes?" I'd be like,

470
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,840
she'd be like yeah and Al Gore invented the internet. I guess he claimed that he invented

471
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:23,120
the internet or some shit. I never even learned what she was talking about. Like I'm the Queen

472
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,360
of England. Yeah that was a new update. Well we didn't know about the Queen of England

473
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,480
when I was a kid. We were in North Carolina. Yeah. You know. They don't teach you about

474
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:34,840
that there. Fuck no. I just picked up my Canadian friend. He handed me a piece of money to show

475
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,000
me how weird it was. First of all. The Looney and the Tooney. First of all it's plastic.

476
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
weird. Second of all, the Queen's on it. It's because they were a territory of Canada until

477
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,080
the 80s or the early 90s. I think I think Canada was a territory of the UK. I think

478
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,420
we should put Sacagawea on ours. Yep. Don't they have her on some of the coins? A gold

479
00:26:55,420 --> 00:27:02,400
one. Then they changed all the gold. No, it was a gold coin. The gold was a dollar. Yeah,

480
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,240
the gold dollar was Sacagawea and then they changed it from Sacagawea to all of the presidents,

481
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,500
it just fucked up because then you got to put you put Andrew Jackson in there.

482
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,700
You know what they should do the kings of comedy. I agree. Bernie Mac, Bernie.

483
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,540
That's not a bad idea. It's the entertainer bands in the world. That's a

484
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,200
good idea to put breaking Benjamin on one breaking Benjamin. It should be

485
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,920
breaking the rock. The rock core either. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

486
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:33,040
Finger 11. I mean, not stricken. That's a song. Finger 11. 11 is good. Flip

487
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,000
front side of the coin. A photo of them on like a like a moody, moody photo of

488
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,880
them on a rooftop, you know, like every rock band in the early two thousand

489
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,800
had back of the coin picture of the single. Oh, no, I'm saying one coin

490
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,740
with every rock band in America to make up a coin in my perfect world. All the

491
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,600
presidents, they can do all the rock bands. Yeah, but they all the presidents

492
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,600
get their own coins or my back by doing this, then we should respect the rock

493
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,520
bands by giving them each their own. Can you imagine how excited you would be if

494
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,960
you got a coin with all the rock bands on it? It's not our job to figure out

495
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,980
how to fit the bands on there to be bands. I don't like government to make

496
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,120
the band's coin and they make it and then you get it. And guess what? All the

497
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,000
toilet paper should have wrappers on it.

498
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,280
Oh, wrapper. I thought you meant wrappers like it should be wrapped up.

499
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,120
No, it should have little Wayne and all this bull crap. I understand now you

500
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,600
want to wipe your ass with it. Wipe my ass with little Wayne. Little Wayne.

501
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,720
All the, I should have every single member of the DNC. And all my food should

502
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:27,000
have chocolates on it. And all my food should have whipped cream on the side.

503
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:33,120
And all my food, the sauce on the side should be free. In my perfect world and

504
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,560
our perfect economy instead of dollar bills and money, we'd have album

505
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:43,560
albums, LPs, and we'd trade each other. You'd say, Hey, here's this Bob Seger

506
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,680
album. I go, Okay, I'll trade you for

507
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,760
I'll trade you for the Leonard Skinner album. Yeah, what would the what would

508
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,960
the number one? Well, dude, obviously, the number one would be the Beatles.

509
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,560
You'd be so pissed off, bro, if you're working as a cashier in the store and

510
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,120
someone came in and they were buying a cliff bar and they're one of those guys

511
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,360
that comes in and they dig by cliff bar. They pay with five hundred Justin

512
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:09,220
Bieber. Oh, they've been collecting in a jar in their house, bro, or they say

513
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,160
hey dude, I'm not counting that for you. Take it. I only have the mollusk on

514
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,880
LP. Do you have a change for it?

515
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,520
Yeah, yeah, dude, here's fucking for Justin Bieber albums and usher album.

516
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,540
Yeah, whatever take it to the Bank of Music, take it to the Bank of Music,

517
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,340
roll it up into a

518
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,520
put it in the mute thing. I'm wondering what the convert like what all the

519
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,640
dollars would be djs and they spin the albums when you yeah deposit the how

520
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:33,800
much

521
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,880
it's record movie music country music.

522
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,800
How much would okay, okay, how much would like just a loaf of bread cost what

523
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,040
album would that be a loaf of bread would probably be

524
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:53,680
and how much is a loaf of bread cost three bucks, yeah, something like that,

525
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:57,320
depending on the bread, though, like a baseline loaf like what would a three

526
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,340
three dollar bill be yeah. What would what would three dollars dollar bill

527
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,980
we all by limp biscuit? Oh, that's three a three dollar bill. Anything that's

528
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,300
good.

529
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,440
Anything under five would have to be either a full album from some piece of

530
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,780
crap pop star or maybe just a single with a radio with it with a yeah, I think

531
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,280
three dollar a single. I think that's part that would be so ignition and

532
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:25,400
ignition remix on one thing. Yeah, I guess this would all the five would have

533
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,020
to be like

534
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,420
would be the all music reviews or like the pitchforks course. No, it's yeah.

535
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:35,460
It'd be how good it is. Yeah. I mean reviews. Somebody's got to be a

536
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,700
standard. Nobody's reviewing. You don't review money, man. You do. There's a lot

537
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,220
of people who do review money. I like this money, but it's not enough. Ben

538
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:47,220
Stein, Ben Stein, he doesn't review money. He has money and you can win it.

539
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,260
Oh yeah. You know, he was my mom's professor. Have I told you that before?

540
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,140
No. Yeah, he taught like that. Well, that's what that's how we got. No, this

541
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:01,340
this was after this after Buehler. He was a professor at Pepperdine and he was

542
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,040
then he did he made a movie about intelligent design. I don't even know

543
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,580
who that is inside. He's a guy who says anybody anybody Buehler Buehler. Oh

544
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,060
really yeah, that was my mom's professor. Yeah, he was an actor. He was

545
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:16,780
an actor and then also an economics professor. Yeah, he's like what's his

546
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,380
deal. He's like he's a he thinks that poor people should be grounded. A

547
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,220
Asian Jewish guy, yeah, who's libertarian and

548
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:30,120
thinks that he got kicked out of working in academia because he believes that God

549
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,260
created the world and not some monkey

550
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:38,660
or whatever evolution. So actually he aligns with all of my views. Yeah, he's

551
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,460
cool man. Yeah, he did and he did a movie called No Intelligence Allowed, I

552
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,140
believe is what it was called. Yeah, and it's

553
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,460
and it was about how no professors are allowed to say that God

554
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,420
invented the world. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, speaking of world,

555
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:58,900
what did you guys know? Here's something I learned music world. Pluto

556
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:04,260
was only discovered in 1930. Yeah, it's new as fuck. It's the newest.

557
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,300
It's really new and what came first, the dog or the planet. The dog

558
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:12,580
was named after the planet, but very shortly after. Yeah, it was new.

559
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,140
It was a new discovery and Walt Disney was excited about it and named

560
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:21,980
with the dog after that's like if we named a cartoon character ebay right

561
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,980
well ebay is not very new. He's been around for a minute. It wasn't really

562
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,340
discovered. That'd be like if it was one thousand nine hundred and ninety nine

563
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,180
and we named a cartoon character ebay.

564
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,940
Yeah, you're saying yeah, okay, what year is

565
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,500
two thousand and twenty three. Oh yeah, so then that'd be like if we named a

566
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,820
cartoon character x yeah, okay, I would do that yeah.

567
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,780
that's a good idea. That's a good name for a character. There's a good chunk of

568
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,760
you to find a decent, but I guess what happened with Pluto and this is this is

569
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,100
what maybe where I can see the scientist argument for Pluto, which I don't agree

570
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,060
with okay, but it only was discovered in one thousand and thirty and basically

571
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,720
they discovered it and announced it and then all the public was like, Oh my God,

572
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,820
the ninth planet and all those signs are like, oh no, it's not it's actually it's

573
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:09,380
different and everyone's like no, it's a not planet right. You and I it's and I

574
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,780
put it and then they were like, okay, I guess they were and you can't go back on

575
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,000
that that's what I'm saying. You guys fucked up in one thousand and thirty

576
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:21,340
please don't tell the nerd man. You gave it to us. We got it. You can't say

577
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,540
never mind. I was actually lying. I don't know the science nerds. Of course

578
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,180
they weren't going to like

579
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:31,380
okay, nineteen thirties as science. Well, that's the thing they just

580
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:35,940
glass just discovered football and then the nerds had to strike back exactly and

581
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,540
they said all right. You know what we got another planet. It's called Pluto.

582
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:41,100
It's way out there and you can't actually see it because it's so small.

583
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:45,940
Yeah, we like that planet. Actually, it's a dwarf planet. We like that planet.

584
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,340
Yeah. I miss those old time bullies that talk out of the side of their mouth,

585
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,740
man. They knew this. Yeah. 1930 to 2010, bro. You almost never see...

586
00:33:54,740 --> 00:34:00,140
When was it? 1930 to 2008. That was 2010. 2008? The book came out? 2008, yeah.

587
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,140
I was in middle... I think I was in sixth grade, so probably 2008, 2009.

588
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:08,940
How old am I? Yeah, 2008, 2009, somewhere in there. What happened to people

589
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,940
talking out of the side of their mouth. You almost never see that anymore.

590
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,940
2006. I think it's because there's less lead in stuff.

591
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,940
Everybody's talking out of the side of their mouth because of these vaccines.

592
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,940
They're all getting Bell's palsy. Well, Bell's palsy for sure.

593
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,940
But that's... That too. There was also a lot of more vaccines back then.

594
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,940
Sorry. Sorry. I have Bell's palsy. Or the new vaccines back then.

595
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,940
I just got the COVID vaccine. I just got the COVID vaccine.

596
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
What you getting, Moderna? What happened to that?

597
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,940
People used to do that and then they started talking out of both sides of their mouth.

598
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,940
Oh, they would have cigars. Is that why? Yeah.

599
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,340
yeah to back mouth would would and they were eating sticky jellos and aspects

600
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,740
and it was

601
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:48,420
that makes sense to nowadays. We don't have much sticky food anymore. It's all

602
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:53,140
dry or wet. We don't really have any more nowadays. It's aspects from an only

603
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,140
fans model. Yeah, and only and spicy food is mostly the norm. And even then a lot

604
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,460
of times they put an emoji.

605
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,340
that's become very normal. Yeah, I see food has become normalized. I had some

606
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:10,180
hot sauce earlier that put me in the dirt, man. Yeah. Put me in the dirt. I

607
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:13,580
hate that. When you eat, when you... You took a gamble on a new hot sauce that

608
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,420
they had at the restaurant and it looked, it had a woman on it. You think you

609
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:21,560
know your spice level? Yeah. You think you know your Scoville line? I sit in

610
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,960
there hacking up a fucking

611
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,940
I feel like maybe I kinda wanna do one of the challenges just so I can feel

612
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,700
the upper limit, 'cause I've never liked spicy. I mean, I don't mind spicy

613
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,320
stuff, but I never seeked sorted out before. I think you might find it

614
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,720
orgasmic. I think I might find it horrible and it might completely ruin my

615
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,100
life for a couple of days, but I feel like I need to I need to I need to be

616
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,680
able to understand. We should do a spicy episode. Yeah,

617
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,000
oh my God,

618
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,400
a whole Jesus Christ of spicy episode yeah and we should look at spicy pics.

619
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,120
We should do the death nut challenge. The death nut is there a death nut.

620
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:57,920
Yeah, it's a kill the kid. Where does that grow? It grows. I think it's a

621
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,760
normal nut that they put spice put yeah they death up a nut.

622
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,540
It's so funny that all the spicy challenges you buy is like it looks

623
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,760
like a fucking like like Hot Wheels package where it's like the paper and

624
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,520
like a blister pack and it's like one thing that's like not a spicy food and

625
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,220
then somehow infused with chemicals. Cover it and so much like what it's

626
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,040
called like the one chip challenge or the

627
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:26,460
I know that yeah just it's always just you buy it. It's just a fucking little

628
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:34,800
We were at, I think we were at Gordo's and I got the birria tacos there and they had one

629
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,000
of those little ancho chilies.

630
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:44,520
And I don't know why, like it was like a dried pepper that was in the sauce and I bit the

631
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:49,400
whole thing because I've had those before and I've been fine but that was, I guess the

632
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,560
one that they put in there was the spiciest one ever because I had to go in the bathroom.

633
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:57,060
I went in the bathroom and almost threw up because I was spicy. I almost threw up

634
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,340
last night because the ham was too spicy. This happens with peppers often.

635
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,520
Some jalapenos, like every tenth jalapeno is like ten times. There's a

636
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,240
jalapeno my dad still talks about. He ate it ten years ago. I swear to God.

637
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,320
That's how I feel about this little ancho chili, dude. Every time I go home,

638
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,160
my dad, if my dad sees a jalapeno, he's like, "Remember that one time, that one

639
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,080
summer when I made cheeseburgers and we had jalapenos on the side, and there was

640
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,080
that one that was so spicy that everybody took a bite and everyone had to

641
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,520
go run water under their mouth. He's obsessed with this hell of a thing.

642
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,360
There was one time we were doing the same thing, little ancho chilis at a taco truck.

643
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:38,360
It was like me, you, and Mike. Same shit. I overestimated, I think I ate two or three,

644
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,880
overestimated my spice level and was on the side of the street trying to throw up.

645
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,880
From chili.

646
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,720
From a little dry to chili.

647
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,680
This spicy food ain't right. They went too far with this spicy food.

648
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,680
I have white ass.

649
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,440
become part of life. Keep that shit in Thailand to do with the Thai spice.

650
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,080
Julio, can you handle spicy stuff? No, not really. I do. I like that bow tie

651
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,680
spice. What do you think of Thanksgiving food, by the way? Yeah, first time ever.

652
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,720
I thought it was delicious.

653
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,600
Had a great, great day. I even tried to, I tried to, you know,

654
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:16,080
spruce up the mac and cheese a little bit, put the chipotle in it. That's

655
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,640
unusual, man. The spiciness of the mac and cheese? It wasn't even spicy, but it

656
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,740
something in it. It had a bit of a thing. It had a red flavor. Yeah, yeah. I know

657
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,920
what you mean. I noticed it. I added red stuff. To what? The mac and cheese.

658
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,880
And guess what? Guess what mix I used at the grocery store? Mac and cheese mix.

659
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,440
Quesadilla. Oh. That mac and cheese was fuego. Yeah, dude. We all, we all, everyone popped off.

660
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,920
Bro, we tore. Everyone popped off. We ate and left no crumbs, man.

661
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,620
man. We I had pressed even the tiny amount of cauliflower that I did bring

662
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:57,120
because you said last year I pulled up with a poultry option. You did, but this

663
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,760
year I completely redeemed myself. The biggest thing of Brussels, you pulled up

664
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,180
with enough Brussels sprouts to feed a family and we had family meal. We did.

665
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:09,960
We had the biggest thing of Brussels sprouts of and all I brought the drinks

666
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,540
and he brought the drink and they were given to me by a miracle. Do you guys

667
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,560
know what happened? No, what happened? Well, I got some. I got some of the

668
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:22,640
white claws and I was going to go get a big thirty rack and then when I went

669
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,820
outside and I was opening the windows when we were going to go buy the beer,

670
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,980
I was opening the window gates here at the office and in our trash area, there

671
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:35,040
was a twenty dollar bill on the ground. You're kidding. Yeah, so we got free

672
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,920
beer. God subsidized our drinks. Oh my God, he blessed us from the sky and I

673
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,240
had to do it.

674
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,540
The planets God knew about the five weeks of plans has been changing

675
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,900
shined upon in some way that is not normal, dude.

676
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,460
- No. - We were getting scared.

677
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:54,620
- Neptune, we were like, kind of like, you know,

678
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:57,040
kind of, we felt like maybe, we were saying like,

679
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:00,580
oh, this kind of sucks, whatever, this is kind of crap.

680
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,140
- But Pluto's back and I have proof, man.

681
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,980
- But Pluto brought us back.

682
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,980
- Do you guys wanna see my painting?

683
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,820
- Yeah. - Yes.

684
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,100
- What do we know about Pluto?

685
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,140
- Tiny, smallest planet. - Small.

686
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,100
- Bingo.

687
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,460
- Mercury, Mercury, second smallest planet.

688
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,300
- Look at this painting.

689
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,860
- It's so gorgeous. - Oh my God.

690
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,780
the world. You record an Instagram reel of you painting that night. I wish you

691
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,100
had it go viral. It would go so viral. I'm going to get up and show this. I'm

692
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,340
going to show Cameron's camera how small this is.

693
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:33,740
That is a small planet picture I've ever seen. It looks like a purse, too,

694
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:38,060
because of the handle. I like the handle. Give me the loose thumb tack over

695
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,420
there. I got to hang this shit up. Oh, it's it stuck to me and rip my thumb

696
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,020
off. Is that what the super glue is for? How did you get it in your mouth? I opened it

697
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:59,820
with my fucking mouth because I ain't no bitch. This looks amazing. That is a great painting.

698
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:09,360
Wow. Looks great. Pluto y'all. Reminds you of anything? Planet. So that's my amazing painting

699
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,800
for today. That was amazing. I think that art is going to be a really big that's a

700
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,680
thing. I mean we've talked about it before, but this this five weeks of

701
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,040
planet shit has opened our minds to different avenues once this whole

702
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:23,520
podcast that we know once everything's over once this turns to dust once the

703
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,880
ceiling over there finally collapses. Yeah what's going on with that? I can't

704
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,960
tell if it grew or not it kind of was browning me. It's just brown. It's sagging quite badly.

705
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,760
It is sagging, but there's a family up there or something. Are they made out of water?

706
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,600
there. Maybe it's the water. They might be making water or they have a hot tub. Are

707
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,400
they fish? They could have a hot tub in their apartment. I don't believe that.

708
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:48,640
Could be. I can see that. It's just a it's practically a bath. Maybe they have. It's not so

709
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,520
strange to have. Maybe they're like they're on a permanent honeymoon. Oh lovers. And they have a heart shaped tub.

710
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:59,240
Oh yeah. That has a jacuzzi jacuzzi. Renting the honeymoon apartment.

711
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,680
Honeymoon apartment in Ridgewood, Queens. Yeah. Wow. This would be an amazing place to

712
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,680
That does sound wonderful. A balcony, a hot tub.

713
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,680
Where would you guys go on a honeymoon to?

714
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,680
Bridgewood Queens. Right above this office.

715
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,680
I want to go to China.

716
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,680
I want to go underground.

717
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,680
I would love to go underground.

718
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
Oh, I want to go to Vietnam and see the underground tunnels.

719
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,680
And make love in the honeymoon tunnel.

720
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Oh my god, dude.

721
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,680
With a grenade wire above me and a bunch of razor blades everywhere.

722
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
That sounds so fucking awesome.

723
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
In a spike pit?

724
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Yeah, some of that shit.

725
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,680
What is that thing called? Is it Puka Pit?

726
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,680
No, you're thinking of a necklace.

727
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
But what's the word?

728
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,680
Well, they had a lot. They had the ones where...

729
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Pungi?

730
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,680
Pungi?

731
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:43,680
Pungi?

732
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,680
They were kind of playing Pungi.

733
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
Pungi Pit?

734
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,680
That's what they called it in Tony Hawk's Frozen Skater 2.

735
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
A Spike Pit?

736
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:54,680
They called it a Spike Pit, but in the first game they called it by the name,

737
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,680
and I think it starts with a P.

738
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,680
We'll figure it out later. It's not of any importance.

739
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:05,080
it's okay. Well, that's fine. We'll figure it out. You guys think you'd be any good

740
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,760
at guerrilla warfare or do you think you're the only type of warfare? I'd be

741
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,400
good. Yeah, me too. I feel like I'm much more built for this line shit. I don't

742
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,440
think so walking out line. I still fight like that. Get well, if I get in a fight

743
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,480
with somebody at the bar, I say you get eight friends, I'll get eight friends.

744
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,160
Let's walk at each other play Red Rover. Yeah, we're about to walk at each other,

745
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,000
get eight friends and get a kid and put him he's going to give him a guitar or

746
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,240
something. Yeah, he can play. Let it rock and let's walk at each other with our

747
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:32,820
hands out. He's probably going to play smoke on the water. Play smoke on the water? He's

748
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:35,700
probably only going to play smoke on the water. Yeah, I guess you're right. It's the first

749
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,460
song he learned. I would have been getting it as a little drummer boy, man. It would

750
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,300
be so scary to be in one of those lines because they were using the muskets that would misfire

751
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:48,820
like 60% of the time and they didn't have rifling inside it, so the shots didn't go

752
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,260
straight. They would just go out in random directions. So you'd just be standing with

753
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:58,620
two lines facing each other and you'd just be shooting at each other. I feel like everyone's

754
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:01,320
was missing like eighty percent of the time. I feel like and you're really

755
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,160
learning and we're just standing there and it's a loud banks going off and

756
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:05,860
nobody's die.

757
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,160
The fuck is going to die first Jesus Christ yeah, you might like it's like a

758
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,340
game at the fair or something. It's like you're playing a egg spoon.

759
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:17,400
Imagine

760
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,280
a really bad

761
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,040
yeah,

762
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,940
that to be so scary man. I would imagine trying that shit now with like an air

763
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:33,820
it's like rows of guys with fucking AR 15s. Yeah, just everyone is me dead.

764
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:37,180
Everyone would know it was a fight would last two seconds. I would definitely if I

765
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:39,500
was on the front lines, I bet we'd be marching, you know,

766
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:48,620
you're a high flying flag. Yeah, that's playing dad dad dad dad dad dad dad dad

767
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:53,420
dad. And then I would I would say, Oh, fuck my shoes on tide man. Hold on, give

768
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:58,360
second but then I slowly the entire every line kind of passes me now I'm at the

769
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:03,400
back of the line and now I'm the chef general guess we're making grits nice

770
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,020
okay now I just now was thinking about you know the Looney Tunes short where

771
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:11,740
Bunker Hill Bunny or Bugs Bunny is in the Battle of Bunker Hill and it's him

772
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:14,700
and Yosemite Sam and they're shooting cannons at each other no it sounds fun

773
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:18,260
really I guess I kind of just assumed everyone's seen that because I saw it

774
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,680
probably 500 times did you watch it in school but as a Bunker Hill no I watched

775
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,760
watched it at home because of my love for bugs bunny, but I just did where I

776
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,420
guess this doesn't make any sense. If you guys haven't seen it, but in that

777
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:33,900
it's two forts that are built right next to each other and they're shooting

778
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,640
cannons at each other. You think they ever actually do they just feel like

779
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,560
okay, we're going to build our fort here and you guys build your fort right here.

780
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,920
It's a while to one of the forts blows. We should make you guys chill. While we

781
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,960
build our fort, you build your fort chill everybody chill. We're just going

782
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,820
we're going to go away to forts next to each other so that we can have a we can

783
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:59,480
have the war. If the forts are too far apart from each other, we're going to

784
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,600
we're not going to be able to battle will not work. The battle will not work.

785
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:06,260
The guns aren't good yet. We don't have enough gunpowder to shoot the cannon

786
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:09,900
balls. That for neither of us want to go do the line. We don't want to line

787
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:13,280
anymore. We both want to shoot from inside the fort, so let's just shake on

788
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,580
this. We're not going to fight. What was the country that in World War One? They

789
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,720
thought it was still the line. Was it Poland? No, it wasn't Poland. It was I

790
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:22,400
think it was like

791
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,280
Luxembourg. It was something weird and they pulled up and like all the regalia

792
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,840
and they're like Cray and they were like, let's do this. Let's make the line

793
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,360
I think

794
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:37,120
I think it was Poland. I don't think so. There's nerve gas and trenches yeah. It

795
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,240
was literally like a guy was like, okay, I guess we're going to start the war.

796
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,040
Let's line up from shortest to tallest and then his head just

797
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,640
like that must have been crazy man. That must have been we're pulling up on

798
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,320
horses, yeah, like horses like it was bush gardens pulling up on like giant

799
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,600
ass horses with like they put their horses in clothes and they're like,

800
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:59,880
yeah, let's go to war man. That must do that. I mean that AK forty seven,

801
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,480
yeah, that was suck being the general or whatever that was like yeah, trust me,

802
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,280
they're gonna line up. It's still a line. I know dude that's what that's what it

803
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:12,440
is and that's what you as in Vietnam, bro. We all we put yeah, we're gonna

804
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,740
fuck you up like get ready. You get you come out. We're going to fight you bro

805
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:17,880
and we're going to fucking get we're coming there and we're going to shoot

806
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,480
and we got second. We see you we're going to shoot. Yeah,

807
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,960
we got beat by dental floss, yeah, walking around ringing a bell.

808
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:26,980
Yeah,

809
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,780
where are you getting?

810
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:37,780
The tiger trap to just a fucking just a spike that fell out of a literally

811
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:42,320
walking into Jurassic Park, right? Oh, here we go. It's like it's like a bully

812
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:46,280
school being like going up to the nerd me like hey as soon as school's out like

813
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,740
at two thirty, I'm going to beat your ass and the kid just goes home at two

814
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,240
o'clock

815
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,180
walking around like what the

816
00:47:52,180 --> 00:47:56,840
that shit must have sucked so bad. I think almost every war has been

817
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,680
basically shit yeah, but like

818
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,600
even more because it's like they already had like

819
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:06,760
it's like I can't imagine going to

820
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,580
before after rock and roll has been invented,

821
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:15,560
like all you'd want to do is just go home and listen to rock and roll the

822
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,860
whole time. You finally had something to live for. Yeah, exactly. All these

823
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,240
other there's a music or the world war one and two. What are you gonna go

824
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,440
back?

825
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,600
Fuck that. No,

826
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:28,840
I'm a fucking little trumpet ass. Yeah, but I gotta go sit in a club and

827
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:33,120
dress up and listen to music. Fuck that man, right? Don't even have a cell

828
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,080
phone, got a fucking telegram and shit.

829
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,140
there's somebody back home writing a song about how he just fucked your

830
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,680
girlfriend. Yeah, exactly, and you can't you don't know yet. Yeah, we don't have

831
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:46,780
the computer. You come home and your your your family is now living in a

832
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,660
house of straw. We had three little pigs because they stripped every piece of

833
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:54,380
metal and wood out of your house to to invent a new guitar

834
00:48:54,380 --> 00:49:01,480
to send you a box of spikes. Yeah, dude, imagine they need more spikes.

835
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:08,960
say your mom gets a job building spikes because it's a war. They need spy and

836
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:09,320
that

837
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:13,980
when rock came out, you're sitting there and your white your wife is back home

838
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,880
getting fucked by a ninety pound guy who looks exactly like it most looks like

839
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,260
the most beautiful woman of all time and it's from bloody London right God damn

840
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,560
yeah, no going to Vietnam. Fuck that all these all the you know I would have

841
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,620
England involved in that war. I think that if a war came up in Vietnam, it's

842
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,600
Luckily, we're nowhere close. Us and Iran are going to patch things up pretty fast, I

843
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:40,600
think. As long as I turn 27 before that shit happens, I'm good. But if I was draft, I think

844
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:46,600
that I would straight up say, "Dude, I can't do it. I can't do it, man. I'm not built for

845
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:47,600
this war shit."

846
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:50,320
They didn't let you in if you had flat feet, right?

847
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:53,920
Dude, I'm doing jump training.

848
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,680
I feel like flat feet was the thing that's like the stereotypical draft dodger thing.

849
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,160
You can't let me in if I have flat feet.

850
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:16,400
I have no arch. I have no arch either. You're not special bro. Yeah, I know, but we're both

851
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:20,340
going to have a high arch. I don't know. I have a few of high arches. I'm going to be

852
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:25,900
real. My feet are fucking made for straight up. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. He's got high arches.

853
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,100
because I knew he got high arches. I think you and I were not going to war.

854
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,240
He is going what is going to be the bones you do of the next war. If you

855
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:36,840
it's anxiety, it has to be right, it's going to be as I mean that you have to

856
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:40,640
just be full of the something that we have over the people in the in the past

857
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,480
generation, they're getting drafted and yeah, they're trying to be like, oh, I

858
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,320
have bone spurs. My hips are they hurt when I lie down now. They're going to

859
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:52,060
move. I can't dance now. I said they come to me. They're trying to they're

860
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,760
trying to get me in the army. I say, listen, buddy, you can do if you want to.

861
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,240
in fact, I want you to because the second you put a gun in my hands, I'm going to

862
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,680
slay every member

863
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:06,000
of my company. They're all going to be dead because I'm a psycho zoomer and I

864
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,080
have PTS. I have PTSD from a bad interaction at McDonald's. Yeah, I have

865
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:15,360
PTSD from a interaction where I was kind of weird. One time I thought that the

866
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,720
computer screen was a person at the McDonald's straight up. Yeah. Back then,

867
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:22,960
if they tried to be like, oh, I can't be in the army because I'm crazy, they

868
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,180
they would take your clipboard and they would take a big red marker and they

869
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,480
just write gay on it. Yeah. And you would not be able to get a job for the rest of

870
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,320
your life. No, no. They change your last name. You don't have to go to war, but you also have to live in a hole now.

871
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,920
Yeah. You're going to live in an apartment that has a big arrow pointing to it that says gay guy inside.

872
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,840
Nowadays, they say, if you try to get out of the army by saying you're gay, they say,

873
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:48,120
please, we need you. Yeah, we need you, man. We need you to whip the other men into shape.

874
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:53,620
Yeah, we need you and we need you to, I mean, you're already good at the computer.

875
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:56,620
Get behind the like, the drone thing.

876
00:51:56,620 --> 00:52:00,620
I could probably be content creator for the army or something.

877
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,120
Yeah.

878
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:02,120
Some kind of streamer.

879
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,120
I would love to work social media for the army right now.

880
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,620
I could do that shit, I think.

881
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:08,620
Oh my god, I would love to go to PAX East with the pull-up bar.

882
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,120
I'd be the guy that stands next to the pull-up bar at PAX East.

883
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,620
I could be a recruiter for sure.

884
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:17,120
It's not the pull-up bar at PAX East, but it is VR pull-ups.

885
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:20,360
you guys are you're talking about the being the recruiter who goes to Paxos.

886
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,560
That's that's the one that's your that's your like that's your pizza party.

887
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:26,920
That's your once your your day to day job is you are texting fifteen year old

888
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:27,240
and say

889
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:32,680
you finish your homework. Oh shit, my bad. You still in school. I'll text

890
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,840
back. I thought that's literally all they do. They take they text high

891
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:39,520
schoolers and I was friends with this army recruiter on Facebook when I was in

892
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,720
high school because I would just add like any friend request that came in. I

893
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:47,800
to accept it, bitch and it was funny to do that because you so funny. I have

894
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,240
thousands of friends on Facebook. A lot of people fucking kill for that. Okay,

895
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:55,080
well, there's one guy, the friend cap, this one guy, no, I didn't

896
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:58,560
yeah, I probably have twice as many. I deleted it, I deleted it, but there's

897
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,440
one guy that like my Facebook group has been popping off, y'all. Yeah, my man,

898
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:08,440
but there's this one army recruiter I was friends with that would try to make

899
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:13,220
memes about why you should join. And there's this one that was stuck in my

900
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:17,860
brain forever. It was like, "TB12 is throwing touchdown passes while you're

901
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:22,900
passing your opportunity to join the US Army." Damn, dude. That shit worked in

902
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,780
New Hampshire, too. Bro, that probably worked. That got three kids. He probably

903
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:30,900
got the biggest meathead in the school. That and then the Dodge Charger,

904
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,700
obviously. The Dodge Charger's always gonna get people. These days, all you'd

905
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,060
have to say is, "Do you guys wanna... Do you wanna go shoot a Draco or a

906
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:42,940
yet. Join the army man. And avoid student debt. You want to avoid student loan debt and go

907
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:49,980
shoot a glizzy man? Go straight up to fucking go to Iran right now. You need to, we need

908
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:55,100
you to go over there and instill a phantom tax on Iran. You need to go jump out of where

909
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,860
the battle bus is leaving. You better get your spot man. If I was a recruiter I would

910
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:04,820
just be telling people like you have to sign this right now or you're going to jail. Yeah.

911
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:09,820
it's just been a you're being sued. Yep, I pretend everything to drop the soup. If

912
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:13,140
you if you sign right here, if you know, I don't tell them they're joining me, I

913
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:18,220
just say your name and Tokyo drift style situation. Yeah, what happened? Why did

914
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:22,580
he have to go to Japan and who knows? Have we talked about it before? Yeah, I

915
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:26,260
never seen it. You ever seen Tokyo drift? We've talked about this. He gets in big

916
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,860
Bantha Pudu and then he fucking has to go to Japan.

917
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,900
yeah, he said he gets in Bantha Pudu

918
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:37,300
shit, a Star Wars fan. I know I know that well. I didn't expect him. I know

919
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:40,580
what a Bantha is, but I wouldn't expect him to say who do is poop in the Star

920
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:40,900
Wars.

921
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:48,240
I say that quite quite often. Yeah, I never heard you say that before. Well,

922
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,660
you don't hang out with me when I cussed it.

923
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:55,100
I don't I say I say that kind of stuff. That's true. I say alternative cusses.

924
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:58,940
Yeah, alternative cussing is good again earlier instead of Dick. I said prick

925
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,800
brick. That's funny. Brick is always good instead of a but how much time do

926
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,920
we have left on the holly relax bro? Well, there's a

927
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,980
the hell's that there's a new jay so that's why I thought you're trying to

928
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:13,680
get out of here. I was no, no, no, I have to show this new song. I forgot

929
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,900
about so I want to preface this by saying that I didn't know we were

930
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:23,520
acknowledging Pluto as a planet, so I had to make this one really quick. I

931
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:26,880
need to push back against this because we've we listed the plants are doing so

932
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,420
20 times on the episode. There's audio evidence. Okay, that's not an excuse.

933
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,380
Well, I think what you'll hear in this song

934
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:38,420
is lyrics. Is lyrics. And a beat. And a beat. And maybe a chorus, man. And I

935
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,620
think you're gonna be pretty impressed. Alright, let me hear this shit. What's

936
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:46,060
it called? Remember. Damn. It's actually his deepest song yet.

937
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:49,180
Man,

938
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,940
I don't know what I've been doing, man.

939
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:56,260
I'm so confused.

940
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:01,260
I gotta talk to my best friend Pluto about this.

941
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:02,260
Oh, OJ the alien.

942
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:05,260
I'm spinning in this cosmic confusion.

943
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,260
I'm lost in love, caught in grand illusion.

944
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:11,260
Neptune's allured like a magnetic pull.

945
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,260
My thoughts scattered like stardust in the pool.

946
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,260
I love the pool, man, the pool is cool.

947
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:19,260
Summertime, go there right after school.

948
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:22,260
We'd all go there playing fish out of water.

949
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,260
That was the game that I used to slaughter.

950
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:43,980
fifth

951
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:53,820
the

952
00:56:53,820 --> 00:57:14,460
*Rap music*

953
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:20,220
*Demonic laughter*

954
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:22,460
(laughing)

955
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:31,980
- This is plutonium rapping.

956
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,680
Cookie Monster?

957
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,500
- Yeah.

958
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:43,940
- Okay.

959
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:52,020
Okay,

960
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:56,860
that's a really good one. That was great. The beat was amazing, a little bit of

961
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:00,700
you know some kind of padding, maybe at the end. What do you mean? For the

962
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,100
length

963
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,180
we do do we

964
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:08,980
Tony and his speaking plutonium. It makes sense yeah, but then he had the

965
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,380
adlibs that exponent for the well, the Adler English. Oh, so that was saying

966
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:17,340
what he said yeah, okay, he said lives were done in English. So we do it. It

967
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:23,900
He was talking about how he remembers Bill Nye the Science Guy and Cat Dog and Toonami

968
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:29,240
and how much he misses playing in the pool. See, because every good rapper has a song

969
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:38,240
about the 90s. Every single good rapper has a song about the 90s. Yeah, I'm from the 90s.

970
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:44,020
Boy, I'm from the 90s. Do you guys consider yourselves from the 90s, man? I don't think

971
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:48,020
I don't know because we're told all the time that I feel like I'm from right now.

972
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,020
Yeah, I feel like I just now I'm hitting on the pulse.

973
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,020
Yeah, I got I'm not my finger.

974
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,020
My whole body's my whole I live on the pole.

975
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,020
It's my I'm in the I am the pulse.

976
00:58:59,020 --> 00:59:01,020
We're Gen Z, right?

977
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,020
Did they change the definition again?

978
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,020
Dude, I think I really I think we're cusp.

979
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,020
I think this I think we are literally Gen Z.

980
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:08,020
I'm not going to lie to you.

981
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,020
I think we're elders.

982
00:59:09,020 --> 00:59:10,020
Z lineals, man.

983
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,020
I literally we are.

984
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,020
Yeah, fuck my life.

985
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:16,020
by elders Ellen you doesn't have between one thousand nine hundred and

986
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,620
ninety six and twenty two. I was born ninety seven barely made ninety eight

987
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,860
bro. I was born in two thousand nine. I'm barely made it.

988
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:23,420
I'm right on the cusp.

989
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:27,660
Wow. What's the new generation of these alpha

990
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:32,180
generation alpha? You say what? Yeah. These thirteen year olds are alpha

991
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:37,180
generation. My nephew speaking of gen alphas, his birthday yesterday, I called

992
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:40,900
them on the phone to say happy birthday. The same happy birthday immediately

993
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:45,640
takes the phone from me or from his mom and goes up to his brother and starts

994
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,560
doing, he started doing POV like Call of Duty and was just walking around the

995
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,640
house shooting stuff and there's, I just, I have a video of him just shooting his

996
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:59,560
brother like that and his brother's just standing still trying to do stuff with a

997
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,960
paper turkey they were making. I think he's gone... Do stuff with a paper turkey?

998
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,200
I think he's gone... What the hell kind of perverted shit is your nephew doing?

999
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:08,560
I think my nephew's gone completely insane. You think he finally lost it, Slim

1000
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:13,560
I think that this phone generation is truly fucking up the younger generation

1001
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:15,560
because why the hell is he shooting?

1002
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,560
You didn't walk around with like a...

1003
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:18,560
Yeah, every kid shot.

1004
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,560
He's doing COV...

1005
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,560
What was your favorite gun when you were a kid?

1006
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:22,560
P90?

1007
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,560
No, like a fake gun.

1008
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,560
Oh, fake.

1009
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,560
Oh, a stick?

1010
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,560
Bro, I had this really good...

1011
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,560
Nerf gun, I guess.

1012
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,560
I had this amazing stick, dude.

1013
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:30,560
I used anything.

1014
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:31,560
That had like a handle.

1015
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,560
It was like this crazy, like it had a natural handle in it.

1016
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:35,560
It had a good, yeah.

1017
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,560
And it looked huge like a Halo gun.

1018
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,560
Sick.

1019
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,560
I kept it for a long time in my parents basement.

1020
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,560
You know those long chip clips that you used to like seal?

1021
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:49,560
I would use that as a gun. I killed my dad thousands of times.

1022
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,560
I also had a very realistic General Grievous' blaster that I got for Christmas one year.

1023
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,560
That's cheating.

1024
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,560
That is cheating. That's why I used the stick more.

1025
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:58,560
I don't think I was allowed to have gun toys for quite some time.

1026
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,560
We were allowed to have lightsabers and that was a bad mistake.

1027
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,560
I was allowed to have lightsabers for sure.

1028
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,080
I don't know. Lightsabers is the worst mistake that you can make for your child.

1029
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,000
We had a potato gun, a real one that shot a potato. That's cool.

1030
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,880
Yeah, it was sick. Like the PVC. Yeah, the PVC hairspray. Yeah, hairspray. That shit would launch.

1031
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:18,560
Why were you allowed to have that? Did your brother just make it? Science vibes. Yeah,

1032
01:01:18,560 --> 01:01:21,200
how are you going to stop someone from inventing something? It's not possible.

1033
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,600
What, I can't have a potato? I can't have a potato in a PVC pipe? Yeah, what do you want

1034
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:27,360
for dinner tonight? Potato again. I'm actually really hungry for potato and I want it served

1035
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:34,360
on a PVC pipe in the middle. And also I need a new hairdo. It worked, man. I need a new

1036
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,520
hairdo. It worked every time.

1037
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:41,200
Well, I tried to look up how to make those, and I learned, like early YouTube, there was

1038
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,500
like tutorials on how to make zip guns.

1039
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,100
You can kill somebody with anything.

1040
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:51,080
My friend's older brother made a like magnet gun that shot a nail.

1041
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:52,080
What the hell?

1042
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,080
300 milligrams a can.

1043
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:54,080
300?

1044
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,080
Yeah.

1045
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
That's too much, dude.

1046
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:59,080
That's why I didn't want to take a sip. I know that G Fuel has 300.

1047
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,080
I drank the whole thing.

1048
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,080
I thought it was 200, dude. Well, I'm done.

1049
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,080
Yeah, you're going to have heart problems constantly.

1050
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,080
I got to go to the gym. Bye.

1051
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:08,080
Bye.

1052
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,080
Is there anything we need to talk about?

1053
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,080
I don't think so. I guess it's the...

1054
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,080
Oh my God.

1055
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,080
That's the end of week four, week five, the final week.

1056
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,080
Get ready.

1057
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:18,080
This is coming up next.

1058
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,080
Big shit plan.

1059
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:24,080
Oh, and then if you're in New York, we're on a show with Girl God for the holidays.

1060
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:25,080
Oh yeah, we're going to be...

1061
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,080
- Yeah, what day is it? - An amazing choir.

1062
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:29,660
- You can find it on their social media. - Yeah, December 10th, I believe.

1063
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,000
- December 10th. - I'm still in New York. Come find me.

1064
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,820
- Oh yeah, Jubio's in New York. - Oh yeah.

1065
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,220
- Look for him, man. - Yep.

1066
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:36,740
- All right. - Bye, mate. - Bye.

1067
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:47,000
This is the story of Neptune, a planet report by Cameron Fetter.

1068
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:53,620
Once upon a time, 30 astronomical units away from the sun,

1069
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:58,180
There was a blue and icy planet named Neptune.

1070
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:02,980
One orbit, Neptune woke up and felt depressed.

1071
01:03:02,980 --> 01:03:06,220
"What makes me special?" asked Neptune.

1072
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,740
"I feel so average."

1073
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,820
"Don't worry, Neptune," said the sun.

1074
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:13,500
"You're very special.

1075
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,940
For example, you're an ice giant.

1076
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:18,980
Your distance from me means that you're dark and cold,

1077
01:03:18,980 --> 01:03:22,660
covered by frozen, icy materials."

1078
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:24,980
"Big whoop," replied Neptune.

1079
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:26,780
"That doesn't make me unique.

1080
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:29,460
Uranus is an ice giant as well."

1081
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:31,780
"Well, maybe your surface doesn't matter.

1082
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:34,180
It's what you're like on the inside that counts.

1083
01:03:34,180 --> 01:03:37,180
You have a rocky core," the sun said.

1084
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,020
"Yeah, right.

1085
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:41,660
So does Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Uranus,

1086
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:43,900
and probably Jupiter and Saturn too.

1087
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,020
I knew I wasn't special.

1088
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:48,060
You're just making me feel worse.

1089
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:50,060
I think I'm going to kill myself."

1090
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,900
No.

1091
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:55,220
Neptune opened its desk drawer with its hand, where it kept its revolver and used its hand

1092
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:57,620
to put the gun to its atmosphere.

1093
01:03:57,620 --> 01:03:58,620
"No!"

1094
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:03,060
"I'm done doing this with you!" screamed the sun in anguish.

1095
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:06,780
"It seems like every rotation you threaten to kill yourself.

1096
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:07,940
You think you have it bad?

1097
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:11,140
Look at Pluto, the poor guy isn't even a planet anymore!"

1098
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:14,980
"Even my suffering isn't unique," sighed Neptune.

1099
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,980
"I think I get it now.

1100
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:22,580
I was so concerned with being special, but what's actually special is that I'm so similar

1101
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,820
to everyone else in my solar system.

1102
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:27,900
It's about togetherness and family.

1103
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,700
That's right, said the sun.

1104
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,660
I'm glad you came around.

1105
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:33,660
Coming around the sun.

1106
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,380
Yeah, coming around me, I mean.

1107
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,380
The me.

1108
01:04:36,380 --> 01:04:37,380
The me.

1109
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,380
Let's eat.

1110
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:41,460
And the planets all started in on their Thanksgiving dinner.

1111
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:44,820
Moral.

1112
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,260
The moral of the story.

1113
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:47,260
Okay.

1114
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:53,260
There is nothing interesting about Neptune.

1115
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:55,700
