1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:09,680
- Ready in this bitch?

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,600
- Yeah, we're all ready.

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,000
We're going. - And let's go.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,840
- And let's go.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,640
- We're here live with Jack Frost.

7
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,000
He's been nipping at your nose.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Here comes winter, baby.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,080
Jack, how's your day been?

10
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,840
- Oh, my day has been so good so far.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,520
I've been making people feel the cold.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,720
- And it's gotta be what, 53 degrees outside right now?

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,000
- I'm 53, but when you consider climate change,

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
it's supposed to be 103 today, but because of my doing.

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,520
- You lowered it?

16
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,260
- Has climate change affected your work?

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,600
- It's affected my work positively, yeah.

18
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,440
- Yeah, why?

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,080
- Because as the warm earth becomes more and more

20
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,920
in such a sense, in that regard,

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,260
to be such a way that I've then become into my,

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,100
people need me.

23
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,080
- So you can drop, so in the summer,

24
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,960
are you active in the summer all that much or no?

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,040
- Not really, that's when I like to go to school.

26
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,540
Nice.

27
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,540
People go to school not in the summer, but that's the best time to go to school.

28
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,040
Really?

29
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Because there's no one there.

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,440
Everyone's there during the year.

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,040
The teachers don't pay attention to you, but you go in the summer.

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,340
It's you and three other kids.

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,140
Yeah, the teacher focuses on you.

34
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,040
You know those guys?

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,440
I know those guys.

36
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
Hell, I was one of them.

37
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,940
Curly Moe and Larry.

38
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,140
They belong in summer school.

39
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,440
They should have been in school all day long.

40
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,440
Why go to school for 18 years when you could stretch it out?

41
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,240
Why do they make stupider people go to school more?

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,000
I've said this all the time man, death lingers on every word.

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I've been saying that a lot lately too.

44
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,440
Yes, you have been saying that a lot lately.

45
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,200
But they should, if you get the worst score, you need to go to a better school.

46
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,720
That's like, oh, that's like if you had a really bad injury, we got to send you to the

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
minute clinic.

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
Yeah, it makes no sense.

49
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,280
There's the, there's that.

50
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,400
They put the, the smart kids should be in the most shit fucking schools ever.

51
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,440
They should be so physically tough to learn.

52
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
All the institutions.

53
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,680
They should have like weights and stuff on them.

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,600
They should be in the school for Matilda.

55
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,860
- They should get sent to mistrunch school.

56
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:00,040
- Yeah, they should be locked up.

57
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,920
And I'm not gonna say who are the smartest people

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,460
in our society, because I don't want it to feel like

59
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,500
that type of thing.

60
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,080
- Wait, what are you alluding to?

61
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,160
The smartest?

62
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,000
- I don't know.

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,160
(laughing)

64
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,960
- The smartest people in our society?

65
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,480
- Well, it's just we're painting this image

66
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,880
of people being trapped for thinking a certain way.

67
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,960
- Oh, okay.

68
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,800
- So I don't wanna--

69
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,800
What are you guys talking about? I'm not interested in having any Will Smith slap type of discussion.

70
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
No, no, no. Jack Frost, Jack Frost don't play like that. He don't play that. Jack Frost got PR.

71
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,800
What's it like being a celebrity? One of the biggest celebrities I would say worldwide.

72
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
It's similar to, yeah, what? Your big celebrity world, everybody knows Jack Frost. Everybody, yeah.

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
What's it like? Yeah, what is it like?

74
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:52,800
Dude, it's fucking hectic. Yeah, I can imagine. You can't even go to the store without someone identifying you positively.

75
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,400
I mean, it makes, I mean, you know, you came in here, you're dressed in full gold right

76
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,240
now except for your gloves.

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,240
I came like this.

78
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,600
It's kind of interesting, I feel like Jack Frost, I guess maybe the images of you as

79
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,840
Jack Frost usually are kind of before you came up like that.

80
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,840
You didn't have the money to have an entire gold suit.

81
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,720
If you search Jack Frost 1993, you're not going to see me the same as I am now.

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,240
It's going to be completely different.

83
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,580
I can tell that you've kind of whited up the blue part of your body.

84
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:27,340
Yeah. A lot of that. Yeah. It seeps through a little bit, but not so much.

85
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,940
Yeah. But the gold is a good touch. I think.

86
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,500
You said people are recognizing you at the store too. Are they,

87
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,260
are they getting mad at you? Or are they like, why are you making a positive way?

88
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,100
Why are you making cold?

89
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,740
Well, they identify me positively.

90
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,220
Yeah. Like a suspect.

91
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,500
Like they know who you are.

92
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,220
Oh, okay. It depends on the store really.

93
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,580
And you're probably what?

94
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,620
So some stores people are mad. Some people are different stores.

95
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,860
Like the grill store.

96
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,520
I guess maybe a winter clothing store people might be mad because you're making them spend

97
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,520
money here.

98
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,520
A Burlington Co.

99
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,520
Factory.

100
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
Burlington Co.

101
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,800
Factory, they're saying, "Thank God, let me put this to the ticket for a test ride."

102
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,320
Why can't you take clothes for a test ride?

103
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
I agree.

104
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
You can.

105
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,480
Amazon Essentials, you get a seven-day try-on.

106
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,580
You're kidding me.

107
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,720
In my job, I just can't afford to be wasting money on clothes.

108
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,880
So this means a lot to me that that could be an opportunity.

109
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,080
You should be able to take...

110
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:18,640
you take like the manager of the Burlington Co. Factory with you and he

111
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,000
could walk around with you for a couple days? Well yeah it's just one

112
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,280
employee. When you walk down a fancy street and they have like a

113
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,080
Gucci store, Uniqlo, you should be able to wear those expensive clothes around the

114
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,480
city for a little bit. Right and because that's also...

115
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:44,600
I get what you're saying now. I didn't know you meant like an actual test drive with the manager.

116
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,880
but is like got binoculars. But imagine this scenario, okay?

117
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,240
You're walking down the street in this trendy area, okay? You're wearing full Gucci,

118
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,800
expensive clothes. You look stylish and fashionable. Everyone is looking at you, okay?

119
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,440
And they're going, "Oh my god, that's the most stylish guy on the planet. How can he afford those clothes?

120
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,040
That's incredible." And then they look slightly to the right and they see the manager of the store holding your hand. He's handcuffed to you.

121
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,320
Oh my god, he's test driving them. The way that you just presented that scenario made it feel like

122
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,680
SAT question like a comprehensions test. Yeah, I was like he's trying so hard to remember

123
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
This is also the thirstiest I've ever been around friends military age friends

124
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:35,080
I didn't go that well

125
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:50,420
It's Jack Frost! You're gonna freeze the water. I'm gonna freeze it. Imagine if you had the

126
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,000
Midas tongue and you're gonna make out with somebody. Oh my god. Turn their tongue

127
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,160
gold. That's it. That'd be uncomfortable as fuck. Mm-hmm. Gold teeth though.

128
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,440
Unsuckable. Gold teeth? You'd have gold teeth all the time. Yeah. It would

129
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,440
make biting into like walls and stuff a lot easier.

130
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Oh my god, thank you.

131
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
Sure.

132
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,440
Have you had solid gold teeth?

133
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,960
Wait, show everybody our water bottle.

134
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,600
I'll bring it in for you.

135
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,000
Yeah, put it up on that table.

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Fucking.

137
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
There you go, man.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,320
So, wait, let me check the frame on it.

139
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Yeah, sure.

140
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,640
Do you really think I'm going to go buy a water cooler?

141
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
They're $85.

142
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:33,280
You have to stay, you're going to freeze this.

143
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,480
- Yeah, you need to stay away from that right now.

144
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
- Put it over here.

145
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,680
- The benefit of ice is it melts again,

146
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,720
so as soon as I leave--

147
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,920
- Oh, you're fuckin' ass walking around.

148
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,480
- Ah, shit, I never really--

149
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,320
- There's a lot of benefits to ice.

150
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,160
- Listen, here's a question.

151
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,000
- You know, I--

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,820
- Hey, hey, hey.

153
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,680
(laughing)

154
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,520
Say that again.

155
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,560
- What'd you say?

156
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,700
- There is a lot of benefits to ice.

157
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,540
- Yep.

158
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,360
- That's rare.

159
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,720
- Yeah, that is rare.

160
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,560
Listen, if you could have a, what's your dream train?

161
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,640
- One that goes, what are the destinations?

162
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
every celebrity that could run a train on you

163
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,440
and like five to ten people.

164
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,760
- I thought you meant my dream, like an Amtrak train.

165
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,040
- Well that's Polar Express.

166
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,840
- That's gotta be the Polar Express.

167
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,560
- I guess that's the obvious answer.

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,400
- But if you, I'm saying like,

169
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
what are your five to ten guys that are like Jack Frost.

170
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,320
- To run a train on me?

171
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,800
- Put me in a room with these five

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,820
and we're gonna make magic.

173
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,440
We're gonna make a Kim K sex tape, we're going to the moon.

174
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,280
- And I only get five people?

175
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,120
- That was only one guy.

176
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,160
- You can get five to ten.

177
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,000
- There's only one guy in the Kim K sex tape.

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,680
- He had, Rezia has clones, but we can talk about that later.

179
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,080
- Vin Diesel, step one.

180
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,920
- Yeah.

181
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,740
- Step one.

182
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,200
- Step two.

183
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,040
- Oh yeah, in order too.

184
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,360
- Dead or alive?

185
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,200
- Dead. - Yeah.

186
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,720
- The Rock. - Only dead.

187
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,720
The Rock.

188
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,440
- Kill the Rock, get him in there.

189
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,280
- Okay.

190
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,240
- Sex tape.

191
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,680
So I want a lot of different body types.

192
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,280
- You want sizes difference, yeah.

193
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,360
- I guess a mummy.

194
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,200
- You kinda, I guess they could gauge,

195
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,600
they could kinda gauge you,

196
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,520
you know like people get their ears stretched,

197
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,240
kind of would want to do it in reverse order of size. Oh yeah. You could get a

198
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,320
gauge, you're saying like I put an earring gauge on someone's whole body?

199
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,640
So it starts small and then you get big. I don't mean to be crass but your asshole

200
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:12,080
would like be one size at the beginning and then a different size

201
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,760
at the end. You're kind of working your way up. Different shapes could be good too.

202
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,040
Yeah that's healthy. In the end it would be... What's the most interesting

203
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:23,960
asshole shape I wonder? Probably square. Yeah that might be square or star. Maybe a

204
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:30,560
letter if a letter a letter a or B put it fit hey if it was big enough you could

205
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,280

And he's on shit. My dad says holy fucking God is that show a show?

217
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,780
Yeah, you never heard of the curse word in it. It was the world's change

218
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:40,520
There used to be a Twitter account that was shit. My dad said or maybe it was an Instagram. I don't remember

219
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
It was an Instagram.

220
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,120
But it was no, it was a Twitter.

221
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,560
It doesn't really matter.

222
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,260
But the guy would post his dad would

223
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,240
be saying stuff would be like, how

224
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,260

225
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
iPhone, you shit ass son?

226
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,180
And his son would say, instead of

227
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,060
helping my father, I'm going to post

228
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,260
this word for word transcript online

229
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,540
and have strangers laugh at it.

230
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,640
You know what's wrong with today's

231
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,380
society? An account called shit my

232
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,900
dad says it should all it should be

233
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,040
on there is I'm proud of you.

234
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,820
Yeah, that's right.

235
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,760
And then one late, late, late

236
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,060
into life, maybe a little bit of

237
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:13,300
confusion like some stuff like some kind of off weird questions and then just

238
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:16,660
kind of saying help kind of really yeah and then maybe like right right but as

239
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,580
the dad is dying maybe one that says like I see a gargoyle yeah or something

240
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,860
like that what or like something like it's watching me or grow my grandpa's

241
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,540
like my great-grandpa's last words I'm in prison I'm in a prison that's what

242
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,540
Was he in jail? No, he was in a hospital. So he was wrong. He's an idiot.

243
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,540
That's embarrassing. So embarrassing that he fucked himself.

244
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Great guy by the name of Arnold. I got his shirt. Arnold. Back at the house.

245
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,540
You got his shirt? You got his shirt? Back in the day you could only wear one shirt your whole life.

246
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:50,540
He left me a grey polo that has his name in the back. It says Arnold.

247
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:54,540
I put it on every day. I'm like, "Ah man, I'm in prison."

248
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,540
It's awesome. We have something exciting that we're going to be doing through December.

249
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,820
through December. Oh yeah, it's December. You know what time that is. If you're Christian, pay attention.

250
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,540
Everybody else, take a break. Check this out. Don't, don't, okay, we'll put this, let me explain what

251
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,540
this is first, please. Circle. For God's sake! It's a circle. We're doing a circle every day. Yeah,

252
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:22,420
Will Sasso is a circle. That ain't Will Sasso. Someone, someone changed. We actually just got a

253
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:28,020
hold of some technology that allows us to track Santa Claus. Yeah. We put a GPS on Santa Claus's

254
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:34,900
outfit and we're not going to say our source of who got close enough to Santa Claus to do this or who

255
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:39,540
yeah you've had some run-ins with Santa I'm guessing. Yeah I've seen him at the tracks.

256
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:46,340
Yeah like the dog tracks? Gambling. Gambling on horses. He's got to make that money somehow. He's

257
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,700
got all those gifts to give out. That's a good point. I didn't even think about that. I always

258
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,820
thought just God kind of handed a check. God is Santa. God is Santa? That's something that is

259
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,960
sitting right in front of everybody that no one talks about. Santa is God. You think

260
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,060
Santa's just doing that? When I was in elementary school my friend told me,

261
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,820
"Did you know actually there's no such thing as Santa and Jesus brings the

262
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:11,300
presents?" Really? And then I told my mom, my friend told that, and my mom was like,

263
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,940
"Nobody thinks that. That's not even a thing that anybody says." Your friend

264
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,900
made that up. We had a... no that's... that's all I'm saying. That's what my mom said.

265
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,580
kind of people you got that going on. That Jesus brings the presents? Yeah and we just were like no.

266
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,100
No. Because if Jesus brings the presents that means Jesus is also sneaking into

267
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,900
your house taking your teeth at night. My mom told me that. What? No, that's the tooth fairy.

268
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:36,620
My mom told me that Santa brings three presents and then she brings the rest.

269
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,180
She brings the rest? She brings the rest of the presents. Did she make Santa bring the good

270
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:46,380
presents or the bad presents? See I never know. I never knew. You never knew? I

271
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,380
I never knew which ones were from Santa or which ones were from mom.

272
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,380
No, she just threw them all in a pile.

273
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,380
Oh man, we used to get the from Santa on the tag.

274
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
I think you just didn't read the labels.

275
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
No, they weren't wrapped.

276
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
They weren't wrapped?

277
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,380
My mom wouldn't wrap any of the presents.

278
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,380
Wow, sad.

279
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,380
That feels like it's not a present in that case, it's just an item.

280
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,380
Yeah.

281
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,380
It's kind of trash.

282
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,380
It's clutter.

283
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,380
It's an item.

284
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:17,380
- My parents are both Jewish and they tried to hide it

285
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,100
from me my whole life, so we did Christmas and all that.

286
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,740
- Jack Frost has Jewish parents.

287
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,720
- Yeah, and I'm not.

288
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,560
- Oh my God.

289
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,500
- I don't fuck with that.

290
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,700
- No, I can tell.

291
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,740
- Be careful now.

292
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,940
- I know, well, be careful about them.

293
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,080
Be careful of them.

294
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,920
- Whoa.

295
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,980
(laughing)

296
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,820
- Come on, man.

297
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,900
- No, that's not what we're saying, Jack Frost.

298
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,740
- Nuh-uh.

299
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,580
- No, no, no.

300
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,400
- What?

301
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,240
- No, we're kinda saying the opposite.

302
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,080
- You're putting words in our mouth.

303
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,060
- We love Jews.

304
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,780
- Jewish people.

305
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,600
- You love Jews.

306
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,440
we love Jewish people. To be... No, to be my friends, my neighbors. To be. To be. To be

307
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,000
around. We love Jewish people to be. Well, I just wish my parents had been honest about it. Yeah, that is

308
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,200
kind of... they hid it from you? They hid it from what age? Wait, they hid Christmas or

309
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,280
Judaism? They hid that they were Jewish from me. Okay. Because they knew how

310
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,360
disappointed I would be. That's a... that is a Jewish last name that I

311
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:15,520
think about it. Frost? Yeah. It's my cross to bear. Yeah. Well not your cross. Well yeah.

312
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:23,600
You're star of David to bear. I'm not Jewish. Your parents are. My parents are Jewish. I'm snow.

313
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:32,880
Okay. That makes sense. Two snowflakes met up at the 930 club in DC and 11 months later I

314
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,760
popped out. No we played DC9. I thought we played there. A lot of nines in DC.

315
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:05,800
so much like Michael Jackson when you cover your face. That's something you can't do

316
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,040
unless you're made out of snow, man.

317
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:18,360
Okay, we have a bit, we basically we have a, we have a, let's, we're gonna track, we're

318
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,560
gonna check where Santa is every day, every episode this month, so let's go ahead

319
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,060
Let's see where Santa is today.

320
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,360
People who are curious are all going to say that.

321
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Oh my god.

322
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Should we talk over this?

323
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Yeah, you can.

324
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Yeah, we're good.

325
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
There he is.

326
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
It looks like he's Mexico.

327
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Where's that?

328
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Oh!

329
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,400
He's at the Bellagio in Las Vegas, in LA's Vegas.

330
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,400
That's pretty cool.

331
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,800
I mean, I guess he's getting his gambling on.

332
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,880
What is Santa, can we see anything?

333
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
What is Santa doing?

334
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
Yeah, what's...

335
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Oh!

336
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
Oh, that's good.

337
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,880
He's getting the coat.

338
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
He didn't have it?

339
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
It's kind of late.

340
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
It is kind of late.

341
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,880
Maybe it's up boosted.

342
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,760
It's kind of late in the game to be getting that.

343
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,840
So Jack Frost, I mean this mask stuff is getting ridiculous if you ask me, right?

344
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,520
I know, I can't hardly breathe because the mask I wear is so thick.

345
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,040
Yeah, what are you doing like inch, I mean you're a celebrity so you're probably doing

346
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,040
bulletproof kind of.

347
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Yeah, Kevlar mask on your face.

348
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,440
Because if someone inside, I can't, the money maker, I can't have somebody shoot me in the

349
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,440
teeth.

350
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,360
Yeah, even though it would probably like, the hole would be there and then it would probably

351
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,960
fill back in with snow and then.

352
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,800
The mouth's already a hole for most.

353
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,600
Well, you know what I realized recently?

354
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,160
David Blaine said that?

355
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:24,660
Yeah.

356
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,000
That's a quote from David Blaine.

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,920
The mouth is a hole.

358
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,560
Yeah, he said that.

359
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,960
I was actually doing some philosophical thinking

360
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,360
recently.

361
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,800
I realized probably the reason COVID wasn't around back

362
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,000
in the day, way back when, is because of medieval knight

363
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,160
helmets.

364
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,560
That's the thickest mask of all.

365
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,960
And that's probably why it waited till now to show up.

366
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,920
That's a really new-- nobody's wearing helmets.

367
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,160
It probably popped out like the groundhog said, no thanks.

368
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,800
- And now it's like, now's my time.

369
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,460
- 'Cause you're seeing people who are in polycules

370
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,240
all kissing each other, coughing in each other's mouth.

371
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,140
- Exactly, and everybody wants to show their face.

372
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,640
It probably saw everyone posting their face on Instagram.

373
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,480
- He said, "I can attack that."

374
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,280
- Oh my God, that's so true.

375
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,560
- I'm gonna get up in that face.

376
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,520
- Yeah, I'd like to message you a disease.

377
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,360
- Yeah.

378
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,180
- COVID.

379
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,980
- COVID, 19 likes, that's what he was seeing

380
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:11,820
on the Instagram images.

381
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:14,120
- We got problems with these polyamorous molecules, man.

382
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,200
- I agree.

383
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,340
- Get out of here.

384
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,040
- Get out of here, get into a regular molecule.

385
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:22,640
You know, I feel like all those people who are polyamorous and have like 15 wives and

386
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,920
shit, they all live in like the Midwest.

387
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,520
It's all like Chicago down to like...

388
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
Well, it makes sense.

389
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,440
There's a lot more room out there.

390
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,440
That's true.

391
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Detroit, that's a good place to have a polycule.

392
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Get a whole fucking...

393
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Oh, what, my studio?

394
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,040
Yeah, 12 bedroom apartment for $10 a month.

395
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
That's perfect for a polycule.

396
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Siberia's got the big polycules.

397
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Yeah, that's what the Midwest is like.

398
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,040
Yeah?

399
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Yeah.

400
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
With the wolves.

401
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,620
Earth is essentially one polyamorous molecule.

402
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,580
- Is that true?

403
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,720
- If you think about it, it's the shape of a molecule.

404
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,060
Everybody here is procreating.

405
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,900
- That's true.

406
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,580
- We all do that.

407
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,760
- Yeah, do you have a--

408
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,920
- Jack Frost does that.

409
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,920
- Huh?

410
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,600
I don't do that 'cause I'm usually in orbit.

411
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,360
- Oh, you didn't, wait, you're in orbit?

412
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,200
You have to go up to shoot the cold in?

413
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,640
- That's why people like me like to chill.

414
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,460
- Outside.

415
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,640
- You notice that Santa, well,

416
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,080
Santa's on the floor right now.

417
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
There's Jesus in a Santa hat.

418
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,440
- Yeah, get that out of here.

419
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,280
Close that.

420
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,640
- Yeah, that's interesting.

421
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:19,320
And that looks like one of those things that you put up in the uterus.

422
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,720
Oh, an IUD?

423
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,240
Yeah.

424
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:28,400
Is that a conspiracy that the Mandalay Bay Casino is shaped like an IUD?

425
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,360
Could be now.

426
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,000
It's shaped like an IED.

427
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,600
Maybe it was supposed to blow up that night.

428
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,880
IED's nuts.

429
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,960
IED's nuts.

430
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,760
You said I eat D's nuts.

431
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,680
You eat D's?

432
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,560
That's what you said.

433
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,720
You tried to get us and you said I eat D's nuts.

434
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:50,240
Jack don't mess with Jack Frost. I'll fuck around and get and I'll uh...

435
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,920
Leave the gloves on.

436
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,160
Deez my own nuts.

437
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,160
Deez your own? Don't eat your own nuts.

438
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,440
I'm not... Jack Frost will deez, eat my own nuts.

439
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,480
Deez eat them.

440
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:04,280
Damn he's so crazy he'll eat his own fucking whole ass nuts.

441
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,520
You like CDs or cassettes?

442
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
Uh I like deez, CDs.

443
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
I like deez.

444
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,840
Well okay, alright.

445
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,920
Yeah.

446
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,680
Man, the air in here is just so fresh.

447
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,840
Yeah, it is.

448
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,720
It's our fun part.

449
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,880
What's your Spotify wrapped looking like?

450
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,520
Yeah.

451
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,000
2022.

452
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,120
Can we know yet?

453
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,080
No, that comes out.

454
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,080
But that's what you do. The fun part now is saying, "Oh, is my wrapped going to be..."

455
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,840
Oh, what's it? Yeah, what's going to be on there?

456
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,080
Yeah.

457
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,720
What's your guesstimate?

458
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,760
Is it going to be mainly classical or rock and roll headbangers?

459
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,360
Yeah, basically the two options.

460
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm going to have a lot of that.

461
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
What's that?

462
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,400
Solamente una vez.

463
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,400
What's that?

464
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,400
Amen a la vida.

465
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Is that the Lady and the Tramp song?

466
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
You don't know Solamente Una Vez?

467
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,400
No.

468
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
What the fuck?

469
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
What the hell is that?

470
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Everyone's got a different colored mics.

471
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,400
Who's it by?

472
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,400
A lot of different people.

473
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,400
Oh, it's one of these.

474
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,400
It's various artists.

475
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Yeah, it's kind of like Jingle Bells.

476
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
A lot of people like it.

477
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Everybody's got a Jingle Bell.

478
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
It's a Christmas song?

479
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Yeah.

480
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I don't know.

481
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I don't know.

482
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I don't know.

483
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I don't know.

484
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,400
I don't know.

485
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,400
I don't know.

486
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
I don't know.

487
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,400
I don't know.

488
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,400
I don't know.

489
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,080
got a jiggle bell. It's a Christmas song? Nah, just love. I know the prayer. You know a prayer?

490
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,620
I know Celine Dion and the Italian guy with no eyes. That's good. Who's that? No eyes?

491
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,240
Or some shit. What's the point of being in Italy if you can't see? I almost said he's

492
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,800
deaf but there's no way he's deaf. The food. The food. Oh, the food. That's a good point.

493
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,720
Oh my god. The food in Italy is so remarkable. I would love to experience it someday for

494
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,000
myself. I mostly experience the food in Italy from Google Images. Yeah. HBO Max.

495
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,960
Did they ever do a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles where they let them loose in Italy? I don't

496
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,640
think so. I don't think they could, it would allow them. Probably. They should let

497
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:50,680
them loose out there. Who knows where they'd go. They should make, I think almost every

498
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,480
character, they should make a movie about that character called that character's

499
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,240
name Unleashed. I agree. Sonic Unleashed. Yeah. Clifford Unleashed. That was a game. Clifford

500
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,940
unleashed would be fire, dude. An adult Clifford movie. Kind of a dark twist on

501
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,240
Clifford. Yeah, and you know why he's red. Yeah, he's mad. He's mad. He's angry.

502
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,140
His circulations, his heart rate is so high. He has a big vein on his head, too.

503
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,240
Yeah, it's popping out. He's got steam on his ears constantly. And he goes like

504
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:20,340
this... And he eats people. And he can only walk on certain ground 'cause his

505
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:24,440
paws are so hot it'll melt. Yes. He can only walk on metal. Yeah. My feet are

506
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:30,240
And if you walk on the metal after him it burns your feet if you step where he step and then everybody judges you

507
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:38,840
Life they did that one. That's the worst part of that. Yes, so she's a distraction. There's destruction, but then there's also judgment

508
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,440
Imagine if you're playing follow the leader with a guy like that his feet were so hot if you followed his steps you'd burn

509
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,500
You will I would just lose it's not that big of a deal to lose follow the leader

510
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:53,600
Maybe unless that's right. That's your value system being exposed right now. I just that's a moral judgment

511
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,480
Maybe I'm just not that competitive.

512
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,920
- Imagine playing follow the leader

513
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,980
where the person in front has a gun.

514
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,720
- Well, but are they aiming backwards?

515
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,120
- Yeah, they-- - I would.

516
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:05,080
- You would aim backwards or you would follow?

517
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,920
- What?

518
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,520
No, that's the whole point is that

519
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,920
you're trying to shake everyone off, right?

520
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,400
- Yeah. - Oh, got it.

521
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,960
- So they have a gun.

522
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:13,780
- Oh, true. - Good one.

523
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,060
- Or you could have a gun and maybe you shoot,

524
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,620
you do something illegal with the gun

525
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:19,240
and everyone else has to do it.

526
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,640
- Is that part of follow the leader?

527
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,760
You have to do also Simon Says?

528
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,520
Should we practice? Should we try? I think it can be part of it.

529
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,760
We could try that in here.

530
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,000
All right.

531
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,880
Jack Frost jokes LLC.

532
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,400

533
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,600

Jack Frost jokes...

Still Jack Frost jokes.

543
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,240
Where are you getting your money from, though?

544
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,480
somebody paying like what's your business model? I mean you make the world cold.

545
00:22:55,480 --> 00:23:00,280
Well you're probably getting a paycheck from God. If it's climate change you're probably getting paid by maybe Soros or something.

546
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:07,060
True. Al Gore. I don't look man. I just open my bank account and I see green numbers

547
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,120
this week. I say thank you very much. I have no questions about who and what

548
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,840
type of people are outside my house. So you're saying that, who are you saying that to?

549
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,080
If you open your bank, are you talking into your phone when you open the bank

550
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:25,120
app. Thank you very much. It's a saying.

551
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,840
Also nowadays you can talk to you they have these voices.

552
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,200
There's a bank app that lets you talk to Drew Barrymore.

553
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,440
Chase Blue! Chase Blue!

554
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,200
Chase Blue Drew Barrymore. Are they of Blue Barrymore?

555
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,000
It might not come up yet because this is a business venture I'm not supposed to

556
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,400
talking about? You know what I would say? What's in the app store? You gotta go to the app

557
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,680
store. Why would it be in there? See I told you, look how many results there are. Drew

558
00:23:54,680 --> 00:24:01,680
Barrymore Playboy Bunny. There's over a million point two nine results. That's just a blue

559
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:09,640
Drew Barrymore. That could be her in the Chase app and she's saying here's your fifty first

560
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:16,640
dollars. Right, welcome back. Maybe it's that she knows it. Is she an expert on banking?

561
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,320
banking it is so strong is superhuman I just made the wall call for you but it's

562
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,680
shivered is eternal where oh my god turtle of strength eternal straddles are

563
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:33,920
Jewish you're in a turn what they're like already Amica oh that's a video

564
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:40,840
earlier of a guy cooking a turtle cap no I can show you I said I think it's hell

565
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,480
cringe I'll show you right now I don't want to see that he does all right we

566
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
You don't have to look at the...

567
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
No, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

568
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
All right.

569
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
What were we talking about?

570
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
What about...

571
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
Oh, we were talking about Drew Barrymore.

572
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Oh, yeah.

573
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
What you said...

574
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,320
But so my question was, is, was she like, I mean, I feel like...

575
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,320
This is...

576
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,960
Oh, this guy.

577
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,200
This is a clip.

578
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,480
This is...

579
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,480
Jack Frost watches cooking.

580
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Okay.

581
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,560
okay actually starting to sound okay all right looks like soup can you dip soup

582
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,840
into another liquid can you turn soup into another yeah you can dip some I was

583
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,760
thinking about last night cuz you could dip a chicken finger in the ketchup but

584
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,520
you can't really dip a liquid into a liquid you take a you take I guess that

585
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,880
the soup is can a frozen motherfucker yeah that's true you freeze one dip that

586
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,680
you can make soup you're gonna do it like this I didn't even realize my

587
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,320
privilege. Yep, yep. Cold. That's why you're here. Yeah. What were you gonna say about

588
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:50,040
Julie Barrymore? Oh yeah. Well, because I think she doesn't know that much about

589
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,840
banking. I mean she probably knows enough about banking. But I don't think she's making

590
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,400
assumptions about her financial literacy. But what I'm asking I guess is when you

591
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,500
talk to her is it more just like she's like hi I'm Drew Barrymore do you have

592
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,160
any questions about my movies or is it specifically only about banking that

593
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,780
you're talking to her about? That's a good question. Like is it, I mean maybe she

594
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,900
Whether she's an expert or not, you know, is it like, oh, like, I'm, can I have an autograph?

595
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:12,900
Is it that type of conversation?

596
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
She's a human, man.

597
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,100
Is she, is live chat on the app?

598
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,140
She's really talking?

599
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,140
She's really talking.

600
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,300
How'd you search, did you Google, did you find this out, you Google search, I want to

601
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,300
chase Drew Barrymore?

602
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:28,020
I just met someone sitting on the floor at a mall and they were looking at this Aston

603
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,200
Martin magazine and I had to start chatting up.

604
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
And then they told you about this?

605
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,500
They put me on to the Drew Barrymore Chase app.

606
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,540
they're looking at an asset Martin magazine they're probably open up their

607
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:40,460
bank account millions of dollars yeah that's the point right so you got to pay

608
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,380
attention to people like that in society look at how they move and follow suit

609
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:47,740
magazine people the leader that would be it that should be a if you have like a

610
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,140
like a black like American Express black card type thing where you have like a

611
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:54,900
ton of money you should be able to get kind of whoever celebrity you want on

612
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:01,460
your GPS voice yeah they used to have that with ways right yeah Owen Wilson as

613
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,180
as Lightning McQueen, Morgan Freeman.

614
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,380
- I honestly do, an actual question I have is,

615
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,120
when they get a celebrity to do something like that,

616
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,420
or anybody for that matter,

617
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,620
how do they get them to say every word--

618
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,580
- They don't say every word. - In existence?

619
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,420
- They say every word.

620
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,360
They read the dictionary. - They say, "Turn right,"

621
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,300
and then it goes to the back to the robot voice.

622
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,480
It's kind of a let down. - You know what?

623
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,260
There are way less words than you think there are.

624
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,700
We've collectively, over this whole hour or so

625
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,340
it's been so far, have probably said about--

626
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,460
- 25 minutes. - 80 words.

627
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,380
- That's true. - Well, that is true.

628
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,780
And yet this is ouritarianism and that's another one ism. That's another that's a new word that wasn't said before

629
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:43,460
What you're gonna do you can I keep going you those kind of sound like you're going in there kind of five fingers of death

630
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
Yeah, you're gonna freestyle song

631
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:50,460
Talking is freestyling. That's true. That is true. Did you ever do sway in the morning as Jack? Yeah, I've been on

632
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,480
I've been on this way play. Yeah, you can search me. Yeah

633
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,380
Yeah, you ever you sound he ever should give you one of those huge beanies. He wears with the brim

634
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,800
No, he did not try to take it every time I see him, but he doesn't like me when I touch him

635
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,020
Maybe with a life has see three hats right now. They're looking pretty good. You want to snag these I do want to snag

636
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,620
I don't want this shit getting crunchy like one of those

637
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:15,420
Jack Nicholson in the frost yes, sir

638
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,080
Nicholson in the frost yeah, he doing Jack Nicholson

639
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,480
I think that his brain is being obliterated by like chicken nuggets at the Lakers games or yeah

640
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,440
He turned into a marshmallow man, yeah

641
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:32,200
He does yeah, he should he should try and monetize this somehow

642
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,840
It's a shame to see just something bad happen without me. We like do like a master class

643
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,240
Yeah, exactly you should just

644
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,420
How to eat chicken nuggets so long they died

645
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:50,400
He's always eating in the Lakers the front seat of the Laker car, and he's doing his thing. What's the Laker car?

646
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,400
Just the front seat

647
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:59,760
The front seat of what? Front row of the whole stadium. You have no judgment upon where a

648
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,040
chair is and what limits it to. No, no, no. You could be in the back seat right now. I'm

649
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,080
in the passenger side of this table. You are kind of in the, yeah. I want to get a side

650
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,760
car. What would be the front, who would be the driver of this table? Of earth. Of this

651
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,600
table? The driver of earth? That's a heavy question. Santa Claus. He's at the top. Yeah,

652
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,200
I guess that's true. Who is it? Santa Claus? I guess that's true. You don't drive a car

653
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,600
from the top. From the top? Maybe you don't. From inside. I do. Mr. Bean? Mr. Beast? Mr.

654
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,840
Bean drives the car from the top. Jack, do you know Mr. Beast? Jack Frost? Do I know Mr.

655
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,400
Beast? Of course we're in talks. He's always trying to make excellent content videos. Well

656
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,840
he would always, you'd be such a great resource for him. That's true. He's always trying to

657
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,840
freeze shit. I froze 30,000 Indonesian immigrants in a loose area. The least free area in the

658
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,840
The person who melts last gets to keep all the other donuts.

659
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:00,840
I remember that video where he was like, "I started winter."

660
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,840
And it at least didn't work out. It was a scrapped video.

661
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,840
Yeah, they threw it.

662
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
He couldn't make winter happen.

663
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
He tried to make winter, but he doesn't have any sort of frozen ability.

664
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
I feel like maybe we could get you two to link up.

665
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
I mean, I don't want to...

666
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
I've talked to Mr. B.

667
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
He's also a North Carolina native.

668
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:25,160
native. He bounces ideas off of us. That's right man. 75 South, Tribeboro, Cookout, Silas Creek Parkway.

669
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,240
What's your cookout order Jack Frost? Don't tell me you're getting five milkshakes for your tray.

670
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:38,120
No relax. Okay. I'm getting a barbecue pulled pork sandwich with hush puppies, coleslaw.

671
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:49,400
And what to drink? Yeah, cheer wine. Oh, with Nutella ice. Nutella ice. Nutella ice. That's not a bad idea.

672
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:57,400
I thought you, I didn't want to get caught like I'm not a North Carolina guy, which I'm not. You're

673
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:03,160
not. I'm from space. Yeah, it's cold up there in space. Yeah. So you're an alien? How's that work?

674
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,960
Are you snow? Okay. Well, what? Are you snow or are you an alien? Okay, I guess that answers my

675
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I don't know. Do these hands lie?

676
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,240
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

677
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,980
I mean what else do you guys always wanted to ask Jack Frost? Yeah

678
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm on TRT. I'm on HRT. You're doing

679
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,760
Yeah, you're doing on HRC

680
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,000
Hillary

681
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Speaking of routines though, I do kind of want to know your skin care routine because you're

682
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
glowing blue and red.

683
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
You do look great.

684
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,800
I get one tub of moisturizer, I get one tub of sunscreen, mix them up and then I'll just

685
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,240
let it on my face every day.

686
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,260
You know what I always wanted to do for my skin?

687
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,360
Remember in Wanted where they make themselves into human candles?

688
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,360
No.

689
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,360
No.

690
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,360
Wait, what?

691
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,360
In Wanted?

692
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,360
You don't remember that?

693
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,120
Is Wanted the Curve the Bullet movie?

694
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
They make themselves into human candles.

695
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
They make themselves into human candles.

696
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,120
Oh dude, that reminds me.

697
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
That's like a mission impossible

698
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
and everybody turns themselves into a bunch of

699
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
teacups.

700
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Talking about something like that, right?

701
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,120
I remember that. It's an action movie trope.

702
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,120
They always melt themselves into some 3D

703
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,120
printed object.

704
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,120
It's usually a

705
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
Beauty and the Beast reference.

706
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
It's a paying homage to one of the movies that came

707
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
before. Or a cabinet

708
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,360
Oh a cabinet could work line the witch in the wardrobe. Yeah, that's one of them cabinet

709
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,360
That's a cabinet movie for sure

710
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:44,600
Indian in the cover the original cabinet movie

711
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:51,520
Do the German expressionism is such a wonderful style that they brought it's gorgeous. Yeah. Oh, it's gorgeous

712
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:57,720
File I got a lot of time up there in the space. Yeah, what movies do you get up there?

713
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,680
Do you have do you get Wi-Fi or is it a theater situation? Yeah, mostly Wi-Fi movies. Yeah

714
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,000
Yeah. You see like money playing

715
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:05,920
anything internet related. Yeah.

716
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,920
Yeah. Money playing, snakes on a plane,

717
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:11,360
airplane, the smiley face killer.

718
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,960
Yeah. A lot of those horror movies.

719
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,440
What's it called? Geek School?

720
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:15,960
No.

721
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:16,680
The Geek School.

722
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Bloom House.

723
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Bloom House. Yeah.

724
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,240
They send those up to space?

725
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,320
Bloom House, Hill House.

726
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,680
Yeah. Well.

727
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
Yeah.

728
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,920
We need a little scare up there.

729
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,920
It's boring as hell.

730
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:27,920
It's boring in space?

731
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,200
Yeah.

732
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,440
Don't you have all the laser beams and shit flying by all the time?

733
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,200
planets? Whose laser beams are those? I don't know. You tell me. You're the one in space. I'm

734
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:43,360
just terrestrial. I'm not saying anything. Okay. I don't know whose is it. Yeah, not much goes on.

735
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:51,360
You just look around. Yeah. Anti-gravity. That's true. Anti-gravity? So yeah. So the way anti-

736
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,600
gravity works, gravity pulls you towards a heavy object, right? So anti-gravity is...

737
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,440
- It pushes you away.

738
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,040
- It pushes you, it pushes you away, yeah.

739
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,880
- Oh yeah.

740
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,720
- That's fascinating.

741
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,240
- You jump backward.

742
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,000
- So what, so yeah, running forward is running backwards.

743
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,840
- So everything's kind of opposite up there.

744
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,660
- That makes sense.

745
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,500
- It's backwards.

746
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,520
- It's backwards gravity.

747
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,680
- So do you make stuff hot up there and cold down here?

748
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,040
- Hot up there, cold down here.

749
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,360
Oh, you're talking about--

750
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,480
- Jack Frost.

751
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,440
- Jack Frost, having reverse temperature disorder.

752
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,480
(laughing)

753
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,080
- Yeah, that's what I was wondering.

754
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,360
- Is there a problem you have?

755
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,180
- With what?

756
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,180
Reverse temperature disorder.

757
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,180
Reverse temperature disorder.

758
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,180
Do you have any disorders?

759
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,180
No, I got no problem with that.

760
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,180
What disorders do you have?

761
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:35,060
Reverse temperature disorder, Spillman's curse, what did you ask me?

762
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,060
What disorders?

763
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,060
Oh, what disorders?

764
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,940
I got fucking attitude disorder.

765
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
Okay.

766
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,940
Damn.

767
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:41,940
Alright.

768
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,940
Do they still call it that?

769
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,940
I do.

770
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,780
That seems kind of an outdated term maybe.

771
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,780
What do you...

772
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:50,900
I just mean like is that, like are you, do you have any mental health issues Jack Frost?

773
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,260
Yeah, like do you struggle with anything?

774
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,860
Do you have an intermittent explosive disorder?

775
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Nope.

776
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,860
of intermittent fasting?

777
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,860
Associative identity disorder?

778
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,860
Associative identity? Nah.

779
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,860
There's not really any mental health

780
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
problems for people who go to space.

781
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
That makes sense because it probably gives you a lot of perspective.

782
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,860
You get up there and you're like, "Oh, I'm

783
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,860
small as fuck. Nothing really matters all that much."

784
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,860
I'm the jewel at that point.

785
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,860
I have to imagine your IQ is probably pretty high

786
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,860
from being in space. I think that probably makes you smart.

787
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Being in space, you have to

788
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,860
speak in front of the jewel. I bet LP's music

789
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,860
hits completely different in space.

790
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,820
that's not Linkin Park? No. I mean that's technically Linkin Park.

791
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,880
All of his beats are like... I don't know Run the Jewels as a band. Oh, you just know

792
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,580
them as a phrase. Yeah, like "Yo, run the jewels." The phrase is phrasic sense.

793
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,100
But Linkin Park probably hits different up there too. Linkin Park runs the jewels, I'll tell you that much.

794
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,660
I bet Linkin Park's Transformers songs hit different in space.

795
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:52,580
what I've done. What I've done, New Divide. Oh yeah! Yeah. I know I've talked about

796
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,340
this before. What is the Linkin Park song where the music video they're in a sink?

797
00:35:56,340 --> 00:36:01,980
Oh, is that Breaking the Habit maybe? They're in a sink in them. I don't know.

798
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,660
They're in a sink in most of the videos. Okay. There's this guy at the at the park

799
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:10,040
I keep seeing. He walks around with this big speaker that has a big Puerto Rican

800
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,380
flag on it and all he plays is Linkin Park remixes. Sick. Yesterday he was

801
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:21,380
walking around he rolls it around he was playing the wah is a what's the wah?

802
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,380
The wah!

803
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,380
The wah!

804
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
The wah!

805
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
The wah!

806
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
The wah!

807
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
The wah!

808
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,380
The wah!

809
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
The wah!

810
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,380
The wah!

811
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
The wah!

812
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,380
The wah!

813
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,380
The wah!

814
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
The wah!

815
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
The wah!

816
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,380
The wah!

817
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
The wah!

818
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,380
The wah!

819
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,380
The wah!

820
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,380
The wah!

821
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,380
The wah!

822
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,380
The wah!

823
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,380
The wah!

824
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,740
I'll be skating and I hear him just doing that and it hypes me up.

825
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,780
Do you ever think about dressing up in his exact outfit and doing exactly what he does?

826
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,640
That's a good idea.

827
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,680
I should get a big speaker with a Puerto Rican flag on it.

828
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,100
You think that as a joke, but the speakers, the larger speaker is, they can get into the

829
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,940
like $500 or $600 range.

830
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:06,540
Yeah I think that's a very expensive, it's like, it's not like the flag is hanging on

831
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,540
it.

832
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,660
Like when you see a guy who walks around the subway with a giant boombox, he's made like

833
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,660
a $1000 investment.

834
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,660
Yeah.

835
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:17,460
But it's not the boom box, it doesn't have a Puerto Rican flag draped over it. It's like

836
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,460
the grate on the meadow is Puerto Rican flag.

837
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,780
It's a big upgrade. He took that to an auto shop and painted it.

838
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:27,980
GTA speaker. He drove his speaker into a garage.

839
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,500
Well, it's got wheels on it.

840
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,340
True. Hey, if it's got wheels.

841
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:35,700
If it's got wheels, it can go to an auto shop.

842
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,620
Who's your celebrity crush?

843
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:39,620
That's embarrassing.

844
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Sorry.

845
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:44,300
I have to know. Okay, but I have to know. But you can allude to it.

846
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Okay, they're in a movie. Okay, okay.

847
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,820
Okay, let's guess. I think I know who this is. Okay, okay. I think I know.

848
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:56,220
They, uh... Will, do you want to guess?

849
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:00,220
No. Okay. Michelle Obama. Does it rhyme with Fousey Foo?

850
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:03,420
Who? Juicy J?

851
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,340
Lucy Liu? Oh. No, it's, um...

852
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:10,620
I can't remember her name, but she was in Chuck and Larry.

853
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,620
Chuck and Larry?

854
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,620
Jessica Biel.

855
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,620
Jessica Biel, man.

856
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,620
Woo-wee!

857
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,620
Jessica Biel is, you know who she is, Dave?

858
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,620
She's got to be from the US.

859
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,620
Justin Timberlake.

860
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,620
She's dating Justin Timberlake?

861
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
She's married.

862
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,620
No, she's not.

863
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,620
They're married?

864
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:22,620
Yeah, they're married.

865
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,620
They've been married a long time.

866
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,540
I think Jack Frost can change that.

867
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
Fuck Justin Timberlake.

868
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
Whoa.

869
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,540
You're doing--

870
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
Wait, get it, get it, get it, get Jax.

871
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,540
Yeah, get a punch in.

872
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,540
Get Jax a-- there you go, talk your shit.

873
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,800
Fuck Justin Timberlake.

874
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,000
You have stolen enough property from working class Americans and it's time to return it.

875
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,360
Your episode of whatever it's called, lost, or punked, sucked, um, what?

876
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
I think that's your camera.

877
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,360
No, that's not.

878
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,360
No, no, no, no.

879
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,080
I was picking your nose on the camera.

880
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
But you can zone too.

881
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
Fuck Justin Timberlake.

882
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Whoa.

883
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Whoa.

884
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,080
I didn't even say it again.

885
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
I think I heard you the first time.

886
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,080
I was so busy picking your nose.

887
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,080
I take it all back, whatever.

888
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
He was such an asshole on the social network.

889
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,080
Because of his hair?

890
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,080
Yeah.

891
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,080
He's a dickhead.

892
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:08,360
is his activity. He's playing a role guys, relax. Yeah, he's rolling over in his grave.

893
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,640
His roles are fine, but him as a guy is a dick. I think when he bends over he's probably got

894
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,480
some jelly rolls. That's what I'm saying. He's got some of the Don Vito's expresses

895
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,120
on him. He's got veal scallopini all over him. You need to stop eating sushi off of

896
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:25,080
Jessica Biel's body, you're putting on pounds. Oh my god. Justin, Justin, filter plate. Yep.

897
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:30,320
Okay, what celebrity do you want to put Ebby in their belly button and suck it out of them?

898
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,140
the fat guy from jackass. Preston Lacey? Or Zackass.

899
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:43,200
You can put both of their belly buttons together. Oh, Action Bronson. Oh my god. He'd be like a big gulp.

900
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,720
Because of his huge belly button. Yeah it's probably so deep. Yeah it works out.

901
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,360
What if he had a small belly button though? Like how big fat guys have little

902
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:59,960
nipples? Pretty big. You have a big one actually. Yeah that looks deep. I feel like I could see

Yeah, can you just pull up maybe a hot picture of Jessica Biel?

919
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,460
We were talking about her and I was expecting to get kind of sexually aroused.

920
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:36,460
Oh, he already has a tab open with Jessica Biel.

921
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,460
That's been there.

922
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,460
Wow.

923
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,460
Sexual.

924
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,460
Okay.

925
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,460

This is gonna be not good to...

927

That is not her.

928
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,460
That is not Jessica Biel.

929
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,460
I know for a fact none of this is her.

930
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:48,460
That's Jessica.

931
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,460
That is not Jessica Biel.

932
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,460
Looks like it.

933
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,460
Jessica Biel, hardcore sex.

934
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,460
She did this?

935
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:56,740

936
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:01,480

937
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:08,620
fappening what's that Jack Frost is that like for every for one day everyone's

938
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:14,780
allowed to masturbate that'd be like the purge or the happening is splurge

939
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:15,380
There we go.

940
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,180
Oh, the splurge is good.

941
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:17,680
The jerge.

942
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,580
[LAUGHTER]

943
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,080
The jerge.

944
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,380
The jerge.

945
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,980
The jizz purge.

946
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,980
Hey, make that up.

947
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,380
Oh, that's the jerge right there.

948
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,780
That guy's jerging hard.

949
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,980
That's a jerging on.

950
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,780
That's a Christmas monster called the jerge.

951
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,580
We probably should have to walk down the--

952
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,780
[LAUGHTER]

953
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,080
God, I wish I looked like that so bad, man.

954
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,580
You don't.

955
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,580
No, it seems nice, but--

956
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,780
He's got sloth from the goonies eye,

957
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,380
because they put a watermark over it.

958
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:41,180
He looks scary.

959
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,680
That's OK.

960
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:42,480
Oh, yeah.

961
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,680
Kind of a spiral eye.

962
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,380
Yeah.

963
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,980
I know a guy who had sloth in the goonie eye and he passed.

964
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:47,980
That's sad.

965
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:49,980
He passed from sloth in the goonie eye, yeah.

966
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,980
Wow.

967
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
That's awful.

968
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,980
I know.

969
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
You know they're selling that house from the goonies?

970
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,980
Which one?

971
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,980
Which one?

972
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,980
Yeah, there's a lot of houses.

973
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:57,980
The big house at the beginning.

974
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:58,980
I heard they're selling the ship too.

975
00:42:58,980 --> 00:42:59,980
They're selling the shit out of that.

976
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,980
They're selling the cave.

977
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:01,980
The ship out of it.

978
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:02,980
I don't want no part of that cave.

979
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,980
They're selling the ship out of the cave.

980
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,980
Yeah, that's right.

981
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,980
Don't keep me as far away from that cave.

982
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:06,980
I know, it's scary.

983
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:07,980
How much would you pay for a cave?

984
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,660
When are they going to sell sloth?

985
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,100
are free. Why do celebrities have been buying all these islands and they're at

986
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,320
the point with private islands where they go to Saudi Arabia and they start

987
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,800
blowing sand into the fucking ocean to make an island that's shaped like a

988
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:24,220
square. It's so ridiculous. It's crazy right? It's not a real island. So do, but when are

989
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:28,100
they gonna start moving like okay now I'm trying to move like Batman and I'm

990
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:35,740
gonna have a cave. When are they gonna do it? I don't know. Should be coming up is all my

991
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:38,860
That is a good point. I actually just thought of a Jack Frost question you just

992
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:42,240
actually made me think of one. Have you ever considered, I mean, maybe going to

993
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:48,260
Hawaii and turning it into a tundra? Yeah, I've thought about it. I've thought

994
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,940
about it. I'm frozen. Apparently a volcano erupted there today. Really? Today? Yeah.

995
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:58,220
My god. Apparently it's really bad. Are you serious? Yeah, I guess it was a

996
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:04,100
tragedy. Look at volcano news. Yeah, a big one just blew everyone up and there was

997
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,060
ash. Don't look up sexual at the end of the news. That's interesting. News about did a

998
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,060
volcano erupt. Well it is inherently sexual when the earth busts. Oh it's not

999
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,640
my bad, it began erupting. That's the hottest nut on earth. Wait do people die? I think they

1000
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,980
need you. A lot of people are... oh there's a smiley face. Look at this bull crap. I think

1001
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,020
people in Hawaii maybe need you right now. There's fire and brimstone. It's an

1002
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:28,700
interesting moral question. Sure. Because just because you have the power does that

1003
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,620
mean you have to deny yourself the humanity of just living life? It's like,

1004
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,120
"Oh, I was born with an ability to reverse volcano destruction."

1005
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,120
Have you seen Hitch?

1006
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
So you're kind of like Superman.

1007
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,120
No, not Hitch.

1008
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,120
Hancock.

1009
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:43,980
Dude, that's crazy that you said that and I knew what you were talking about.

1010
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:47,240
I've seen Hitch more than any other program on earth.

1011
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,800
I can probably do every line of it.

1012
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,800
Do it, go.

1013
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,800
Do it, all right, from the top.

1014
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,800
Establishing shot, New York City, we're coming in up top.

1015
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,800
We got that song playing that I can't remember.

1016
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,800
Fuck.

1017
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,800
That's not part of the script.

1018
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Yeah, you can keep going.

1019
00:44:58,800 --> 00:44:59,800
Yeah, it is.

1020
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,640
- Yeah, you can keep going.

1021
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,460
- You can just say the word.

1022
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,300
- Yeah, it is.

1023
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:03,200
(laughing)

1024
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,340
Oh, we come in, pull in, we get a close up,

1025
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,000
insert shot on Kevin James.

1026
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,080
Oh, whoa, I'm tossing the pizza today,

1027
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,280
trying to learn how to dance.

1028
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,480
And then Will Smith comes through,

1029
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,840
he's got the allergic reaction,

1030
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,680
and then Eva Mendez is like,

1031
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:18,240
let me show you just what I like.

1032
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,520
- And then they go on a see-do, right?

1033
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:21,840
- And then they go on a see-do,

1034
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,000
and then, I haven't seen in a while.

1035
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,280
- If I see Eva Mendez, I would see her and do her.

1036
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,120
- Oh my God, yeah.

1037
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
Wow.

1038
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,800
If I see her, I might do her.

1039
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:32,800
That's a talented sentence.

1040
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:33,800
Yep.

1041
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,800
I'm going to patsy you, eat some pads.

1042
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,400
I'm going to, I don't mind if I do eat some pads.

1043
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:47,000
I would see, I would see Eva Mendez's pads and I would say ew.

1044
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,240
I'd put on pads and eat some.

1045
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Those things are nasty.

1046
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:52,240
What are, pads?

1047
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,240
Just pads are nasty.

1048
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:55,920
Eva Mendez's pads, I'd see them say ew and then eat them.

1049
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,880
I don't know if anyone ever thought about this.

1050
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:03,200
It's so hard to understand. Yeah, for some reason I thought you meant her butt.

1051
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:11,280
Why? I'm talking about the neutral pads. If I see her pad and say "eww" I tie her pad.

1052
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,960
I make a pad tie so she can't take it off. You wear her used pad as a tie.

1053
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,680
Yeah. You have to be so good at language to have this conversation.

1054
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:26,160
Very high level kind of stuff. Yeah. So that's good. But have you seen Hancock?

1055
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,520
Because that's the whole moral dilemma of Hancock. I'd hand her my cock.

1056
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:33,440
Huh? Saw it in theaters twice? Because the fire alarm went off the first time I had to run it back.

1057
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,160
That happened to me once. You ran it back afterwards? Then you only saw it once. I saw it 1.5 times.

1058
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:43,400
Okay, that's fine. Yeah. So what are you gonna say about it? Do you... Wow, this is a whole new look.

1059
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:51,400
God damn. Damn. Badass Jack Frost. You look like Slim Shady. Whoa! You look just like Slim Shady.

1060
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,520
Whoa! Come on, man. He doesn't even care. You're acting like Slim Shady too, disrespecting fucking

1061
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,160
every so disrespectful dude.

1062
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,000
- No, I don't.

1063
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,960
- Whoa, what the fuck?

1064
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,680
- Suck my eyeballs, man.

1065
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:02,520
- Fuck you.

1066
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,340
- Fuck you.

1067
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,180
- I don't give a fuck.

1068
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,020
- Why do you say that?

1069
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,520
- Because it's abnormal, man.

1070
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:07,360
I don't give a fuck.

1071
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,920
- Whoa, behaving oddly, dude.

1072
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,920
- You're acting ice cold to me, Wade.

1073
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,840
- Yeah.

1074
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,680
- Oh my God.

1075
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:15,360
- I told you about this syndrome.

1076
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,120
- Oh, this is part of the syndrome.

1077
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,440
- Sleet snowy.

1078
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,680
- Yep, sleet snowy.

1079
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:20,760
- Is that like Slim Shady?

1080
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,680
- Yeah, like Slim Shady, sleet snowy.

1081
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,080
- Marshall Mathers, it's more like.

1082
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:31,400
yeah what winters yeah weathers Marta Marsha are Mart for Arctic weathers

1083
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:36,680
March Arctic weathers oh that's good Arctic weathers marginal matter in the

1084
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,760
new Simpsons movie is there a new Simpsons movie coming out no blue Simpsons

1085
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:46,400
movie dollar marginal matter one of the main characters of the show marginal

1086
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,600
matter yeah got a Marge impression in you tell me really oh yeah do you want to

1087
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,320
hear my Marge noise I came up with recently. It's if she never made this

1088
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,360
noise, but I think she might, she maybe would if she something happened. So this

1089
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,080
isn't an impression. This is like this is a what is. This is a speculative.

1090
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,720
Hey, Mike acts like Homer. That's right. That's right. I respect you. Wait,

1091
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,360
check this out.

1092
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,080
Marge. Marge. Check this out.

1093
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:17,120
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. But here's a joke. Tell us.

1094
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:21,840
Marge would never make that noise.

1095
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,680
- Well, that's the whole point.

1096
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,020
- Yeah, it's speculative.

1097
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,680
She wouldn't make it in the show, but like--

1098
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,000
- What if Marge made that noise

1099
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,600
while she was snoring? - What if Marge made--

1100
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,440
True.

1101
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,280
- I'm in a disgusting mood,

1102
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,560
but maybe that's the sound that her--

1103
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,400
- Then don't say it.

1104
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,220
- Don't, yeah, I don't even wanna hear it.

1105
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:35,160
- You're in a disgusting mood?

1106
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:37,760
- I'm just in a nasty sex kinda mood.

1107
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,440
- Oh, I hear you saying, you're riled up.

1108
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,400
- Yeah.

1109
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,000
That made you, that riled you up?

1110
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,840
- Little bit.

1111
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,800
I was saying like, you know when something comes--

1112
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:45,640
- See, you're perfect, you're good at it.

1113
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,480
- I'm not good at it.

1114
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,300
- You're not good at it.

1115
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,140
- I wish I didn't do that.

1116
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,980
- Do it again.

1117
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,800
- I wish I didn't do it.

1118
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,000
- You kind of have Bart hair.

1119
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,680
No, he looks just like Eminem, dude.

1120
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,080
What are you talking about?

1121
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,920
- It's like a Bart in the shower.

1122
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,520
- Here's a good question.

1123
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,380
Speaking of Mark, I'll go Marin on you.

1124
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,400
- Oh my God.

1125
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:07,240
- Who are you guys in terms of coldness?

1126
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,520
In terms of coldness and temperature?

1127
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:11,360
- Low temperature.

1128
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:12,760
- Who are my lowest temperature guys?

1129
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,720
- Yeah.

1130
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,560
- Or just guys that inspire you.

1131
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:15,400
- Your cats.

1132
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,000
Oh, I see. My influences?

1133
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,720
Yeah, like who is the generation above you?

1134
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:20,800
The class above you?

1135
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,960
I mean, you gotta give it up for, like,

1136
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,480
Lenny Bruce, man, just put truth on blast.

1137
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,320
Yeah.

1138
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:29,720
It revolutionized the comedy industry.

1139
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:33,500
And then, like, you know, I'm an annoyance guy, so like,

1140
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:37,640
I feel like Tim Robinson really made the Chicago comedy scene

1141
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:38,480
what it is.

1142
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,080
Yeah.

1143
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:42,200
The annoyance was a Chicago theater?

1144
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,040
Yeah.

1145
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,440
That Jack Frost used to roll through?

1146
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,440
Oh, Jack Frost?

1147
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:47,440
Jack Frost.

1148
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,440
I thought you were asking me, Jack Bensinger, what are your biggest comedic influences?

1149
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,440
[laughter]

1150
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,440
And you went Lenny Bruce and then Tim Robinson?

1151
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Those are your two?

1152
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:02,440
I got the list tattooed on my back.

1153
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,440
Lenny Bruce and Timmy.

1154
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,440
You have a Tim Robinson tummy rocker in Old English?

1155
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,440
Yeah.

1156
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Tim Robinson?

1157
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,440
That'd be sick, dude.

1158
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,440
Don't talk about this shit.

1159
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:16,440
Hey, we got, well, Hitmonchan. That's Hitmonchan.

1160
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,440
Yeah, I was saying Hitmonchan.

1161
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,440
Did you play Pokemon growing up?

1162
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,440
Yeah, I played Pokemon.

1163
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,440
Which one? Ice Cold?

1164
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,440
Blue Ice.

1165
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,440
Blue Ice Crystals.

1166
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,440
Yeah, man. I always thought that I had Pokemon in my attic.

1167
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,440
Come to find, just squirrels and rats.

1168
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,440
Squirrels and rats in your attic?

1169
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,440
They lived together?

1170
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,720
the most fucked up house that was unfortunately destroyed by a flood in

1171
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:47,440
2019 growing up. For real? That's tragic. In Virginia?

1172
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,960
Why didn't you freeze it? Refrigerator flood. What the hell are you talking about?

1173
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,400
My refrigerator was running and nobody was home and the water from the fridge just

1174
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:59,800
completely melted my house. Nobody even bothered to call? What? Nobody even bothered to call?

1175
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:05,760
Call what? To ask? Oh because of the prank? Yeah. It's not funny man, my childhood home was destroyed by a

1176
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:11,440
refrigerator running. Isn't that the most twisted sense of irony?

1177
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,140
And my home was destroyed by it. Yeah. Damn. How does the entire home get

1178
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,560
destroyed by that? Because we had a split-level house and so the fridge was

1179
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,520
up top and my whole house is made out of wood. And so it just yeah really

1180
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,320
ate through it. Wait so it like... because my fridge at home is broken and it

1181
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,480
leaks water all the time. Mine was leaking brown fluid. Mine leaks a red fluid.

1182
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
I think sticky brown fluid.

1183
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,480
And then my dog walks up and eats it and I just go "Ahhh"

1184
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,480
Is it cherry juice?

1185
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,480
No I have no cherries anywhere near my house.

1186
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,480
I touched my liquid with my finger.

1187
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,480
Mine looks like chili oil.

1188
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
It was sticky.

1189
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
It could be chili oil.

1190
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,480
It's gotta be syrup.

1191
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
I cleaned it. You know what it was? It was rotten.

1192
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,480
Oh wait, you already knew?

1193
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,480
No I found it out later.

1194
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,480
It was a sweet potato.

1195
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,480
On the top of the fridge.

1196
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,480
Isn't that horrible?

1197
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,480
That never happens again.

1198
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,980
I don't have sweet potato anymore.

1199
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,480
You thought that was the problem?

1200
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:09,880
What was that specific one?

1201
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,120
Oh yeah, get rid of that thing.

1202
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
You probably got your problem pretty much fixed.

1203
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,440
Because they were brand new too.

1204
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,000
So tell me, you're hitting up, you're a celebrity, you're rich, and you're all about ice.

1205
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,720
Are you walking down Johnny Dang, icing you out, brand new chain, walking around Paul

1206
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:23,720
Wall style?

1207
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,040
Johnny Depp ice.

1208
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,040
Oh yeah.

1209
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:31,560
People see me walking down the street and they know that I have money based on my appearance.

1210
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,560
I'm Jack Frost, man. I'm rich. Duh.

1211
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,560
Yes, sir. Duh.

1212
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:38,560
Put some music under that.

1213
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,560
Yeah.

1214
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,560
They sampled you for that.

1215
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,560
Like they did Trinidad James in that one song.

1216
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,560
Where they said, "Don't believe me, just watch."

1217
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,560
They sampled the word "watch."

1218
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:51,560
They gave him like $3 million for that.

1219
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,560
He didn't even do vocals on it.

1220
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,560
The guy who made the song just was friends with Trinidad James.

1221
00:52:57,560 --> 00:52:58,560
Who the fuck is that?

1222
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,560
Had no money anymore.

1223
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:06,240
the guy Trinidad James? No, Trinidad James. He's that song that's like "gold all in my

1224
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:14,320
watch" "gold on my watch" "hello hello hello" yeah. I don't remember if that's the lyrics but probably close to that.

1225
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,440
It was. Part of the song where he says hi to the audience. That was with a...

1226
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,640
He waved to every single person. That was a scrapped take. He walks up and down.

1227
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,720
I feel so good when Trinidad James does that. That was a scrapped recording take where his phone rang during

1228
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,720
and when he was singing the song in the studio.

1229
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,720
Yeah, and he went, "Hello, hello, hello."

1230
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,420
You really do look so much like B-Rabbit to me these days.

1231
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,420
You have more... Oh, you want more water?

1232
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,420
If it's going around, I don't want to be weird about it.

1233
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,420
Yeah, yeah, come on. There you go.

1234
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:43,420
Alright. Alright, so...

1235
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,420
Here, I'll pour it for you.

1236
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,420
Here, go ahead and pour it.

1237
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,420
B-Rabbit.

1238
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:51,420
Should we do it more over the electronics?

1239
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:53,420
Yeah, it's pretty good.

1240
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,420
Thanks, man.

1241
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:58,420
Wow.

1242
00:53:58,420 --> 00:53:59,420
I might hit that a little bit myself.

1243
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,420
Stuff's good.

1244
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,820
Why don't we just get like a cooler thing for it?

1245
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,820
D-O. Are you made of fucking money?

1246
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:05,820
No.

1247
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,820
Because he's made of snow.

1248
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,820
It's true.

1249
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,820
I'm made of money.

1250
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,820
Jack's drinking that whole thing.

1251
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,820
Look at that.

1252
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:11,820
Oh my god, you're going to have to pee so bad.

1253
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,820
He's got ice to produce.

1254
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,420
You know that I hold the record for the world's slowest chug?

1255
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,020
Really?

1256
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:19,020
You hold it?

1257
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,020
You are going really slow.

1258
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,980
I'm not seeing that cup move at all and somehow you're still gulping.

1259
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,140
Oh, he's kind of tasting.

1260
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,140
It's in the middle.

1261
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:26,140
Okay.

1262
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:29,780
put you through the whole thing. How long would it take you if you're at your

1263
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:33,600
slowest to drink that? Competition or just practicing? Competition, Coney Island.

1264
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:38,440
Coney Island slow chug competition? It's a smaller competition but they do it

1265
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,880
kind of in the same part. They do it in the winter. Well so are you allowed to do

1266
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,680
that? I mean I don't know if you guys ever had as a school child you ever

1267
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,520
did a slow race you ever tried to do a race where you're at going slow but

1268
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:53,140
people some people would be clowns they go backwards and can you do that in the

1269
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:58,820
slow chug? Can you spit up water? Can you just not drink? I'm gonna get it. I don't know.

1270
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:05,940
You have to have a clear regulation cup.

1271
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:12,620
It says here that you're worth 1.2 million. That's a lot. That's your revenue in 2022.

1272
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,620
That's not what it's worth.

1273
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:16,660
I was gonna say, that's not even close. That's just my revenue last year. That's probably

1274
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:19,140
not even including my streaming. That's probably not even including...

1275
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,140
You stream?

1276
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:21,140
Yeah, man.

1277
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:22,140
You're on Twitch?

1278
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:28,140
Hasan Abi. That's you? Yep. Whoa you do a zip up all the way up? That's me man. Oh my god.

1279
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:32,140
I clean up good. You do yeah. I had no idea that was you. I didn't realize you were

1280
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:36,940
so political. Super political. Damn. I'm like a super political guy. Yeah. What's your

1281
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:41,740
what what's your politics? Well you know it depends on the issue. Uh-huh.

1282
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:48,900
Abortion. Um clean it up man. Clean up the abortion? Yeah clean up your act. Okay.

1283
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:53,900
Wait should we clean up the most of my opinions are 3,000 years in the future

1284
00:55:53,900 --> 00:56:00,620
Well you're in space developing these yeah, just like who'd you vote for

1285
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,060
West election

1286
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,500
Biden Biden yeah

1287
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,100
Just the most sensible thing Trump is Trump was a wreck

1288
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,640
He was the second he got into office his policies were you know all over the place

1289
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,760
Where do you think, are you thinking in this next, you think he's gonna win the nomination

1290
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,180
in this next cycle?

1291
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:23,040
You know, it's not looking good for him after the midterms.

1292
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:29,480
I do feel like it's hard to even imagine anymore a world where Trump doesn't win a primary,

1293
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:30,680
but it's really starting to look like that.

1294
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,720
I know that a year is a long time from now.

1295
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:36,840
It's, you know, it's, we didn't, everybody got the midterms wrong this time.

1296
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:41,500
So it's really, it's a weird place to even try and pretend to know how to predict these

1297
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,840
elections at this point, yeah.

1298
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,680
- Do you think DeSantis might win?

1299
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:45,520
- Sure.

1300
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,340
- DeSantis.

1301
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,920
- It's certainly gonna, uh!

1302
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,160
(laughing)

1303
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:55,960
- Oh wow.

1304
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:56,800
- I needed that.

1305
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:58,760
- Who's your guy in 2024?

1306
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,600
- My guy in 2024?

1307
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,640
It's President Belly, man.

1308
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,960
I'm trying to gain weight.

1309
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,800
- Trying to gain weight.

1310
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,560
- I'm trying to gain weight.

1311
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,560
Yeah, big time.

1312
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,240
- Are you saying you'd become President Belly?

1313
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,960
I'm hoping President Belly maybe comes up

1314
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,800
and he's like, "You're everybody."

1315
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,920
is my belly. Oh, I get you. I listen to my belly, that's it. What's the country? It says

1316
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,920
here President Belly is President Reagan. Can you put this up here? If you search President

1317
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,920
Belly, President Reagan is... Your bro Reagan? You didn't know that? You're bringing him

1318
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:30,120
back? Yeah, vote for him. You froze him? I ride him in. Yeah, wait, so what other things

1319
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:35,640
can you Google that have something weird come up? What if you search President... Try it,

1320
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:39,760
Space Invaders. It is so fun having Google, right? You can play Space Invaders. I would

1321
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,220
I never sit at my house and just Google things and look at the results, but it is so fun

1322
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,220
to do here.

1323
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,220
Yeah.

1324
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:49,880
Something about somebody else doing it for you, I'm like, "Oh my gosh, I'm blessed."

1325
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
Maybe.

1326
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,880
Space Invaders, doesn't play.

1327
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,880
It's not your own Bing, that's the issue, I think.

1328
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,880
No, it didn't work.

1329
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:54,880
Yeah, I don't know why you use Bing so much, Jubio.

1330
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:55,880
All right, so let's go ahead and play this, I guess, really quick.

1331
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,880
I don't think we want to play Space Invaders.

1332
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:57,880
Okay, let's just go ahead and play this really quick.

1333
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,880
No, no, no, I don't think we'll play Space Invaders.

1334
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,880
Hotline Bing.

1335
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,880
Favorite video game, Jack Frost.

1336
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:01,880
That's a tough one.

1337
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:02,880
I don't know.

1338
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,880
No, no, no, I don't think we'll post this.

1339
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,880
Favorite video game, Jack Frost?

1340
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,880
That's a tough one.

1341
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,880
Maybe Bomberman.

1342
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:12,880
I thought you'd say Ice Climbers.

1343
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
I thought you were going to say Jack Frost Adventures.

1344
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,880
Let me try again.

1345
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,880
Let me try again.

1346
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,880
Cold War.

1347
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,880
Wait, what's your favorite war?

1348
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,880
My favorite war is the Ice War.

1349
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,880
The Ice War?

1350
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,880
When did that happen? Who was that between?

1351
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:37,720
That was 1913 between East Timor and Papua New Guinea. East Timor? East Timor?

1352
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:46,120
Right? What's Timor? Google it. East Timor. Search Ice Wars. No. Yeah. Okay. Oh I've never

1353
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:49,780
even heard of this place. Yeah. All right. They got a nice flag. I guess you've seen

1354
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:52,920
all the world because you're a famous celebrity. Yeah. How old are you? I can name every country

1355
00:58:52,920 --> 00:59:01,420
right now. Okay, try it. America, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize,

1356
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:10,160
Nicaragua, Salvador, Panama, yeah Venezuela, Colombia. You want me to keep going in this

1357
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:19,920
order or should I? What is the order here? Top to bottom. The earth is a line. Okay.

1358
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,960
and America to the top and then Canada and then Mexico? Yeah, the bottom is Tuvalu.

1359
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,640
Tuvalu, which is another country I'm not so familiar with. Kiribati.

1360
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:36,420
What? Kiribati. I don't know what that is. You guys really don't know every

1361
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:40,560
single oceanic island? No. What do you do all day up there in space? I guess he

1362
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,940
sees them all from space. What else am I gonna do? I got no internet and I got these, I'm

1363
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,800
looking down at the earth and I just see the names of the countries on the

1364
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:51,120
different colors. You can see the names. They don't tell you that about space.

1365
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:54,960
Yeah. Whoa. All the names on top just so it makes it easier for a traveler. I

1366
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:58,440
wouldn't be surprised. That makes sense for a space traveler. Yeah. You ever get hit

1367
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:05,280
by any of that space junk? I get hit on by ladies with space junk. Oh my god.

1368
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:15,280
Oh my god, holy shit. That was fucking crazy dude. Yeah bro. Oh my god, how did you do that?

1369
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:22,280
Alright, yeah. Only got a couple minutes left. Okay. Yeah. What did you ask? Do I have to

1370
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,280
get hit by a space junk? No, no, now I want to know about your love life. Where are you

1371
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,280
fucking these women with space junk? Making love, making love. Oh, okay. When you say

1372
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,560
Space junkie mean like those galaxy pants?

1373
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:34,560
Maybe?

1374
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,560
Yeah, like disco pants?

1375
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,560
Yeah, kind of a...

1376
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:38,560
What is disco pants?

1377
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,560
Are they human?

1378
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,560
Shiny?

1379
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:41,560
Oh, okay.

1380
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,560
Yeah, there's a fuckload of humans up there.

1381
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:43,560
Okay.

1382
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:44,560
Every one of us.

1383
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,960
Do you ever hop at the ISS, maybe get a shot of every single liquor from every single country

1384
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:49,960
because they're all up there?

1385
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:50,960
Damn, that would be so fucking sick, dude.

1386
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:52,960
Can you imagine doing a bar crawl in the ISS?

1387
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:53,960
Holy shit.

1388
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:54,960
You'd be drunk as a skunk.

1389
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:55,960
Now in Korea, you would be.

1390
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:56,960
From the Twinkling Star?

1391
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:57,960
Yeah.

1392
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,960
You'd start at the Twinkling Star and then you go to...

1393
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,960
What is that?

1394
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:03,560
you go to international space station that is the twinkling star ron's galaxy

1395
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,200
it's all the bars and bars and the space station

1396
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,840
the ron and then and then shea jupiter that's a restaurant that has a bar in it

1397
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:14,200
exploded on her way up there the carissa mccullough rocket ship

1398
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,560
exploded yeah it was not her that exploded and then the ship caught on

1399
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,360
fire we don't know sorry was there a security

1400
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:25,640
camera in there no there was a security guard in there he didn't do his job

1401
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,240
trying to make sure no teachers explode on you i know you've been exploded on by

1402
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:43,640
a couple teachers. I can just tell man. You've got a smile. There's a pain behind that.

1403
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,560
There's pain behind it and romance in a sense. But I didn't know anything. I

1404
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,560
thought when when everybody told me that story when I was a kid because I was too

1405
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,000
young to know what was happening there or maybe I wasn't alive I don't remember

1406
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,680
but that when it exploded. You were not alive when the Challenger exploded.

1407
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,080
when was your parents died before you were born?

1408
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:01,480
Oh yeah. I was not alive.

1409
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,480
89?

1410
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,080
88, 89, something like that.

1411
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,520
I think it was in 1720.

1412
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,000
I thought it was in 69.

1413
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,760
That's probably why it was quite exploded.

1414
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,240
No idea. I built a spaceship in 1720.

1415
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,480
Who's sticks?

1416
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:16,760
Krista McAuliffe was a teacher in New Hampshire.

1417
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,320
Oh, that's why you know.

1418
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,360
Yeah.

1419
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,360
That's why it exploded.

1420
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,600
We had to learn about that all the time.

1421
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,480
Were you related?

1422
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:22,960
No.

1423
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:23,840
Was she bad?

1424
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:24,840
No.

1425
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,520
She wasn't bad?

1426
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,160
She was bad at flying a spaceship.

1427
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,200
- They like to show us off.

1428
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:31,640
- This is so wrong, this is so wrong, man.

1429
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:34,280
- She was in like a cartoon UFO.

1430
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,840
It's just her in like a glass dome.

1431
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,280
- Can we just show respect, man?

1432
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,840
Can we show respect to people who are dead?

1433
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:43,040
- I used to have a poster of the Challenger.

1434
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,760
- You were a weird, tortured child.

1435
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,640
- I had a, jeez, I had this as a grownup.

1436
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,480
- That's not right.

1437
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,520
- I had a poster of all of them.

1438
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,440
- I bet you had an action figure of the falling man

1439
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,000
from 9/11. - It said America's Heroes

1440
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,680
and it was just a photo of all the Challenger victims.

1441
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,680
They're not heroes.

1442
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,680
Yeah.

1443
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,680
That's why I had it in my room.

1444
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,680
Isn't that heroic?

1445
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,680
I hung it up in my...

1446
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,680
It's not heroic to die, dude.

1447
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,680
Yeah.

1448
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,000
I guess it's nice of them to not fall on a suit.

1449
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
That was heroic of them.

1450
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Dude, let me say this.

1451
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Thank God everybody knows how the 9/11 planes flew into the Twin Towers.

1452
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
You know some kind of secret?

1453
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Someone threw this?

1454
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,000
All I'm going to say is this.

1455
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,000
Stop doing Tee Hee.

1456
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,000
All I'm going to say is this.

1457
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Stop doing Tee what?

1458
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Stop doing Tee Hee.

1459
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,000
Stop doing Tee Hee.

1460
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Stop doing Tee Hee.

1461
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Stop doing Tee Hee.

1462
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Stop doing Tee Hee.

1463
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Stop doing Tee Hee.

1464
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Stop doing Tee Hee.

1465
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,320
doing tea what? Tea heat. You know Michael Jackson. All I gotta say is thank God

1466
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:35,500
they didn't throw the 9/11 planes into the whole earth instead of into the

1467
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:44,040
buildings. That would have sucked. We're all on it at the time. Yeah. I need water.

1468
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:52,900
You've been using so much water. Wait what were you saying? I don't think I was saying anything.

I mean a little I guess earlier. I thought you meant cheating at the games in Wild 'N Out.

1485
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:16,260
You can't cheat at those games they're fucking bulletproof. Yeah that's so true

1486
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:20,700
the CIA needs to focus up on what Nick Cannon is doing over there. There's no way you can

1487
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:26,100
get past those rules. You guys want to go see Wild 'N Out Live at Madison Square Garden?
