1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,600
- Wow, it takes a big man to apologize like that.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,840
- That was very big of you.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,040
- That was huge of you.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,120
- I'm really happy that you stepped up to the plate

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,320
and you did what was right.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,080
- I didn't think that you had it,

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:24,960
because when we asked you to apologize,

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
you seemed so resistant at first.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,780
And then I mean, that's the thing.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,200
Like when you when you talk to

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,740
somebody who is addicted to a

13
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:34,880
sleepy time, it's a disease.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,500
It's addiction is a disease and

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,200
especially to sleepy time tea.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,920
Yeah. And we've known that's why

17
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,840
addicts are always walk around

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,040
going, oh, oh,

19
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,880
and that's what you do when you're

20
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,120
we've known that Jubio has been

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,620
addicted to this for a long time.

22
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,160
Yeah. Haven't done a single thing.

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,280
I actually I heard to listen to him.

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,720
I heard this week a set up a set

25
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,200
back as a set up for a comeback.

26
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,000
Yeah. And who is that?

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,480
I heard from Jack Bensinger.

28
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,480
Okay. Yeah, he said a setback is a setup for a comeback.

29
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,480
That's great. One of the most beautiful things I've ever heard.

30
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,480
I actually don't know if he said comeback or cun-back.

31
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,480
Cun-back? Well, I just didn't hear him that well.

32
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,480
I don't think cun-back is a word.

33
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,480
It's either a setback is a setup for a cun-back or a comeback.

34
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,480
Cun-back is the last name of those things.

35
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,480
I'd like to shout out Jack for putting me onto that.

36
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,480
Cun-back, that sounds like a last name.

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,480
It does kind of sound like a last name.

38
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,480
I guess it could in a different country.

39
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Imagine a guy named Chris Cun-back.

40
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,160
Yeah, he'd probably be pretty quick.

41
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,160
Yeah.

42
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,720
That's like a good heckler, like Stephen Hofstetter kind of name.

43
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,720
Yeah.

44
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Yeah.

45
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,720
Stephen.

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,720
Everyone is jacking his swag nowadays.

47
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,720
I don't know him that well.

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,720
I'm not going to call him Stephen.

49
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Yeah, it's a little familiar, isn't it?

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,720
Call him his full name.

51
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Stephen Hofstetter.

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,720
I call him Mr. Hofstetter.

53
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Yeah.

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,720
Excuse me, Mr. Hofstetter, your jokes suck.

55
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,720
Yeah.

56
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
Hey.

57
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,720
Well.

58
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Polite heckler gets destroyed.

59
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
No, that's what I'm saying.

60
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
I'm in the audience.

61
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
I'm the polite heckler.

62
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
You just said the S word, first of all.

63
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
Okay, no.

64
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
The S word is obviously a completely different word.

65
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,200
word is obviously a completely different word.

66
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,120
You can take one of my coins.

67
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,440
No, no, no, no, no.

68
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Okay, first of all, we haven't even introduced it yet.

69
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,480
Okay.

70
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,960
And we also, we also in our, we definitely, that word is okay.

71
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,280
According to who?

72
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,920
What kind of psych-manager do you hang out with?

73
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,280
The first time, we already did a no swear D&D episode.

74
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,600
Can we, can we pull up maybe just like a list of words forbade by the Catholic

75
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,160
Church?

76
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,400
Well, I don't think that they...

77
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,960
Forbidden.

78
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,360
List of words forbidden.

79
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,400
List of words forbidden by the Catholic Church.

80
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,360
I don't think they make, they publish a swear list.

81
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
Yeah, I think Catholics are like sailors.

82
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,660
They should publish a list of swear words.

83
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,660
So then every year, you know which words are going to get you to send to Asia.

84
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,960
Well, first, can we get a punch in on this right here?

85
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,760
If we have it, a table punch in?

86
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,160
Yeah.

87
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,960
So this is, if you're not watching the video, this is a swear jar.

88
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,760
And we have decided to do, we didn't name it yet.

89
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,160
This is a Prime Energy collaboration.

90
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,600
between Logan Paul and KSI.

91
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,160
It's got to be one of the most dis-

92
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,920
dis-dest-dest-dest-dest-

93
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,400
the itchy double hockey sticks out of here.

94
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
It gives you the most exciting headache

95
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,860
you'll ever have in your life.

96
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,600
No, just just don't even go there.

97
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,840
Don't even promote that.

98
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,740
Put it down. Put it under the table.

99
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,940
You know what we can promote?

100
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:09,640
We are going to be

101
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,540
a healthy lifestyle, a healthy lifestyle,

102
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,480
and also we're going to be making our own

103
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,380
branded swear jars.

104
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,080
That's a great idea.

105
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,620
That is a really good idea.

106
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,820
But we need to what's the best idea

107
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,620
you've had in six months.

108
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,580
It's going to be

109
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,360
they're going to be like one hundred dollars

110
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,320
because there's gonna be a hand blown or mouth blown by a glass blower.

111
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Mouth blown, yeah.

112
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,820
I think it's still hand blown.

113
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Yeah.

114
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
No.

115
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,820
No, these ones don't use their hands.

116
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,820
Yeah.

117
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,820
They do it completely with their mouth.

118
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,820
I don't think your mouth is ever involved, is it?

119
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
No.

120
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,820
You blow.

121
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,820
How are you gonna blow the glass?

122
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:38,820
I don't know.

123
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:39,820
You blow it with a straw.

124
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,820
I thought you blow it with a blower.

125
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:45,060
That's probably in the factories, but the mouth blown ones, that's like handmade.

126
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,060
But hand blown.

127
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,060
Oh my God, they're blowing.

128
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,060
Yeah.

129
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,060
They're completely blowing.

130
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,060
She's blowing that stick.

131
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,060
That's why it's called glass blowing.

132
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,060
Like there's no tomorrow.

133
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,260
like they're playing an instrument.

134
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,060
Uh-huh. They're playing the Mordor.

135
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,060
(Humming)

136
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
Whoa, what was that?

137
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
That was the window sound.

138
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,060
I thought that somebody hit like a music button.

139
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,060
No.

140
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:08,060
(Humming)

141
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,060
Bro.

142
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,060
Doesn't that sound kind of right?

143
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,060
They're blowing on that thing like Dizzy Gillespie.

144
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,060
The Year of Noswear.

145
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,060
Oh, yeah. The Year of Noswear.

146
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,060
I'm trying to think if there's a good name for it.

147
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,060
Maybe the Month of No Cuss.

148
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,140
Here's the plan. We're going to try to do a full year of no cussing,

149
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,460
or at least if you cuss, you have to pay for it.

150
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,660
So it's really got to be worth it because guys,

151
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,300
we've been doing this podcast for four years at this point.

152
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,100
And if you go back into our history,

153
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,100
we have used so many unnecessary cuss. We've used every word in the book.

154
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,100
Well, at least Patrick has.

155
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,660
Let's get like,

156
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,300
this is a one minute grace period to say all the words that we said.

157
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,860
No, I don't think so.

158
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,460
We had a four year grace period. It ends today.

159
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,900
Okay, so stop flipping around and let's get down to business.

160
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, and he didn't say biz.

161
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,600
And I didn't say biz n-i-t-c-h.

162
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,700
Yeah, he said business.

163
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,700
Because that also is skirting the rules.

164
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,200
Yeah, any kind of that we call that a half cuss. Impolite.

165
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,300
If you say a word and you have

166
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,500
impropriety in your mind and heart when you say it.

167
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,800
If you're thinking a cuss and saying a wuss,

168
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,500
you could say like, we'll call that a wuss word.

169
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,400
Yeah, like if I said, what the virtue?

170
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:22,100
I would even though the word I'm saying is virtue, you can feel behind it the word I

171
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,100
mean.

172
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,640
Yeah, you're getting pan pricks from the Holy Spirit.

173
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,640
I don't know about that.

174
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,580
And that's maybe a reduced fee, but it's still not right to do.

175
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,440
See, I have a bag here of all the coins.

176
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,660
So there's a couple things I want to establish.

177
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Let's go over ground rules.

178
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,860
Okay, here are the ground rules.

179
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,720
First of all, we will come up with a list of coins, which it can be something that evolves.

180
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,000
you open up the notes app right now get that open and then we'll just say like we won't

181
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,880
swear but we'll say the word right we'll just say like blank word okay so words we can't

182
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,680
say all right so f word f word is obvious for is not a swear f word is obvious s word

183
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,880
is obvious yep b word b word a word you don't have to type word after everyone no I think

184
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,280
he does. A word. A word is good. Well then the other S word. What's the other S word?

185
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:26,520
Well I can't say it. Wait, shh. S-H-I-T. Whoa. We're making the list. We're making the list.

186
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,040
First donation is collected. That's a penny. That's a penny. Well I already grabbed a quarter.

187
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,200
And I missed. Also, another ground rule. If you miss, it's not telling you that you didn't

188
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,720
need to pay, but you do have to try your hardest to get it in.

189
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So a word, the other S word, which again, I

190
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,840
don't know what I'm not sure what it is either. And that's

191
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,520
pretty much all the cusses that I ever learned. The F word, the

192
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,920
other F word, we'll say any racial or slur type thing. All

193
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:03,800
slurs are, and you can't say, and you can't say idiot. Yeah.

194
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, idiot. Wait, we both just

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,080
know. No, no, no. Coins are free coins.

196
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,120
That's a full dollar. There's like there is thirty dollars of coins in here.

197
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,360
You are an idiot.

198
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,960
Pay again, pay again.

199
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,280
I'm going to be broke.

200
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,600
I only have like ten bucks today.

201
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,560
OK, so we're going to establish this.

202
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
We'll add to this as you know, in other countries.

203
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,900
This is a full year.

204
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
We're not touching this for a year.

205
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,180
But I would also like to establish up top,

206
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,220
what are we going to do with this money when it's all full?

207
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,760
So at first, my idea was to bring it to

208
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,680
a homeless person.

209
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,320
Yeah. And give it to them and say, this is all the times we've

210
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
sinned this year.

211
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,960
But they're going to just spend it on drugs and alcohol.

212
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,920
They might spend it on going to a swearing show.

213
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Yeah, they might go to a swearing speakeasy.

214
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,200
Yeah.

215
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,600
What's the password? The F word?

216
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,880
Yeah. And not the F word.

217
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,880
I'm going, I won't, that's it's just going to be hard. Wow. You know what? Wow. Okay.

218
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,880
That was, that was bad. That was really, really bad one. This is going to be,

219
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,880
this is really, I think it's going to be so difficult. I'm hoping that this,

220
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:19,880
cause guys, you think that I just cussed when I'm, when the cameras were on and

221
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,880
the mics were on. When I get home, I'm saying F this, S that. Oh my God.

222
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,880
Look at my a-hole. I look at the S and TV on. I'm looking in the,

223
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:32,880
I'm looking in the, I'm pointing at the mirror and I'm saying, "F you."

224
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,880
I'm punching the mirror.

225
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,880
I'm like, and I'm making myself a delicious meal. I'm like, "I want to eat this F."

226
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
I'm showing my dog my D.

227
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Yeah.

228
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,880
I don't want to do any of that.

229
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,880
Yeah. I'm saying like, "I want to drink a D glass of water."

230
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm brushing my teeth. I'm like, "I'm brushing my D teeth."

231
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,880
I'm brushing my D.

232
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,880
I'm brushing my D with my toothbrush.

233
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I need to take an S and brush my D.

234
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
I'm going to brush my D with my S.

235
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,880
I sat down on the toilet and got some S in my mouth.

236
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,880
Oh yeah, add D word there.

237
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,880
I'm at my house, I'm going to eat my S.

238
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
I'm going to eat my own S.

239
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,880
I'm going to F my S and eat my D.

240
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm going to F a big pile of my own S.

241
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
What the heck am I doing?

242
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,880
Oh, H word.

243
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,880
But can you say H-E-C-K?

244
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Hold on, hold on.

245
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
I have to say the word because...

246
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,880
Spell it.

247
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,880
Okay.

248
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Wait, you're already doing a boner. Can't say it. Can't say B-O-N-E-R.

249
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Okay. Okay. So that's getting around the D word.

250
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,880
You can't because I get home and I'm like, I'm going to turn my D into a B.

251
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,880
I'm going to F and turn my D into a B with S.

252
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,880
What do we even say? We want to talk about. Do we have to say erection?

253
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Yes. Yeah. She gave me an erection. Or phallus.

254
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,380
phallus.

255
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,880
No, a hard phallus.

256
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,880
My phallus became erect.

257
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
We could probably say engorged phallus.

258
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
We could say any medical terms are okay.

259
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
There's blood in my phallus.

260
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Medical terms are okay, but if you're using it in a medical context, you can't be like, "Yeah, I'm going to stick my phallus in a girl."

261
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
So it's also no dirtiness.

262
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
No dirtiness.

263
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Okay, okay.

264
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Derriere. Derriere is French.

265
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
Derriere is not French.

266
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
No French.

267
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,920
butt as long as it's not too crass.

268
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,360
Yeah.

269
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,880
Okay.

270
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,120
Like I got some, you get a couple butts a day.

271
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,960
You get a couple butts.

272
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,680
You don't ever do it.

273
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,840
I got effed in my butt.

274
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,920
Yeah, definitely.

275
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,760
But you can say like, hold on to your butt.

276
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,720
You can say that before you say something crazy.

277
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,520
I got effed in my butt and some S came out.

278
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,560
Yeah, you can't say that.

279
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,760
You can't say that.

280
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Some S with some C in it came out.

281
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,920
No, we can't say that.

282
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,760
You can't say that.

283
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,760
We're saying it.

284
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,440
We're not saying no.

285
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,680
You can't say a B shot C in my butt.

286
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,920
Can I say, oh my God, my keysters full of C.

287
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,520
You can't say C.

288
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,600
Okay, okay.

289
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,640
You can't say C, but you can say sperm because that's medical.

290
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,080
But you could say like, you can say C only in a donation context.

291
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,440
You can say I got fornicated in my keister.

292
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,120
Fornicated is not that.

293
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,680
I'm such an S F.

294
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,280
I got F'd in my keister.

295
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:11,600
Yeah.

296
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,280
I can say that?

297
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,120
You can say that.

298
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,640
Okay.

299
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,360
You can say, my keister's full of sperm.

300
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
I don't think you can say any of this.

301
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Because I got F'd.

302
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
You can't say F'd.

303
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I'm a total R for C.

304
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,360
You can't say I just F'd a B.

305
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,360
I can't say I'm a total R for getting F'd in my keister.

306
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
I can't say that.

307
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
Okay.

308
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,360
I'm going to give a dollar for that.

309
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,360
That was purely crass.

310
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,360
I don't want to say that.

311
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,360
We're trying to make a change here.

312
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Speaking of addiction.

313
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,820
And then another B word.

314
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,960
What?

315
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,680
The word for breasts.

316
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,280
Oh, oh, grass, one calculator

317
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,280
words. No, no, no,

318
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:57,080
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

319
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,840
You can say hello, but you can't

320
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,760
say sine cosine plus

321
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,760
minus.

322
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,980
But yeah, calculator words.

323
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,980
We know. Yeah, we know.

324
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,920
Can we say you can't say

325
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
the OK.

326
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,840
You can say, oh,

327
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,800
my grandma has a

328
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,340
you can say my grandma's in my

329
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,560
Grandma, you can say that. You can also say my grandma has a a pussy cat.

330
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,400
Yeah. Yeah. But you can't say just the first part of that.

331
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,360
No. That word that I was you can say.

332
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
You can say my grandma has a pussy.

333
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,400
Will a pussy footing? You can say pussy footing.

334
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,640
So again, it's all it's contextual.

335
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,760
If it's in if it's in the dictionary, you can't say the first syllable

336
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,640
of contextual either. No, no, no.

337
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,840
And you can't say the first syllable of dictionary either.

338
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,360
No, especially you can't say the contextual and dictionary for.

339
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,040
So no, you can't say them together.

340
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,960
And you can't talk about how they smell when they get together.

341
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,000
You can't say my dictionary is put into some context.

342
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
Yeah, you can't. Well, no, I mean, that's actually rather intellectual.

343
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
Yeah. So also that's another.

344
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,120
Well, yeah, depends on the conversation.

345
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,000
OK, so OK, here's one thing I want to establish.

346
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,720
OK, I want to establish the.

347
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,520
My dictionary has no context.

348
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,000
I want to establish.

349
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Do we have a Huckleberry Finn rule?

350
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,520
No, no, no, no.

351
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,560
Where we can say anything if it's a quote.

352
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,360
Oh, I see.

353
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,960
That's not what I was guessing you meant by the Huckleberry Finn rule.

354
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
No, no.

355
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,760
I'm saying if you're quoting it.

356
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,160
Right, if you're popcorn reading.

357
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,760
If you're quoting somebody who says the F word.

358
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,160
If you're popcorn reading in high school.

359
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,960
And they say the B-O-N-E-R or something.

360
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,760
Can you say that?

361
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,960
I think we should still spell it.

362
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,760
I think that's the time we're allowed to spell it.

363
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,160
Okay, what if you try and circumvent the thing and you say the...

364
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,760
Don't say the middle of circumvent either.

365
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,160
Yeah.

366
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,960
What if you say B-1-er?

367
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,760
Can you say circumcise?

368
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,360
Or do you say B-1-er?

369
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
You can say circumcise.

370
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:37,960
Okay.

371
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
I'm going to be saying that a lot.

372
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
Okay.

373
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,200
(laughter)

374
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,000
And if you absolutely have to say something,

375
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,740
we do, do we still have the beep?

376
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,580
Oh yeah.

377
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,440
Yeah, so, and if you really need to sell it,

378
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,120
you could say like, so the guy said,

379
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,760
what the (beep)

380
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,600
Yeah, so like that.

381
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,420
He didn't say it though.

382
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,260
Yeah, you didn't really time it well.

383
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,160
Yeah, I didn't know what you were gonna say.

384
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,280
It's kind of impossible for me to tell what you're gonna say.

385
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,120
Well, I said,

386
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,400
You said, and the guy said,

387
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm just gonna press,

388
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm gonna try to react in time.

389
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,960
What the (beep)

390
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,800
Okay, you suck at this.

391
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,360
It's difficult. Whoa.

392
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,200
No, I said this.

393
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,040
That was really mean too.

394
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,860
Can we say, yeah, okay, also--

395
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,260
know how I can't read your mind.

396
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,580
It's a swear plus mean jar.

397
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,980
Meanness also does.

398
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:15,980
Yeah, meanness is a swear.

399
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,980
OK, so being mean is a swear.

400
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,540
So I haven't doubted I have a three

401
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,680
dollar budget for the rest of this

402
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,660
episode. Otherwise, I'm going to

403
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,980
serve in mowing the jar.

404
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,900
Right. That's why I got the coins.

405
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,900
But that's not my money.

406
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,280
That's also that's cheating.

407
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,180
You're cheating.

408
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
It's not cheating.

409
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,780
It's a dollar or more.

410
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,380
Other in every other country

411
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,440
in the world, the coin is respected

412
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,460
in Canada, in England.

413
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,420
They don't respect the coin in

414
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,420
Canada. They call them loonies. They call them loonies because it's a loose one.

415
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,620
That's where it comes from. That's where it's derived.

416
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,220
And you know what they call them in? They call them disgusting things in the United

417
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,720
Kingdom. What do they call them?

418
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,220
They call them... Why don't you just... Well, I can't even say it because it's so

419
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,520
disgusting. Yeah, but you can hit the censor.

420
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,120
So just what do they call that in the UK?

421
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,820
Todgers.

422
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,320
He didn't hit the censor button. I was never going to hit the censor.

423
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
You have to donate that money.

424
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
So I have two dollars left.

425
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
And we have stuff coming up that is just gonna definitely

426
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
I'm gonna accidentally curse during.

427
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
So that's really sad. I can give you a loan.

428
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
Okay.

429
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
If I run out of money,

430
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
I will ask for a loan.

431
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
With a lot of interest.

432
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,320
I think that this list is good for now.

433
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
I don't need, that's cheating

434
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
and you should come with dollars next time.

435
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
No, it's not cheating. They respect the coin

436
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
in other countries. We're not in other countries.

437
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,840
And we have all, they also say all this stuff in other countries.

438
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,340
Well, do you like the bag it came in?

439
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,000
The what it came in?

440
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,800
Or the what?

441
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,380
The bag.

442
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,360
The what came in?

443
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,120
The what came in?

444
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,920
The baggin.

445
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,100
Came in.

446
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,860
Okay.

447
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,800
Well, yeah, it sounded like.

448
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,760
What are you, what are you saying that I said?

449
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,280
It sounded like the other F word.

450
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,320
No, a French word.

451
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,520
We said no French words.

452
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,440
Oh, baguette.

453
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,040
Oh, oh my God.

454
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,920
And he said it again.

455
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,000
He said it just three times, by the way.

456
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,800
That, hold on.

457
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,320
French.

458
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,160
I have to pay.

459
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,700
Yeah.

460
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,240
You have to pay whatever the equal amount is in euros.

461
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,480
Do they use euros in francs?

462
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,480
No, they use francs.

463
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
That's a dollar.

464
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
No, they use euros.

465
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
And that's a French word.

466
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
What?

467
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
Francs.

468
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
Fuck.

469
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,480
No, I'm not.

470
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
No, no, no, no, no, no.

471
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
That's not.

472
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Dude, the sound of the coin.

473
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,480
He's turning the mic into the coin.

474
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,480
You forgot to set the F word.

475
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
You set the F word.

476
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,480
I know.

477
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I'm putting more.

478
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,480
There we go.

479
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,480
And you're done.

480
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
That was a dollar something.

481
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
I don't even know.

482
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Speaking of awful things that happened in this world, last night, I'm at a birthday party

483
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,560
awful things that happened in this world last night. I'm at a birthday party, okay? And

484
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:43,920
I am at a birthday party at a bar in Manhattan and someone comes up to me and they say, "Batman's

485
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,280
here." And I go, "What do you mean Batman's here?" They say, "Robert Pattinson is in this

486
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:54,400
bar right now." Whoa. And I walk over to the bar and sure, this place is called Ear Inn.

487
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:03,840
Sure as hell, ordering at the bar, sure as anything, ordering at the bar is none other

488
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:13,020
but the safty prince himself, Robert Pattinson. And I really wanted to spill a Bloody Mary

489
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:15,640
on him or something, but they were too expensive at the bar.

490
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,960
So anyway, we leave kind of early, and I have to pee at the bar, but there's a line, so

491
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,320
I walk, I'm like, I'm just going to go pee on my car because I parked down there.

492
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,360
And I start peeing on my car and, um,

493
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,080
I look to the left and a woman falls into the street and a guy like starts

494
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,400
walking away. And so I have like my penis in my hand.

495
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,040
Can I say that if it's the story? Yeah. Yeah. It's medical. Penis is medical.

496
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,840
Yeah. So I'm peeing on my car out of my penis and a woman gets knockout

497
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,080
gamed like 20 feet from me. And I'm like, what the heck's going on?

498
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,240
So I, a guy, a guy is like walking away and he's like got a mask that covers his face.

499
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,240
Batman.

500
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,400
And she's saying awful, she's saying awful cuss words.

501
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,720
So really she kind of deserves it.

502
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,440
But she's cursing at him.

503
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,200
And I start cursing because I kind of get into it.

504
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,920
I say, "What the F is wrong with you?

505
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,240
You are, you crazy are, effer."

506
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
And he's like, he just goes like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

507
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,760
And then I started like walking towards him to like try to approach him.

508
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,120
And then he starts, he just bolts.

509
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
He just like runs away.

510
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
The flash.

511
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
And I walk over to the lady.

512
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,400
Yeah, walk over to the lady.

513
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:24,360
And her jaw is broken. Like her face is like this big and she's this British lady and she's

514
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:32,040
like that fella just knocked me loony. Or she said something along those lines.

515
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:37,600
And then I get in the car and we start leaving. I'm like, gosh, that was so awful. It really

516
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,560
put me in a horrible mood. I was like, that is so awful that we live in a place where

517
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,720
that kind of thing happens. That is so awful. And there's nothing I can do because I didn't

518
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,620
know if the guy had a knife, you know, or I don't know.

519
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:54,740
So then we start driving, I'm like, "Man, if only there had been somebody, somebody fearless,

520
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:00,480
some vigilante who was fearless enough to stop him." But he was at the bar!

521
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,500
I thought that that story was going to end that you walked up to the woman with your

522
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,460
penis out of your zipper.

523
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:10,140
No, no! Batman did nothing. He was too busy drinking, by the way.

524
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,140
Well, do you know why?

525
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,140
Why?

526
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,100
You didn't set the bat signal off.

527
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,100
Yeah, you...

528
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
I wasn't going to know.

529
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,600
I have to sign it into the window.

530
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,800
The box away, dude, he was to have your phone up in the bar with the

531
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,400
bat with a bat low bat, the Batman symbol on Google images.

532
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,300
Just like the one night.

533
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,500
I thought nothing like this.

534
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,300
Nothing bad will happen.

535
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,100
You're saying you thought you were saying within 60 feet of Batman.

536
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,800
Yeah, and this woman gets completely Batman attracts trouble destroy.

537
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,300
It happens.

538
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,600
Every goes his road.

539
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,000
Skyler.

540
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,400
He follows your fault for going into Gotham.

541
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,800
This guy.

542
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,600
Well, I wasn't Gotham.

543
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,900
This guy was definitely a Batman villain type.

544
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
Like just like did he go?

545
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,940
Kind of well, no more like henchmen like he's sitting around

546
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,740
Yeah, wait did he go like

547
00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:01,300
It was not a baby no, but he was sitting around doing kind of like, uh, you know in all the batman games

548
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:06,580
They're always talking about batman when you're walking around. Yeah the bat you hear about this bat walking around

549
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:10,820
It was like that kind of guy. He was definitely a henchman. He was not an evil. He was not tiny

550
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,940
little tiny fisherman hat. Yeah, little fisherman hat. He's like all striped shirt. Yeah, the same

551
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,580
exact body type is the next 12 guys that you see. Yeah, just like different face, maybe or different

552
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,180
hair. Uh huh. Yeah. If that happened to me, if I saw that I would have gone home that night and

553
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,900
like, got all my clothes together, got my sewing machine, I would have made my super suit.

554
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:35,780
I honestly, it was for me a little bit of a maybe I become a vigilante or yeah,

555
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:40,780
I would have become, I can't be the Jubio's the love bug.

556
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Yeah, I didn't want to reveal this until I was ready, but I'll reveal it now really quick.

557
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Yeah, I've been planning. I'm going to draw a love bug comic book.

558
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,780
That's adorable. I'm going to publish it.

559
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,780
That's really sweet. I think I will become a vigilante.

560
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,780
You have no idea the excitement that just washed over.

561
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,780
Yeah, that is exciting.

562
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:01,780
I'm like, I want to curse because I want to say holy F.

563
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,780
Yeah, well,

564
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,780
That is effing amazing.

565
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:05,320
That is effing amazing.

566
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
You can say it's holy cow.

567
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Holy cow.

568
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,320
That is flipping amazing.

569
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,060
Do you think there's room in New York for a vigilante who dresses up like an orthodox

570
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,060
acidic guy?

571
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,060
And that's like my super suit?

572
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,060
Yeah.

573
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,060
Right?

574
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,060
Well, yeah, because I mean it's the most...

575
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,020
Is that it's like you escape and you're doing like Naruto, like shadow jutsu.

576
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,020
Yeah, exactly.

577
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,020
Yeah, I'm just blending in perfectly.

578
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,020
Where is he?

579
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Yeah.

580
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,260
People are like, oh my God, he's like a drop of water, like tears in the rain.

581
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,740
See, my thing, I think if you're just going to like, like, try to be a vigilante in New

582
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:39,300
York, like you're going, you're going to Haseed, I'd probably be eight ball jacket guy or like,

583
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:41,100
Oh yeah, that's NYPD officer.

584
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,100
NYPD officer.

585
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
That's good.

586
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,100
No, I think you'd get caught as an NYPD officer.

587
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,700
I'd probably, I'd be a guy caught as NYPD officer, but eight ball jacket guy.

588
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
NYPD.

589
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,740
I would be a different cop star here.

590
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,540
It's funny that cops here are all just like fat pieces of shit.

591
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,540
North Carolina. Oh, my God.

592
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,040
Bro.

593
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,540
Okay, I have one dollar.

594
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,540
Fat tubs of lard.

595
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Try that next time.

596
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
They're lazy bones, I'll say that.

597
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
They're lazy bones.

598
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
They're lazy bones.

599
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,540
They're do-nothings.

600
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,540
They're lazy bones who do nothing, and they all have like,

601
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,540
you just see them sitting around eating lunch all the time.

602
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,540
In North Carolina, they are all military guys.

603
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,540
Yeah, when we were in North Carolina after you left,

604
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:29,540
We were going out to a bar with Noah and Pierce one night,

605
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,740
and we walked down the street in downtown Wilmington,

606
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,940
and literally 10 cop cars pulled up on the street

607
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,040
because someone was being loudly drunk.

608
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,240
And they were all the way down the street.

609
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,040
They were cuffing somebody.

610
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,440
There was a girlfriend who was there.

611
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,940
It was like, "What the F-U-C-K are you doing?"

612
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,140
She's like, "Do you feel good about what you do?"

613
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,940
Pulling that whole thing out.

614
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,460
And she's a crazy and it was literally it was like 10 G.I.

615
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,780
Joe's. Yeah, just one saying my hometown.

616
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:04,900
So the airport was like on the border of it was like Manchester Airport

617
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,820
and then Londonderry like the airport was there.

618
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:11,300
So my my hometown needed a SWAT team. Yeah.

619
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,100
But I mean, you've seen how small Londonderry is.

620
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,500
There's no reason for them to have a SWAT team.

621
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,340
So all the maybe for the flies. That's right. Yeah.

622
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,500
Hold on.

623
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,420
Yeah, maybe for the flies around the horses bottoms hit that which one which one fine boo. Say it again

624
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,980
Wait, maybe for the flies around the horses bottoms

625
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,100
Yeah, yeah, that's good

626
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,820
But yeah

627
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:41,200
They had like all the cops had like they were so insanely overpaid and then every year they would get new

628
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,100
Cars and stuff careful now Patrick because we do have added to the list here at the bottom. This is a cop rhetoric

629
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
cop rhetoric.

630
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:53,580
No, no, no, no. It's not anti-cop. Most of the town's budget went to the police.

631
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,580
The cops in my hometown were noble and they educated kids about drugs and elementary school.

632
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,580
I'm talking about their steeds.

633
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,300
You think the DARE program.

634
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,460
I'm talking about every year the cops got the Noble Knights of Londonderry got new steeds.

635
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,460
Really?

636
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,460
Yes.

637
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,460
They had steeds?

638
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,660
They had steeds, which were Toyota or Dodge Challengers.

639
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,660
No, that's not a steed.

640
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
That's barely a steed.

641
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,540
They were Dodge Challengers. You don't think the Dodge Challengers is a steed?

642
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,540
Is it donkey?

643
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,620
I challenge the idea that that's a steed.

644
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,900
Can we say A.S.S. in reference to a donkey?

645
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,900
Yes.

646
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,020
I think so.

647
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
But only in reference to a donkey.

648
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:28,500
But honestly, I'd rather you use mayor.

649
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,100
Or if it's an acronym for something.

650
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Mayor.

651
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
Mayor is good.

652
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,900
The battered mayor, like Skyrim thing, the bar.

653
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,300
I'd say in that sense.

654
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,580
Can we reference video games?

655
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,580
No.

656
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,980
No, I don't think so.

657
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,540
That's not so right.

658
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
You can't reference--

659
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
What about Noah's Ark?

660
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
Not an M-rated video game.

661
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:48,340
Okay, no M-rated video games, no R-rated movies.

662
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:48,840
Yeah.

663
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,540
And nothing that has an explicit sticker on it, music-wise.

664
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,940
So, not even... So, no T, no rated T.

665
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,440
So, E10.

666
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,540
T is fine. I think that this podcast is generally T.

667
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,140
Yeah.

668
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,040
PG-13. We're somewhere in between PG and PG-13.

669
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,340
We're like PG-11.

670
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,340
We're like a hard PG.

671
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:06,840
E10.

672
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,340
Yeah.

673
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:07,840
E10.

674
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,040
E10+.

675
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,540
Yeah.

676
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,040
E10+.

677
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,640
But I always like to say PG-11.

678
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,140
Okay.

679
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:15,340
Because 10-year-olds might even be a little too young for some of this stuff.

680
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,880
- Parts two of podcasts.

681
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:20,460
- Guys, tonight is my bachelor party.

682
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:21,300

00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,820
- That's right, we're bringing the jar.

685
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,220
- Yep. And we're going to get all the P, P,

686
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,900
P shaped gummies, P shaped lollipops,

687
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,100
and P shaped straws.

688
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,940
- And we're going to get,

689
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,760
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

690
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,600
- We're going to get a,

691
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,860
- We're getting totally clothes off.

692
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,540
- We're going to get a sex worker.

693
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,540
- We're going to get a sex worker, a shaker, a hole,

694
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,860
right in front of our faces and we get to smell it.

695
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,860
we can put the coins in there.

696
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,860
We're going to tell her to not W before she comes.

697
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,860
Uh-huh.

698
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,860
And we're going to smell her A.

699
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,860
(laughter)

700
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Wait, what's W?

701
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Wipe.

702
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,860
That's not a swear.

703
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,860
Yeah, but in that context you were right to say it.

704
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
In that context it's nasty.

705
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,860
In that, I guess.

706
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Yeah.

707
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,860
I had to W so many times this morning.

708
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Really?

709
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:10,860
I hate it when you have to W like your A a million times.

710
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
My butt.

711
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:14,020
- Okay, so you're here, you don't have to say A.

712
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,860
You don't have to say A.

713
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:15,680
- You can say butt.

714
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,520
- You can say butt.

715
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,360
- Yeah.

716
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,180
- So you're just A or your tush.

717
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,020
- Okay, you're gonna have to W, I have to W my tush.

718
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,940
(laughing)

719
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,700
I have to W my tush so many times.

720
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,100
- My tush was so messy this morning.

721
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,940
- Really?

722
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,380
- Yeah, I literally was making ice cream out of it.

723
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,220
- Oh my God.

724
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,040
- Yeah.

725
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,880
- And then you W.

726
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,500
- This is nasty, this is getting in a nasty territory.

727
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,980
- Ice cream's good.

728
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,380
- That is good, you're right.

729
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,220
I actually do like ice cream.

730
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,380
- That's very, not very so.

731
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,740
- That's probably the most wholesome.

732
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:43,500
It's the goal of this is to have a healthy lifestyle.

733
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,380
Would you agree?

734
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:44,940
Yeah.

735
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,900
To stop being...

736
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,260
What?

737
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,900
Cause I feel like we're kind of losing sight a little bit because I am saying

738
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,900
some stuff that could be construed as a little, um, anatomical.

739
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:53,580
Yes.

740
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,260
I think it's more that you're talking about this stuff because no

741
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,780
one else has talked about it.

742
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,580
But it's also toilet humor.

743
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,420
It's not toilet humor because when, when you change, when you shift the lens,

744
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,460
what do we joke about?

745
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,620
It's not humorous.

746
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,460
What do we say?

747
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,340
It's not humorous.

748
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,420
It's the news.

749
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,420
But then that's divisive.

750
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Oh yeah, here's some news that he had to W his A.

751
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:16,100
Let's talk about the news that, uh, so the exciting news that you broke to us right before

752
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
we started recording.

753
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Oh.

754
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Which is?

755
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
Millie Bobby Brown.

756
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,100
Oh yeah.

757
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
Is now engaged.

758
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
Patrick was so excited about this.

759
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,100
This is exciting.

760
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,160
And we said we're gonna cover it on the show, we haven't yet.

761
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,660
Because as a Bon Jovi fan.

762
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,860
Millie Bobby Bon Jovi.

763
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,420
As a Bon Jovi fan, I'm excited.

764
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,540
I like that.

765
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,540
That's like a Civil War name.

766
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,220
There's a new member of the Bon Jovi family.

767
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,220
This is New Jersey royalty.

768
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Millie Bobby Bon Jovi.

769
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Oh my God!

770
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,220
That's right, that's what I said when I heard that the first time.

771
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Millie Bobby Bon Jovi.

772
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,220
Oh my God!

773
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,220
Oh my God! Wait, is that Lord's name in vain?

774
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,220
No, I don't think we have that on there.

775
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:53,220
We'll do, okay, we, even though

776
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,220
because we have a mixed... We should try to say gosh, but...

777
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,220
Because we have a mixed religious background

778
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,220
for all three of us, I think that we

779
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
do unfortunately, it does have to be a secular

780
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,220
rule set for these words.

781
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,220
Definitely. Which I mean, you know...

782
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,220
If you want to personally not say G-O-D like me,

783
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,940
then that's fine.

784
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,140
- For me it's more like if I take,

785
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,020
'cause I follow Shintoism,

786
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,040
so if you take maybe the spirit of a tree in vain,

787
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,300
you say something kind of nasty or you invoke a rock.

788
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,380
- Yeah, be careful there,

789
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,100
don't slur your words saying Shinto.

790
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,180
- True.

791
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,140
- Oh true, yeah.

792
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,180
See my brain, honestly, I'm so like locked in here

793
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,620
that I didn't even consider that could be--

794
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,260
- I kind of completely forgot what I was saying.

795
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,740
- My religion is--

796
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,580
- Dalai Lamaism.

797
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,100
Church of Bill Hicks. Really? Which I'm pulling back a lot.

798
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Yeah, I can't believe that you're so... That's why I brought so many coins.

799
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,500
Because I know I'm going to slip up. I thought that I'd slip up more. He's the one. He's the

800
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:53,580
Catholic one. He's sitting here. Christian, sorry. Yeah, I'm not Catholic. Catholics are

801
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:59,180
actually going to H-E-double hockey. He's sitting here. He's swearing like a f-ing sailor.

802
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:05,420
Okay, so again, that's against the rules. Not really, right? You could say like an ever-loving

803
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
Ever-loving.

804
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,420
Ever-loving sailor.

805
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
He's swearing like a flippin' sailor.

806
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Guys, let's talk about this Dalai Lama situation.

807
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
So I wanted to go out and just put a message out here.

808
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,420
It's the thing I said this to you guys before.

809
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,420
I just want to do it on the podcast, kind of get this out of the way.

810
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,420
Dalai Lama, we saw the news.

811
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
We saw what you did.

812
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,420
You hugged a child.

813
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,420
You said, "Want to suck my tongue?"

814
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,420
And pal, I'm going to give it to you straight.

815
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,420
S your T.

816
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,420
That is...

817
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:30,420
S my T, he said.

818
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,420
As you said, "Do you want to S my T?"

819
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,420
Yeah, which is crazy.

820
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:40,420
To a child, a young boy, who was literally, the Dalai Lama was that young boy's idol, most likely.

821
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:46,420
And here he is asking him to SST. But Dalai Lama, you got one more chance, buddy.

822
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,420
Actually, you know what, we'll say this.

823
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,420
We'll give you two more chances.

824
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
That was strike one.

825
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,420
That was strike one.

826
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,420
Strike one.

827
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
Two more strikes and you are out!

828
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,420
Two more strikes and you better not mess this up.

829
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,420
He's got two strikes, because all that stuff he was saying about Tibet.

830
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Tibet. What do you mean? Oh, that's fine. What do you mean? He has one strike, okay?

831
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,660
Because he told a little baby that S is T. You have one strike and one ball. Yeah. You

832
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,860
have one strike and one ball. I guess, yeah, the Tibet stuff is a ball. Well, that's good

833
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:18,220
for him, right? Yeah. Because the ball is for him being a spiritual leader and a wall.

834
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:26,460
Why do people want to free Tibet? Because China made it crazy or something. Oh, then

835
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,340
And yeah, then he has two strikes.

836
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
No he has one strike.

837
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,660
He has two strikes for talking.

838
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,820
Pelt, asking a child to s your t is a strike.

839
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,180
No he's to bet.

840
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,660
He thinks to bet is dope.

841
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,140
Because he's the ruler of it.

842
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:44,020
I bet he's trying to take that child to bet.

843
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,260
You're making a joke about a pedophile.

844
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Pedophilic.

845
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,100
Well I wouldn't go that far.

846
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,100
I wouldn't go that far.

847
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,300
Because I would say if you get to three strikes I'm definitely going to call you that word.

848
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,340
But until then, we're just going to call you. You're going to say you made a mistake.

849
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,000
Yeah, we're going to say you were very...

850
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,740
We made a very public mistake.

851
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,240
By the way, not all those who wonder are lost.

852
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,740
Can you hit like a clap?

853
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,740
Yeah. Can I get an applause? But not all those who wonder are lost. So thank you very much.

854
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:18,540
Yeah. I mean, and that's true. I really believe that. So, Mr. Dalai Lama, I just want to say

855
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:22,300
there is always room for you in the loving arms of Jesus Christ.

856
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,300
Fatality.

857
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:29,740
First of all, grow your hair out because I do not like that bald shit. It does not look

858
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,740
good on you.

859
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,100
What the H-E-double-hockey-dick-s-r-e-u-s-d-o-i-n, man?

860
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,500
I need a dollar. I ran out of money. I'm a cusser today.

861
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:43,980
Just here. That's why I brought the coins. Here's three dollars.

862
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:52,020
I'll give you these later. That's going to be a dollar for me. You need to convert.

863
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,360
Gosh dang it, it's hard.

864
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,660
And try changing up your fit every once in a while.

865
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,120
Yeah. Hey, by the way, you don't live in a cartoon, Dalai Lama.

866
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,160
You don't get to wear the same shit every...

867
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,500
Did you just get out of the shower?

868
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,800
Why are you wearing that?

869
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,000
You know what?

870
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,860
I can't stop saying yes.

871
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:11,400
The Dalai Lama, you dress like a llama that was generated in Dali.

872
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,100
I think it's...

873
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,400
Fatality.

874
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,840
Yeah, that's right. That was fire.

875
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,640
Gosh, it's so hard to cuss, man.

876
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,140
Hard to not.

877
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,180
It's hard to not cuss.

878
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,580
It is hard for me to cuss.

879
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,080
I brought this. I'm having an amazing time not cussing.

880
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,240
But what do you guys think about shaking the challenge to the next level?

881
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,780
Let's do it.

882
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,580
Shaking the challenge?

883
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,440
How do we shake the challenge to the next level?

884
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,140
That's right.

885
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:38,640
No, but how? You have to explain how.

886
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,280
Yeah.

887
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,140
We're going to do a very exciting special challenge.

888
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,040
OK.

889
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,180
Talent show.

890
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,740
A talent. And this is something that I developed.

891
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,680
OK.

892
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,920
that I thought that we could do

893
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,040
that nobody has ever attempted before

894
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,880
in the history of podcasting or even the world.

895
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,220
- I think you're probably right.

896
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,940
- This is a challenge that's called

897
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,000
the five fingers of music.

898
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,120
- Wait.

899
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,200
The five fingers of music?

900
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,240
- The five fingers of music, that's right.

901
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,880
Five beats, 50 minutes.

902
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,400
- Okay, and what do we do with these beats?

903
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,240
- No cussing.

904
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,360
- No cussing?

905
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,080
- Freestyle.

906
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:16,900
- Freestyle.

907
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,740
the top off the dome off of the

908
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,780
ever loving dome.

909
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,300
Excuse me real quick.

910
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,260
Excuse me real quick because of the

911
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:28,260
I guess in that context, but the word

912
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:30,580
dome. Yeah, I was going to ask about

913
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,900
that. It's kind of euphemistic.

914
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,820
Yeah, it is a little bit euphemistic

915
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,980
off the but it means but this

916
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:40,300
whoa, that's that's that's way worse

917
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,460
than saying that's way worse.

918
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:45,220
That is 50 cents.

919
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,180
Whatever, man.

920
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,180
You can act out anything.

921
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,180
And here's another for your flippant attitude.

922
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:54,180
You see my flippant attitude or my flippant attitude?

923
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:56,180
Flippant.

924
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,180
Oh, okay. I was being flippant.

925
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,180
You were being really flippant.

926
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,180
Speaking of flip, how about you flip that beat on and let's do this dang thing.

927
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,180
Okay, hold on.

928
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:10,180
Wow.

929
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:12,180
Okay, show me one of these fingers.

930
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:14,180

Yes I have.

937
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
Okay so when he does sway in the morning with a rapper,

938
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
each beat is called a finger. He does five fingers.

939
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
But they don't tell them to F him.

940
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
Finger me dog.

941
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100

Finger me. My headphones just got turned crazy.

946
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
But it's all okay.

947
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Everything did just get a little bit louder.

948
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100

00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,380
Okay, show me a finger.

Okay, that's fine.

Don't finger me.

00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
You can't even say it.

961
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,380
Don't F me.

962
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,380

963
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,380

966
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
Here's the first F.

967
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,380
We'll call it the five F's of music.

968
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,380
Damn. Wait, this F is amazing.

969
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,380
You said D.

970
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,380
You did say D.

971
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,380
Crack.

972
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,380
Crack. Crash.

973
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Oh, crash.

974
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,380
Alright, what's my word? I gotta go off a word.

975
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,380
You have to go off a word? Yeah.

976
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,380
Coins. Coins.

977
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,380
Oh, I got so many coins.

978
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,380
I rap so good, you feel it in your loins.

979
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,380
I look like a loian from the zoo.

980
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Cameron, it smells like poo.

981
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:41,100
I was like, "Pooh, I can't say P-O-O, but I don't care because I am so good at rapping

982
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,540
in a clean way.

983
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:46,460
Cameron and Patrick are dead.

984
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,040
Like happy.

985
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,220
And I can't say C-R-A-P-P-Y."

986
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,220
Dang, this is hard actually.

987
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,540
I realize how many cusses rhyme together.

988
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,540
And this come into your head immediately, as soon as you think about rap music.

989
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
This is really teaching me how sick I am.

990
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,540
Usually when you think about rap music, you think about cusses.

991
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,540
Let me show you how it's done.

992
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:03,660
Show me how it's done.

993
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,980
I went to the baseball game and I saw the game.

994
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
I saw the game.

995
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
You went to the baseball game and saw the game?

996
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,980
It's supposed to be rap.

997
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:17,860
I went to the baseball game and I saw the game.

998
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:22,660
I watched all the baseball game and I thought it was the Flames.

999
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:24,300
My team is the Flames.

1000
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,300
The Florida Flames.

1001
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,620
That's my favorite team and I love their name.

1002
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:33,500
Me and Cameron and Patrick are going to the store today to get some more Flames.

1003
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,100
Because we like flames and Patrick and Cameron and Caleb is our names and we're three friends

1004
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,180
and we don't play video games anymore.

1005
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,180
Because they're bad.

1006
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:46,460
Even if we shut the door, we don't play them privately.

1007
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,160
They're demonic and no we don't smoke chronic.

1008
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,940
We don't drink any gin and tonics.

1009
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,720
And we still don't play Sonic.

1010
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,820
We don't like Sonic but we like um...

1011
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,020
Sonic the restaurant.

1012
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:02,020
What can we even like?

1013
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,020
And health.

1014
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,460
And we like investing in ourselves.

1015
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:08,300
And Sonic the restaurant is a treat on weekends.

1016
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:08,740
Yeah.

1017
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,940
I go there, I get.

1018
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:16,660
I get freaking milkshakes and french fries and burgers and hot dogs.

1019
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:16,980
Yeah.

1020
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,340
Yeah.

1021
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,700
Well, what was that one?

1022
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,620
I don't even know what that's from.

1023
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,020
That was cool, though.

1024
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,980
That's part of the finger.

1025
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,860
The F.

1026
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,940
You said finger.

1027
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,420
Okay.

1028
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,240
Yeah.

1029
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,880
(laughing)

1030
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,620
- I don't like the bing bong bong.

1031
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,880
(laughing)

1032
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,720
- What?

1033
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,560
- What's so funny?

1034
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,720
(laughing)

1035
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,320
- No, I don't like that.

1036
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,160
Okay, I like that.

1037
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,000
- I like this one.

1038
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,000
- We need topics, we need clean topics.

1039
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,840
- What about this one?

1040
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,440
Yeah, we need some topics.

1041
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:54,340
(laughing)

1042
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,760
- Topical topics.

1043
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,400
- We're using the swear jar

1044
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,880
and we like to drive a really slow car

1045
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,640
Cause we don't like to speed

1046
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,040
Cause we don't need to get anywhere fast neat

1047
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,360
I moved the word need to the end

1048
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,520
Cause I couldn't figure out a rap fast enough

1049
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:12,160
And I just have to move the word to the end

1050
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,640
And then I'll type a message and press send

1051
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,200
Text is speed, not for me

1052
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,520
All I need is some good ass speed

1053
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,660
Whoa!

1054
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:23,200
Wait, drop a bomb

1055
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,640
Drop a bomb right now

1056
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,440
Wait, wait

1057
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:33,400
He just said, good a double marijuana.

1058
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,520
Double. He just mentioned Merrill. That's a buddy.

1059
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:41,160
The D's lettuce. Have you ever seen this on a, on a game? That's T T or M.

1060
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:45,360
Yeah. Rated for drug references. Press the bomb.

1061
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,080
Have seen it. Tony Hawk. Yeah. Drug references. So you just referenced,

1062
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,760
you just referenced drugs. Uh huh. You referenced drugs. That's not okay.

1063
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,440
Okay. That's I guess. Yes, we are doing it. Um,

1064
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:04,080
secular. Yeah. But as I stated before, Church of Bill Hicks, it is part of my religion.

1065
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,380
So you're saying you need to make a religious exemption.

1066
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,680
It is a religious exemption for me to say that I love smoking cigarettes and drinking beer.

1067
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,280
Cigarettes is different.

1068
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,480
Cigarettes and weed is actually now legal.

1069
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,980
Give me a finger. Give me a finger.

1070
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:19,380
Okay. You want a new finger?

1071
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,780
Finger me. Newly.

1072
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:25,080
You... I cannot even believe your behavior today.

1073
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,480
Okay. Finger me. Give me a slow one.

1074
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,280
- I said, "Wait, hold on, we stopped the beat.

1075
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,820
"We stopped the beat for me."

1076
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,920
His attitude.

1077
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,400
- Here, I'm just gonna go back into the first F

1078
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,120
for a second and we'll go.

1079
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,080
I put these in order.

1080
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,140
I spent a lot of time, almost 30 minutes,

1081
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,640
making all five of these Fs.

1082
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,460
And I don't remember which one is which,

1083
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,720
so we're just gonna go through them in order.

1084
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:47,120
And if the next one isn't slow, there's nothing I can do.

1085
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,960
- That's fine.

1086
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,840
You can finger me whatever speed.

1087
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,240
- Hey. - Enough of this.

1088
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,760
- Okay, whatever. - You can't swear

1089
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,080
or you're gonna get eaten by a bear.

1090
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,460
- Dang. - When you swear,

1091
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,960
It makes me feel bad.

1092
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,560
I got sweared at by my dad when I was a kid.

1093
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,560
Yeah, well, that's referencing child abuse.

1094
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,260
That's not referencing child abuse.

1095
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
It's referencing swearing.

1096
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,060
What do you think of this?

1097
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:09,660
Patrick from the church of Bill Hicks.

1098
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,760
Wait, I can't even hear anything.

1099
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,260
Okay.

1100
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:16,560
Patrick's from the church of Bill Hicks.

1101
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,860
He died from smoking cancer sticks.

1102
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,260
Yeah.

1103
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,960
Wow.

1104
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,460
That was pretty good.

1105
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,560
Step of the beat.

1106
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,860
You are making fun of what in my religion would be your Jesus Christ.

1107
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:35,260
And look right here on the list.

1108
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:40,060
Bill Hicks is Alex Jones. That's a rumor. He died from a big brain tumor.

1109
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:44,060
I think we have no religious stuff in the list.

1110
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,340
He's not a major religion.

1111
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,840
a major religion but you shouldn't disagree. I think the thing that makes this country

1112
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:56,180
great is the freedom of expression. He just said make this country great. He's a MAGA.

1113
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:03,180
Hey Patrick, this is what I think about Bill Hicks. I think you should go eat a bag of

1114
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,900
potato sticks. Or you could bleep yourself too. This is way too much for me. I can't

1115
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,300
also be bleeping. A bag of potato sticks actually tastes pretty good. So that's what I was trying

1116
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,300
to say. I wasn't dissing him. I'm trying to diss him. Why would I need to censor potato

1117
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,940
Also, the no dissing.

1118
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:24,700
Wait, OK, so we're supposed to do rapping with no dissing and also we do a radio show.

1119
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:30,180
Hey, Patrick, you can't rap without dissing and making others and punching down.

1120
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,660
If you can't rap without punching down, buddy, you here's OK, here's a store

1121
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:37,540
core, which is like the most PG rapping ever.

1122
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:41,620
Hey, Patrick, I heard that you follow Hicks Bill.

1123
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,660
Yeah, I heard it on the rumor mill.

1124
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,460
Wow.

1125
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,220
What do you think of that?

1126
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,060
I can't tell if that's a diss.

1127
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1128
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,420
I heard that you got a Bill Hicks need.

1129
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,580
I, Herman, on the rumor weed.

1130
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,860
Oh, from VeggieTales.

1131
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,220
Oh, yeah.

1132
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,980
I heard that you think Bill Hicks is...

1133
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,100
Larry, Bob, and the cucumber, his nephew, who is an asparagus.

1134
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:03,340
Yeah.

1135
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,420
They go on a lot of adventurous.

1136
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:12,300
And they go and they go to the wall of Jericho and they go on and on and on and on.

1137
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:12,620
Yeah.

1138
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,700
It's a show called VeggieTales.

1139
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,160
and when it's entertainment, it never fails.

1140
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,740
I'll watch every single episode.

1141
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,880
I'll never turn off my T-Vode.

1142
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:22,240
Yeah.

1143
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,920
Cedric the Entertainer and Steve Harvey and Bernie Mac and DL Hughley.

1144
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,420
You're not even rhyming.

1145
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,420
They're all the kings of comedy.

1146
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,300
Hughley rhymes with comedy.

1147
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,220
No it doesn't.

1148
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,180
Hugh, well, OK, Hughley, comedy.

1149
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,880
It's not Hughley.

1150
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,260
All right.

1151
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,220
I think I think we're going to move to the next step.

1152
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,180
Let's get to the next step.

1153
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:41,980
Give me a finger.

1154
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,720
All right.

1155
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:43,560
Hold on. I have to stop this.

1156
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,060
Last one.

1157
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:50,020
That's right. That's how you end all of them. Yeah. All right. You guys ready for the next

1158
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:53,780
one? I am. All right, here it is. I don't remember what it is.

1159
00:43:53,780 --> 00:44:04,380
Wait, this is actually good. Damn. Okay. Switch it up. Hold on. Hold on. Switch it up. Stop

1160
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:11,980
the beat. Stop it. Again. Why do I have to keep stopping it? You start every single F

1161
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,980
with a D.

1162
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:14,300
Oh, did I say D?

1163
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:15,500
You said D.

1164
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:17,340
Did I say D?

1165
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,420
I don't remember, but I believe

1166
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:19,740
that.

1167
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:20,880
Julio, can you run that back?

1168
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:21,900
We can't run that back.

1169
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:22,940
It's un-run backable.

1170
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,260
Did you hear me say a D, though?

1171
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:26,260
He said a D.

1172
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,140
I don't know. I'll trust Patrick,

1173
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:28,460
though.

1174
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,620
OK, whatever. I'll put some of

1175
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:30,860
Patrick's money in the swear jar

1176
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,740
because he's so worried about it.

1177
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:32,740
Are you guys ready?

1178
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,420
For F number two?

1179
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,540
I can say prickly pear. I can call

1180
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:36,540
you prickly pear.

1181
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,860
That's cool.

1182
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:38,860
That's fine.

1183
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:40,380
I'm the only one here who

1184
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:42,800
- Who cares about the rules?

1185
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,260
- I think you're, you're, you're boiling into being a Karen.

1186
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,860
- You are being a Karen.

1187
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:50,620
I want to just, honestly, as much as I love the swear jar,

1188
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:52,300
as much as I love the swear jar,

1189
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,100
I really want to get through these five F's of music.

1190
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,400
- Okay. Okay. Let's do it.

1191
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,260
Run that.

1192
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,300
- Whoa.

1193
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:06,560
(laughing)

1194
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,700
- That was so hard.

1195
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:16,600
That was so hard. Wait, stop it, stop it. That's right. Listen, that, I don't think,

1196
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:19,660
listen, that was one of those, that happens every once in a while on Swag, where they

1197
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:24,380
drop one that is just way too hard and everybody just goes, oh, like, have you seen the video

1198
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,500
of Timbaland when he plays that song for Jay-Z and Jay-Z makes his head hit the ceiling and

1199
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,980
the floor at the same time because he's so excited about it? This is the dirt off your

1200
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,140
shoulder. Do that one more time for me. We just have to hear that again.

1201
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,640
You need to be ready. One of you guys needs to start here.

1202
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:37,640
Yeah.

1203
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,140
Okay.

1204
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:38,640
Yeah.

1205
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,140
Ready?

1206
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:39,640
Yeah.

1207
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,140
Alright, I'm going to do it again.

1208
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:45,140
Oh my.

1209
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:54,640
Oh, that is disgusting. That's so good.

1210
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,640
Yo, listen up.

1211
00:45:57,640 --> 00:46:03,140
I went to Starbucks and I saw a Karen.

1212
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:08,780
Grabbed her coffee said we are sharing. She said yo, my name is actually sharing

1213
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:14,380
I said ho you look like a Karen then I grabbed her coffee and I spilled it

1214
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:18,140
Then I grabbed her muffin and I filled it. That's right

1215
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,860
Se X with her not don't give it if you see K about her

1216
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,900
I don't care about the Karen's that I have I give him my finger and I tell her that I'm Jeff

1217
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:34,060
I lie about my name, I lie about my age, I say I'm 13, they don't really know my age

1218
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:39,180
is actually about to be 26, I turn 26 on Monday the 25th.

1219
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,180
That's not true!

1220
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:42,180
Shut up!

1221
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,180
Is that your birthday?

1222
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,300
That's right, that's a bomb on you.

1223
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:51,940
Yeah, yeah, I was at the Starbucks and I had to order a coffee bowl cup and I wanted it

1224
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:58,540
with oat milk but then I was attacked by a MILF and she grabbed me and she did some stuff

1225
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:05,300
and I said no I just want my cup but then she took me in the bathroom and she sucked

1226
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:11,580
me up with a vacuum see you thought I was gonna swear but I never need words like that out

1227
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:17,060
of my hair I keep them in my heart and I don't let them out and I don't say fart and I don't

1228
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:33,100
say

1229
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,100
Lopez style.

1230
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,180
I think she sings that song.

1231
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:37,660
I don't really know.

1232
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,740
I need to go to the Starbucks too.

1233
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,220
Also gotta go to Starbucks for this verse.

1234
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:49,420
I went to Starbucks on the first of the month cause my girlfriend works there.

1235
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:53,460
Shouldn't give out her job on the show.

1236
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:55,100
That's a bad idea.

1237
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:58,380
Someone might show up and assassinate her.

1238
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:02,980
Or come over here to the studio and steal the swear jar.

1239
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:10,200
Might show up and order oat milk, but they turn out to be booth comma John Wilkes. Yep show up to oh wait

1240
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:18,900
Show up to the Starbucks with the swear jar give her all the money say I want a Blair Clark

1241
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:24,300
What's a Blair Clark? We don't have an item that is called a Blair Clark

1242
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:31,580
I'm sorry. I'm drunk. No, that was a joke. Don't kick me out the Starbucks

1243
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:35,660
I just need the code for the bathroom so I can take a stinky log.

1244
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:40,380
Drop a log of poop, a log of it into the toilet.

1245
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:43,540
And it'll make this sound.

1246
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:51,300
Wow, that was so good, that really inspired me so much, I think that was by far our best finger.

1247
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,180
Yeah, that was pretty good.

1248
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,500
All right, well, that was only finger number two.

1249
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,140
Wow, wait, I thought we got a speed.

1250
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,780
OK, we're going to go to the next finger.

1251
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:00,260
Ready? Yeah. Ready for the next finger.

1252
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,340
All right, here it is.

1253
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:03,340
[Music]

1254
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,340
Okay, this one's a little faster.

1255
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,340
This is kind of a...

1256
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,340
Yeah.

1257
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,340
Kind of a DMX type.

1258
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,340
Yeah, but you can go slow on it if you want.

1259
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:12,340
I did not say this is like the clips.

1260
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,340
This is like grinding.

1261
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,340
Uh-huh.

1262
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,340
Just that kind of song.

1263
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:16,340
And then it also has this.

1264
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,340
[Siren]

1265
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,340
[Scream]

1266
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,340
No, I'm just kidding.

1267
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:20,340
I know it's not.

1268
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,340
Put sirens in this song.

1269
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:23,340
Put sirens in this song.

1270
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:24,340
Respect the police.

1271
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,340
Get some jackets for the cops.

1272
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,340
Get them a fleece.

1273
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:32,300
I go to the store and I get a fleece jacket.

1274
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,300
North Face.

1275
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,300
North Face.

1276
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:37,900
Uh oh, this cop did blackface on Halloween.

1277
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:43,540
This cop did blackface on Halloween.

1278
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:46,140
He got paid off from the union.

1279
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:48,140
They gave him paid leave.

1280
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:50,860
Yeah, I respect the cops.

1281
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:56,100
Gave him paid leave on Halloween so he could go trick or treating in the neighborhood.

1282
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,820
And the beat is way too loud.

1283
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,260
He told me to turn it up.

1284
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,020
I think that's because that rhymed.

1285
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,020
It just rhymed.

1286
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:03,020
That's a good point.

1287
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:09,820
The cop uses paid leave to pretend to be a kid and go around on Halloween.

1288
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:11,660
In a costume he was Yu-Gi-Oh.

1289
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:13,900
He was Yama Yu-Gi from Yu-Gi-Oh.

1290
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,380
He would go toward a door and then he would go.

1291
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,380
Dressed as the Pharaoh.

1292
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,980
The cop went on paid leave.

1293
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:23,300
I think that he needs a red sleeve because he is a freaking Nazi.

1294
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:24,300
That's right.

1295
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,020
All the cops are Nazis to me.

1296
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:29,020
I respect the cops to do that job.

1297
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,420
You need incredible chops.

1298
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:33,320
You need to enforce all the traffic stops.

1299
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,220
Okay, it's pretty tough.

1300
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:39,520
Imagine a cop with hops a cop on the court that can dunk real

1301
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,920
tall or a cop.

1302
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:45,020
That's a bunny rabbit named Judy hops and she can dunk a basketball.

1303
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:46,620
She's seven feet tall.

1304
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,920
Wait, that's seven feet tall.

1305
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,520
I'd be scared of that cop.

1306
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:53,020
He'd stand on the turnstile.

1307
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:54,120
Make sure no one hops.

1308
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:00,280
Dang, a cop that's actually a hooper who could stop an active shooter on the basketball court

1309
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:05,880
or in the home. You know that when he dunks the whole place goes, "Oh!" Look at the cop.

1310
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:12,600
He's got hops and he's got a mop top because he's also part hippie cop. He has a hippie outfit on.

1311
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:20,120
That's right. What if there was a hippie cop? A guy who actually liked peace and cop stuff?

1312
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,520
I think all cops are like that.

1313
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,120
That's right.

1314
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,520
I think that all cops are like that.

1315
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:28,560
And they wear cool hats and I like their uniforms.

1316
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,480
And I think that they obey all of the norms.

1317
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:33,960
Go. I think the cops don't beat people.

1318
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,240
I think that they behave not evil.

1319
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,320
I think the cops are really good.

1320
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,640
And I think that their cars should be made of wood.

1321
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,560
Yep. I think all cars should be made of wood because I don't believe in technology

1322
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:50,800
because I'm a guy and I don't owe anyone an apology for my beliefs.

1323
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:57,680
Imagine a world of wooden cars and wooden stars and wooden bars and wooden made out of wood.

1324
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,440
No metal.

1325
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,160
We never learned metallurgy.

1326
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,040
I have allergies in the summer because of all the wood we have to keep making wood.

1327
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,720
I'm allergic to birch pollen.

1328
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:09,440
Dang.

1329
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,360
It's up in my nose.

1330
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,320
It gets all in the pollen.

1331
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,840
It makes me sneeze.

1332
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,760
That's right.

1333
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,000
Stop the pollen, please.

1334
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
- "No technology is what I need.

1335
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,440
I need a car that runs on my feet.

1336
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,840
That's right. I need a bird alarm clock.

1337
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,160
I need to put my jizz in a sock.

1338
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,760
It's okay to say jizz, it's not on the list.

1339
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,600
That's right.

1340
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,000
Don't slap my wrist because I just said a naughty word."

1341
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,040
- Look right there, at the list,

1342
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,100
there is a J word, above R word, under C word,

1343
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,280
and under butt.

1344
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,200
(laughing)

1345
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,660
- Wait, he just said butt.

1346
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,200
- Butt is okay to say.

1347
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:51,200
But is okay to say, we already decided that today.

1348
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,680
It's like you didn't pay any attention to the list

1349
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,360
on this episode of Podcasts About Lists.

1350
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:57,440
I paid attention.

1351
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,680
I also paid attention, paid many times

1352
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,900
into the swear word jar, the swear jar.

1353
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,340
I think that this will go far.

1354
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,800
When we go to Locks for Love and get me a new wig

1355
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,440
with this brand new, with the money that we have raised.

1356
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,400
If you want a new wig.

1357
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,480
When I was in high school, Locks4Love came to my school and I shaved off all my hair.

1358
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:22,280
It was a really weird thing. We used to have pep rallies for it.

1359
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,560
You used to have to go to the gym and go to pep rallies.

1360
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:26,760
Now we're just kind of telling stories really, really fast.

1361
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,920
And nothing is really rhyming even at all.

1362
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:31,520
And if you skip the pep rally, you get in trouble.

1363
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,840
Yeah. Yeah. That really burst my bubble.

1364
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,280
OK, that story seriously had no stinger.

1365
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:38,960
But are you ready for the next finger?

1366
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,040
Yeah, there goes finger.

1367
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,040
Wait, these transitions are crushing my brain.

1368
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,040
This one's got a little bit of a Latin flair.

1369
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:53,040
Okay, Julio.

1370
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,040
Let's hear you.

1371
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,040
Julio.

1372
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,040
Let's go.

1373
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:02,040
Completely create a green clean freestyle from the mean nacho cheese style guy that we have.

1374
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,040
Go ahead, dang. Here he goes. Wait, he's getting out of the room.

1375
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,040
No, no, no, he's leaving.

1376
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:08,040
No.

1377
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:09,040
He's leaving the room. No.

1378
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,040
No, get back here.

1379
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,040
He left the room.

1380
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,040
He doesn't want to freestyle.

1381
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,600
I think he's coming back with a coke freestyle.

1382
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:17,440
He got a coke freestyle machine in his house.

1383
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,440
Cause it's real cheap.

1384
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,440
Get that in his house.

1385
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,440
Come on.

1386
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,440
One line.

1387
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,440
One line.

1388
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,440
We want him to do one bar.

1389
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,440
One bar.

1390
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,440
One single bar.

1391
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,440
Come on Julio.

1392
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:27,440
Let's hear a bar.

1393
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,440
Okay, alright.

1394
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,440
Then we're just going to rap as you do.

1395
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:30,440
For a while.

1396
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,440
Julio.

1397
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,320
My name is Julio and I'm coolio.

1398
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,320
That's right.

1399
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,320
Okay, no, no, no.

1400
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:38,320
Okay, wait, wait.

1401
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,320
Yeah.

1402
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,320
Alright, you gotta feel it for a second.

1403
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:41,320
You gotta let that beat ride.

1404
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,320
You gotta let that beat ride.

1405
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
Do the... put some chops on it.

1406
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
(Humming)

1407
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,320
(Laughing)

1408
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,320
That's one of the best beats I've ever heard.

1409
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,320
(Music)

1410
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,320
(Sigh)

1411
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,320
That sounds better.

1412
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:59,320
Maybe Julio will want to jump on the

1413
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,320
beat now. Yeah, Julio... oh he's a coward.

1414
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Okay. Alright. Look I have no

1415
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,320
bars. Yeah, my name is Julio and I'm

1416
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,320
from Mexico. Yep. And my

1417
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,320
rhymes are Julio that make people say

1418
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:14,020
Let's a go like Mario. I am Mario is my name.

1419
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,420
Like Mario.

1420
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,720
He's got the Mario.

1421
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:19,720
Which I don't remember. I think that means neighborhood or something, right?

1422
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:20,320
Mario?

1423
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:20,920
Maybe.

1424
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,920
My name's Julio.

1425
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,520
I got a cousin named Franklin.

1426
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,020
Yeah.

1427
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:29,620
His name is Mario and my villain's name is Wario.

1428
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:30,120
Yep.

1429
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:33,220
I got a cousin named Franklin and you know when he walks his leg

1430
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,020
it's Stanklin.

1431
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,420
He got hit by a car.

1432
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:37,420
He got hit by a car when he was 15.

1433
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:41,620
basically destroyed all the bones in his leg and it didn't get back together right.

1434
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:45,920
Yeah, you don't really need to rhyme when you do a freestyle because you can't

1435
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,020
really have, you can't really think that much. Okay, this is bad. This one is

1436
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:52,420
hitting my head way too many times. Okay, let's talk about, let's talk about,

1437
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,620
yeah, let's get a word here. Let's get a topic. Divorce. Divorce? Okay, let's go

1438
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,420
to the next finger for divorce. No, next one is the last finger. No, we got to finish this finger first.

1439
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:05,120
Yo, my parents got divorced. I'd fix it if I had the force. I'd use my hands to

1440
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:10,360
make them kiss I'd use my hands to eat their piss I'd eat my own parents pee I'd make them

1441
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:15,480
smile and do it for free I'd go what?

1442
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,160
I'd do divorce with the force I'd do the anti-divorce force I'd make them touch each other's legs

1443
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:25,240
I'd make them touch each other's heads I'd touch their heads and put them together I'd

1444
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:29,720
make them head by tooth in the weather make them wear two matching sweaters I said I'm

1445
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:35,040
I'm with stupid, I'm with cupid, I'm with foolish, I'm with bluish, I'm with a Jewish guy, he

1446
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,680
is my friend, his name is Fry.

1447
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:42,320
Fry is kind of a Jewish guy's name, I think at least, or is that lame?

1448
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:45,560
You're thinking of a cartoonish guy's name.

1449
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:51,600
My bad, I'm thinking of Futurama, I didn't mean to make Jewish drama by accusing Fry of

1450
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,600
being Jewish.

1451
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,960
Oh my god, I really am clueless.

1452
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,960
That's my bad.

1453
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,440
But I do fuck with Lila's dad.

1454
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:59,440
He has one eye, he's from this...

1455
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,440
You F with Lela's dad?

1456
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,440
Full F word.

1457
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,440
Full F word.

1458
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,440
But, hottest freestyle yet.

1459
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,440
We can agree on that.

1460
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:13,440
No, there's no doubt about that.

1461
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,440
Because I was with Lela's dad in the...

1462
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,440
I came up in the gutter with Lela's dad.

1463
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,440
And I was a mutant.

1464
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:21,440
With Lela's dad and her mom too.

1465
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,440
And you said P-I-S-S.

1466
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,440
I'm with Lela's dad and we are in the gutter.

1467
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:29,760
gutter and he is making me a sandwich called jelly peanut butter.

1468
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:30,760
Dang.

1469
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,520
Yup, it's a sandwich that's backwards and I am rapping with wack words cause I can't

1470
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:39,760
think of anything to rhyme cause it's going too fast for me to think in time.

1471
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,240
And I just want to eat my sandwich and I think that Leela's mom is a bland witch.

1472
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,240
Yeah.

1473
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,800
Cause she is a mutant and I don't like mutants and I think that she is a mutant.

1474
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,520
And I really don't like mutants and I think mutants should.

1475
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,520
Okay.

1476
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,200
And my window needs new tint.

1477
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,200
In my car.

1478
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,800
I would say you need an improv class.

1479
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
Yeah.

1480
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
Yeah.

1481
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,800
You need UCB01.

1482
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,560
I took it, it was so fun.

1483
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,440
I made so many friends for life.

1484
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:06,360
I think I met my future wife.

1485
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:10,280
I got an A. I had to play every day in improv games.

1486
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,280
It was so fun.

1487
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,400
Oh my God, I gotta go back to the UCB101.

1488
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,000
Maybe I'll do 103 next time.

1489
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I'll skip 102.

1490
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,440
I'll skip right to 103.

1491
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,440
That's right.

1492
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:22,440
That one is...

1493
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,480
Get the bomb ready.

1494
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:32,200
Object work. Yeah. Wow. Again, you said D in that song. Guys, we'll catch up at the end.

1495
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:36,680
Okay. I'm sorry. I finally got into my freestyle zone, so I just got to let it fly. The thing

1496
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:41,000
is we were doing so good yesterday. I thought it was a warm up. I think I actually drained

1497
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:45,680
myself. You drained yourself? I think I drained all my good rhymes about Dracula. We did rhyme

1498
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:51,080
about black Dracula for about 30 minutes. I have no rhymes. I think the type of music

1499
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:52,080
I'll just give it a shoot.

1500
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,680
I mean, you've all seen song Sunday's

1501
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,200
a do black Dracula.

1502
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,480
It's all in the interest of

1503
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,480
rhyming. Yeah, right.

1504
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,600
This is not this is not racial.

1505
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,400
No, it's a let's go to the next

1506
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,620
finger. Then the next one's the

1507
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,640
last one. Right.

1508
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,960
If you think that this is a racial

1509
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,760
rap, you're going to go to the OK,

1510
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,360
because the last one I do remember.

1511
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:12,160
OK, this is the one that is

1512
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,960
perfect. This is the last one.

1513
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,880
OK, so it's maybe it will be

1514
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:17,800
a little intense, you

1515
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,180
know. Yeah. So I don't know if you

1516
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,000
guys are ready for this.

1517
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:20,500
I'm ready.

1518
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,000
But this will... Here.

1519
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:22,500
You ready?

1520
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah.

1521
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I'm ready. I'm gonna hit it.

1522
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,500
Yeah.

1523
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:25,500
Because you guys might have a reaction to this.

1524
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,500
I'm the cool hand Luke.

1525
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,500
I don't remove.

1526
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,000
You say so.

1527
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I'm not. I'm warm hand...

1528
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Warm ham.

1529
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,500
Warm ham Todd.

1530
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,000
I'm warm ham Dan.

1531
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
I'm warm ham Dan.

1532
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,500
I'm gonna flip out.

1533
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:45,500
Wow.

1534
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,500
Yep.

1535
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,500
Just the drums and the words.

1536
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,500
That's all it's about.

1537
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:53,500
I'm a blacked out Dracula born and raised in Africa.

1538
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Eat you with a spatula and...

1539
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
Dracula.

1540
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,500
I don't remember what the rest of it was, but it was fire.

1541
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:00,500
Speaking of Dracula...

1542
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:01,500
Oh, I'm attacking ya.

1543
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:04,500
I'm attacking ya, 'cause I'm Dracula, straight from Africa.

1544
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,500
Speaking of Dracula, last night Caleb saw Robert Pattinson,

1545
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,500
then he saw a woman get her face battered in.

1546
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,500
Dang!

1547
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,500
Whoa! By a batter man.

1548
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:15,500
No, batter man wasn't there. Batter man was in the B.A. air.

1549
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,500
He was in a place called Ear Inn that I went in,

1550
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:22,240
I went in and I said, yes, I send I drank too much in the bar.

1551
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,780
I had a tequila soda. It got me really far.

1552
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:27,860
And then I farted when I was three feet from Batman.

1553
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:30,340
I didn't mention that earlier because it was embarrassing,

1554
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:34,660
but I farted in the bar and a guy said, what the fuck? Somebody farted in here.

1555
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:36,820
Yeah. You farted. You farted in here.

1556
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:40,220
He said what the funk I'll count that.

1557
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,800
Not count that as a swear cause it's being the song.

1558
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:45,380
And you can say what the funk if it's a funk song.

1559
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:49,620
He farted- This is technically a funk song because there's a beat and it's a song.

1560
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,620
He farted near Batman.

1561
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:54,220
Okay, wait, I need, I lost the- He farted near Batman!

1562
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,220
Yeah?

1563
01:00:55,220 --> 01:00:56,220
Yeah.

1564
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:59,140
He farted near- He farted near Batman called- I'm completely losing the- I think I'm gonna

1565
01:00:59,140 --> 01:01:00,140
faint.

1566
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,140
Wait, wait, wait, we're gonna let him, we're gonna let him touch this.

1567
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:03,660
You shush, shush.

1568
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,140
He farted near Batman.

1569
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,940
I call that Joker gas.

1570
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,940
Dang.

1571
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,740
He smelled so bad, someone said, "Someone's smoking ass."

1572
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,420
Whoa, that's a dollar.

1573
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,420
That's a dollar.

1574
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,860
Nobody said that, you weren't there.

1575
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,860
Yeah, but it was just a story.

1576
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:22,460
I make up a story where I say I was fucking pussy and shitting in my own fucking asshole.

1577
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,460
What?

1578
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,380
That's a story.

1579
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,380
That's not a story.

1580
01:01:26,380 --> 01:01:29,100
You were trying to circumvent the swear jar.

1581
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:30,700
I'm not complaining that I swear.

1582
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:31,700
You said that no one said that.

1583
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,900
I'm saying I know no one said that.

1584
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,900
It's a story.

1585
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,900
I owe like $10 right now.

1586
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:38,420
So you just kind of went off for no reason.

1587
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,500
Yeah, I kind of popped off.

1588
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:41,620
You owe so much.

1589
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:43,780
Caleb can't stop swearing.

1590
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:45,660
I don't know why it's like he's daring.

1591
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:47,740
And what the hell is this guy wearing?

1592
01:01:47,740 --> 01:01:49,740
He said H-E-L-L.

1593
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:51,780
Oh my gosh, he's going to jail.

1594
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,660
Yep.

1595
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,580
Going to swear jail.

1596
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,820
At a certain point, we're going to get a swear jail.

1597
01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:59,700
Not a problem for me to pay because I'm a dang millionaire.

1598
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,500
Oh, we're going to get a thing called the swear jail.

1599
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,660
It's a dog cage, puts you in the swear jail.

1600
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:09,060
If you swear too much one episode, we're going to have a camera pointed.

1601
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:09,860
Oh, that's a great idea.

1602
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,940
You have to do the whole episode from a swear jail.

1603
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:14,100
Which is a dog crate.

1604
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:16,600
It's a dog crate Caleb's gonna live in.

1605
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,600
Wait.

1606
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,100
Because he swore too much on the show.

1607
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:22,100
I'm trying to think of...

1608
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:27,100
Wait, you're on the precipice of something right now.

1609
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,100
Oh my god.

1610
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:33,100
Yeezus kind of thing going on.

1611
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:37,100
This is like... I'm thinking that this...

1612
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,100
Is this like a...

1613
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,600
Dang.

1614
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,600
Animal Crossing type beat.

1615
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,600
Animal Crossing.

1616
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,600
Animal Crossing.

1617
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:51,600
When you go into someone's basement, you gotta fight all the cockroaches.

1618
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:56,600
Uh oh, first part of that word could have been encroaching on a swear word.

1619
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,600
Dang, yes sir. Go off.

1620
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,600
Yup.

1621
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,600
I like this beat. I like the sound. Saxophone on the beat. Let's go.

1622
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,600
Let's go to the stove. We're gonna go back to Starbucks where the Karen was.

1623
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,600
Where the Karens flow.

1624
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:21,760
the

1625
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:23,520
It's not even its final form.

1626
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,000
There's going to be a big change.

1627
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:26,000
You ready?

1628
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:27,000
Someone start doing it.

1629
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I'll change it in the middle.

1630
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,000
Okay.

1631
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,480
I went to Dunkin Donuts and I saw a Karen there.

1632
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,120
I seen her from the back.

1633
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,960
She had the classic Karen hair.

1634
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,440
It was blonde as heck and it didn't look so fair.

1635
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,040
So I walked up to her and I hit her with my freaking snare.

1636
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,040
Give me a snare.

1637
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:47,040
That's a snare.

1638
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,040
Yep.

1639
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,040
Yeah.

1640
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:50,040
Hit her with that.

1641
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,040
Hit her with that.

1642
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,040
Hit her with that in the back of the head.

1643
01:03:54,040 --> 01:03:56,040
She fell over, she's dead.

1644
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,040
She dropped her ice cream cone.

1645
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,040
I hit her with my phone.

1646
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:03,040
I am a caveman walking around a modern world.

1647
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,040
I am a caveman and I have a hairy caveman girl.

1648
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:14,040
Also, the Dunkin Donuts was a combination of Baskin Robbins, 23 flavors, rum, raisin.

1649
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,040
Get it in my belly, I need that.

1650
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,040
I'm a caveman walking into the ice cream store.

1651
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:25,520
I said 23 flavors do you have maybe one more? I asked for Mammoth, asked for Rock

1652
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:31,280
They said no I grabbed my Glock I put it in their face. I said give me my Flavs

1653
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:38,960
Oh, I may have messed up there. I think it's 23 flavors for Dr. Pep Bear. That's Robins 31. That's right

1654
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,000
I walked into the Dr. Pepper outlet the other day

1655
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:49,120
I gave them all the flavors and I said this drink is way too sweet for me.

1656
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:51,880
You need to make a diet version.

1657
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:55,480
They accused me of being a soda virgin.

1658
01:04:55,480 --> 01:05:00,080
I said I've had soda before, please do not call me different.

1659
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:06,320
I told them that if they don't give me soda, I'll act ignorant and I will throw a stick

1660
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:12,080
of dynamite in here and then I will go to the bar and get adult soda beer.

1661
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,080
Wow.

1662
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,320
And now just for everyone's

1663
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,960
information, there is a Dr.

1664
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,960
Pepper outlet.

1665
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:19,920
You can go there on vacation.

1666
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:20,960
That's right.

1667
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:21,960
It's in Asia.

1668
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,120
Store is Asian.

1669
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,000
Yeah. The owner's Haitian.

1670
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,920
That's right. His name is Barry.

1671
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,960
And yes, his back is hairy.

1672
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,000
Yeah, I seen

1673
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,120
his back because I work there and he

1674
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,840
used to change in the bathroom.

1675
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,640
He's in the bathroom.

1676
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,400
A lot of people would see him change

1677
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,600
because he biked to work.

1678
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:41,840
That's right. He had a real

1679
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:46,140
recumbent bicycle and it's so low to the flow to the earth.

1680
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,040
That's what you should say.

1681
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:49,580
The earth said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1682
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:52,620
If you're a rubber, if you're a rubber, if you're

1683
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:56,680
that was his last name, Barry Rubber, we should get political.

1684
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:11,380
If you're a Democrat, I'll defend you.

1685
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:12,380
Love Obama.

1686
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,580
He's from Kenya.

1687
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,580
Bomb drop.

1688
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:16,220
Bomb drop.

1689
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:17,060
It's not on the bomb drop.

1690
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:18,160
See, this is so confusing.

1691
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:18,760
The bomb drop.

1692
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:19,560
Bomb drop.

1693
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:20,260
That's right.

1694
01:06:20,260 --> 01:06:22,360
Man.

1695
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:22,700
All right.

1696
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,860
I mean, is that all the fingers?

1697
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:25,000
That's all the fingers right there.

1698
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,600
Except this one.

1699
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:32,600
(Music)

1700
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:33,600
That's not actually a finger.

1701
01:06:33,600 --> 01:06:34,600
(Music)

1702
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:35,600
Drop a beat real quick.

1703
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,600
Wait, drop a beat for Pat. He needs a beat right now.

1704
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,600
Because I have to play us out.

1705
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,600
(Music)

1706
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,600
Yeah, tell us about...

1707
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,600
I hope this beat didn't leave your ears bleatin'.

1708
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,600
On the 28th there's a shareholder meetin'.

1709
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,600
That's right.

1710
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:49,600
Wow.

1711
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:50,600
Yeah, yeah.

1712
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:51,600
I think it's the 28th.

1713
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,600
What day is it? Hey, Jubio, can you look that up?

1714
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,800
Can you see the digits on the calendar?

1715
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:03,800
I said up because I wanted, when I said what day is it, I really wanted to rhyme that with

1716
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:09,560
"idget" which I can't really say so right now I am about to pay.

1717
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:14,080
Is that a parody swear which would fall under parody law?

1718
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:18,880
See it's not a parody, it's just how a cowboy would say it.

1719
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,420
By the way, if you hate this song, we don't rap on the Patreon.

1720
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:24,340
That's right.

1721
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:28,680
Go to the website, give us some money so that we never do this again.

1722
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:32,260
And if you hated this episode, I got one thing to say to you.

1723
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:34,720
Eat a load.

1724
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,520
Eat a load of vegetables.

1725
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:38,900
Eat your vegetables.

1726
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:42,560
Because technically, we did do a list.

1727
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:43,900
It's a list of band swear words.

1728
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:45,240
A list of fingers.

1729
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,440
And a list of five fingers of music.

1730
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,520
Really quick, let's go down our list of swear words.

1731
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:56,520
The F word, the S word, the B word, and the A word, the other S word, the other F word,

1732
01:07:56,520 --> 01:08:02,520
any racial slurred word, and no idiot, and no D word, and no "Hockey sticks"

1733
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:03,520
Heck is it loud?

1734
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:11,520
Boner, you can't say it, but just a couple, C word, J word, R word, H-O-O-A-S, P word

1735
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:15,520
D word for pussy, D word for dick, suck.

1736
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:20,520
Meanness is a swear, Todgers, anti-cop rhetoric.

1737
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:27,520
Nastiness, pedophilia, choking, sexual gesturing, drugs, Karen Ho.

1738
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:29,520
Dang. Wow.

1739
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,520
Alright, bye guys. This is a new era.

1740
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:40,520
That was fun.
