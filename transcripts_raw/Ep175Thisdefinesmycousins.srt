1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
(laughter)

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
(music)

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
You're a crap monster.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
(laughter)

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(explosion)

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Alright, yeah, my mom got you guys a present.

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
No she didn't, I don't believe you.

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Look right here.

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I got her a present.

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That's just a white piece of paper.

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
That's a package.

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
My mom handed this to me and said...

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
And I got her a package.

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It says...

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm looking here, it says...

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm looking here, it says...

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm looking here, it says...

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm looking here, it says...

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm looking here, it says...

22
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm looking here, it says...

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I'm looking here, it says...

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm looking here, it says...

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,360
I got her a package.

26
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,360
It says, I'm looking here, it says St. Pete Warehouse.

27
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,280
I gave her my Peter St. Lee.

28
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
Yep.

29
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,280
Mm-hmm.

30
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,360
She saw me ware a house.

31
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
Mm-hmm.

32
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,000
Let me open this up here.

33
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,040
I housed my wares in your mom.

34
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,040
Yep.

35
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,040
She opened up my package too.

36
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,040
Hold on, hold on.

37
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,040
Yep.

38
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,480
I'll open this up so you can, or take it out of the package.

39
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:04,640
unpacked me my mom got you beer koozies I taped your mom up I was I'm ignoring I

40
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,480

41
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,560

42
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:24,920
Patrick's mom we can add that part in I can when I pee inside Pat's mom you know

43
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,680
it makes sense cuz the lady's are like a toilet the label says right here to burn

44
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:42,280
pee that's your mom's name - she signed it yeah I know - - barn to barn - that's

45
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,280
That's my neighbor here.

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,840
How was your Christmas guys?

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Mine was incredible.

48
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,840
I'm back in the south.

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,160
Based on your background, you're as small as an ant.

50
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Yeah, right now.

51
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,160
Oh, my background?

52
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,160
You're a blade of grass.

53
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,400
Sorry, I'm actually, I'm on the links right now.

54
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
I'm back to golfing.

55
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
No.

56
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,400
So, yeah.

57
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,840
I don't believe you.

58
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,640
I decided to become a golf ball.

59
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,780
(laughing)

60
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,040
- Oh dude, you're living out Uncle Matt's TV show idea.

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:13,880
- Yeah, yeah.

62
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,140
- You're doing the Meisner thing.

63
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,400
You're trying to method act.

64
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
- Well yeah, he wants to have me star.

65
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,860
I did see Matt the other day, he's doing well.

66
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,360
He sends his regards.

67
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,380
- Nice.

68
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,080
- He laced me up with an Apple gift card, $25.

69
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920
- Oh!

70
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,740
- Thank you, Matt.

71
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,580
That was huge.

72
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,420
- Hell yeah, dude.

73
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,620
- I'm gonna buy, what can you even buy?

74
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,600
Yeah, you can have it.

75
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,480
I have no idea what to use it on.

76
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,320
- Really?

77
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,240
- You can use an Apple gift card on.

78
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,640
- I already, I set premium.

79
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,480
- Yeah.

80
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,400
- Oh, that's actually, I think that's what I did last year

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,240
when he gave me the same gift, actually.

82
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,720
- Yeah, that's what I would do if I got it.

83
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,080
If I got that.

84
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,160
- I gave him an Amazon gift card.

85
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,000
- Whoa.

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,240
- It was also $25.

87
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:00,160
He just gave me a worst $25.

88
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,440
No, not equivalent.

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
- Equivalent.

90
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,880
- I can only buy digital goods.

91
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,320
This guy could buy whey protein if he wanted to.

92
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:11,160
No no no no no you could buy a phone charger.

93
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,160
What I don't...

94
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,160
Okay.

95
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,160
You probably...

96
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,160
You could buy a phone charger with the name of a song.

97
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,920
Hey nowadays at $25 you probably couldn't buy a phone charger.

98
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,280
Those damn things are about $100 now due to inflation.

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,280
These days, $25 bucks, what does that get you?

100
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,400
What is that gonna get you a McChicken?

101
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,400
What's that gonna get you?

102
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,960
A gumball these days?

103
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
Yeah.

104
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,960
Hey.

105
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,280
$25 for a fucking gumball?

106
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,320
When I was a kid $25 would get me two and a half albums on iTunes.

107
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,360
Now you can barely get one song.

108
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,400
You have to buy the first 10 seconds of the song.

109
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,440
For 25 bucks I could have sex with Pat's mom 50 times.

110
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
That doesn't make sense.

111
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Yeah it does.

112
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,680
And nowadays it's only 25 times.

113
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
It costs one dollar.

114
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,440
To have sex.

115
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,120
She bought you these wonderful gifts, you two, and you're treating her like this.

116
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,880
I'm treating her like a-- She likes it.

117
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
She'll never listen to this.

118
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
Oh wait, she listens to every episode.

119
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,880
Oh shit, I forgot.

120
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,880
How's y'all's Christmas's been?

121
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,880
It's been... I mean, I didn't get to go home for Christmas.

122
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,880
I'm the only one of us who didn't get to go home for Christmas.

123
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,880
And whose fault is that?

124
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,880
That's right.

125
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,880
50 gay guys in Manhattan that you hang out with.

126
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:26,880
Yeah.

127
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Yeah, you deserved it.

128
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,880
I honestly... yeah.

129
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,840
I don't believe that I don't believe that there's that people should like

130
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,480
Moralize about like about like oh, I should have been more careful about Kovat except for Patrick. Yeah, it's no

131
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,440
It is literally 50 gay Grinches ruined Christmas for about 4,000 people in New York

132
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:55,360
50 gay Grinches hanging out it

133
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
Are you kidding me? The gay guys I hang out with love Christmas.

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
Yeah, well, they shouldn't have ruined it then. They loved it so much,

135
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
they should have stayed home and watched The Matrix like me.

136
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,400
Yep. True.

137
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,640
Yep. I did not stay home to watch The Matrix. I went to IMAX.

138
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,480
Damn! Because I could.

139
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,840
That's pretty cool. Baller.

140
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,600
I couldn't. Baller alert.

141
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,640
I'm not sacrificing that ticket. No way.

142
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,800
Yeah, I'm finally back home. I beat COVID.

143
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
Nice. How was it?

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,160
What was your highest high and your lowest low?

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Rosenthorne for COVID.

146
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,680
Rosenthorne for COVID.

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,560
Basically, I'm not afraid of it anymore.

148
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,080
You guys know how scared I was of it.

149
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,120
Because it damaged that part of your brain that experiences fear.

150
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,640
It damaged fear in my brain.

151
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,320
I've been afraid of a lot of things.

152
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,160
As soon as the Atlantic publishes a new article about it.

153
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:48,400
Yeah.

154
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,040
We'll see the name of the new variant, you'll be afraid of it again, don't worry.

155
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Hey, what if it ever happened to me when I saw-

156
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
Omicron is so easy.

157
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,040
When I first saw Omicron I was like, "Oh, here it is."

158
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
You guys should get it.

159
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
But then, I'm gonna get it.

160
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Yeah, you guys should totally get it.

161
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
I'm definitely gonna get it.

162
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,040
You think there's a difference?

163
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,520
Anyway, we're literally all gonna get it.

164
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:08,440
Now that Christmas is over, I don't give a fuck if I get it anymore.

165
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,440
Yeah.

166
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,440
That's fine.

167
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,440
That's fine by me.

168
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,480
I'm gonna be out and about every single day.

169
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,400
You can come hang out with me.

170
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,040
My cousin is coming to visit.

171
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,040
Oh, swag.

172
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,040
Okay.

173
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,640
So, I'm gonna be probably giving it to him or getting it from him.

174
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,620
Um, yeah, now it's gonna be a good time.

175
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,740
When that cousin comes up, you know you gotta link up.

176
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,740
What?

177
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,800
And that's facts.

178
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,440
When that cousin comes up, you know you gotta link up.

179
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
That actually is.

180
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
That is actually so true.

181
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,240
That's so, that's low-key facts right there.

182
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,760
You have a, that's a Christmas vibe.

183
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Uh huh.

184
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
That's a whole Christmas vibe.

185
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,200
No cap.

186
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,040
When you link with that cousin, you know how that is too.

187
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,900
When you link with that cousin, you know you got grandparents involved.

188
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,580
When you link with that cousin and you go on that Thanksgiving walk?

189
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,160
my cousin link my reaction be like the Thanksgiving walk when you when you both

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,460
split a Gatorade blue laser blue color submarine sandwiches with my cousin

191
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,220
before Thanksgiving so we don't have appetite so we don't know eat the gross

192
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,020
food my mom makes.

193
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,620
Changing my gifts to my cousin before Christmas?

194
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:18,220
Eating like Shaggy and Scooby with my cousin before Thanksgiving?

195
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,380
so we don't have that thanksgiving fullness I hate that

196
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:30,260
drinking a toilet with my cousin before Thanksgiving so I don't have to eat my

197
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,940
grandma's damn ass food me and my cousin throwing up after Thanksgiving so we

198
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,380
don't have to keep the turkey in our body and fall asleep I love eating

199
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,060
turkey but I hate poopooing it and me and my cousin feel similarly about this

200
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,620
issue so basically me and him split a pound of sugar-free jelly beans before

201
00:07:47,620 --> 00:08:15,100
for

202
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,100
robot dance at Thanksgiving with your cousin?

203
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,100
When you flatten out the tips of your fingers and your cousin's fingers to make them more alien-like?

204
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,100
When you put your fingers in- when you do Spock hands with your hand and you do-

205
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:29,100
your cousin do Spock hands with his hands and you put them together and you look inside and it's a vagina

206
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
and you show your grandma?

207
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,100
Experimenting with my cousin before Thanksgiving in the woods?

208
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Seeing whose pee smells worse, me or my cousins in the woods?

209
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,100
Doing a science experience with my cousin?

210
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,100
Science experience?

211
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,300
Yeah, I had a science experience with my cousins.

212
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:53,420
Chasing my cousins through the woods.

213
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,220
Making mud pies with my cousin in the kitchen.

214
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:58,940
Bringing in mud from outside and bringing it into the kitchen and making mud pies in

215
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,940
the sink.

216
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,900
Feeding grandma our new potion recipe at Thanksgiving.

217
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:07,220
Yeah, it's leaves and dirt and water.

218
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,860
Yeah, Mark brought his potions again.

219
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
I don't know what to...

220
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,860
Like a grown man.

221
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,860
Greetings!

222
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:19,860
a

223
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,160
wearing a big green robe. Yeah, cool man. Yeah, that's our cousin Mark. He does like potions.

224
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,560
He does basically, he's the potions master of the family. He calls it, he calls it's potionry.

225
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,360
He got into like, like over the pandemic, he got into like warlockery. Yeah. Pretty

226
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,640
much. Yeah. He rolls his eyes. He's like, I'm not a warlock. Okay. I'm a potions master.

227
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,580
I'm a potions fucking family. I hate this gay ass family. My gay ass family call me a warlock

228
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,620
when I'm clearly going to wizard school.

229
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,460
- Yeah.

230
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,900
- Shit's-- - Ugh!

231
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,740
- When I'm like way more into wizardry.

232
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,780
- My fucking uncle is gonna go on his rant again

233
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,600
about how warlocks are trying to halt the rotation

234
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,740
of the earth to bring an infinite winter.

235
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,340
It's like, God, dude.

236
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,180
- What is the difference between--

237
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,000
- We literally just do rituals.

238
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,900
- A warlock and a wizard.

239
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,340
- A warlark.

240
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,660
- I think a warlock is evil and an accent's just cool.

241
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,820
- Your southern accent?

242
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,920
- Yeah, I'm back in the south,

243
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,680
So I'm a southern accent to coming out.

244
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,080
- Hi, me, it's from south.

245
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,680
I'm from south.

246
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,000
- I've been riding around in my slab.

247
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,840
- What?

248
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,920
- Basically drinking lean in my slab.

249
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,000
- Your slab? - My slab.

250
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,480
- What's your slab?

251
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,720
- Big ass fucking box Chevy with fucking huge rims

252
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,720
and a stencil on the rear window with a dead kid.

253
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,580
- Yeah, that's cool.

254
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,720
- With angel wings.

255
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,800
- Yeah.

256
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,640
- Yep.

257
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,760
- Rest in peace, Miguel.

258
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,760
Yeah, 1999 to 1999.

259
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760

(laughter)

263
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
(laughter)

264
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,760
Yeah, I've been riding around in that car pretty much.

265
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Yeah, listening to the Boatwork Doll Season of Cereal really loud.

266
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,760
That'd be so funny to get, like, an in-memoriam thing on the back of your car,

That sounds cool.

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,840
I'm glad you brought this up.

279
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,840
Yeah.

280
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,840
Yeah, it's really bad.

281
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
It's terrible.

282
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:49,680
Maybe if he wasn't smoking so much he wouldn't have written that fucking shit.

283
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,760
To unfreeze me after like thousands of years and like, they've like eradicated the common

284
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,080
cold and I like destroy the human race because I'd have some sickness that they don't have

285
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,080
an amenity to anymore.

286
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:08,200
more. Yeah, the sniffles. The sniffles plague destroys all of us. They cut me out of the

287
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:14,680
ice and somehow everyone on the earth catches depression and they all kill themselves. Yeah

288
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,400
because you're so damn ugly. Damn, I will be ugly after thousands of years in the ice.

289
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,280
Hey I'm not even taking that as an insult. I'd probably break a leg or a razor. You get

290
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:29,280
freezer burn on your shit yeah I look like a damn hot dog mm-hmm you wouldn't

291
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,640
look like an American hot dog I'd look like an American hot dog you're claiming

292
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,080
that we ever heard American hot dog about you coming out looking like a dog

293
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,280
yeah I don't ever put hot dogs in the freezer dog huh yeah I ate some freezer

294
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:48,440
hot dogs this week yeah yeah you ever put hot dogs in the freezer what doesn't

295
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:53,760
no reserve them they already preserved with nitrates I know I don't know why

296
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
You don't have to put it in a freezer.

297
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,760
Speaking of dumbass shit, I literally also ate freezer hot dogs this week.

298
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Are you saying you ate them cold out of the freezer?

299
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
No, just in the freezer.

300
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,760
They were in the freezer and then I cooked them.

301
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,760
I thawed them and cooked them.

302
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,760
You thought I was eating them like a popsicle?

303
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,760
Well, I don't know why else you would put a hot dog in the freezer.

304
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
To preserve it.

305
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
You could probably room them in the fridge.

306
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Hot dogs you can keep out on the counter.

307
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,060
Yeah, you can, yeah.

308
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,060
They're fully cooked.

309
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,820
You don't have to put them anywhere.

310
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:25,660
Yeah.

311
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,260
But, did you, what, you guys get,

312
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,460
or Cameron, did you get potatoes at Christmas?

313
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,300
No.

314
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,620
Instead of coal?

315
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,460
No.

316
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,280
My, fuck.

317
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,120
Do you, I--

318
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,980
No, I just got coal.

319
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,100
I just got coal before as a joke.

320
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:41,940
Yeah, it's a funny joke.

321
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,340
One time my, well that's the thing,

322
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,580
it's like, that's so, like, I don't know

323
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,180
if it was just like my grandparents

324
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,980
trying to cut costs or something by putting potatoes in the stocking instead of coal.

325
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:01,180
But what my parents would do is we get stocking stuff that would be like a bunch of like tiny

326
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,380
like random toys and stuff and then we would just get we've literally got the same like

327
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,940
not the same items but the same exact things in my stocking like every year for my entire

328
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,940
life.

329
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,820
They would just like because I would open them up and then they just put them in the attic

330
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,380
and then give them again the next year.

331
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,380
Yeah, that's smart.

332
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
system.

333
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,580
Yeah, because you always forget about it by the next year.

334
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,380
My mom has multiple times just wrapped up shit that I left here last year.

335
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:29,140
Yeah, that's a good move.

336
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,420
You forget about it and you're like, "Oh, thank you."

337
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,420
Right?

338
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,460
I actually do want this because it's something that I have.

339
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,940
And then I just forget it again.

340
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,940
Yeah, it's perfect.

341
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,940
It doesn't happen with me.

342
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,940
It's very clever.

343
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,660
I remember all my stuff.

344
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:41,660
No, you don't.

345
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
I'm a hoarder.

346
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,660
You don't remember a single thing.

347
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,300
I haven't seen you becoming a hoarder.

348
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,380
Did you guys ever see that one video that lady-

349
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,180
If I live with a girl I would be the worst hoarder of all time.

350
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:58,260
Literally everyone in my family, every old person in my family lives in like, hoarder palaces now.

351
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,380
Did you guys ever see that episode of Hoarders?

352
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:08,260
Where the lady, she like, she eats food in her bathroom.

353
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:13,540
And she gets pieces of poop from her toilet.

354
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,440
Like little specks of poop that fly everywhere and she like puts them on her food and she eats

355
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:29,200
Like we talk like we talked about eating poop on this show so much

356
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,480
I don't know why that just grossed me out

357
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,400
It's so disgusting cuz it's like also I'm watching hoarders to see like how many like game cubes that they have in their basement

358
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,820
And then they just ten minutes in there's a woman just eating her

359
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,080
(laughing)

360
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,520
- They don't even blur it out.

361
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,500
Exactly.

362
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,860
Well, 'cause I guess she hoards,

363
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,680
oh yeah, she hoards her poop.

364
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,300
Yeah, I forgot, that's a big part of it.

365
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,140
She hoards her poop.

366
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,660
- Well, but how does the poop get into the food?

367
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,500
You said it flies everywhere.

368
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,460
- I don't remember.

369
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,340
I think she like puts it on the food,

370
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,820
if I remember correctly.

371
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,980
She like scrapes it up and like it gets on her food.

372
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,140
- My aunt just hoards DVDs.

373
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,940
- Well, she's better than this lady.

374
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,780

375
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:07,600
- That's my great aunt.

376
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,440
- She's a lot better.

377
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,260

Okay, then what is it?

Prove you can read.

476
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:30,480
Number one is they see you doing something and ask you to play with them.

477
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,440
That literally, that happened before this.

478
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,560
That literally happened right before this.

479
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,480
Did the kids want to, they wanted a podcast?

480
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Yeah.

picked up the microphone and asked me if he could try it.

483
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,240
And I told him--

- I know, dude, if he started a podcast,

488
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,040

And a half.

521
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
He holds up half a finger at the end.

522
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

523
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

524
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

525
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

526
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

527
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

528
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

529
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:56,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

530
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

531
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

532
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

533
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
I'm 21 and three quarters.

534
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:07,680
I'm twenty one and three quarters.

535
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,920
It is so fucked up when if you're an adult and you ask how old somebody is and they're

536
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,920
like, "Well my birthday is next month."

537
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,840
And it's like, who fucking cares?

538
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,840
It doesn't matter.

539
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
You're the age you are.

540
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Don't try and get cute with me.

541
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,120
Or I'll kill you.

542
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,160
I hate cute shit.

543
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,840
Absolutely.

544
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,680
I like ugly fucked up cool stuff like Ghost Rider.

545
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Yeah.

546
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,920
And Bugs Bunny.

547
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,120
bugs bunny whose head got chopped off

548
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,200
come on that's an american institution

549
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,240
yeah what the hell Cameron next thing you know you're gonna be telling me

550
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,680
you're gonna be telling me squidward is doing a suicide

551
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,760
you're gonna wanna look something up you wouldn't believe some of the things i've seen about

552
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,720
cartoons being killed

553
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,800
yeah

554
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,400
you wouldn't believe some of the fan theories that i have in my twisted brain

555
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:57,000
you wouldn't believe some of the dark ideas i have about what kind of blood comes out of different

556
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,040
characters

557
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:02,160
yeah i guess i mean i hear it's i heard a song the other day

558
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:05,440
about how well having a gun

559
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,680
my fan theories that on the jury are brothers and that's why they fight so

560
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,200
much

561
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,800
or that my theory theories that they're married

562
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,800
that's what it might so much areas of kitten theory

563
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:20,880
yes it is a small cat

564
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,000
it's true is

565
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,120
yeah their status was that brothers

566
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,480
known their blood brothers their blood brothers

567
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,680
their brothers by blood they did it

568
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,080
but they don't know that he's actually real brothers idea is that bugs bunnies

569
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:39,080
stay being funny as hell in the episodes hold that that is that the ratio

570
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,520
uh... we share that theory

571
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,040
we have a theory

572
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,520
i have a theory that uh...

573
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,840
sylvester as a speech impediment

574
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,240
one of my family and i'm going to laugh at one of my series i developed as i

575
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,720
think spongebob isn't in real life under the ocean i think he's a cartoon that

576
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,720
does

577
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,040
I think that's a fool's theory.

578
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,080
I think Spongebob has no holes and he has black spots.

579
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah.

580
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,600
Yeah, like a cheetah.

581
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,160
That's a really good theory.

582
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:19,600
And Patrick, I don't, Patrick is a girl.

583
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:26,520
One of my fan theories is that Patrick's actually in purgatory and all his characters in his

584
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,280
life are in his imagination.

585
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,280
Which one?

586
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,120
theory that christian ramsey is really cheap

587
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:39,120
christian crab that he's really he's really really cheap any of the money

588
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,120
my all my theory about christy the crab is his redness actually comes from

589
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,720
blood because of the how much he kills

590
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,640
you think he is a little bit also is a murder

591
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,640
yeah yeah also my theories is that the seven deadly sins are in sponge bob

592
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,960
yeah my theory is that squidward actually has a depression

593
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,440
gay yellow

594
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,420
yet yet uh... girl who

595
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,680
crazy

596
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,880
squirrel

597
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,320
stealing the crown word stealing the crown from king neptune lankton

598
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,080
uh... and what that

599
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,040
because he works at the restaurant

600
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,800
all he does work at a rest yet hamburger

601
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,680
hamburgers the seventh deadly sin

602
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,800
uh...

603
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,600
so this is under the cd something as you play with them this happened a few

604
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,280
minutes ago my brother asked me to play with them and i said no so he stole my

605
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,940
books and hit them and when he gave them back after a long time

606
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:34,560
he said if i would play with him and i said no and then he started crying in my

607
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,520
mom had to get involved of course and uh...

608
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,240
that's a sounds like a nerd here's a second nerd and uh... the

609
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,080
kid is actually

610
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,080
a bully and i'm on the bum on

611
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,460
the bully side pro-bully i'm actually i hear a little comment here

612
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,540
if it's against a nerd but if you're bullying a jock that's not cool

613
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:58,820
you don't know what's going on at their home that's making them act that way

614
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,560
their dad could be putting out cigarettes on them

615
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,420
so true i dread the day where either caleb

616
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,100
or nate or alfie comes over to our house

617
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,340
ten times worse when i have friends over it went like this friends and i play

618
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,160
minecraft together alfie

619
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,660

620
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:21,900
friends. Aw, that's annoying. Alfie. And I want Lucas to play with me too. Lucas. Whaaat?

621
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,100
Reluctantly plays with Alfie. See what I mean? It is never a good experience.

622
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,580
Mm-hmm. Yeah, dude, when you get Caleb and Nate together, so annoying.

623
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,300
I'll admit, as Caleb is an annoying kid name. Yeah.

624
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:43,540
And here's a reply to that comment from the same user, from Alfie, one of my not-cringe

625
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:52,540
comments back in the day I am proud in memoriam of their old posts here's a

626
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,500
good one doesn't this happen in Jeff the killers

627
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:04,860
backstory says xx severed humanity xx I think it does Jeff the killer got

628
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,220
annoyed why do you think what do you think made him start killing true I guess

629
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,120
That's a good point. I love this if it is with my little brother

630
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:19,440
My seven-year-old brother is the opposite very big introvert wouldn't ask me for anything unless necessary and kind of mature past his age

631
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,540
Unlike my nine-year-old sister

632
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:24,660
Little kids want to play with me because I look like an eight-year-old

633
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:43,420
roll. That's a comment from Andy Bilinakis. Yeah, there's a lot of scripts on this one.

634
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:50,420
Too many scripts for my taste. This one's very long too. The one at the very bottom, yeah.

635
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:59,260
you want to read it? You know what? Sure. Do you want to be me or kid? Or six year old?

636
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:05,660
I think six year old might be kid. Yeah, I want to be. You'll see if we read the script.

637
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,740
Just choose six year old for now. I'll be six year old. Alright, I'll be me. Walks in

638
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,180
the kitchen. Do I have to be kid? No, you don't. Just wait. Let's play. I hate being

639
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:23,820
six-year-old okay restart go ahead okay walks in the kitchen let's play brothers

640
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:28,100

641
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:33,220

644
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,620
But don't break it.

645
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
I said it's fine.

646
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,500
Okay, Pat, this is where you come in.

647
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,620
Okay, by the way, now the six-year-old will be called kid.

648
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,780
That's a stage direction.

649
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,780
Have it!

650
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,780
I said I'm fine.

651
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,780
Let's play!

652
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:57,780
I don't want to play.

653
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,780
You're mean!

654
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
What?

655
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,340
I just didn't want to play.

656
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,140
I hate this game.

657
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:05,060
Second scenario.

658
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:07,980
I sit down next to my laptop, and guess what?

659
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,020
Thanks for helping me.

660
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:14,220
I was using my dolls to make a movie on your laptop.

661
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,220
You know you can't do that!

662
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,220
Oh wait, I gotta expand this.

663
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,220
Can you be the mom? Elsa is the mom!

664
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
Come on!

665
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,220
After a bit of normality.

666
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,220
Pretend the mom fainted.

667
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,220
Thinks no, I'm bored this little kid.

668
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,220
I'm gonna also be the little sister with the big sister.

669
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:36,220
Please, I won't have anything to play with.

670
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,220
Oh, this is you, Pat. Kid's mom.

671
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:41,220
What is going on?

672
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,220
I'm playing and he wants to be the little sister, but I am.

673
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,820
You should not be playing together!

674
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,420
Decide what you are going to play!

675
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
There we go, I found the voice.

676
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,020
I want to play Roblox on your laptop.

677
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,980
I want to go on my laptop.

678
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
You're not sharing.

679
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,580
I am, I let you on the laptop to play earlier.

680
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,900
Give it to me.

681
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,140
And my dad said you can't use it.

682
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:02,540
I've suffered getting told of by my parents just to let you on it.

683
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,500
Fine, I'll play on the Nintendo Switch.

684
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
Finally.

685
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,700
I convinced the kid to leave me alone, but she kept asking me to do stuff.

686
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,700
And she said I have to help her.

687
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:17,060
She calls my name and tells me cool stuff that she made and did in Minecraft.

688
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,060
That was a beautiful story.

689
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,060
Wow.

690
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:23,580
I mean, it had a big plot twist in the middle too.

691
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Yeah.

692
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
A huge plot twist.

693
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:29,180
The 6 year old will now be called Kid.

694
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:35,460
I think when that, if you can do this in post, put the song from Fight Club in there.

695
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,860
It's kind of a split personality thing.

696
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:39,860
Pretty cool.

697
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:43,620
number two they force you to watch annoying little kids shows with them

698
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:51,020
true yeah this is facts this is facts my brother is 13 and watches My Little Pony

699
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,820

705
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,860
true uh... i would not watch

706
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,020

711
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,020

713
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,320

715
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:57,740
And then Cam, you also just sign me as "me".

716
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,220
I'm always playing "me".

717
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,500
I wish I could play against...

718
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,500
We're looking for kind of a "me" type.

719
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Yeah.

720
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,900
Alright.

721
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,660
Alright.

722
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:14,900
Here's a tip to prevent a little kid forcing you to watch what you don't like to watch.

723
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
Plan A.

724
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,380
Let's watch Teletubbies.

725
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:25,680
"Uh, let's watch F-Zero GP Legend Anime, the super cool futuristic race car packed with exciting racing and light comedy."

726
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,680
"No, Teletubbies."

727
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,680
"I'll give you Candy and Disney Channel, all set of Barbie dolls and Teletubbies if you watch F-Zero GP Legend Anime."

728
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,980
Plan B.

729
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:43,480
Trick the little kid by disguising F-Zero GP Legend Anime DVD as a Teletubbies DVD.

730
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,080
Plan C.

731
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,600
scared a little kid with the monster mass

732
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,000
if you try to change the paper no one's

733
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,040
and i'm not going to ask

734
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,640
plenty scare the kid with a chucky doll

735
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,080
while i think i had a little word with the monster mass because it got a lot

736
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,320
stir massed with a lot of the master mask

737
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,960
uh... do you know when you know as a kid

738
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,560
you didn't you didn't take the

739
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,200
the chicken out of the freezer that fridge to thaw

740
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,300
your dad's coming home with a monster mass

741
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,340
that is a pull up with the monster massing

742
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:19,480
if you have you know you find that the chickens ninety finds that the chickens

743
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,100
not the odd

744
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:25,180
that's right you know you we are a great up late at night under covers playing

745
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,840

746
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,540

749
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Wait now that storm.

750
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,360
Yep.

751
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
That's how much it's gonna fit.

752
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:48,360
And don't even think about trying to explain it away by saying you were playing Big Brain Academy.

753
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,360
It's not gonna work.

754
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:49,860
Yeah.

755
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,360
No.

756
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
That's not homework.

757
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
It's still a game.

758
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
It doesn't count as studying.

759
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
It's still fun.

760
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,860
What's the one that Penn Jillette was in?

761
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,860
You're playing with too much fun!

762
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,360
That's what your dad's gonna say.

763
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,860
The Penn Jillette game?

764
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,360
Yeah.

765
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
I don't know.

766
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
I think he was Big Brain.

767
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:05,360
Right?

768
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
I don't know.

769
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,860
Oh wait, no.

770
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,360
It was Magic Simulator for Detective DS.

771
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,080
- Yeah, magic fat guy thing.

772
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,920
- Yeah.

773
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,920
- For DS.

774
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,760
- Yeah.

775
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,240
- Libertarian, pendulet, libertarianism is magic.

776
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,260
- Libertarian, atheist, fat guy, magic thing.

777
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,820
Little no talking friend for DS.

778
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,520
Do you think he found--

779
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,360
- Little no talking friend.

780
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,380
- Do you think he found Teller in like a tree trunk?

781
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,220
- Yeah.

782
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,440
Teller, this guy ain't telling me anything.

783
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
That's the thing about this guy. How do you even learn magic?

784
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Both of them look very fucked up.

785
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
He can't talk or read.

786
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
You ever see that Run DMC music video they're in?

787
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
No.

788
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
You're thinking of Aerosmith, Walk This Way.

789
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Oh yeah, that's right.

790
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,440
Number three, they whine for their parents

791
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
because you got mad at them.

792
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
True.

793
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,440
A twelve year old is not a little kid.

794
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,440
My cousins scream a lot.

795
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,440
I tell them to shut up.

796
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,440
They cry for my relatives and I end up getting in trouble.

797
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Need I say more?

798
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,440
Here's a comment from Dogs Unleashed.

799
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,440
There was some...

800
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,440
[Laughter]

There was some kid at a party and we were arguing

803
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,440
over who was going to hit the pinata.

804
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,440
Long story short, I didn't

805
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,440
get to hit the pinata.

806
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,440
Damn. That's so fucked.

807
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,440

823
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,640
We were just posting like 20 pictures a day

824
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,480
of just stacks of paper that say like,

825
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,320

cousin mistake by cut dogs unleashed. They're like yeah like 500 page scripts like like

00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,200
bound. Oh yeah yeah we'd do them we'd do a big A-list celebs too. Oh yeah yeah we get

831
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,360
Javier Bardem to play the cousin. Yeah who's gonna play who's gonna play. Andy Serkis is

832
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:51,400
the piñata. Cameron has to play me. I'm always me. Yeah I know. Little kids. I'm straight

833
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
I'm straight up just like me.

834
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,400
I feel like I was born to play that role.

835
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:03,400
I think little kid and six year old are gonna be like, like that duo of roles is gonna be like the next like Joker kind of thing.

836
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Where you have different, where James Bond, you know.

837
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,400
There's like a rotation every couple years.

838
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Yeah, it's like a prestige role.

839
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,400
People wanna play.

840
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
Yeah, people are gonna be looking.

841
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,400
You know, why can't we have, why can't we have a female cousin?

842
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
That's right.

843
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,680
like a bunch of think pieces huge news Idris Elba will be playing six-year-old

844
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:38,880
in the cousin mistake saga yeah yeah number four yeah they get you in trouble

845
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,520
for something they did so in roblox she was in my account and guess what she was

846
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:51,360
online dating on my account and she tries to seem grown up but in reality she's

847
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,640
being stupid. That's so funny getting really mad at your sibling for getting

848
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:02,880
like groomed on your account. I remember my friend of mine got in trouble because he was dating a girl.

849
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,720
I think Patrick froze look at his beautiful expression. Who froze me or them? He's stuck. He looks so cute I'm

850
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,880
I'm gonna take a screenshot.

851
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,000
- Now he's gray.

852
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:12,840
- Oh no, he came back.

853
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,000
- Am I back?

854
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,400
- Oh, dude, my internet sucks here.

855
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,120
- That gave me time to reflect on the story

856
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,640
I was about to tell and I've decided to not tell it.

857
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,920
- Yeah?

858
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,480
- Yep, nope, that is, I saved, I dodged a bullet there.

859
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,000
- Maybe I need like a timeout type thing

860
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,360
so I can decide whether or not I'll take the next story.

861
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,000
- I should be able to give you timeouts like a coach.

862
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
- Yeah. - Yeah.

863
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,660
- I think that's a pretty good idea.

864
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,200
- I've experienced this a lot, so much pain in life.

865
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,960
I hope my parents die because I literally don't need them long story, but I don't

866
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,700
need them and the reply is I hope this comment haunts you for the rest of your

867
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,320
life for wishing death on your parents. They may be annoying, but there's still

868
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:54,800
the reasons you're alive. What did you guys read this one? We don't

869
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:59,680
Christmas 2015 my cousin hit me with an iPad then she told me I was being

870
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:03,120
annoying to her. I told them that I didn't do anything guess who they

871
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,520
believed that's right my cousin. Here's another here's a short but sweet comment

872
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,520
This defines my cousins.

873
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,520
*snort*

874
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,520
This is a very cousin-heavy episode.

875
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Listen to this one.

876
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Yes, my neighbor got me in trouble because she threw a water bottle on the ground.

877
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,520
It wasn't even a big deal, but now her parents hate me.

878
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,520
And every time she sees me, she beams like a sun and does cartwheels as if that's a show-off thing.

879
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,520
Whilst I'm skating and doing cool tricks.

880
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
So who's the show-off now, you little brat?

881
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,520
F you, Michaela. You are the reason your parents are divorced.

882
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:46,300
divorce. I hate when people do cartwheels as if that's some kind of show-off thing.

883
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,420
Me too. Make a go in and make grounded video of your cousin to teach her a

884
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:55,300
lesson. Imagine like your family court you're like being

885
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,700
asked like which one, which parent you want to stay with and you just bust

886
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:04,140
out a fat cartwheel. Yeah, just in your car wheel as if that's a show-off thing.

887
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,140
Who's the show-off now, Michaela?

888
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,140
The judge is like, well, Michaela did an amazing show-off trick and I cannot-

889
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:14,140
OBJECTION! A cartwheel is a show-off thing!

890
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:19,140
Overruled! Michaela, your parents are forced to get back together!

891
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:26,140
Your Honor, a cartwheel is clearly a show-off thing.

892
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,140
Number six.

893
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:30,140
Wait, one more. Oh, you got another.

894
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,060
One kid broke my dad's laptop by dropping it down the stairs and blamed me for it.

895
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,060
I was so grounded.

896
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:38,620
Then they caught him on the surveillance video the next day and ungrounded me right away

897
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:41,260
and apologized for not believing me and they called his parents.

898
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,260
He was grounded.

899
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:47,580
Having a surveillance video in your house to catch kids breaking laptops.

900
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:55,620
When I was a kid, my dad had one of those air freshener things you plug into the wall.

901
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:59,900
But I thought that it was a security camera.

902
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:03,980
mhm inside i would like act really weird in this one part

903
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:04,900
house

904
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,700
i would like never like

905
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,780
if i would like uh... wake up ur like in the middle of the night

906
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:15,760
i would like to avoid uh... an airway because i think it's a security camera

907
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,060
it's pretty cool right

908
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,920
number uh... five they never shut up

909
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,700
this is much like sonic boom rise of lyric where instead of awesome music you

910
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,900
get to listen to the four main characters not shutting up

911
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,860
true yep lots of long comments on this list yeah it seems like this one brought

912
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:41,340
out a lot of a lot of anger in people definitely happened to me once when I

913
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,980
was 13 once in the car by five-year-old cousin asked 5,000 questions about a

914
00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:56,100
horse it was so annoying yeah the question my brother talks about

915
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:01,260
dinosaurs all day every day that sounds like a blessing like a cool kid yeah

916
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:07,660
dude I just got a field guide this is so true come over and look at it it's so

919
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,880
thorat hurted because of screaming my ass off at my four-year-old brother my

920
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:24,880
My thorat.

921
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:25,880
My thorac-

922
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,880
Did you read this one?

923
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,880
They sure haven't brought it into the house.

924
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:28,880
My thorax.

925
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,880
My brother slapped me in the thorax.

926
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
[Laughter]

927
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:34,120
Uh, number six.

928
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,120
They ask you to do ridiculous things for them.

929
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:38,120
Mm-hmm.

930
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,080
Uh, once my mom would force me to make videos of myself singing terribly to random songs

931
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,880
just to entertain my cousins while they were eating dinner.

932
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,200
This one.

933
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,920
Hi, I'm twelve.

934
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,680
My nephew always asks, "Would you choose a hanger over me?" and "Will you let me in your

935
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,120
room if someone busted up in the house and would you let someone kill me i'd be

936
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:59,600
like yes i would let someone kill you and he'd be like i know that's not true

937
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,840
and then i'd be like that why you ask you'd be like i don't know

938
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,100
the cover players

939

could you please cut the i'd be like and he'd be like

940
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:11,300
that's a cool way to talk

941
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,480
there's one that's it's so pretty being twelve and having a nephew in your

942
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,080
nephew's asking you guys we would you would you let me dot

943
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,520
I would say yes.

944
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,040
Would you care if I even died?

945
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,040
Yeah.

946
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:25,040
Would you care?

947
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,360
Would you even give a 4 year old, would you even give a shit if I died?

948
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,960
That's such a good thing for like a little kid to be obsessed with asking.

949
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,720
By the world, make me fly, eat an entire school lunch without throwing up.

950
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:41,760
By the world, make me fly.

951
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,240
By the world, make me fly, eat an entire school lunch without throwing up.

952
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,160
When my 9 year old cousin was younger she forced me to wipe her butt for her after she used

953
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,320
the restroom.

954
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,920
She was like 3 or 4 at the time.

955
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,720
I'm never wiping anyone's butt but my own.

956
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,840
And I barely do that.

957
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:08,840
If I ever have a kid, I'm gonna get a robot to do it.

958
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,920
Hopefully they'll have those by then.

959
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,960
I don't want to ever...

960
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,600
Or a maid.

961
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:20,440
a maid yeah just a wiping maid a wife maid.

962
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
Maid wiping only?

963
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:25,840
Yeah a wiping only maid there's a different maid to clean and the wipe maid gets paid

964
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,520
less because she only does one thing.

965
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,160
Exactly yeah it doesn't matter how hard the job is.

966
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,240
I guess I could pay you more if you wanted to wipe me and my wife too.

967
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:37,360
Yeah if you want to get really deep when you wipe I'll pay you extra.

968
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:41,880
If you want to wipe a little bit of the poop out of the inside of my butt.

969
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:50,240
And then like a month later being like, "Hey, do you still have that poop you wiped off me

970
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,240
a month ago?

971
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,080
I need a stool sample."

972
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:59,560
And then six months in you go to the National Enquirer like a tabloid and you break a story

973
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:05,600
that's like you on the front page like, "My maid won't stop wiping my butt."

974
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:10,520
You get her just like, "Can we put her in jail?"

975
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,940
Number seven, they never leave you alone.

976
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:16,600
It's so true.

977
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:22,740
I'll play with you, says Anonymous.

978
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,600
That's creepy.

979
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,120
Yeah, I'll say.

980
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,880
This one, all the comments here are too long.

981
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,220
Yeah, how about some one word comments?

982
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,400
Hey, wait, here's a--

983
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,860
I'm never gonna play with you, so go away.

984
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,120
Here's a script, a very short script on the last page

985
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:44,020
can reprise my role as a little kid sure and cam you'd be big kid please okay

986
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:51,640
okay hey sissy shut up lol see that one doesn't have as much going on no in it

987
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:55,720
as some of the other scripts you really know much at all no I don't I'm not even

988
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:02,320
really sure what the that one's gonna be hard to that's gonna be it's an

989
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:07,560
unadaptable yeah absolutely script as some might say yeah but they hey they

990
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:12,340
said that about Dune and look how that went. True. That's true. Yeah. We could be seeing

991
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:19,520
a Denis Villeneuve little kid, sissy big kid movie pretty soon. We could. Yeah, you never

992
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,660
know. Number eight, when you ask for something, your parent says no, but when the little kid

993
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:30,800
asks for the exact same thing, they get it immediately. How come when I ask for a diaper,

994
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:36,680
I don't get one, but when this kid does, he gets a diaper? It's so messed up what they

995
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,600
do the definition of my annoying nephew if our world depends on the youth of

996
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,280
today I can see the earth lasting another 20 years that makes sense because then

997
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:54,000
they won't be young anymore yeah true to the be new kids yeah this one also has

998
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,800
no good comments wait wait me can I have a YouTube account I'm 26 mom no me why

999
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,280
not my cousin has one she's nine I show my mom my cousin's YouTube account mom I

1000
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,960
I said no is no, okay?

1001
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:10,640
Why is a nine-year-old allowed to have a YouTube account,

1002
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,260
but not a 26-year-old?

1003
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:13,880
That makes no sense at all.

1004
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:14,720
- That's so true.

1005
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,280
- The reply, your mom has no right to stop you

1006
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,800
creating a YouTube channel, computer fan zero.

1007
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,560
(laughing)

1008
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:24,840
That's the first ever computer fan, guys.

1009
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,120
- Yeah.

1010
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,400
- Came before computer fan one, yeah.

1011
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,200
- That's actually, that's a very adaptable screenplay.

1012
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,520
- That is a really good screenplay.

1013
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,700
- Kind of a controlling mother, controlling a 26-year-old,

1014
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,620
not letting him have a YouTube account? I feel like this could be Tom Holland's

1015
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:47,900
chance to break out of the MCU. Playing 26 year old. Yeah. Yeah. He'd be so good as 26

1016
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:53,660
year old. Number 9. Probably the best. They stare at you. I sometimes have to wear an eye

1017
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:57,740
patch because I just had a surgery on my eye and we went out to eat. This rude little kid

1018
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:01,620
kept staring at me because I was wearing that. Then she loudly asked her mom, "Mommy, why

1019
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,500
Why did that girl paint over her eye?

1020
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,860
Mind your own business, you brat!

1021
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:07,860
That's so rude.

1022
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:12,660
That poor kid just wanted to know what was going on.

1023
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:16,660
Years ago, I was at Ocean City, Maryland, and I was playing Final Furlong at one of the

1024
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:19,060
arcades and a baby was staring at me.

1025
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:23,660
Also years ago, I was at Wildwood, New Jersey, riding a coin-operated horse at Ed's Funcade,

1026
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,940
and a toddler was staring at me.

1027
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:30,300
I was a teenager at the time, and I was just being random and having fun.

1028
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:35,260
My sister always stares at me for like 10 minutes before she goes to bed. Don't underscore blank

1029
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:45,900
7. That's the that's she doesn't blink. That's what he's trying to say with his username.

1030
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:51,860
Yeah, this is this comment. I think we can all relate to here this summer in 2019. We

1031
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:56,140
went to India for five weeks, which I don't enjoy and we met my three-year-old twin cousins

1032
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,300
who were fine two years ago but turned super obnoxious, and I was watching YouTube on their

1033
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,980
TV and mom made me stop and I got into an argument because I was dying of boredom and depression

1034
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:08,360
due to the fact that there was pretty much nothing fun to do on India trips except watching

1035
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,920
TV and my cousins were staring at me.

1036
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,840
I was so mad that day.

1037
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,220
How is there nothing fun to do on India trips?

1038
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,220
I know!

1039
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:19,220
There's so many big restaurants you could go to.

1040
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:21,940
There's those really curvy boats.

1041
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:23,300
Yummy Sea Strike.

1042
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,420
Tandoori Strike.

1043
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,420
You gotta hit Tandoori Stop when you're in town.

1044
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,420
Absolutely.

1045
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:29,420
Every single time, bro.

1046
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,420
The number four combo?

1047
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:33,540
I don't know, I like Yummy C Tummy better.

1048
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,700
Yummy C Tummy's probably one of the best ones there.

1049
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,380
Plus they have Mr. Beast Burger.

1050
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:38,900
Oh, true.

1051
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:39,900
Yeah.

1052
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:43,740
Dude, they have Mr. Beast, but they have like, it's cool because they have like, you know,

1053
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,660
items that you wouldn't get in the States.

1054
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,060
Like you can't get like the Mr. Beast Paneer sandwich.

1055
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,060
True.

1056
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,060
That is true.

1057
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:53,060
Nice.

1058
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:54,060
Yeah.

1059
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:59,220

Kill the song the photo is the is the gummy bear song and naked gummy bear with a stub singing in a high-pitched voice

He might taste gross, but I want to eat him anyway, so he dies

1072

I don't know that must have been in the German version. He had a stub yeah

1073
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,460

I once saw two kids doing the whip nay-nay dance while waiting at the cinema lobby

1079

This is why I am pro-choice now and that abortion should be legal worldwide

The whip and the nae-nae do those are some of the coolest dances ever well you have a problem with those

1081
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:03,000
There's a comment here that says I saw a little girl with a shirt saying I know all the lyrics of frozen

1082
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And I will sing them to you

Back in my day

1090
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:42,300
Now we do the whip and the nay nay back in the 1800s we used to be on ships and say nay nay

But now a few years later kids nowadays are just crips and don't want to play play

No, this is here's like kids nowadays their idea their idea of a good is a good summer is

but back when I was a kid,

1102
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,640
I'd rather have a trip or a vacay-cay.

1103
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:43,040
- That's right.

1104
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,500
(laughing)

1105
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,560
Nowadays these kids just wanna do a Fortnite dance.

00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,560
I wanna go on a food tour, use a fork and knife in France.

1107
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,480
- Yes sir.

1108
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,380
- Try a Michelin star restaurant in France.

1109
00:55:58,380 --> 00:56:03,120
- Kids nowadays are too focused on learning the floss dance.

1110
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:06,920
I'm trying to stack my paper so I can buy some Hugo Boss pants.

1111
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:07,920
Yeah.

1112
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:08,920
That's right.

1113
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:09,920
Yeah.

1114
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,920
Yep.

1115
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:11,920
I heard that.

1116
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:12,920
Yep.

1117
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,920
Definitely.

1118
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,920
What else do kids like these days?

1119
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,920
Uh.

TikTok.

Jujubes, sock hops, playing jacks.

1123
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,640
Nowadays kids are doing TikTok.

1124
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:32,480
When I was their age, I was, uh, I was jelking with hair ties to get a thick cock.

1125
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,720
(laughing)

1126
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,360
- Yep.

1127
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,060

1128
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:42,880
- Yeah.

1129
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,720
- Yes sir.

1130
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,880
Back in my day, we didn't have TikTok.

1131
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,320
- Mm-hmm, what'd you have, brother?

1132
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,000
What'd you have?

1133
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,820
- What did you have?

1134
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,660
- I don't remember.

1135
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,620
(laughing)

1136
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,960
I don't remember, guys, fuck.

1137
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,960
Um, I remember I sang the La Cucaracha song too many times to my older sister.

1138
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
Yeah.

1139
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,960
La Cucaracha, that's a damn annoying song.

1140
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:13,960
Yeah, that's a good song.

1141
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,960
Yeah, if you hate Mexico, me, I love it.

1142
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,960
It's a catchy ass song.

1143
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:17,960
I repped it.

1144
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:18,960
It is catchy.

1145
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,960
I sang that song a lot as a kid.

1146
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,960
Number 16, they follow you wherever you go.

1147
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:25,960
Mm-hmm.

1148
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:26,960
I am from Somalia.

1149
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,960
Who wrote that shit, the damn Pied Piper?

1150
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,960
Come on now.

1151
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:30,960
That's right.

1152
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:39,800
right yeah I am from Somalia yes number 18 they ask are we there yet I don't know

1153
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:44,740
does it look like we're there no then stop asking this is why your kid should

1154
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:51,840
play with Google Maps I've been using it since I was 7 number 21 app number 21

1155
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:56,560
they act like teens if I had a sister in order for me to shut them up I'd head to

1156
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:02,800
my drum set and play a Neil Peart style solo. Wait, oh, that'd just make them scream louder.

1157
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:09,800
Here's a script here Cameron and Caleb can do. On what? On they act like teens. I think

1158
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:15,880
Caleb you should be playing Gretchen. Yeah I play me. Caleb's definitely a Gretchen type.

1159
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:21,440
How am I a Gretchen type? Okay whatever. What are you doing? Playing Bloodborne and ignores

1160
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,920
if you don't tell me what you were doing I'm telling mom set up you're not my

1161
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:35,640
parent we're gonna have this everywhere by next year it's gonna be huge in China

1162
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,960
we're gonna have to remove a lot of references so that it plays actually what

1163
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,560
I want the I would really like the Wachowski sisters to adapt this one here

1164
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:49,040
okay 23 they spit at your face if they can't beat you up here's what I this is

1165
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,640
This is the Matrix 5, okay?

1166
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,140
Okay.

1167
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:52,640
Yes.

1168
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,440
My five-year-old cousin once tried to hit me, so I grabbed her wrist stop.

1169
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,140
She tried to hit me again with her other hand, so I grabbed it too.

1170
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:02,740
When she realized she couldn't move, both of us can't since I'm holding her hands with both of mine,

1171
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,340
she spat straight at my face.

1172
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:07,940
It was a big saliva that landed between my eyes, so my reaction is violent.

1173
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:11,240
Since then, she would spit at me when she is angry or just want to piss me off.

1174
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:13,440
In other words, she spits every time she wants.

1175
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,740
She loves my reaction.

1176
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,940
It is gross. I hate it.

1177
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:16,940
I can already imagine that, uh...

1178
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,440
I can see that as a monologue.

1179
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:22,200
I can imagine the 8 bullet time. Yeah, going into spit time.

1180
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,160
That's cool as fuck, dude. Oh my god.

1181
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,300
That would be sick. And it's just like the rain scenes from The Matrix where all the spit is just suspended.

1182
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:33,660
Oh my god.

1183
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,260
Hello, Cousin Anderson.

1184
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:41,400

Cousin's like you are a disease. You're a virus.

1186
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,600
I finally watched one and two. I gotta still see three.

1187
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:53,440
You'd never see what's wrong. I never finished the matrix. That's why you do. That's why you're not as conscious as me

1188
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,760
You're Cameron. Yeah. Well, I never watched literally the best my grandpa's favorite movie

1189
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:04,960
Your grandpa's favorite movie. Oh, yeah, he was driven to insanity by the Matrix. You told me that's pretty cool

01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:09,840
I think it'll be that week will be driven to insanity by the Matrix

1191
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:16,840
Yeah, I almost was driven insane by how good the action was. Yeah, I mean I was going crazy

1192
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:22,760
I was nearly driven to Lawrence Fishburne in that movie. I was nearly driven to Kung Fu

1193
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:26,000
I was nearly driven to FYE to buy the box set

1194
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:38,000
