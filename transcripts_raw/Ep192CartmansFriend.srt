In a rapping way. In a rapping way.

21
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,000
Why did they get rid of that kind of rap?

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
They need to bring it back.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,200
That's what's going to come back next.

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,200
That was my...

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,120
Because I saw a video the other day.

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,600
It's like two live crew on the Phil Donahue show and it's like them giving up on doing

27
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,000
the censored version of their song halfway through and like...

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,960
What were they saying before?

29
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,600
I don't remember.

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
It's like some...

31
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,920
It's the song that fucking...

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,440
It's Face Down Ass Up, right?

33
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,440
That's their fan...

34
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,440
I think so.

35
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:13,840
going to a hotel and shooting a load on a woman's face but it's like the same

36
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,280
delivery it's the same flow as like Run DMC so it's like I'm gonna take a girl

37
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:28,600
to a hotel and I'm gonna make the whole room smell like that's cool yeah it was

38
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,320

We have a fly problem and there's a fly on my mic.

82
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,420
There's a fly on my mic.

83
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,140
Yeah, what I wouldn't give to be a fly.

84
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,420
I just heard the fly in my soup joke.

85
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:34,940
Well, you're going to move your phone or something.

86
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,260
Something's going on.

87
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,260
What's going on?

88
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,260
I don't know.

89
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,260
Something's going on.

90
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,700
What's going on?

91
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,700
On.

92
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
Is it good now?

93
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
I don't know, we'll find out.

94
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,700
Okay.

95
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,580
Um, I heard that, I heard the whole thing for the first time.

96
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
What's the fly in the soup?

97
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,580
The original one?

98
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:56,460
It's like, uh, what's, where's the fly, what is this fly doing in my soup?

99
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,140
I believe that's the backstroke.

100
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,140
That's the original one?

101
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,140
That's the original one.

102
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,140
You think that's the original one?

103
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,140
I feel like that's a far side joke.

104
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,140
I think that's just one of the ones.

105
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,340
Yeah, is that one of the ones?

106
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:11,700
I mean, I think it's like saying like I feel like it's like I heard the first song the other

107
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,700
day.

108
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:16,020
I've never what do you guys talk is it my girl heard a bunch of flying soup jokes, but I don't

109
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,100
know if I would consider one of them.

110
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,100
I don't know.

111
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,220
It's one of those things you read like a joke book or from your grandpa or something.

112
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,340
My grandpa was talking about no damn flying is.

113

There's a soup on my fly.

116

That could be funny.

117
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180

128
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,740
bad thing. Nobody is. I don't know why, but it's all mad. I think it's cool.

129
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,900
It's we have an African king as a president still still. We're talking

130
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:31,900
about behind the scenes. Joe Biden was born in Kenya. Yeah, he was yeah. I'll

131
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,300
tell you I was born. I'm sure I'm sure it out of the dark continent.

132
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,180
Let me tell you something. He was a baby that got brought in like the

133
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,560
expedition from like heart of darkness. He's got left there for three

134
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,380
hundred years.

135
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,060
That'd be so funny if it was like Joe Biden was like I was born in

136
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,860
Rhodesia. I mean

137
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,060
Delaware

138
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:06,540
about. I remember growing up in Rodea, in Delaware. I had a big bone through my nose. I just did.

139
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:13,540
Oh come on. I had rings on my neck. See my neck is so long I stretched it out with rings.

140
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:20,540
No Joe you didn't have that. I did. Never mind there's no photos. There's one photo,

141
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:22,540
No photos. There's a painting.

142
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,540
It's just a painting.

143
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,540
It's a presidential portrait.

144
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,540
Dude, that'd be so funny.

145
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,540
I was a warlord in Rhodesia.

146
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,540
I remember coming up,

147
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,540
one of our favorite things to eat

148
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,540
was that one Rockefeller kid that went missing.

149
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:46,540
We used to munch on him for lunch.

150
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,540
you know how they like Obama's presidential portrait everyone got mad at

151
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
because it's like...

152
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
I hated his presidential portrait.

153
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
Because it's too cool.

154
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,540
There was a bunch of bad ones though.

155
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
They're all bad.

156
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,540
Every presidential portrait looks like shit.

157
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,540
I thought the Obama one was kind of cool.

158
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
The Obama one with leaves, right?

159
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,540
Yeah, that one looks cool.

160
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
Can't show leaves.

161
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:09,540
That one looks cool, but it's kind of like, I don't know, it's like Tumblr like...

162
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,540
Nowadays, can't show leaves.

163
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,540
Tumblr Obama edits, you guys remember those?

164
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,540
[Laughter]

165
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
Remember the Obama fandom on Tumblr?

166
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,540
No.

167
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:24,340
Oh man, dude, the Obama fandom on Tumblr was crazy. They would ship Obama and Biden.

168
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,060
Oh, I kind of remember. I remember seeing posts from people who were like, "I'm making

169
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,260
that up, but if you did actually see shit, that's crazy."

170
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,660
No, not like shipping them, but you would always see those posts that were like them,

171
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,100
like Joe Biden, and it would be like writing dialogues between Joe Biden and Obama.

172
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Oh, Biden.

173
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
Oh, Biden.

174
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,100
He hated Joe Biden, though.

175
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,740
Yeah, well, no, but people would always write, like, make it like, "Joe Biden." I keep saying

176
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,740
Joe Biden would say like a pun to Obama and Obama would be like come on Joe.

177
00:08:53,740 --> 00:09:00,740
I would read the ones where it's like you got your finger in my mouth Barack.

178
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:08,740
How about you go and put your penis in there.

179
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:17,740
instead put your penis in my... I'm Obama now I'm gonna do it for my country. I had a necklace made of fingers.

180
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:28,740
I had a necklace made of fingers in Rhodesia. They based claw from Black Panther off me.

181
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:35,740
Okay, so Cameron can say necklace made of fingers and I can't say bone through nose.

182
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,580
Correct. How is that different? How is that different? That's way different. That's way

183
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:47,500
worse. He said the necklace made of fingers. Let him have it. This could be a lizard bone.

184
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,820
You can't say that. Lizards don't have bones. That's a lie. Lizards don't have bones either.

185
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,020
Lizards don't have bones. I'm fucking done with you guys. And plus it could be lizard

186
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:00,140
fingers. Yeah, and it could be plastic fingers. It could be a plastic bone. It could not be

187
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,980
a plastic bone. We could have bought it at fucking Urban Outfitters. It could not be

188
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,980
be a plastic how you don't know you never want a bone in your nose. I have.

189
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,980
You wore a bone through your nose. I wore a bone through my nose and big rings on my neck.

190
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,980
Okay and why did you do that? Because I was being racist. Star Wars cosplay?

191
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,980
Okay. I was being so racist. That's okay I guess.

192
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,980
Alright yeah I feel defeated. Yeah.

193
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,980
I had a castle.

194
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:31,980
It looked like the castle from Monty Python.

195
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,740
I went I went to Wakanda. I think I went I

196
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:45,500
and I saw I went to Philadelphia. I went

197
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:52,900
yeah. I think that's what it was. Yeah, that's where he says. I

198
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,740
went to a condo. I know one of his aids whispers in his ears

199
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:05,800
like Philadelphia I went to Wakanda famous for the cream cheese I saw a

200
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:13,240
Liberty Bell in Wakanda I saw I got I went to Geno's and then I went to Pat's I

201
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,920
went to Pat's again and then I went to Geno's again I kind of just kept I

202
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,760
forgot which one had my order he should they should do crazy frog with with Joe

203
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Joe Biden yeah. I think that would honestly. He does crazy frog when he tries to say any

204
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:40,340
word. If I did have a video with crazy frog in the oval office would Joe Biden be like

205
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,260
I'm here with my good friend crazy frog. Yep that would break the internet. That would

206
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,560
one break the internet. Aave club if you're listening to this get on it. You say the AAVE

229
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,160
and she hosted the Oscars. She hosted the Oscars now she has a Hulu show coming out.

230
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,680
They play an ad between yeah on every ad break where I'm watching Always Sunny.

a row of people saying that. Yeah I no disrespect to Amy Schumer as a

236
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,760
comedian but she needs to be completely treated like a King Kong style animal and

237
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,080
put in a cage and every special should just be her in a cage going "argh" banging on the

238
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,880
bars and stuff. But no disrespect to the comedian. And then people dressed up like the 1920s in the

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,880
audience pointing and laughing. Don't be afraid, it's just the fattest woman in the world. It's a

257
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,240
Yeah, I heard I hate fucking job of the hut

258
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:02,040
Yeah, dude, that's her line

259
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,520
Yeah job of the huts dick is very weak

260
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:11,000
He's got we came weird wick. Yeah, i'm fat. He's like literally a giant ball of slime

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,960
He's literally a garbage. He's a serious garbage pale kid literally

262
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:21,000
He's literally a fat slug, but he's not as disgusting as my very small pussy

263
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,720
or my ex oh

264
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,560
small yeah. I mean seriously Yoda can't even get his pinky up here yeah and we

265
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,040
tried.

266
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,200
Yoda's pinky is big.

267
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,120
Even an ant's pinky wouldn't go in my tiny ass.

268
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,040
Yoda's pinky was a penis.

269
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,200
If Yoda's pinky was a penis, that would be a huge penis.

270
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,320
What are you talking about? Yoda is tiny.

271
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,520
His pinky is huge.

272
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,560
Okay, I get what you're doing here, but that doesn't work because we're talking

273
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,840
about hands and you have a hand that everyone can see.

274
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Yoda has a hand in up his butt.

275
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,460
the control.

276
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,960
What doesn't you know how they originally wanted Yoda to be a

277
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,600
monkey in a costume is I wish they did that that would be so

278
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,900
they were going to put a monkey in a full costume. Yeah, imagine

279
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,980
how fucking terrifying awesome it would be so cool still with

280
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,180
Yoda's voice. It's like they're just like cutting like like

281
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,100
there's so many scenes, clips of just like a monkey running at a

282
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:19,460
crew member just over and over again. Every time they notice

283
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:25,180
yeah every time they cut to Yoda he's running directly at the camera. That'd be so sick.

284
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:30,580
Frank Oz is trying to like do the ADR or whatever. If they just spray painted a monkey that would

285
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,900
have been cool. I think that they should they should have to castrate all actors like they

286
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,580
do monkey actors. I agree. Yeah. Yeah. They castrate monkey actors. Yeah. So Dunstan had

287
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,260
Dunstan couldn't have sex. Dunstan yeah any any monkey well monkeys that are in movies

288
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,660
that either have to castrate them or they will attack all the women on set. Well there's

289
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,100
Here's that story of that Robert Downey movie that has the monkey in bed with the girl.

290
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,140
Oh yeah, and didn't the monkey wrangler, wasn't he like a...

291
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,940
He was like, yeah, for like 20 extra bucks, the monkey will fuck her.

292
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,140
And the girl was like, okay, I'm down.

293
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:11,060
And Robert Downey Sr. had to be like, no, you can't fuck this monkey for $20.

294
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,260
Yeah, monkeys can...

295
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,740
I've definitely talked about it before.

296
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,260
a movie with a baboon where the they couldn't have any crew members that were

297
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,700
on their periods because the baboon could smell it and would attack them I'm

298
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,180
serious you know you got a giant boner that's a airbrush it out of the movie

299
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,420
yeah it got a boner from a period it would know it just constantly had a

300
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:37,460
boner but it literally yeah there's like that's what happens if you don't if you

301
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,660
you don't castrate a monkey actor.

302
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,060
I'm serious.

303
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,260
The movie's called Shackma.

304
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,660
Shackma?

305
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:45,360
Shackma.

306
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,860
I want to see that boner.

307
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,360
Let's see here.

308
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,860
Is it disgusting?

309
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,760
Here's the baboon.

310
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,060
And it's just like and in the movie you can tell it's just

311
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,460
like genuinely a tat like it like it's like a horror movie.

312
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,560
So it's like runs at doors and stuff and it's just like actually

313
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,720
it like it goes like and like tries to rip the door open and stuff it's really

314
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,920
scary. Oh so it's about the monkey being evil. Yeah, yes, my god, you're terrifying.

315
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,560
Yeah, dude, oh they're really scary. Monkeys are scary. I don't fuck with

316
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,160
baboons at all. No, I saw baboons doing something very bad at the zoo to a

317
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,640
little baby baboon. Oh my god, I thought you're gonna say to a baby. Yeah, well to

318
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,640
yeah, a baby. What did they do to a human baby? They did something. One of them did

319
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,720
did a bad thing to a baby baboon a big baboon and a baby baboon.

320
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Wait, you saw this?

321
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,440
At a hulla baloo.

322
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,180
At a zoo?

323
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,720
Yeah.

324
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,320
A hulla baloo.

325
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,220
You saw a baby baboon get attacked by a-

326
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,020
Well, I didn't get it.

327
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,220
I saw an adult male baboon rape a baby male baboon at the zoo

328
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,920
in front of a bunch of kids.

329
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,620
I never told you that before.

330
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,320
Really?

331
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,620
You told us that?

332
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,820
That was- what zoo was that?

333
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,320
That was-

334
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,020
What zoo was that?

335
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
That might have been-

336
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
What zoo was that?

337
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm trying to remember when that was in Chicago. It wasn't Chicago because it

338
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,320
was just me and it must have been here. Maybe it was it might have been

339
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,720
prospect Park Zoo. Do they have baboons? I don't I've never been to any zoo

340
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,820
here. I would might have been Chicago. I don't fucking remember. I've been to

341
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:24,020
too many damn zoo went to a zoo and they chased it down and and yeah, yeah,

342
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,040
and there were kids watching and the parents are like

343
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,320
sure it was a baby. Yeah, you can tell if it's a baby. You can tell. Did it have a

344
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,960
diaper on? It was a baby. And a rattle? It was a tiny baby baboon. I choose to believe it was a small girl.

345
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,480
It was not a girl. Or a young man. Why would you choose to believe that? You can

346
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:51,520
just... You can erase the... Yeah. You don't even see it. You don't have to believe anything about it. You can visualize it as a cartoon and it doesn't exist. You can choose to believe that none of this happened. Yeah. I'm making it up.

347
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:56,120
Actually, I choose to believe that it was two babies now. Did you guys try to

348
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,440
talk me out of it. I went to the I think when I the first month I lived here no

349
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,440
wait yeah yeah yeah the couple weeks into me living here I went to the Bronx Zoo

350
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:15,320
by myself. It was cool but it's like I went on a Saturday and it was like all

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,000
see any of the cool animals I did see a red panda for the first time. What are you talking

354
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,160
about a fast pass? You get a fast pass for a zoo? Is there a line to see the animals?

355
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,640
The cheetah pass. There is like school exhibits, like the coolest exhibits you'd have to wait

356
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,920
in line for like hours. Damn I've never been to a zoo like that. Dude the bronc zoo gets

357
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,480
packed. The Chicago zoo is free and if any of the zoos here were free I would just go

What the hell? Really? You just made that up? Yeah, I can't go to the zoo.

363
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,520
What we did say we saw treadmill monkeys. Really? No, dude, stop at the

364
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,200

371
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,600
I can't go to the zoo if my mom asks me what I'm doing

372
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,060
and I tell her I'm at the zoo,

373
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,940
she fucking says that Rocky quote at me.

374
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,020
She's like, "Oh, retards love the zoo."

375
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,500
And it ruins the whole zoo day for me

376
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,340
'cause then it's like,

377
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,860

Beautiful place.

Seriously.

455
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
Horrifying history.

456
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,900
Yeah, really, the racist history of Farmville.

457
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,900
Yeah.

458
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,900
It was actually the first coup in, actually the second coup.

459
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,900
It used to be called Plantationville.

460
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,900
Yeah.

461
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,900
It's really bad.

462
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,900
They changed it to Farmville only two years ago.

463
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,900
Yeah, now it's really bad.

464
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
A lot of statues have come down in the past few years.

465
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,100
Yeah, they have a statue of Ulysses Hitler.

466
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,420
Mm-hmm, yeah. Joe Farm.

467
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,980
Joe Farm, who the town is named after.

468
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,940
The creator of it.

469
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:04,820
Joe Farm, the creator of Farmville, actually, he was called the Slave Punisher.

470
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:08,980
Yep. He was called Slave Hitler. That was his nickname.

471
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,460
Yeah.

472
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,380
And that was before Hitler.

473
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,300
Before Hitler.

474
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,500
That's how evil he was.

475
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:18,420
It's because he called them that because he hit them so much.

476
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:24,740
He hiddled them a lot. Yeah. Which is a seriously original kind of hitting he came up with.

477
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:29,460
It's southern slang. It's like Junebug or like Cheerwine or whatever. It's like stuff they make

478
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,540
up. Cheerwine isn't slang. It's stuff they make up that doesn't make sense down there because they're

479
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:39,140
all huffing glue. We're not huffing glue, okay? We have Gin X in our water supply. You have gin

480
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:42,580
in your water supply because you're all alcoholics. Yeah, my dad's damn house. What's up?

481
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,460
Yep, new Amsterdam gym.

482
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,460
And the damn water supply.

483
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,460
Now we have a Teflon by-product in almost every part of North Carolina's public water.

484
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,460
That is sick.

485
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,460

498
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,540
drank it cuz it's cool and delicious now the age of enlightenment goes because of

499
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,040
I didn't know everyone started drinking caffeine and was like what if we put

500
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,480
four wheels on a car yeah we already had a car yeah we had a three-wheel car we

501
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,700
invented the three-wheel car we were drunk he's falling over like shot

502
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:57,720
invented that's not the first car and then they're like that three wheels it

503
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,040
just looks stupid yeah it kind of looks like no a penis no it looks like a

504
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:06,640
slingshot asshole it looks like a penis and then you put four wheels on it looks

505
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,960
like a box okay no it looks are they expensive is a slingshot yeah I don't

506
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,240
think they look expensive but they're not they're the most expensive car you can

507
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,520
buy it's like made of plastic it like this that is the most expensive vehicle

508
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:25,360
it should be cheaper cuz it's it should be cheaper than any four-wheeled car

509
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,720
cuz it definitely yeah it should be a three I'd be like a price match thing

510
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,600
where it's like you can pay three quarters of the price thousand dollars

511
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,180
for that super cheap I would I would guess that it's 50 a slingshot for the

512
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:42,120
office I'm down yeah I would love to have one there's a stick that would be cool

00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,400
Dude, five slingshots on tour?

Yeah.

552
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,400
We all--

553
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,200
Just a convoy?

554
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Yeah, a convoy of slingshots.

555
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,560
You two can't drive.

556
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:05,440
Just driving 90 miles an hour down the highway in a slingshot.

557
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,840
I don't think they go very fast. I think they're really just for parades.

558
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,880
Yeah.

559
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,440
They're for looking like a grinch.

560
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:14,800
Hi, I'm interested in your product. I would like some more details.

561
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
I'm going to look on Facebook Marketplace for a--

562
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:24,880
looking forward to your send sign in with Google okay. I bet they have one on

563
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,240
Facebook marketplace right they have to for a Polaris link shot yeah maybe it's

564
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,480
got to be that's got to be the cheapest place to buy one. I wonder if you get it

565
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,760
shipped market. I feel like it might come in pieces and you have to put it together

566
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:41,560
ten thousand dollars. Oh, it says it says beware

567
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:48,600
beware beware. What does this mean? I'm guessing that's got eleven thousand

568
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,920
miles on it. Structural day. Do you want to buy a structural damage?

569
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:59,780
Polaris? How do you put a let I know miles on a fucking slingshot? I mean, I

570
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,760
guess if you have a slingshot, you're taking that shit everywhere. Yeah, do

571
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:06,660
that's not a thing you like leave in the garage. Oh, in my day that like down

572
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,280
I know I leave it in the garage and I use it as like a couch. I'm not going to

573
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,800
fucking drive that thing around. Let me see if I can sort by lowest price. I'm

574
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,480
going to take that to my office job. Here's one for one dollar. Oh my God,

575
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,160
really? I love when they do that on Marketplace when they do like in search

576
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:29,280
of yeah. Okay, one dollar one dollar lots of one dollar ones. Oh, how about

577
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:35,240
this one? Look at this a Kawasaki Ninja. That's the same thing, but I'm guessing

578
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,080
better because it's not a fucking Polaris link. Oh, it's his turbo on it.

579
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,400
Yeah,

580
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,600
yeah,

581
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,000
you make more stupid cars. We could yeah,

582
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,400
we could get this twenty five thousand.

583
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,000
What did you buy this

584
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,200
mini cup race car? You guys ever do like a pine wood derby or anything? No,

585
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,240
I wish I that seems like fun. My dad did with my brother when they were in my

586
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:07,620
and my brothers and like boys cats. My dad was like we're going to make the

587
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,800
wheels on the thing out of pennies. He's like that that's going to work really

588
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,320
well, drill a hole in a penny and they like and all the other kids use like

589
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,680
fucking little wheels on their thing. My dad was like we're going to use

590
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,740
pennies and then they started the race and my brother's car just didn't even it

591
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,240
didn't move at all. Why would pennies move listen to this this? I just found

592
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,360
this when I was looking to to buy a slingshot on on Facebook marketplace

593
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,880

595
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:44,960
this summer have lots of real estate on the car for advertising not looking for a lot

596
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,800

597
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,200
you to purchase your own stickers to put on the cart both sides front back and helmet

598
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:59,200

702
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,720
'cause there was some kid in the stall,

703
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,420

00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:17,960
'cause I was screaming it, and she walked into the bathroom,

707
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,420
and I was like, "Huh?"

708
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,680
'Cause there's a girl in the boys' bathroom,

709
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,040
it's Mrs. Gray and she was like, "You shouldn't be doing that." I was like,

710
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,880
"Okay, I'm sorry." When I was in first grade, I worked at the FBI and I went

714
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,100

715
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,940

It was my birthday.

857
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,060
Yeah and you didn't even want to have an egg hunt.

858
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,060
That's kind of fucked up.

859
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:28,060
Why would I want to have?

860
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:29,060
I don't want eggs on my birthday.

861
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,060
It was Easter on your birthday.

862
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,900
- A plastic egg?

863
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,080
- A cigarette hunt.

864
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,920
- What?

865
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:33,760
- You can put that inside the eggs,

866
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,040
that's the point, you put anything in the eggs.

867
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,280
- How am I supposed to open up an egg

868
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,120
and drain all the juice out?

869
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,700
- You never heard of a plastic egg?

870
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:42,680
And also you drain all the juice out when you die an egg.

871
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,840
- A plastic egg isn't an egg at all.

872
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,780
- Are you one of those freaks who dies a hard boiled egg

873
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:46,620
like a weirdo?

874
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,440
- Yes.

875
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,600
- What? - I never got that.

876
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,120
- Dying a hard boiled egg?

877
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:52,880
What, you die it and then you paint it with the vinegar?

878
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,200
- You can't even eat those eggs after

879
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,720
'cause they're covered in paint.

880
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,240
- Yes you can, you die it, it's on a shell.

881
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:01,280
it's no it's way better to drain it. I have you never you never blown the yoke

00:49:54,200 --> 00:50:00,340
tall and you're two inches tall. Pause. I'm not pausing. He noticed another man's height.

909
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:06,200
I didn't even notice. You noticed. So if I notice, so you admit it's true then. Yes.

Yeah, okay. That's all I need. I'm two inches tall. See if I give a fuck. I still fuck models.

911
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:19,480
Limbo. Hey, nowadays with the way the culture is treating height and how much people like

912
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,360
freaking tall man and Limbo is the one game you don't want to win.

913
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,720
True!

914
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,560
Okay. Seems like nowadays in the news with all this height stuff, Limbo is one of those

915
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,880
games you don't want to win at the Easter party. You don't even want to win this game.

916
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,520
Seems like this is one of the Easter games you want to lose. Okay, picture this,

917
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,600
you're at an Easter party, right?

918
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,120
You're at the biggest Easter party of the year. A million hot girls and they're not your family.

919
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,640
You're at a different family's Easter party. Let's just say they're bunnies.

920
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,760
yeah complete limbo, complete limbo and you're saying listen. I could go pretty

921
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,460
low yeah on one of these bitches, but I'm not going to show you my high bitch.

922
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,240
You have to pull out a tape measure or take me to the doctor and you know,

923
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,580
then I'm not going to take my shoes off and it seems like nowadays. If I played

924
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:05,720
this game, I'd rather lose than win. Yeah, never ask a woman her her. It's

925
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:09,560
like golf and never ask a man. If he wants to play limbo, yep yeah, because

926
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:13,440
he's going to say no yeah limbo is like golf. It's one of those games you want.

927
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:14,900
you don't even want to win.

928
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,220
- Listen, I may be small,

929
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:19,360
but I could still house a damn hungry man.

930
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,820
(laughing)

931
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,380
I'll take it down.

932
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,380
I'll eat it.

933
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,620
- Do you ever tell you about the--

934
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,100
- Within an hour, I'll eat an entire hungry man.

935
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:31,220
- I bought a hungry man recently,

936
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:33,660
like a couple months ago.

937
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:34,880
- Salisbury?

938
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,100
- No, I bought the fried chicken selects one.

939
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,700
I was pretty drunk.

940
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,940
I was coming home from a bar.

941
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,140
- No, and you left it in the oven, right?

942
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,160
- Yeah, I fell asleep with it in my oven.

943
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:49,460
Yeah, I wish it had just burned you alive. It would have been so it would have been so funny

944
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:54,820
We should have killed everybody on your entire block. Yeah one hungry man one hungry man single hungry

945
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:01,560
I just burnt just blowing up an entire sources are saying the fire was started after a stupid man fell asleep

00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,840
Eating a hungry man waiting for his hungry man this

947
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,360
On succession the source of the fire was this fat piece of shit. It's just a picture of the guy

948
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,360
He has the Hungry Man.

949
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,360
There's a picture of the guy buying a Hungry Man at the store.

950
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,360
It's just like in grey sweatpants and a mustard stain.

951
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,360
If you're wondering where we got that photo, a patron of the grocery store just thought he looked stupid.

952
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:30,360
Just him checking out. It's like it's got the Snapchat thing on it.

953
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,360
It's like look at this fat piece of shit buying a Hungry Man.

954
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,360
I bet he's going to burn down his block later.

955
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:39,360
Cut to that.

956
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:44,480

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,620
it was don't tell me it looked like charcoal a brownie already looks like a piece of charcoal

976
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,860
if you told me the broccoli turned black then i might be a little impressed

977
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:59,660
this guy doesn't know a fucking thing about hungry mans

978
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:03,340
what is it you think the brownie is not is not brown and black no there's no broccoli

979
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:07,460
and hungry man there isn't the broccoli cheese surprise there's not a hungry man

980
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,460
broccoli cheese surprise extra with funfetti ice cream there's no fun well

981
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,700
how would you get all goes in the same oven why would there be ice cream it's

982
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:20,140
heatproof yeah ice cream I give you if you put if you put ice cream in the oven

983
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:24,540
it hardens like like model magic you're just jealous because you've never had

984
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,580
the different flavors of hungry man that I've had yeah yeah what are those this

985
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,580
this must be some hungry man in Japan.

986
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,180
- Calamari.

987
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,900
They have a calamari hungry man.

988
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,900
- Oh my God.

989
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:36,240
- Calamari and a ginger salad.

990
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,200
- Fried calamari.

991
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,440
- And yeah, it also has the funfetti ice cream

992
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,520
that's heat proof.

993
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,700
Okay, and you can put it in the oven for up to one hour

994
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,540
and it will be fine.

995
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:46,100
- Yeah, they heat proof the ice cream.

996
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,240
It comes in like plastic wrap that blocks the heat.

997
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:49,080
- Actually--

998
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:49,900
- It comes in a radiation shield.

999
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,740
- I just remembered, I just changed my memory

1000
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,580
and it's actually, it's reverse ice cream

1001
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:57,660
So it comes hot and you heat it up and it becomes cold.

1002
00:54:57,660 --> 00:54:59,660
But when it's in the frozen section, it's piping hot.

1003
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,660
It's like, "Ah, ah, ah!"

1004
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:06,340
You have to hot potato it into the oven, and then when you take it out, it's ice cold.

1005
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:08,020
It burns your hand from coldness.

1006
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,020
Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,020
It's opposites.

1008
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:12,220
So this limbo bar.

1009
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,220
Opposites attract, right?

1010
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,220
Yes.

1011
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,220
That's why you put ice cream in the oven.

1012
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,220
That's a myth.

1013
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,220
That's a myth.

1014
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,220
That's a myth.

1015
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,220
So the mayor's reaction.

1016
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:20,820
So isn't poop the opposite of my mouth?

1017
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:21,820
Yes.

1018
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:22,820
No.

1019
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:23,820
Your butt's the opposite of your mouth.

1020
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:28,940
is there to make a lot of the opposite of your mouth is probably your foot okay

- Make a limbo stick.

1046
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,820
- Can I read your review of the limbo stick?

1047
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,140
- It's been so stressful having an office,

1048
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,940
can we please go on a retreat?

1049
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:43,780
- Yes. - I would love

1050
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:44,600
to go on a retreat.

1051
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,460
- Where would we go on a business retreat to?

1052
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:47,920
- Six Flags.

1053
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,540
- Six Flags would be pretty rollercoaster, rock and rolling.

1054
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:53,380
- Yeah, that's a good point.

1055
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:56,580
- I'm a little bit scared of going really fast.

1056
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,420
- Okay, that's on you.

1057
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:58,860
- You could go on the small coasters.

1058
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,300
- I am a little worried about rollercoasters now

1059
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,260
that a couple people have died on rollercoasters

1060
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:04,100
in the past year.

1061
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,620
- Those are carnival rides.

1062
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:06,620
- Nuh-uh.

1063
00:58:06,620 --> 00:58:10,180
there were two drop towers yeah no the drop tower was it was at icon park

1064
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:13,500
that's like not a real that's like well there was one there but it was like it

1065
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,780
was a good drop tower it was the same like like manufacturer it's not in like

1066
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,860
a real park though though I've been to that place that's like not that does

1067
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,500
matter it's a restaurant but I'm saying they're not it's not like like I feel

1068
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,500
like I like all the ones that I like have like like staff and stuff like that

1069
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:33,500
one that's like a that's like a teenagers okay run the other one was was

1070
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:37,780
a little girl died in a mine shaft drop tower. Well that's that she should have

1071
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:42,900
been mining. She's a child. You should not be letting your kids spelunk at that age.

1072
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:47,340
She died of black lung. Yeah, yeah, that's true. Yeah, no, but the Icon Park one, that was

1073
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:52,940
yeah that was like a teenagers operated ride. Also I guess I'm like probably the

1074
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:57,420
exact size of it. It's so crazy that they... You know why I am scared? Why? Because I look

1075
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,980
exactly like a crash dummy. Yeah. So I'm worried that they might get confused.

1076
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:09,080
Oh, we're testing the ride today. Oh, I say there's a crash dummy on the ride. We'll just we'll just leave him on buckle

1077
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:15,980
Yeah, oh, that's cool. They added a we need to see what happens if a guy doesn't buck out boy. That's the yeah, what happens?

1078
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:18,900
Yeah, it would just worry me a little bit

1079
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,780
I would be I would be slightly mistaken for a mannequin a lot when I'm walking down the street people start putting clothes on me

1080
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:27,220
I walk by a telco all of a sudden. I have a Kangol hat and

1081
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:32,780
I'm wearing sweatpants. I say mama. Yeah, I get mistaken for the axe chocolate guy all the time

1082
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:39,280
No. Yeah, I do. You don't. Women lick me. Women don't lick you. Women, a woman stole

1083
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,140
my arm the other day and started eating it. That is something that would happen

1084
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:47,140
to me as a mannequin, not you as a chocolate. That would, somebody, a teenager, a teenager,

1085
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:54,220
would steal your arm as a mannequin, yes, but because I'm, people mistake me

1086
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:58,140
for the axe chocolate guy, they steal my arm and they eat it like, and they put,

1087
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:02,660
they melted like if it's like it's an I forgot though people people mistake me

1088
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:08,940
you don't Broadway star really I don't I don't think you do Cameron put us side by

1089
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:13,060
side you have chocolate skin I have shit does that mean my skin is straight

1090
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:18,340
vanilla mm-hmm damn mm-hmm I look like a chocolate guy I'm strawberry I'm

1091
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:22,080
strawberry you are I'm ready said you're vanilla so you can't switch okay I'm all

1092
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:26,740
three no I'm a sweet combination I'm an old and I'm not Neapolitan I'm head to

1093
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:33,820
I'm the ice cream man. I'm made of ice cream guys. No, no, it's not my profession, it's

1094
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:39,860
my race. If you guys, if you guys, okay, if your entire body was Neapolitan ice cream,

1095
01:00:39,860 --> 01:00:48,940
what sections are you putting where? I think I might go red legs, black top, white middle.

1096
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:53,620
I mean there's really only two combinations you can pick. It's not true. That's not true.

1097
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,500
- Yeah, there's only two because--

1098
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:56,780
- There's three flavors.

1099
01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:00,220
- There's three flavors, but Neapolitan is always

1100
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,340
strawberry, vanilla, chocolate.

1101
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,540
- It doesn't matter what Neapolitan always is.

1102
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,100
- We're breaking that rule.

1103
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:08,580
- So, no, 'cause then this is just,

1104
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:11,300
no, there's only two 'cause you can only do

1105
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:12,820
that combination or the reverse.

1106
01:01:12,820 --> 01:01:14,060
- So what are the two combinations?

1107
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:15,180
- You aren't made of ice cream.

1108
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:17,220
That's why I think that you have to,

1109
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,660
'cause I don't really like chocolate ice cream.

1110
01:01:18,660 --> 01:01:20,260
I feel like most people don't, right?

1111
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,620
So you make chocolate your head

1112
01:01:22,620 --> 01:01:26,540
so that you can keep your head without somebody eating it. A lot of people

1113
01:01:26,540 --> 01:01:30,060
like people like chocolate. I don't like rest of it's covered in clothes and

1114
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,080
then people won't even notice

1115
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:35,980
that it's ice cream. Yeah, okay. I mean if I was ice cream, I probably just

1116
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:39,720
wouldn't I would wouldn't go outside in the freezer. Yeah, not me. Well, I

1117
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,500
would be reverse. I'd be the ice cream from the hungry man that actually so

1118
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:45,620
you have to get cooked in the oven. No, I'd go out and cook in the sun in the

1119
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:49,100
summertime. Oh, what about the winter summer? So you get so overheated in the

1120
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,020
winter. Do you guys hear my summer song? I came up with yesterday. That's pretty

1121
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:57,040
Summer time to swing on the summer swing.

1122
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,040
I didn't show you that?

1123
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:00,040
No, I don't think you did.

1124
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:02,040
Alright, so what's the deal? We're on tour right now?

1125
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,040
We're not on tour. Yeah, we're on tour in four days.

1126
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,040
Okay.

1127
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,040
When this comes out.

1128
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,040
Fuck.

1129
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:11,040
So, guys, we only have four days left.

1130
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,040
I don't give a shit. I don't care either.

1131
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,040
But you guys should buy tickets, please, because it's going to be fun,

1132
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:19,040
and you're not going to want to miss it because we're all going to ritually kill ourselves after the tour.

1133
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,040
This is your last chance.

1134
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,040
Yep.

1135
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,360
You will never see me alive again.

1136
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:25,560
Yes, if you would.

1137
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,200
We are going to die in a car accident on the tour.

1138
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,200
Absolutely.

1139
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,200
There's no question.

1140
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,440
Swagpoop.com/shows.

1141
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:34,880
There's lots of shows and links to buy.

1142
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,880
There we added some.

1143
01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:38,560
I know some people were disappointed that some shows were like 21 plus or whatever.

1144
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:41,120
I think we added a few all ages and 18 plus.

1145
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,120
LA and Chicago.

1146
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,520
LA and Chicago we added 18 plus and all ages.

1147
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:46,840
We added a 3 plus show.

1148
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:49,760
Yeah, you have to be above 3.

1149
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,960
We added a dog friendly show.

1150
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:56,640
We added a dog friendly show in Bone Town.

1151
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:00,680
And we, um, yeah we're dead by the time this comes out.

1152
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:01,680
All of us died.

1153
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:02,680
Yeah.

1154
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,680
Alright.
