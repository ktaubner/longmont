I'm recording. Wait, let's do the-

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,800
Wait, we got a backdrop here, so-

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:19,400
You're wearing wireless headphones, Patrick, and you've got a hat on.

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,400
Boy, it looks like he's- with that hat and those headphones, he looks like a steampunk train conductor.

9
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,000
Alright, Pat, I think you said- you said no or something.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,600
I said I don't.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:34,400
You don't? Okay. Yeah, you look like Criss Angel. No, wait. Don't say anything.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Mm-hmm.

13
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,900
Yeah, Ruth's Criss Angel.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,900
[laughs]

15
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,900
Yeah.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,400
Fucking fat magic man.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,900
This guy looks like Christmas Cookies Angel.

18
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,900
Yeah.

19
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,900
[laughs]

20
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,900
Yeah, Crispy Chicken Angel.

21
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,900
[laughs]

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,900
Chips Angel.

23
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,900
Okay.

24
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,900
[laughs]

25
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,900
Chips Angel.

26
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,900
I'm gonna make these chips disappear.

27
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:56,900
Yeah.

28
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,900
Turn around.

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,900
[laughs]

30
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,900
This guy's looking like Chip's angel food cake.

31
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,900
I made them disappear in my mouth.

32
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,900
The funniest part about Criss Angel is that he's got a speech impediment.

33
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,900
His accent is so good.

34
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,900
He has a lisp. I always said he's just a New York accent, but there's something wrong with his tongue.

35
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,900
He has a big tongue.

36
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,900
He does?

37
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,900
Yeah. I'm gonna make his tongue disappear.

38
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900
Yeah, in your ass.

39
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,900
Yeah, in your butt.

40
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,900
Having sex with him would be scary, because remember that one...

41
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:35,900
that one I made the condom disappear yeah you're really risking having a kid if

42
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,780
you have sex with any magician ever right yeah they gotta make everything

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,060

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:54,260
turning it inside out times yeah man he's gonna make a dove crawl out of your

45
00:01:54,260 --> 00:02:00,180
pussy after you're done. Yeah, he's pulling a bunch of maxi pads tied

46
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,780
together out of your vagina. Oh fuck, I'm worried that the homeless women on my

47
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,500

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,240
I don't get dizzy, I get even.

56
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,360
(laughing)

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
I do, dude.

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,920
I can't be spun.

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,000
Yeah.

60
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,960
Yeah, I don't get it, I don't even,

61
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,360
it doesn't phase me, I'm unfazeable in that way.

62
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
It's kind of awesome.

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,880
It's one of my many abilities that I have.

64
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,380
You have at tops one ability.

65
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,380
I have two abilities, that and credit card debt.

66
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,220
Yeah, that's an ability.

67
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,640
And those are my two abilities.

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,700
And I unlocked it about eight months ago.

69
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,300
It's been a great ability so far.

70
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,740
What are you guys drinking?

71
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,740
I got water.

72
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:20,700
I got coffee and water.

73
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,620
I'm back to drinking and smoking alcohol and...

74
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,100
I might smoke alcohol again.

75
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,460
Let me see how many days I have.

76
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,820
I made it two weeks.

77
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,100
That was all I needed.

78
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,260
Pat's gonna do way better than you, Caleb.

79
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,260
I literally said I was doing it for two weeks and I made it two weeks.

80
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,700
I don't know if I'm gonna do better than you.

81
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,700
He will not.

82
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,300
I'm at six and a half days.

83
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,660
I mean that's pretty--

84
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,500
- It's tough man, it's just so fucking boring.

85
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,060
- Right, yeah, I don't know what to like--

86
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,100
- I thought that a TV would help me.

87
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,500
I thought that I got a TV and put it in my bedroom,

88
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:56,980
I was like this is how I will stop drinking and smoking.

89
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,380
And then I just sit in front and watch basketball

90
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,940
on the front of my bed.

91
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,740
- You don't need a beer to watch sports.

92
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,700
- I want a fat rolled one dude,

93
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
I don't want to smoke a Scooby snack.

94
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,700
You know?

95
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,700
[Burps]

96
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,700
What are you burping on?

97
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,700
Oh! Oh!

98
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,700
What are you burping on?

99
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
What are you burping on?

100
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,700
Yeah, burp check.

101
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,700
What are you burping on?

102
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,700
I went to the dentist

103
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,700
a few days ago.

104
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,700
And...

105
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
The dentist was like...

106
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,700
It was just for like a

107
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:38,380
teeth cleaning and after he cleaned my teeth he was just talking about like

108
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:44,620
like he was like talking about how he was really excited because there was a new toothpaste drop

109
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,540
he was like yeah they just came out with this new toothpaste you have to check this out dude

110
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,940
and then he was telling and then he was like and then he was like and he was like and i'm

111
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,180
gonna give you some of this waxed floss i'm really pissed off because the company discontinued my

112
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,100
favorite kind of floss but i've been in contact with them and i can tell you i think they're

113
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:06,540
they're gonna bring it back. I guess you I mean... That's what you do as a dentist.

114
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:11,140
Like if you're a human you can really only be interested in one thing. Yeah. You

115
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,460
know like if you're gonna do it well like Michael Jordan it was basketball

116
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,860
this guy it's... I guess he does just keep... do you think there's like a

117
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:26,620
website there's like there's like a like a... Tom's of Maine. It's like yeah

118
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,540
no it was just it was I've been thinking about it so much just like of course

119
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,300
that's what a dentist would do. They would keep track of all their, like the new drops.

120
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,540
Dentist that's like a Richard Scarry job. It's like one of the base 15 jobs that my

121
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:46,420
brain understands as a job. Yeah, that's one of the jobs that animals can do. Yeah,

122
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:53,740
exactly. Dentist, construction worker. A donkey could clean your teeth. Yeah, he could. I'd

123
00:05:53,740 --> 00:06:00,220
let a donkey touch my mouth. You would? What other animals would you let touch your mouth?

124
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Yeah, let's go through them.

125
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,220
Where do you draw the line?

126
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:03,220
Probably...

127
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,220
How inhuman can we get?

128
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220
Salamander.

129
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,220
No.

130
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,220
Alligator.

131
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,220
What?

132
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,220
You'd let a donkey touch your teeth but not a salamander?

133
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,220
I would not let a reptile touch my teeth.

134
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,220
Why do you...

135
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,220
Why not?

136
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,220
Why would you not let a reptile in your mouth?

137
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,220
Uh, scales.

138
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,220
Salamanders don't have scales.

139
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,220
You think it'll give you scales?

140
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,220
Yeah, it'll give me scales.

141
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,220
Also, salamanders aren't reptiles.

142
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,220
I don't want anything sticky on my teeth.

143
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,220
Reptiles aren't sticky.

144
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,220
And they have sticky...

145
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Except candy.

146
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,220
What about Skittles?

147
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,220
I owned a gecko.

148
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,220
I owned a gecko.

149
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,220
I owned a gecko.

150
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:35,500
except candy I own the gecko I owned a gecko I know he climbs up a glass no he

151
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,460
does why do you know him anymore yeah he died yeah yeah I I used to own various

152
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:48,620
reptiles and bugs would you let a bottom you had a bug

153
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Yeah, I had a pet bug on a tiny dental floss leash, and I'd walk him around the neighborhood.

154
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,620
I had to clean up after him.

155
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,120
Patrick, would you let a bug touch your mouth?

156
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,620
I would not let a bug touch my mouth.

157
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,620
What if it was the more...

158
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
What if... okay.

159
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,620
If it was like a... if it was a gorilla dressed up like a dentist.

160
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,620
You would notice.

161
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,620
I don't think I'd notice.

162
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,120
I don't think... I think gorillas' hands are too big to be a dentist.

163
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,620
He'd end up just like...

164
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,620
Yeah, if you...

165
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,620
You'd choke on his fingers.

166
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,340
dentist I need a dentist with tiny ass hands.

167
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,180
- So I'm so confused why you wouldn't,

168
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,020
why would you not let--

169
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,760
- No, just a person, just a person.

170
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,260
Like if it's a dentist, he's gotta--

171
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,220
- Got a small mouth?

172
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,420
- I don't want someone's fuckin' hot dog fingers

173
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,260
in my mouth, you know?

174
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,080
- 'Cause that's what dentists do,

175
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,860
they stick their whole hand in your mouth.

176
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,700
They kinda do.

177
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,540
- They kinda do.

178
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,360
(gagging)

179
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,660
- My dentist does, yeah.

180
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:41,180
- I think you guys have freaky dentists who are into stuff.

181
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,860
- Well I actually do go to a freaky dentist.

182
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,500
The last, second to last dentist I went to left the, you know the sucker thing?

183
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,260
Like the thing that dries your mouth out?

184
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,780
Patrick keeps going to different dentists and they keep just looking at him and going

185
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,820
"Ugh!" and just running out of the place.

186
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:06,020
Yeah. No, this dude, so he left the sucker thing in my mouth for like 30 minutes and I was like,

187
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,940
"Oh, he must be going to the bathroom or something." And then he comes back in and he-

188
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,220
30 minutes?

189
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,420
Yeah, like 30 minutes.

190
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,620
And you survived.

191
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,620
I'm sitting there just like

192
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,980
and he's like

193
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,940
he comes back in and

194
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:25,640
He fucking is with somebody else. I'm like, I think I was like 15

195
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,740
he's no I was 14, so he comes back in with somebody else and

196
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,300
he is like

197
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:38,500
It's someone from his church and he's giving them a cassette tape of his wife's organ music

198
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,380
So he was gone for like 30 minutes because someone texted him and is like hey

199
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,060
I'm here and then he came in he's like oh you're gonna you're gonna love it you're

200
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,420
gonna love it track three she does this cover of fucking this song it's amazing

201
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,740
let me get this clear were you strapped to the chair yeah why didn't you do I

202
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:00,740
didn't you just take it out of your mouth I don't I didn't know what he was

203
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,060
gonna be back I thought if I took it out that he came back he would you would flip

204
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,540
out I'm 14 I was 14 I don't wanna look like I what if he's good like weird about

205
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,060
his tools you know. You should turn it on him. You don't touch your uncle's tools in the shed.

206
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,620
Yeah you do. I would touch my uncle's tools if he put them in my mouth and left them there for

207
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,220
30 minutes. Yeah. It's different. It's different. Yeah your uncle put his tool in your mouth.

208
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:33,460
That's true. When I was in high school, I um, when I was having like really bad sleep problems and I

209
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,780
couldn't sleep, I fell asleep at the orthodontist in the in the chair and and I yeah I got like I

210
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:44,060
I kept waking up, I kept falling asleep and waking up just like from the sensation of

211
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,300
someone putting hands in my mouth.

212
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:51,340
That was probably one of the most real life nightmare experiences I've ever had.

213
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,180
I wish I could sleep with a dentist.

214
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:58,700
No dude, just imagine waking up because somebody is reaching into your mouth.

215
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,060
That's probably like the worst experience you can have.

216
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,500
That's a jackass prank.

217
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,940
I would just pretend that I'm eating a big hoagie.

218
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,500
You can't pretend when you're asleep, it's not possible.

219
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,060
You can pretend in your sleep.

220
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,700
- The imagination can either dream or play pretend.

221
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,640
You can't do both.

222
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,780
Exactly.

223
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,620
- That's right, Patrick has no answer to that.

224
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,860
I was taking a jewel hit.

225
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,220
- Have you guys ever tried to do astral projection?

226
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,460
- Yeah.

227
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,300
- You have?

228
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,380
- Yeah, I know Cameron has.

229
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,260
- Yeah, I tried to in high school.

230
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,700
- I know fucking Cameron has.

231
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,980
- Yeah, and when I was in high school I used to,

232
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:42,700
I got obsessed with it because I heard Sinbad talk about it on the podcast.

233
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,740
He was like, "Yo, I used to be astral projecting all the time."

234
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:51,220
He said that he used to do it all the time and that he like one time traveled to China

235
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,300
while he was astral projecting.

236
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,340
And he was like, "But I don't play that voodoo shit anymore."

237
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,340
Anymore?

238
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,340
Yeah.

239
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,140
That's dangerous, dude.

240
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,260
But I was like, "I'm young.

241
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,420
I have nothing to live for.

242
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,420
I want to go to China."

243
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,300
So I would try every night, I would...

244
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,140
- How does it even work?

245
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,960
- How does it even work?

246
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,800
- Yeah, no, yeah, that's like a lucid--

247
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,640
- How does it even work?

248
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,460
It doesn't.

249
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,300
- Yeah, what do you, right.

250
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,880
- You become a ghost.

251
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,380
So what I, but his advice, his technique,

252
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,460
is that he would sit on his bed

253
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,840
and then like almost fall asleep

254
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,080
and then right before he fell asleep,

255
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,580
he would reach out at like something

256
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,580
that he'd placed on his bed, like a rock,

257
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,100
and then he would leave his body

258
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,620
and then he would go to China.

259
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,140
(laughing)

260
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,820
- He had to get on a plane, he had to go to the airport.

261
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,660
- Yeah, you can't float.

262
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,500
- No, he fell asleep.

263
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,660
- You just have to wait.

264
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,180
- Also, everybody can see you.

265
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,180
- Yeah, right.

266
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,260
- Yeah, and you're fully clothed.

267
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,940
But I just wanted to, I don't know, go to the WBA.

268
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,460
- I would try to lucid dream and never wore,

269
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,660
I could never do it.

270
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,340
One time I got sleep paralysis at school

271
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,280
'cause I fell asleep after a test

272
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,740
and then I could hear people being like,

273
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:03,340
"Wake up," but I couldn't move at my desk.

274
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,340
Oh my god.

275
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Damn.

276
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,340
That sucks dude.

277
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
Yeah, dude.

278
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,340
Evil.

279
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,340
I tried to do lucid dreaming because of something Ray Romano said.

280
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:12,340
What'd he say?

281
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,780
Ray Romano, Ray Romano's a lucid dream guy.

282
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
I watched an interview.

283
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,460
I'm sensing a trend between you guys' experiences.

284
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,460
Yeah.

285
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,100
I watched, it was a Pete Holmes interview on the Pete Holmes show of Ray Romano.

286
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,620
There are worlds beyond our comprehension.

287
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,460
I kinda just astral project to get away from my freaking wife.

288
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,660
That fucking rocks dude.

289
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,660
What is up with comedians being completely insane?

290
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
Yeah, who would know?

291
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
Who would have thought?

292
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,660
Yeah.

293
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,660
When I was a...

294
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,220
I got really into lucid dreaming.

295
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:44,520
I did it a lot when I was growing up.

296
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,980
And I got into it when I...

297
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:52,420
I have to have said this before, but I got into it when I was staying with my cousins

298
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,100
in California.

299
00:12:54,100 --> 00:13:00,460
And one of my cousins picked up this girl at a gas station and then brought her back to

300
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,960
the house.

301
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,020
I was like 14 and I was like, "Damn, she's so hot."

302
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:10,040
And then I took a nap and while I was napping,

303
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,600
I started lucid dreaming and I was like,

304
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,500
"Oh my God, the possibilities are endless.

305
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,780
"I can do whatever I want.

306
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:18,480
"Let me just imagine getting a blow job from that girl."

307
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,920
(laughing)

308
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,820
And then I woke up just covered in my own cum

309
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,240
and I've been trying to do that ever since.

310
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,720
I've been trying to get back there.

311
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,560
It was amazing, dude.

312
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,840
It was like Minecraft.

313
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,080
(laughing)

314
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,480
- It was sick.

315
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,320
- I gotta, I gotta figure out how to do this.

316
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,200
- I feel like I should apologize to her.

317
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,480
(laughing)

318
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,440
I'm sorry, gas station lady, if you're listening.

319
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,020
- You can do that in Minecraft,

320
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,080
but the only other creatures in Minecraft

321
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,360
are like cows and pigs and stuff, so nobody does it.

322
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,200
- Right.

323
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,440
- Nobody has sex, nobody has--

324
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:53,400
- Unless you're on an MP server.

325
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,240
- Yeah.

326
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,360
- Yeah, Patrick goes on an MP server,

327
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,840
minors and

328
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,580
uh... no files

329
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,340
you know i was a bit of a little bit of just said that you thought that up so

330
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,120
bad on those good miners and i'll tell you what i would have said that i had

331
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,720
your pedophile or something no miners and pedophiles you know what a minor

332
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,760
insurgency and it's like jailbreak on

333
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,680
on the head like absolutely there's a lot there's miners and there's pedophiles

334
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,560
and i have to play well right now i get it

335
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,800
now you make that be a good role play server on gmail

336
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,720
yet we should make that yeah

337
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,720
I'm gonna get in touch with Gabriel.

338
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,720
No, because everyone who plays Gmod is either 12 years old or 40.

339
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
You can't, that would be too real.

340
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,720
I guess the entire thing is Miners vs. Penoply.

341
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
You would just open up a world of like...

342
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
You would just open up a very toxic community.

343
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,720
No, I think it would actually be really friendly and positive to Miners.

344
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
It would be great for the kids.

345
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,720
Alright, before we get this started, let's have a good game, boys.

346
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
You have referees.

347
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,240
Yeah, we need to make sure that everybody on both teams recognizes that they are valid and

348
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:03,800
Just like very like positive. I'm taking a knee on the pedophile side during the national anthem at the beginning of the game

349
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,840
Sometimes you got to take a stand dude. Yeah

350
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,440
Yeah, they sing the pedophile anthem at the beginning of the game, and I don't support that kind of thing

351
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
Yeah, it's Gary Glitter rock and roll part two

352
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,440
It's just them going "da-na-na-na, hey!"

353
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:29,440
No, it's that song that's like "I love little girls, they make me feel so good."

354
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Oh, Oingo Boingo?

355
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,440
That's the same guy who wrote the Simpsons theme song.

356
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
What a poorly aged...

357
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Yeah, I know.

358
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,440
Really?

359
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,440
Yeah.

360
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,440
That's Danny Hoffman.

361
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,440
I knew Caleb didn't know that.

362
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,440
I knew Cameron knew that, though.

363
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
You didn't know I knew that?

364
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,440
I didn't know that until like a week ago.

365
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
You two are Simpsons heads.

366
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Huh?

367
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,440
You guys are a couple of...

368
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,440
No, I only just started watching the Simpsons like a month ago.

369
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,560
I was a big Oinko Boinko fan in high school.

370
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,400
That makes like a lot of sense.

371
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,240
Yeah.

372
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,080
That's yeah, I would have expected that.

373
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,200
Oinko Boinko is what you called breastfeeding your mom.

374
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,040
He breastfeeds his mom.

375
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,840
Oinko Boinko fan.

376
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,680
His mom drinks his milk.

377
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,640
I breastfeed my mom?

378
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,840
Yeah, you, hold on, wait, hold on, let me think about this.

379
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,120
Yes, you would.

380
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,240
Yeah, yeah, you would breastfeed your mom

381
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,760
with your big juicy tits.

382
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,640
Did somebody just shoot a gun outside of your house?

383
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,120
Yeah, I don't know what that was.

384
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,100
I didn't hear it.

385
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:20,040
Alright, well, it must have been nothing.

386
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,040
Don't hear any screams or anything.

387
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Hold up, hold up.

388
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
Hold up, yeah, go check.

389
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
I heard a voice.

390
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
It's 16 minutes in.

391
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Heard a voice.

392
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
A voice?

393
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
He heard a voice.

394
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
What?

395
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
I think he's astral projecting right now, dude.

396
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
Yeah, you're astral projecting into his house to scare him.

397
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
Yo, it's Sinbad, he heard us.

398
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
He shows up, knock on the door, "Hey man, what?"

399
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
I heard you were talking shit about astral projection.

400
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
I heard you were talking shit about astral projection.

401
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
I heard you were talking shit about astral projection.

402
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
I heard you were talking shit about astral projection.

403
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
I heard you were talking shit about astral projection.

404
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
I heard you were talking shit about astral projection.

405
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,520
Knock on the door. Hey man. I heard you were talking shit about astral projection

406
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,600
Listen I had to pick the voodoo sticks back up

407
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,080
What

408
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,400
All right, we'll just keep it in that wasn't too long

409
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:02,560
That was crazy yeah, I was like a little like you kill the guy. I think it's a ghost

410
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,920
I think it's haunted sin bad dude. Yeah, it's a very old building

411
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,300
Do you guys, what percentage of you believes in a ghost?

412
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:17,140
None. Zero percent. Okay, this is, you asked me right at a time. I was thinking last night

413
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,620
I was reminded, I was hanging out with my friend and I was reminded of the most haunted experience I've ever had in my life

414
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:26,720
Which definitely, I don't think it was a ghost, but it felt like one time I was walking home

415
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,440
It was on New Year's, New Year's Eve, right before New Year's and I was walking

416
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,480
from my friend's house to my house with like a bunch of friends and we kind of were just like walking around my hometown and

417
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,940
We're like, oh, let's go on this street like that. We haven't walked on before like let's just see what's up here

418
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,000
And we were walking and like Elm Street. Yeah

419
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,660
And we saw this big haunted house and we went in and bats attacked us

420
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:55,580
We're just walking down this Wow and like

421
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:02,020
There was like just a bunch of like train sounds over and over but the train tracks were like further across

422
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:08,660
Town and then like a bunch of the houses the front doors were just like a little bit ajar

423
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,300
like

424
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:14,580
It was like like truly like the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced

425
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,660
I'm sure that it was just like we all just got really scared for no reason

426
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:24,260
But you heard a ghost train we heard ghost trains dude and the doors were all open and you didn't go in

427
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
No, it's people's houses.

428
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,180
You know, it seems like it wasn't people.

429
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,180
And then we were all just noticing the doors were all open.

430
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,180
Yeah, it seems like it was ghosts.

431
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,980
And then there was just a really old lady in a wheelchair sitting on the sidewalk all alone at the end of the street.

432
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,980
Did you wheel her home at least?

433
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,980
That's her house.

434
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,980
And then so we were very scared by that and I realized that's probably why, that was probably, you know, the simulation glitching out.

435
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
And that's why 2020 is like this now.

436
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Dude, yeah.

437
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:51,980
Because that was right before 2020.

438
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
Hey, thanks a lot, Kim. You gave us Carole Baskin.

439
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,820
Yeah, Kim.

440
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,780
Yeah, thanks a lot.

441
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,060
That's what I was thinking about last night.

442
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,020
Kim, Kimrin.

443
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,860
But no, I don't believe in ghosts.

444
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,900
Your name's Kim.

445
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,180
Kimrin.

446
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,020
Kimrin?

447
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,840
Shut up.

448
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,680
Yeah, shut up.

449
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,520
Thanks a lot, Kimrin.

450
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,340
I don't believe in ghosts,

451
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,860
but one time I was at People's Republic in Cambridge

452
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:12,020
with Tom, Jesse, and Abby.

453
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,740
And Jesse is way into ghosts,

454
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,880
and she kept talking about it.

455
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,860
And then we went outside and smoked a cigarette,

456
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,640
left Tom and Abby inside.

457
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,900
And then we walked back in,

458
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,020
and they were about to vomit.

459
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,500
and like looked, their eyes were like completely dilated and we were like,

460
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,300
what happened? And they said, as soon as we walked out of the door,

461
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,380
a glass moved from one end of the table to the other.

462
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,460
And we thought that we thought we were like, you're fucking with us.

463
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,980
And they maintained to this day that that's what happened.

464
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,940
I think it changed Tom's life. Yeah. I really think he was like,

465
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,820
I can't do comedy. I have to go be a doctor now. Yeah.

466
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,500
I honestly think that's when it all shifted for him. That's when he was like,

467
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,380
I have to just be like a normal guy.

468
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,460
- Oh my God.

469
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,300
- I have to check and make sure people are dead

470
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,540
so they won't come back to life.

471
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,620
(laughing)

472
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,640
- I have to be the guy that confirms

473
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,820
whether or not someone's dead.

474
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,260
- Yeah, my mom believes not in ghosts,

475
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,740
but in like angels that you can see.

476
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,700
- Yes.

477
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,540
- Yeah, so.

478
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,820
- Oh, you told us about your angel story.

479
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,660
- Yeah, I did.

480
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,460
- The one where the angel looking over your bed

481
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,740
when you were like five.

482
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,980
- And my mom's still,

483
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,660
my mom is like barely even religious anymore

484
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,380
and she's still like, "Yeah, I saw an angel on you."

485
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,780
I saw your angel.

486
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:26,060
My mom believes in ghosts.

487
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
My uh...

488
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,060
My mom thinks uh...

489
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,340
Well this has been...

490
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,220
So there's like uh...

491
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,060
There's like a radio that wasn't plugged in that turned on in my sister's room at our

492
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,340
house in Ware.

493
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,340
And uh...

494
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,860
There's a room in the house that we don't put anything in because that's grandma's room.

495
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,860
Uh...

496
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,620
Is she dead?

497
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,620
No.

498
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,620
We don't...

499
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,620
Grandma...

500
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,620
Our grandma doesn't live with us.

501
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,620
You never had a grandma.

502
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,620
Oh my god.

503
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,300
- It's even scarier. - I know.

504
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,500
I know.

505
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,980
- Oh my God. - No, there's like,

506
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,780
there's like this room that apparently

507
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,380
like the people who used to live there

508
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,660
like said they hear like voices in

509
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,340
and like they can talk to the grandma.

510
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,500
I forget most of the shit,

511
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,180
but like apparently like somebody--

512
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,940
- I think that's an iPhone game.

513
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,060
- Yeah.

514
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,080
Yeah, there's just an iPhone game in their house.

515
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,300
But somebody, one of the other neighbors

516
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,100
walked up to my mom while she was gardening once.

517
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,340
She was like, "Oh, in that room right there,

518
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,780
"that's grandma's room, right?"

519
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,420
And she's like, "What the fuck?"

520
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:22,500
- Whoa, dude.

521
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,340
- Yeah.

522
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,600
- Apparently it's like well known.

523
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,000
- We should honestly go go shopping.

524
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,500
- I think that's a good thing to do once,

525
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,440
we should go with your uncle, dude.

526
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,280
- Yeah, dude, get a whole map.

527
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,520
- My friend, my friend Dan went to school

528
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,800
in Hawaii for a while and he was hanging out

529
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,200
with his friends and they were getting drunk

530
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,760
and then one of his friends was like,

531
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,040
I'm gonna go pee on this sacred ground,

532
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,800
this sacred Hawaiian ancestral ground.

533
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,640
- Smart.

534
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,040
And he did, and then he got a huge rash up like,

535
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,400
just like half of his entire body,

536
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,320
just like from his leg up to his chest.

537
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,160
But he wasn't like--

538
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,440
- If that's the best a ghost can do,

539
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm a little scared. - Yeah, I know, right?

540
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,920
Right.

541
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,120
Yeah, they just feel you, they make you itchy.

542
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,600
- The thing is, nobody's ever,

543
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,300
even if ghosts are real,

544
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,960
nobody has ever died from a ghost, I don't think.

545
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,680
- Something that just is forever repeating in my mind

546
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,960
is I think Griffin found it,

547
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,940
but it's one of those videos where it's like,

548
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,320
50 people give their hottest takes,

549
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,360
and it's just a bunch of people saying woke,

550
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,200
social justice stuff,

551
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,680
and in the middle there's just a girl who goes,

552
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,320
"It's not a bad thing if you're haunted by a ghost."

553
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,560
(laughing)

554
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,320
- Sometimes it's really chill.

555
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,800
- I think about it all the time,

556
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,960
but that's all she says.

557
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,540
- I don't know, I feel like that's a bad thing.

558
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,600
- I agree.

559
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,440
- Right?

560
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,260
- I mean, it's the haunted--

561
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,660
It's worse if you have a ghost that's watching over you.

562
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,660
It's worse to get haunted.

563
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,660
It's worse to get like a guardian angel.

564
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:56,660
Personally I would say it's worse to get haunted and killed by a ghost.

565
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,660
But a ghost can't kill.

566
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,660
What would like a ghost can kill?

567
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,660
A ghost can kill.

568
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
Everybody's judging you Pat.

569
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,660
Duh.

570
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,660
Yeah.

571
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,660
Bunch of ghosts and vultures out there.

572
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,660
They're judging you right now dude.

573
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,660
I hate it when a ghost judges me.

574
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,660
No, you want to go to ghost court.

575
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,500
I think the fun one is to be judged.

576
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
That's the worst.

577
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I think the...

578
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,500
No, you would like it.

579
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,740
That's the fucked up thing is that he would actually like it.

580
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,740
I would hate it.

581
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,260
I would hate it if a ghost judged me.

582
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,260
No, and everybody would be wearing a white sheet except for you and that's how they'd

583
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:31,260
know you were guilty.

584
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,620
And there's one white sheet that has a powdered wig on it.

585
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,620
Yeah.

586
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,620
That's the judge.

587
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,300
And also one of the jury members has glasses over their white sheet.

588
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,300
Yeah.

589
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,500
The ghost lawyer's wearing a tie around the white sheet so you can see like the outline

590
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:49,420
of the head so it's just kind of pointless to wear the white sheet. And then your ghost wife is in

591
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:55,180
the audience with your ghost baby. And she is breastfeeding. Yeah and she oh and she's got

592
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:02,060
them out dude. Oh my god. She's got two hole two eye holes cut lower down. And then you pull out

593
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:09,020
a vacuum and you go. Suck the milk out. Yeah you suck them. No you go Luigi's Mansion on the whole courtroom.

594
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,900
You could probably suck breast milk out with a vacuum.

595
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:19,020
I think the coolest ghost development would be if like some scientist invented like a device that

596
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,580
lets us see ghosts and we find out that they're just all hanging out all around us all the time

597
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,860
and they're just like smoking weed just smoking weed and like you know just I would hate that.

598
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,460
Putting up under people's heads.

599
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,060
I would not feel safe in my own home.

600
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,500
Pat would like that yet again.

601
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,580
Pat is no Pat is lying right now.

602
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,380
He is capping.

603
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:38,380
Pat you are capping dude.

604
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,340
I'm not capping.

605
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:40,700
You are capping right now.

606
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:48,220
I'm not capping. Stop the cap brother. Yeah. Take that cap off. More like Capric. No! You're crapping

607
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:57,020
right now. No! I'm not. I'm sitting. You're sitting in the, on the porcelain throne right now. Yeah.

608
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,980
That's right. No crap. Yeah, no, hey, no crap brother. No crap. Now we could uh. Exactly,

609
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,220
no crap. I feel like we would find a ghost if we went looking for one. I would not. Absolutely.

610
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:13,900
I think our next big video, our next documentary should be some kind of

611
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,260
some kind of ghost hunter or cryptid hunt. We can stay...

612
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,300
I don't think I've talked about this but the best part about Matt

613
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:29,620
besides every other besides every metal in his head and the music and the

614
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:33,780
ghost hunting thing is that all of he's had like maybe four or five different

615
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:40,500
ghost hunting organizations, all of which are acronyms that spell out a dirty word.

616
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,180
So I think right now, I think it, I think right now is...

617
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,900
Say some more, say all of them.

618
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:49,060
So one of them was crap, and I don't remember what that one was.

619
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:54,580
One of them, one of them was shit, and then now the one that he does is ass.

620
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,460
Acquiring supernatural spirits.

621
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,460
That fucking rules.

622
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
So sick, dude.

623
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,740
- Crap, probably, the P in crap is probably poltergeists.

624
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,700
- Probably paranormal.

625
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,140
I bet it was--

626
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,660
- I wish it's poltergeists.

627
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,060
- Capturing and controlling really annoying

628
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,820
paranormal poltergeists.

629
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,220
- Poltergeists.

630
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,700
- Yeah.

631
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,860
Yeah, it probably was that.

632
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,300
- But yeah, we should, we'll definitely go ghost hunting.

633
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,120
We can, what's the oldest place you guys know about?

634
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,960
- The Earth.

635
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:26,900
- Oh, there's one place, the Earth's core.

636
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,500
We could go to the Earth's core.

637
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
Dude, there's probably so many lava ghosts down there.

638
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Find a ghost in the center of the earth.

639
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,500
Do you think they'd let us check out the White House?

640
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Do you think there's dry bones in the center of the earth?

641
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Probably. Yeah, dude.

642
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
That's probably where they come from, dude.

643
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
That's where they base their Bowser comes from.

644
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Bowser came from the middle.

645
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Middle of the earth.

646
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Yeah, Bowser, he does like lava.

647
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Yeah.

648
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:52,500
I hate when I'm trying to find Bowser and I fall in and I burn my bottom and I have to run around going,

649
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ay!"

650
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
Yeah.

651
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Don't you hate that? But I actually run way faster when I do that.

652
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:04,660
do that. Yeah. So annoying. It's kind of like a speed hack. Yeah. I hate being Mario. It's

653
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:09,580
so annoying when I'm Mario. Yeah. Oh my god dude. What a lot of people don't realize is

654
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:13,660
that it hurts when fire comes out of your hands. Yeah. He burns himself every time like

655
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,580
Wolverine. Yeah. And he just never gets used to it. Yeah and when and you. He doesn't have

656
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,180
the healing like Wolverine. You can't fucking believe dude the growing pains when you get

657
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:26,420
a mushroom, your whole skeleton just stretching out to twice the height.

658
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,420
Oh, terrible.

659
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
No, annoying dude.

660
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,420
You think that's bad.

661
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,380
Imagine like the crunching and the creaking that happens when you get the tiny mushroom.

662
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
Yeah.

663
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:41,300
Yeah, and imagine trying to say to the Walgreens cashier that your name is Tanooki Mario.

664
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,300
You're not gonna believe me.

665
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,300
You're so fucking annoying.

666
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,620
You get it, Mario's SSRIs.

667
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,860
Yeah, all this for some white bitch.

668
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,860
Yeah.

669
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:49,860
No thanks.

670
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,860
Nah.

671
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:51,860
God, it sucks being Mario.

672
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,520
- Shakira.

673
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,220
Shakira I'd do Mario stuff for.

674
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,920
- There's not even like a trampoline or anything

675
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,180
at the bottom of the pipes too.

676
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,820
- Yeah, you just gotta hit it, dude.

677
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,200
- Yeah, you just gotta land.

678
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,620
- You know how much brain damage I get

679
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:08,780
from jumping onto blocks from the bottom?

680
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,340
- Yeah, and fighting turtles?

681
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,180
- And hitting turtles?

682
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,680
- You think that feels good to kill turtles all day?

683
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,120
You think that feels good for me?

684
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,960
- You think?

685
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,500
- I don't even have pockets big enough for all my coins.

686
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,340
- Yeah.

687
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,620
I don't even have pockets big enough for all my coins.

688
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,740
I'm Mario.

689
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,580
I'm Mario.

690
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,540
Hey, how's it going?

691
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,660
It's me, Mario.

692
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:31,020
I don't have enough pockets for my coin.

693
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,740
And then you have your brother.

694
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
Yeah.

695
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,860
Don't even get me started on my brother.

00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,260
Yeah, he's always mom's favorite.

697
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,100

Yeah, why do you keep hunting ghosts?

704
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,740
Why do you keep hunting ghosts if you're such a baby?

705
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,580
They should call him Pussy Luigi.

706
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,780
Why do I keep getting captured by the ghosts?

707
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,780
they should call him Pussuigi.

708
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:52,780
They should call him Pussuigi.

709
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:53,780
Boohooigi.

710
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:54,780

Five minutes and they just gave up and traced Wario as my grandfather and my grandpa opened up

734
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,720
He's like, ah, it looks just like me

735
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,480
And then I showed him Wario and he was perplexed and the fucked up thing is it looks just like it

736
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,540
Hey, yeah his w has confirms Wario is a

Bitch, we should go on a European world places. Yeah, we should go on a world tour of Europe

741
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,340
I'm thinking of going on a world tour of my house today to go to the bathroom. Yeah

742
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:55,820
Yeah, I'm thinking of walking around in a circle in my house. Yeah, I might go on a world tour to like the store man

743
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,740
I wish I didn't have to I wish I didn't have to walk all the way to the bathroom

744
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,620
I wish I could just cut to a map and show two dots one in my room and one in the bathroom and a line going

745
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,380
Between them with a plane flying and then I could be there way faster without having to walk so easy, dude

746
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,620
But like the plane the plane kind of arches like yeah

747
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,880
I like pattern kind of arches in a way that it doesn't make any real sense to I'm fast

748
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:22,740
I have one of the fastest that's the fastest way to travel on a glue the fastest the fastest way between two points is is a

749
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:29,480
Large arch that goes all the way over them. Yeah a red on a globe. Yeah, you're right

750
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,720
Because it's because it's small the globe is smaller at the top

751
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:37,300
You're right. I know I'm right. I'm agreeing with you

752
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:44,620
You're a genius dude. I'm a green with you. I'm a green guy. I'm a creeper. I know you're a Yoshi. I'm gonna creep it green

753
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,620
I'm not Yoshi. You're a green creeper. You're Yoshi. You just said you're green and you're a creeper.

754
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:54,680
Yoshi is definitely Grinch adjacent. I don't I don't really like you guys calling me that. I like you.

755
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,640
No, I'm not Grinch adjacent. Yeah, you are. No. I'm the Grinch named Jason.

756
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,080

00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:10,580
I would not be a sub anything you anyway. Yeah, you're the sub boss in the Grinch RPG

Yeah, those are for we're not Cindy Lou, but we're not Cindy Lou and you're the wrapping paper boss

762
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,280

I'm taking all the wrapping paper for the Grinch.

769
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,860
You're called the Grinch's groomsman.

770
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,860
The truth is I'm actually very close.

771
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,860
That's your character's name.

772
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,800
I'm very close with Santa Claus and neither of you are getting presents this year.

773
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,800
What?

774
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
It's okay.

To what?

783
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Don't tell him Patrick.

784
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,800
Judaism.

785
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Judaism?

786
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Oh, okay. Well, I know Jewish Santa too.

787
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
That's Charlie Day's religion.

788
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I destroyed him.

789
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
It's about rats and stuff.

790
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
It's about rap.

791
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
Yeah. Judaism is about rap.

792
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:16,800
If I know one thing about Judaism,

793
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,800
it's hip-hop.

794
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Mm-hmm.

795
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
That's right.

796
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
The seven days of hip-hop.

797
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
Hip-hop Hanukkah.

798
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
We're gonna have a hip-hop Hanukkah this year.

799
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
That's right.

800
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,800

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,440
- They're playing a dead Prez hip-hop

804
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,440
every time that they light the menorah.

805
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,040
- Yeah, that's right.

806
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,920
And Lil Dicky's there.

807
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,300
That's the only Jewish rapper I know of.

808
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,500
Actually, no, Ill Bill is a Jewish rapper.

809
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,320
- What?

810
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Asher Roth.

811
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,360
- Asher Roth's Jewish?

812
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,120
- Aziroth from World of Warcraft?

813
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,960
- I think so.

814
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,480
- Mr. Moth?

815
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,740
- Mr. Moth? - Mr. Moth from outside?

816
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,740
(laughing)

817
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,580
- He's in World of Warcraft?

818
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,900
You guys aren't making any sense to me.

819
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,780
- What are you saying, Sephiroth is Jewish?

820
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,220
- Yeah, yeah, Asheroth is Jewish.

821
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,780
- Sephiroth is a Jewish rapper.

822
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,380

824
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,160
- And then what?

00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,100
- You did Asheroth Wikipedia?

827
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,940
- Yeah.

828
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,960
- And you just clicked and scrolled?

829
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,460
- It's one of the first things.

830
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,300
- It's one of the first things that shows up.

831
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,060
- You did control F Jewish on Asheroth Wikipedia page

832
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,900

00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,760
in the info box, it says not Jewish.

836
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,460
It just, everything that he's not is listed.

837
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,460

00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,860
on every single page that he's on.

840
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:51,220
So he just has to go to the Wikipedia.

841
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,460
It's easy for him. - It's not true.

842

Rucka Rucka Alley.

863
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
Yes.

864
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:54,300
Two live Jews.

865
00:35:54,300 --> 00:36:01,020
Samberg. They put Andy Samberg in it. Weird Al isn't on it.

866
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,100
Remember, we confirmed he's not Jewish. Yeah, that's kind of the new

867
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,140
podcast we're doing. We pick one celebrity every week and we find out if

868
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,660
they're Jewish or not. This week, Halle Berry. Let's go. No, it's Ashton Roth

869
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,740
already. No, it's Halle Berry this week. Let's find out.

870
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:22,180
Halle Bailey there she is

871
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:27,640
Child actor Sally the baby. Is that what you're saying? No

872
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:35,220
I searched Hallie B and it filled in Hallie Bailey who I don't know who that is, but I tell you this much. She's not Jewish

873
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,300
I'm gonna tell you that really I could have told you that for well

874
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,300
That's that's why we're doing this show is cuz Patrick is clairvoyant about this one issue

875
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,060
That he I have no idea why I know he just sees their penis

876
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:57,740
Tell me Obama cut uncut I

877
00:36:57,740 --> 00:37:03,280
Feel like that should be public record. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I mean absolutely

878
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,540
When the president gets his physical we should know what the president the president's got a thingy

879
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:16,020
We have to know the cut the length if it's like a tricolor one. We should see a traced outline

880
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,020
What the fuck do you mean tricolor?

881
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
Like a Neapolitan ice cream?

882
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
Yeah, like the, you have the base--

883
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,020
What is that? What? No!

884
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,020
Somebody has a solid penis.

885
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,020
Somebody has "get blessed by God" with a perfect pink penis.

886
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,020
You know what I'm talking about.

887
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,020
I have one of those.

888
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,020
The base of my penis is like midnight black.

889
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:38,020
The middle is like a Georgia peach.

890
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,020
It's bright red.

891
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,020
And then the top is as bright as the sun.

892
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,020
It's glowing red.

893
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:50,520
spot on a JRPG boss. You don't have that? No. What color is it all the way through?

894
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:55,780
Looks like a candy corn. It's my color. It looks like my skin. I don't know man, maybe I'm the

895
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:02,460
chosen one. No. Yeah, maybe I'm the chosen one. If anything you have a deformity. I'm the chosen one with the

896
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,240
tricolored penis. That's just the truth dude. Confirm main character. I'm the good

897
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,240
guy. You never heard of that Patrick? No! That's the thing, everybody message Pat pictures

899
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,800
This is a no filter challenge. Send a photo of your penis to what's his name on the other

900
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,200
end of this phone call and make sure that there's three colors in it. Okay? No Photoshop

904
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,680
- Yeah.

905
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,860
- I don't wanna see your penis.

906
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,700
- Oh, you already said you did.

907
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,540
- My shit look like a candy corn.

908
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,360
- I said that.

909
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,200
(laughs)

910
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
- I said that I don't wanna see it.

911
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,000
- You said that you wanna see it.

912
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,840
- No.

913
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,880
- You said you wanna eat it like a candy corn.

914
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,080
- I don't wanna eat it like a candy corn.

915
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,380
- You said, wow, this looks like a popsicle

916
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,000
from the ice cream truck.

917
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,840
- Pat wants to find one under his pillow.

918
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,120
- That's not what I said.

919
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:06,960
- Yeah.

920
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,320
If anyone has access to Patrick's pillow, please place your penis.

921
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,520
Please put your penis in it.

922
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,040
Patricks pillow.

923
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,800
He's going to flip it over in the middle of the night.

924
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,080
But he flips it over not to get to the cold side, just to check if there's a guy's penis there.

925
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,760
So there's something there.

926
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:20,640
And he's going to do it.

927
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,920
Yeah, it's like waking up on Christmas morning for him.

928
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,280
I don't want to see it.

929
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,560
What if I showed you my penis on this call right now?

930
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,840
I've seen your penis.

931
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,240
No, but you haven't seen the three colors.

932
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,800
You saw it.

933
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,520
You saw it.

934
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,400
You saw it.

935
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,200
It was turtled.

936
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,080
Okay, it didn't look very big and it looked like one color.

937
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,160
Just trust me, there's three colors.

938
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,000
- Did you, you made it?

939
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,240
- It's four and a half inches long

940
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,920
and it's spiraled like a duck, okay?

941
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,960
When it's hard.

942
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,280
- You took Neil's phone and he took a picture of it.

943
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,000
- I'm gonna take your mom's phone.

944
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
- No.

945
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,280
- Oh, I'm gonna take your mom's phone

946
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,160
and I'm gonna do nasty stuff to it, dude.

947
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,960
- Yeah, I'm gonna ruin her high scores on Candy Crush.

948
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:02,800
- Dude, I'm gonna--

949
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,760
- It's not gonna happen.

950
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,040
I'm gonna shit on it and throw it in the fire like a mud-baked salmon.

951
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,080
That's what I'm gonna do.

952
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,720
A mud-baked salmon?

953
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,360
Or a clay-baked salmon.

954
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,800
You know those?

955
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:15,800
No.

956
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,960
Somebody didn't grow up in the woods.

957
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,960
A mud-baked salmon.

958
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:20,960
A mud-baked salmon.

959
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,960
It's a real thing, dude.

960
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
That is not a thing.

961
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,960
Nobody's ever been camping.

962
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,200
First you don't think Neapolitan penises are real, now you don't even comprehend a mud-baked

963
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
salmon.

964
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
That's how stupid you are, dude.

965
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:37,740
No, it sounds like you're fucking dumb. You are like you didn't grow up in a fucking cave like Caleb. Yeah, yeah

966
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,500
Yeah, your penis didn't see the light enough. That's why it looks like that not did I do you have one of those blind?

967
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:47,400
Cavefish penises it's translucent your

It has a full skeleton inside it listen

970
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:02,600
Listen, I don't lure fish onto my penis and then give them the first color, okay?

971
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,600
That doesn't happen.

972
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
That's what you do.

973
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,960
I don't even know how I would do that, man.

974
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,960
That's what you do.

975
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,960
I'm trying to comprehend that.

976
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,320

977
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,020

The good Joe.

1001
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,920
That's right.

1002
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
Oh, shit.

That could be his big thing.

He got an email that told him to do that.

1011
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:08,120
He could be on stage and be like, "Listen, we can talk about healthcare, education, reform,

1012
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:09,120
foreign policy, all we want.

1013
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,240
The truth is, neither of my opponents are willing to do anything about the city of Boston."

1014
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:16,680
He's like, he's at a campaign rally and he's like,

1015
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,760
"And I have great news for everybody.

00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,080
"Look under your chairs

1017
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:23,080
"because everyone has a pressure cooker bomb."

1018
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,340
(laughing)

1019
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:32,120
- How do the pressure cooker bombs work?

1020
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:32,960
Do they just--

1021
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,760
- You put really bad rice in there

1022
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,520
and it stinks so bad it kills everybody.

1023
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
- Yeah, you put a real stinky curry in there

1024
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,280
And then you just turn that bitch on bomb.

1025
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,680
(laughing)

1026
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,520
You turn on the bomb setting.

1027
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,400
- Yeah, they should stop making pressure cookers

1028
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,900
with the bomb setting on there.

1029
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,740
That's a big problem.

1030
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:53,920
- Yeah, that was a huge misstep on Black and Decker's part.

1031
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:56,440
- Putting the bomb setting on it.

1032
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,280
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1033
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,640
They should just put a bomb setting on everything though.

1034
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,400
- Screw the microwave.

1035
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,440
- Microwave.

1036
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,400
Do you guys know, I don't have a microwave anymore.

1037
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,240
Do you guys know anybody--

1038
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,060
- I don't have one either.

1039
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,360
- Didn't have a microwave growing up?

1040
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,400
No, I don't know.

1041
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,120
No, they were so commercially available.

1042
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,640
I mean, I guess, like, I guess,

1043
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,040
did, like, my parents count?

1044
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,480
Yeah, wait, no.

1045
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,520
'Cause, yeah, just,

1046
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,680
they didn't grow up with microwaves.

1047
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,480
My sister-in-law, like, her parents believed

1048
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,900
that if she would have,

1049
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,600
if she ate food out of a microwave,

1050
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,320
she'd, like, grow, like, a third eye and shit.

1051
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,400
Yeah. They're not wrong.

1052
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,560
I mean, yeah, the thing, like,

1053
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:36,800
comparatively, they've been,

1054
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,000
stuff like that has been around for a pretty short time,

1055
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,920
and I'm sure in like 20 years it's gonna be like,

1056
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,320
oh yeah, the iPhones were actually like

1057
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,320
accelerating our evolution to grow wings all along.

1058
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,160
- Well that's definitely true.

1059
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,180
It's definitely true that a phone

1060
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,240
is sending stuff into your brain.

1061
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,080
- Yeah.

1062
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:54,960
- Yeah, stuff that we can't see.

1063
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,080
Kind of like a pure black goo.

1064
00:44:58,080 --> 00:44:59,360
- Yeah.

1065
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,120
- That Patrick immediately adapted to.

1066
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,040
And Patrick is the next step of evolution.

1067
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,580
Something that can actually handle the phone.

1068
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,420
- Yeah.

1069
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,300
Like I was thinking about like me and Cam quit,

1070
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,080
we like quit using Twitter every like couple months

1071
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:12,920
for a little bit.

1072
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:13,740
Yeah.

1073
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,460
And Pat just has never, it's never popped in his head.

1074
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,300
No, I know.

1075
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,120
Never stopped.

1076
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:18,960
No, can't stop.

1077
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,980
Me and Simon were talking to Pat about like,

1078
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:23,660
like 'cause Simon and me were just talking about like,

1079
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,140
like even, I'm not even a 10,000 followers

1080
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,540
and I get so angry at people on Twitter

1081
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,300
who are just annoying me and I'm just like,

1082
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,540
oh my God, this is ruining my life,

1083
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:35,660
but it's also the only way I'm making money right now

1084
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,820
so I have to stay on.

1085
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,620
And they were like, "Oh, Pat, you have like 25,000 followers.

1086
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:40,460
"How do you deal with that?"

1087
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:42,500
And he was like, "I don't know, I don't care."

1088
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,260
- It's not a big deal.

1089
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,100
- It just doesn't, it's crazy.

1090
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,340
- Like, he just gives a shit.

1091
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,140
- He's like, I mean this in the best way.

1092
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,620
You are one IQ point below where you would be

1093
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:53,420
if it made you mad.

1094
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,260
- Yeah.

1095
00:45:54,260 --> 00:45:57,480
- You know, like you're like, you're like 119.

1096
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,380
- Maybe.

1097
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:00,220
- Yeah.

1098
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,560
- Probably like 139.

1099
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,020
- You're not 139.

1100
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,860
- No.

1101
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,160
- Probably 139, no.

1102
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,200
I'm a hundred million.

1103
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,200
I don't know.

1104
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
I don't even have an IQ.

1105
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,200
I kind of transcended beyond it.

1106
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,600
It really, it literally, none of it, none of it fucking matters.

1107
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:18,600
Like why, like there's so many people like, there's so many fucking people who are like,

1108
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,720
"Oh, my mutuals are fighting."

1109
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,000
Who gives a shit?

1110
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,560
Just fucking, you can put it down for a little bit.

1111
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,760
Go on a different, like just scroll away.

1112
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:30,000
Go on a different, go on vote.

1113
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,960
Go over to vote.

1114
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,160
Go vote.

1115
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,160
Go to vote.

1116
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:37,880
What's the what's the conservative one? Oh, what's it called? Scribbler?

1117
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,720
Yeah, parlor burbler parlor

1118
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:50,320
Parlor yeah, I made a parlor account and I got banned for pretending to be Ruth Bader Ginsburg

1119
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:53,760
I plundered on parlor. I

1120
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:02,520
Put disinformation regarding hydroxyl or whatever the fuck it's called. I am Donald Trump. I am gay

1121
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,040
That's what everyone wrote on Parler.

1122
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
That's what everyone made an account of.

1123
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,040
The week that Parler came out, everyone made an account that was like,

1124
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:13,040
"I'm Donald Trump and I'm a Democrat."

1125
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,040
And then got banned and we're like, "Look at these freaks."

1126
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,040
I totally got them.

1127
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:21,040
Oh my God. Oh yeah, free speech, my ass.

1128
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,040
I should have gone and made boobs official.

1129
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,040
Who gives a shit? Who gives a shit?

1130
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,040
It's free from the internet.

1131
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,040
I'm going on there and being like, "I am going to kill you. I am going to destroy you."

1132
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,720
getting banned and be like, "Well, I guess it's not a free speech app after all."

1133
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,520
Yeah, someone got triggered.

1134
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,520
Yeah.

1135
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,200
Someone got reverse triggered.

1136
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,200
Yeah.

1137
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
Fucking own, dude.

1138
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:44,000
Yeah, spending enough time to make an account on their website and interact with enough

1139
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,600
people to get banned.

1140
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,600
Yeah.

1141
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,600
We're conservative now.

1142
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,240
Why not, dude?

1143
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,480
Shit like that does get annoying, though.

1144
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,480
I will admit.

1145
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,480
It does get annoying.

1146
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Just put it down, dude.

1147
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,000
Just go do something else.

1148
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
No, I know.

1149
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,000
I know.

1150
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
That's what I do.

1151
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,280
- You put down Parler? - I do.

1152
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,080
- I put down Parler and then I open Twitter back up.

1153
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,680
- Nice, and then you oscillate between the two.

1154
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:09,920
- Yeah, remember they tried to do that with like Mastodon

1155
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:10,960
or whatever the fuck it was called?

1156
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,800
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1157
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,520
- I'm the Mastah and the Don.

1158
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,880
- Hey. - That's right.

1159
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,880
- I made one, I made the Subway account on there, on Mastodon.

1160
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,080
- I couldn't figure out how to use Mastodon.

1161
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,360
- Yeah.

1162
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,640
- Oh yeah, that was like the one for--

1163
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,200
- That like the decentralized one.

1164
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,440
- Sick of right wing trolls on Twitter.

1165
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,640
Yeah, that's the one for people who are sick of an app that just works normally.

1166
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:34,640
You can just turn off.

1167
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:35,640
Yeah.

1168
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:40,840
Sick of an app that makes sense that isn't everything on websites, like .io websites.

1169
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,640
Yeah, that's it.

1170
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,920
Any of those websites, I mean, they've perfected websites at this point.

1171
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,840
Like, you'll never have another, like, dig to Reddit move.

1172
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,480
You know what I mean?

1173
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,600
Because they've just gotten too good at making them, like, nobody, you can't make a more addictive,

1174
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:59,920
put billions of dollars behind researching how to make Twitter the most addictive thing

1175
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:00,920
it can be.

1176
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,000
You're not going to be able to make anything that competes with it.

1177
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,680
Every website update that's been made since 2010 has just been a negative move.

1178
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,660
Oh, absolutely.

1179
00:49:09,660 --> 00:49:13,480
It started with the blue lines on Twitter, like the blue reply lines.

1180
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,000
Yeah, it started with all the blue lives in threat.

1181
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,760
The blue lives, too.

1182
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:22,320
It started with the blue lines and then it was like, "Oh, now you can put four pictures.

1183
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,200
Now we're going to show you the pictures.

1184
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,120
I loved when you couldn't see the pictures.

1185
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:28,120
Yeah.

1186
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:32,040
Yeah, and you open it up and there was those accounts that were like food or gore or whatever.

1187
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,040
Yeah.

1188
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,680
I mean, they would just be like breaking John McCain.

1189
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:41,080
John McCain dies while in Ryan Dunn's car and then you click on it and it'd be Goatsy.

1190
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,080
Yeah.

1191
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,080
I miss that.

1192
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,080
Yeah, that was the best.

1193
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:45,080
And the surprise.

1194
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,080
You know what I mean?

1195
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,080
They took all the surprise out of it and then-

1196
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,080
Surprise me.

1197
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:49,080
Keep me interested.

1198
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,080
Okay?

1199
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:51,080
They took all the surprise out of it and then they put like fucking-

1200
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:53,640
I want to see a man's balls and a man's ass.

1201
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:57,480
I miss Fave Star Cups.

1202
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,800
I miss the Fave Star Cups.

1203
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:04,080
I was talking about that the other day with Cameron, like the serious Fave Star Guy things.

1204
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:07,680
The ones where it was like guys who would make posts like "I just saw someone hitting an

1205
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:12,080
innocent child, hit me instead, I can take it!"

1206
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,080
Those are the fucking best.

1207
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,480
Those are the best guys.

1208
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,400
It was either that, they would say shit like that, or then jokes like "Umm, yeah, whiskey

1209
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,400
equals awesome."

1210
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:29,000
like just the worst types of guys and then they would send like some girl on their like 15 like

1211
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,720
fave like you get one fave star cup a day and then they would send them like some girl some woman who

1212
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:38,920
has like a husband and they're like oh here's your cup darling thanks for the cup darling

1213
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,200

1214
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,480

1215
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:49,980
Yeah.

1216
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,480
Yeah.

1217
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:50,980
I was a...

1218
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:52,980
At some point I got blocked by E-40.

1219
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:53,980
Oh yeah?

1220
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:55,480
I'm still blocked by E-40, dude.

1221
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,480
It's fucking heartbreaking.

1222
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:56,980
Damn.

1223
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:57,980
Yeah, I don't know why I did.

1224
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:00,980
I was an early adopter of Twitter, I think.

1225
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:02,980
I think that's why I'm such a fucking moron now.

1226
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,480
Yeah, definitely that's why.

1227
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:04,980
Yeah.

1228
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,980
Undeniably that's why.

1229
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:07,480
Yeah.

1230
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:07,980
Yeah.

1231
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:09,480
I was too busy.

1232
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,980
I played Battlefield 3 and I went on the hip-hop Reddit and...

1233
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,480
Oh yeah, you guys were Reddit guys.

1234
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,980
I was a huge Reddit guy.

1235
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:18,980
I was a Reddit guy, yeah.

1236
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:24,860
I was just a Twitter guy. I wasn't even I never went back and nuked my reddit account because it was all like yeah

1237
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:31,100
I'm so excited for the Obama re-election campaign. Yeah. Yeah fucking it was atrocious, dude

1238
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:37,180
I'll probably probably nuke mine too, but it's not tied to my name or anything. I don't think people I never used

1239
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:45,220
My genius brain decided that my reddit name should be Caleb underscore pits. Yeah. Yeah, so smart great move

1240
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:52,220
I had no idea, I just, I had no concept of like why you would want to be anonymous on the internet.

1241
00:51:52,220 --> 00:52:02,220
I wasn't posting like anything racist or mean. So I was like, yeah, you just, you know, just post embarrassing like Hillary stuff with my full name on it.

1242
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,220
Yeah.

1243
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:04,220
You were a Hillary guy?

1244
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:05,220
No, but in 2016...

1245
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,220
Were you a Hillary guy in 2016?

1246
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,220
I mean I worked for the Bernie campaign but then the campaign manager was like

1247
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:16,580
in North Carolina was like we need to do like a big Hillary push and I was like duh okay I

1248
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:23,620
work construction and so to my 400 followers I was like y'all we need to back our girl.

1249
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:29,220
Oh no dude I was I was Hillary in 2016. I didn't I voted for Jill Stein.

1250
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:35,300
I was that was like right around when I when I started listening to Chapo Trap House so that

1251
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:39,900
That was right before I learned that you could vote for someone else.

1252
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,700
I was early on all that shit.

1253
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:49,260
I remember listening to the first Chapo.

1254
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,500
When they were on Street Fight.

1255
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,500
I was too busy.

1256
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:54,140
I was having sex.

1257
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,140
I was too.

1258
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,140
No you weren't.

1259
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,140
No.

1260
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,660
I was having sex with my phone.

1261
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:04,180
Yeah, because you have a lightning bolt cable for a penis.

1262
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:06,180
was it Street Fight that they were?

1263
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,180
I don't remember.

1264
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,180
I remember it actually.

1265
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:12,180
That's you and then you turns out you don't remember.

1266
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:14,180
Here's me.

1267
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,180
Yeah I remember.

1268
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:18,180
I think I remember about that.

1269
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,180
I remember that.

1270
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,180
What was that voice Cameron?

1271
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:24,180
Do that one again.

1272
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,180
I think I remember that.

1273
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:28,180
I think I remember that.

1274
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,180
Yeah my name is Patrick. I'm also mean to my friend about voices.

1275
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:32,180
No it was really good.

1276
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,580
He sounded like, uh, you sounded like Ernest.

1277
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,980
I don't know what Ernest sounds like. I've never watched an Ernest movie.

1278
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:40,780
Let's do some voices to close out the episode.

1279
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,280
Let's just do a bunch of voices.

1280
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,180
Okay, let's do, um...

1281
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,280
What were you gonna say about me?

1282
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:46,980
Don't worry about it, Patrick.

1283
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,580
I know what he was gonna say. You don't want to hear it.

1284
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:52,080
Sometimes I think about just like the media diet that you grew up with

1285
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,780
and it blows my brain.

1286
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:54,380
Oh.

1287
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:57,580
The idea that you grew up watching jackass and Ernest movies

1288
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,780
is insane.

1289
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,080
Yeah.

1290
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:06,800
I know I I'm I'm a fucking weird person. You're such a freak dude. I'm a freak. I'm a freaking moron

1291
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:11,360
I hope that lamp behind you jumps up like the Pixar intro and squishes you and

1292
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,400
Replaces you and then we watch a lamp instead of Patrick

1293
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:21,360
I we Cameron and I were talking about this like on stream the other day like I I literally like I remember commercials

1294
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,100
From the 70s even though I never fucking saw

1295
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:32,720
Like the the one with the sad Indian that was Italian. Yeah that guy and then like that's from the 90s, I think

1296
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:39,760
But there was like like we were talking about the Calgon commercial the ancient Chinese secret. I

1297
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,600
Don't know what that I don't know why you're saying we were saying

1298
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:49,160
About it. I was telling Cameron about it. He was telling me about commercials from the 70s

1299
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,120
Do you guys remember the head-on commercials? Mm-hmm. You mean headstrong?

1300
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:00,880
Yeah, I'll take you and it's also it's not a commercial song. Yeah, it's the song but it's in the commercial for like amp energy

1301
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,560
dude, the head-on commercials were like

1302
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:09,760
Brilliant, they fucking make those they were so good. I'd like late 2000 mid 2000

1303
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:14,680
They must they must have made it in like 1990 and I just recycled like I was fucking being hypnotized

1304
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,480
You were dude. I mean, I guess yeah, that is true

1305
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,780
Remember when they parodied it in disaster movie?

1306
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,360
The thing is no parody would be as funny as those commercials just were.

1307
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,360
There was, they made the...

1308
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:31,160
Adam Curtis could make an entire documentary about Head On.

1309
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,160
Exactly.

1310
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:36,960
The disaster movie parody was "Head On, apply it to your fucking forehead you bitch."

1311
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,560
That's fucking sick dude.

1312
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,560
I don't know what Head On is.

1313
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:43,760
Yeah Febreze, fucking spray it on your couch you fucking dumbass.

1314
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,160
Spray your shit with it.

1315
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,560
That's gonna be the next wave of commercials.

1316
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,560
Of commercials?

1317
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:51,560
Absolutely.

1318
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,560
They already kinda do that.

1319
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,560
They already kinda do it.

1320
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,560
Implied, nudity.

1321
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:00,080
I mean like after the self-care brands kinda like start to run its course and people get

1322
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:05,760
like more people get angry at them, there's gonna be one brand who like goes like, "Yeah,

1323
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,120
we're the fucking cool brand.

1324
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:09,900
We don't give a fuck about self-care or being woke.

1325
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,480
We speak what's on our mind."

1326
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,480
They're gonna bring Crack Docs to Pepperdine.

1327
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,700
- Like Kraft Mac and Cheese is just tweeting that

1328
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,780
over and over and everyone's gonna do it.

1329
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:22,080
- Kraft Mac and Cheese rustic cut, it's for men only.

1330
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,400
- Yeah.

1331
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,940
- Thick cut.

1332
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:28,000
- They bring back Cheesosaurus Rex but he's a PUA now.

1333
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:28,840
- Yeah.

1334
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,080
(laughing)

1335
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:34,700
- He drops a macaroni in a girl's drink.

1336
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:37,460
(laughing)

1337
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:40,440
- Brands are gonna start just adding random women on Twitter

1338
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:44,520
and just sending them unsolicited dick pics.

1339
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,920
That's the next step for brands.

1340
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,360
- It's a message from Applebee's to a woman

1341
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,160
that just says, "You look so much better without makeup."

1342
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,480
- Dude, I miss the GoDaddy commercials.

1343
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,040
Those were, those rocked me.

1344
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,760
- You remember that one GoDaddy commercial?

1345
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,200
- Do you wanna titty fuck this athlete?

1346
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,040
Go to GoDaddy.com.

1347
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,760
- Danica Patrick's boobs at GoDaddy.com.

1348
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,720
- Okay, and me as a kid, I said, "Okay."

1349
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:08,560
- Yeah, sure.

1350
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,380
- So I went there.

1351
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:12,700
It's like here's our plans for a website.

1352
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:14,700
Here's how much bandwidth you can get.

1353
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:15,940
And I'm like, alright, I don't care about your plan.

1354
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,740
I care about my plan to titty fuck that girl from the commercial.

1355
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:19,740
Exactly.

1356
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,740
Remember that one they had that fat kid?

1357
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,740
Now that's a plan.

1358
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:24,900
Yeah, and that's what I call a plan.

1359
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,100
There's a Go Daddy Super Bowl commercial where it was 30 seconds of the fat kid from the

1360
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:32,940
I'm Just a Kid Simple Plan music video making out with a woman.

1361
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,140
And everyone was like, what?

1362
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:35,420
This is disgusting.

1363
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:38,220
I was disgusted by that.

1364
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:40,980
They made a kid make out with a grown woman?

1365
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:44,820
Oh no, he's like, if you look up a picture of him,

1366
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,280
he was just like the generic nerd

1367
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,000
from every early 2000s movie.

1368
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,200
Oh, but he wasn't a kid in the--

1369
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,420
No, no, he just looks like a fucking IT guy.

1370
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:59,300
Pat is like, no, he wasn't a kid, he was 14.

1371
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:02,740
Yeah, he was above New Hampshire age.

1372
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,020
The average age.

1373
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:05,860
Yeah.

1374
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,140
Now they should bring back corny commercials though.

1375
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:13,540

00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:21,340
Mm-hmm.

1407
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,820
Because I'm Toby Robbins.

1408
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,100
Toby Robbins.

1409
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,820
Toby Robbins, his PUA brother.

1410
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,820
Yeah.

1411
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,140
He's a pickup artist guy, right?

1412
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,140
They based--

1413
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:31,140
Tony Robbins?

1414
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:35,780
No, he's like-- he goes on stage and he's like, "You can-- you can have everything!"

1415
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,940
Every dollar in the world!

1416
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,820
And then, like, middle-aged women are like,

1417
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:42,540
yes, please, fuck my ass.

1418
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:45,540
- You know what, I thought Tony Robbins was the guy

1419
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,300
from, like, that elliptical commercial.

1420
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:48,820
That's a different Tony.

1421
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:50,160
- Yeah.

1422
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,820
What's up, I'm Jimmy Female Orgasm.

1423
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:55,740
- Jimmy the myth?

1424
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,580
- Yeah, no more--

1425
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,400
- Jimmy the myth!

1426
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:01,340
- No Jimmy Female Orgasm, how 'bout that?

1427
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:04,700
- Oh my God, that's what I'm talking about.

1428
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,580
Female Orgasm is his real last name.

1429
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:08,380
He just makes his first name, No Jimmy.

1430
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:09,220
- Yeah.

1431
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,820
- I would be a great pickup artist.

1432
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,300
- Oh, I'm thinking of Tony Little.

1433
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:14,380
That's a very different guy.

1434
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,940
- Tony Little, no, Tony Robbins is big.

1435
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:17,780
Tell you that much.

1436
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,700
- Tony Little's the guy with the,

1437
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:22,260
he wears the fitted hat and he's got a ponytail.

1438
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,500
- There was some pickup artist

1439
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,180
who was on Freddie Wong's podcast in 2011,

1440
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,100
whose name was, I think it was Adam Lyons.

1441
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,300
And I didn't know what a pickup artist was.

1442
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:33,700
I was just like 14.

1443
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,200
and I thought he was fucking awesome dude.

1444
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,040
- Yeah.

1445
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,700
- It was like all these nerds talking to this guy

1446
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,740
who like gets pussy all the time.

1447
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:47,280
And he was just talking about like harassing women

1448
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,120
on the street.

1449
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,460
- So what kind of special effects do you use

1450
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:51,800
in order to draw the women in?

1451
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:52,640
That's what they're saying.

1452
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:55,240
- I put my penis closer to the camera, see?

1453
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:57,220
So it looks bigger.

1454
01:00:57,220 --> 01:00:58,180
- It makes it look a little bigger.

1455
01:00:58,180 --> 01:00:59,620
- I put them in the background.

1456
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,260
I put my penis in the foreground.

1457
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,000
But yeah, he was just talking about like,

1458
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:04,840
they were like, so like,

1459
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,960
what's like the greatest pickup you've ever done?

1460
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,440
And he was like, yeah, one time I

1461
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:15,680
picked up a girl from her boyfriend on the street.

1462
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,520
- Whoa. - Yeah.

1463
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,200
- Whoa. - And I was just 14,

1464
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,920
like I would never let that happen to me, dude.

1465
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,480
I would kill, I would probably kill you.

1466
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,840
- Immediately kill that guy.

1467
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,160
- And then he talked about LARPing

1468
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:27,080
and how he would go LARPing

1469
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:28,680
and try to pick up women while he LARPed.

1470
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:30,560
- Dude, that fucking rocks.

1471
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,280
- So sad. - That fucking rocks.

1472
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,120
- Just picking up the kind of women who LARP.

1473
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,000
- 'Cause he's doing it 'cause he's like,

1474
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,680
oh yeah, well, you know, chivalry back then was different.

1475
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:38,840
- Yeah.

1476
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,440
- It's a whole different thing back then.

1477
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,400
- Yeah, super impressive.

1478
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:42,720
You picked up a woman LARPing

1479
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:45,360
'cause you were like under 350 pounds.

1480
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:46,200
- Right.

1481
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,020
- Like fucking sick.

1482
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:47,860
- You were the only person there

1483
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:49,160
who kinda looks like a knight.

1484
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,200
- Yeah, yeah, exactly, yeah.

1485
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,040
- Yeah, you're the only guy--

1486
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:52,880
- I think he's like five, six, too.

1487
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,560
- You're the only guy who's not,

1488
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:57,280
who's just pretending to be a troll.

1489
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,680
- Oh, and then I looked him up recently--

1490
01:01:58,680 --> 01:01:59,500
- I'll imagine it.

1491
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,220
He's married to like five women at the same time.

1492
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,060
- God damn, oh my God.

1493
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:08,060
- He just has like a bunch of wives on like a compound.

1494
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,160
- Oh my God.

1495
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:10,000
- So sick, dude.

1496
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,980
- It's where, I can understand if,

1497
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,240
I can understand if they all have their own houses

1498
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,540
and he just visits them, but if he's got a compound,

1499
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,380
fuck that.

1500
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,580
- I can understand having, you know, sleeping around.

1501
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,580
- I can understand having multiple wives

1502
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,180
in their own apartments.

1503
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:26,500
- Let me tell you what, one wife is plenty for me, okay?

1504
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,340
I mean, woo!

1505
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,740
- Hey, look, that's all I need, all right?

1506
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,780
That's all I need, but if I had more than one, I'd probably not put them on a compound.

1507
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,540
Five different wives telling me to get off the video game?

1508
01:02:34,540 --> 01:02:36,260
Yeah, man, sounds like paradise.

1509
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:39,820
Five times the wives is five times the chores, if you think about it.

1510
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:40,820
Exactly.

1511
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:41,820
Yeah.

1512
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:42,820
Exactly.

1513
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:43,820
I'm not doing that shit.

1514
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,660
Let's think about the pros and the cons here.

1515
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:46,660
Of five wives?

1516
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:52,820
Yeah, five wives means, uh, oh my god, but what if they all, what if one wife-

1517
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,820
Five mother-in-laws?

1518
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:54,820
No thanks.

1519
01:02:54,820 --> 01:02:55,820
Yeah, no fucking thanks.

1520
01:02:55,820 --> 01:03:02,620
Yeah, no fucking thanks. Yeah, but if they all have gay dads, that's ten father-in-laws. Yeah, I'm thinking the best life in the world

1521
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:04,900
I'm thinking we got a flag football game

1522
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:18,000
We got a whole flag football game greatest fourth of July ever I beat up all my father-in-laws Oh

1523
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:26,000
Yeah, you're gonna have those five father or those ten father-in-law's building an octagon in your backyard

1524
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,260
Right. Oh my god to be amazing

1525
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:35,140
You can have also different they could be like different characters like oceans 11 style, you know

1526
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,260
You have like you can have like an explosives expert dad

1527
01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:45,660
This is the hacker over the hacker dad like hey father-in-law the toilets claw clogged

1528
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:47,200
and he'll be like, "I'll be right over."

1529
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,000
Drops a stick of dynamite in, blows up the toilet,

1530
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,900

- His name's the cleaner.

01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:56,780
- Yes, you could have a chef.

1534
01:03:56,780 --> 01:03:58,880
- That's Billy the cleaner. - You could have a chef.

- Yeah, exactly, yeah, and then you could have,

1542
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:14,980
- Yeah, you could have like a very sexual,

1543
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:16,820
like South American father-in-law.

1544
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,860

1548
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,580
- Well, it's okay, 'cause it's not his daughter,

1549
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:28,420
it's the other one. - It's not his daughter.

1550
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:29,240
- Yeah, it's a different one.

1551
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,380
- But he comes over, he lays down the rose petals

1552
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,060
that lead to your bed, that your construction

1553
01:04:35,060 --> 01:04:36,500
father-in-law built.

1554
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,860
Yeah, and then right before he's about to penetrate--

1555
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:43,620
It's kind of like Queer Eye with dads.

1556
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:47,140
- Dude, father-in-laws for the--

01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,180

01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:01,580
- We gotta fucking pitch that to Netflix right now.

Gadget the cleaner, Musonex guy.

1583
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,380
Bombs Away is the explosive...

1584
01:05:53,380 --> 01:05:55,380
Bombs Away is the explosives expert. That's three.

1585
01:05:55,380 --> 01:05:57,380
I thought the cleaner was the explosives.

1586
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,380
There's another cleaner.

1587
01:05:59,380 --> 01:06:01,380

Wait, but they're code names, so we gotta get their code names.

1597
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:19,900
Young Dad, like he's really smart, but he like skipped a bunch of grades and became a

- No, no.

1610
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:38,820
- He's the one who asks you about your relationship

1611
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:39,660
with your father.

1612
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:40,480
- I cannot be a therapist.

1613
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,320
Get that fuck outta here.

1614
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,220

1615
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,940

There we go, that's all 10 dads right there.

1619
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:52,380
- All right, here's the fucked up thing though.

1620
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,960
Now that we have all 10 dads,

1621
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,780
I kinda want more.

1622
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:58,620
- Yeah.

1623
01:06:58,620 --> 01:06:59,820
- I kinda want more dads.

1624
01:06:59,820 --> 01:07:00,660
- All you have to do is--

1625
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:03,180
- I kinda want a monster dad, I want an alien dad,

1626
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,520

- Monster truck dad, yeah, Hillbilly redneck dad.

1629
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,240
- Caleb, here's the thing, is if you want more,

1630
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,200
all you have to do is you go--

1631
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:13,040
- Get another wife.

1632
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:15,000
- You go to the bar, you go up to a woman,

1633
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,960
you ask, "Do you have gay dads?"

1634
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:19,240
And if she says yes, you go, "Great, nice to meet you.

1635
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:20,740
"I'm Buster Hyman."

1636
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,000
(laughing)

1637
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,040
- Yeah, Buster Hyman, I barely know her, Hyman.

1638
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:28,880
- Yeah, but I will.

1639
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:29,840
- I will.

1640
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:30,680
- Oh, I will.

1641
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,500
- I will, I will.

1642
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,760
- Oh yeah, I will.

1643
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,760
I'm gonna get to know it pretty damn well.

1644
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,760
How about you and your two dads come over?

1645
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,760
Hey, my name's Buster Hyman and I know what you're thinking.

1646
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,760
Buster Hyman? I hardly know her, Hyman.

1647
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,760
But just you wait. Just you wait.

1648
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,760
[laughter]

1649
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,760
Yeah.

1650
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,760
Ooh. Hamilton dad.

1651
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,760
Hamilton dad?

1652
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,760
Yeah.

1653
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,760
What does Hamilton dad do?

1654
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,760
It's a dad who likes Hamilton.

1655
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,760
That makes sense.

1656
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,760
Civil War dad.

1666
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:55,600
McElroy style dad okay okay my dad my

1667
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,800
- My dad and my dad.

1668
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:59,800
- Skateboarder dad.

1669
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,740
- Well that's kind of covered with Sean White dad.

1670
01:09:01,740 --> 01:09:02,840
Sean White skateboards.

1671
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,040
- Gamer dad, although that could probably just be gadget.

1672
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,280
- That's gadget for sure.

1673
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:08,880
- See there's a lot of, there's too much overlap.

1674
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:12,200
- There's only about 15 types of dads you can have

1675
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,640
and then you just start doubling up.

1676
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:16,840
- So 20 is too many, but so this means that there has to be--

1677
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:17,760
- 20 is plenty.

1678
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,960
- For 15 to be the number,

1679
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:24,240
there needs to be either a widower dad or a straight dad.

1680
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,680
That's true. Oh my God, one mom?

1681
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,380
A mother-in-law could be a dad.

1682
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:33,120
The mother-in-law, you just keep her in the basement.

1683
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:35,920
'Cause I don't need a girl.

1684
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,000
I don't need you kind of.

1685
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,320
Listen, I have plenty of wives.

1686
01:09:39,320 --> 01:09:41,740
Yeah, how about you can sleep in the shed.

1687
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:46,760
You put all your wives in one room

1688
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,440
and then you and the dads get to hang out.

1689
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:49,480
Yeah.

1690
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,920
It's really just a life hack more than anything,

1691
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,000
more than a plan, you know?

1692
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,080
- Yeah.

1693
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:55,960
- 'Cause you don't wanna marry,

1694
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,040
you don't actually wanna marry any of the women.

1695
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,480
'Cause you just select them based on if you love them.

1696
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,480
You only selected them based on how cool

1697
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,480
their gay dads were.

1698
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:05,320
- Yeah.

1699
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:06,680
- You know, so you don't give a fuck about these girls.

1700
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:08,000
- If there's a widower dad though,

1701
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:09,920
then the widower dad could be like--

1702
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,840
- The widower dad's the evil dad.

1703
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,160
- Oh my God. - Oh no, dude.

1704
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,720
- Yeah, but then it's only 14 on the dad compound.

1705
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,640
- But you still have 15 total dads

1706
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,600
where you think it's important.

1707
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,120
- Yeah, you have a dog that's technically not a dad,

1708
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,120
but you can call it dog dad.

1709
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:27,600
- Yeah, it's kind of like a dog's purpose dog.

1710
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,520
- Yeah, we do need an animal, we need an animal.

1711
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,460
- Monkey dad.

1712
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,720
- The monkey dad is your actual dad

1713
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:37,480
who died and got reincarnated as a monkey.

1714
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,280
- It's like Winston from Overwatch.

1715
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,280
He just kind of like a smart gorilla.

1716
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,120
- And then you can say--

1717
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:45,100
- It's like the monkey from Night at the Museum.

1718
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:45,940
- Okay.

1719
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:48,440
- You can say, yeah, yeah, and my dad's a monkey.

1720
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:50,160
- Yeah, turns out.

1721
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:51,640
- Yeah.

1722
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,280
But like if somebody says something unbelievable,

1723
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,120
you could be like, yeah, yeah.

1724
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,240
And my dad's a monkey.

1725
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,080
My dad's a monkey.

1726
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,480
Yeah, and I got a dad who's a hacker named Gadget.

1727
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:04,040
Yeah, and I have 15 dads and they all live on a compound.

1728
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:04,880
Yeah, sure.

1729
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,080
Except for one's a monkey.

1730
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,060
Yeah, totally.

1731
01:11:07,060 --> 01:11:10,960
I have seven wives and I've never seen them naked.

1732
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:12,400
Yeah, sure, man.

1733
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,600
Yeah, and one of my dads is evil

1734
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,040
and he keeps trying to blow us up,

1735
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:17,880
but we've been using different war tactics to attack him

1736
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,640
and kind of prevent him from destroying us.

1737
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:21,160
Yeah, okay, sure.

1738
01:11:21,160 --> 01:11:25,800
Yeah, we have a big computer that's got an AI in it, and that's technically a dad too.

1739
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:27,880
Yeah, and we also have Cyber Dad.

1740
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:30,520
Yeah, Cyber Dad, that's like the Jarvis.

1741
01:11:30,520 --> 01:11:33,080
It's not Gadget, it's like the... yeah, no, he's like...

1742
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,080
He was a dad created by Gadget.

1743
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,080
He's like Cyborg from Teen Titans.

1744
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:37,000
Yeah, sure, a dad created by Gadget.

1745
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,960
And my name's Hunter Poon.

1746
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,160
Hunter Poon, I barely know her, Poon.

1747
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:47,560
Anyway, a six-pack of Bud Light should not cost ten dollars.

1748
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,820
(laughter)

1749
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:51,220
- It's so long.

1750
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:54,900
- He's just talking to the grocery store.

1751
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:58,100
He's like, yeah, if that costs $10, then I have 15 dads.

1752
01:11:58,100 --> 01:11:58,940
Yeah, sure.

1753
01:11:58,940 --> 01:11:59,780
- I have 15 dads and a gadget dad,

1754
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:02,340
and one of them is an AI created by a gadget dad.

1755
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,180
- Yeah.

1756
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:06,380
Anyway, I'll take my beer and hold on.

1757
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,860
(whistling)

1758
01:12:08,860 --> 01:12:10,060
Dads assemble!

1759
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:12,700
(laughter)

1760
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,340
- And by the way, they're not just dads.

1761
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:16,740
They're dad-in-laws.

1762
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:18,380
and then he walks out of the store

1763
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:21,620
and you might wanna watch out for hitman dad

1764
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:25,260
red dot appears on kissier's head. They're not dads, they're just my brothers

1765
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:29,660
yeah they're more than dads. First it was dads, now it's brothers. cheaper by the

1766
01:12:29,660 --> 01:12:36,100
fifteen dads and me. cheaper by the baker's dozen

1767
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:42,100
cheaper by the baker's dozen of dads. well if that ain't a dad's dozen i don't know what is

1768
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:43,940
That's a daddy's dozen.

1769
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:47,540
That's a daddy's dozen if I've ever seen one.

1770
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:49,340
Oh, alright.

1771
01:12:49,340 --> 01:12:53,780
Oh my god.

1772
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:54,780
I love having fun.

1773
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:55,780
Yeah.

1774
01:12:55,780 --> 01:12:56,780
Me too.

1775
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:57,780
I love to have fun.

1776
01:12:57,780 --> 01:12:58,780
I wish that my-

1777
01:12:58,780 --> 01:12:59,780
It's one of the top ten things.

1778
01:12:59,780 --> 01:13:00,780
Yeah.

1779
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:01,780
Alright.

1780
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:02,780
I should be dad soon.

1781
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:03,780
Alright, we can end now.

1782
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:04,780
I just-

1783
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:06,180
Yeah, no, that was important to do.

1784
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,180
Yeah, we had to-

1785
01:13:07,180 --> 01:13:08,180
That was very important to flesh out.

1786
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:09,660
We had to explain the dads.

1787
01:13:09,660 --> 01:13:10,660
Yeah.

1788
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,660
Alright.

1789
01:13:11,660 --> 01:13:15,980
of dads.

1790
01:13:15,980 --> 01:13:25,980
