1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
(music)

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
That was a bad clap.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
That was a terrible clap. There we go.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
That was better.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
That was a fine clap, it wasn't that big of a deal.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Fine ass clap.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
So what did you guys do this weekend?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
If you'll allow me to explain my weekend with a Primus song parody.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Go ahead.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,160
(humming)

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:39,500
Too many birthday parties.

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,200
- I could do one too.

13
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,040
- Okay, go ahead.

14
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,000
- I had some fun.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,240
(laughing)

16
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,040
You know?

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,120
We had some fun.

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,760
(laughing)

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,600
- That would be my game.

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,420
- My game is fun.

21
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,160
(laughing)

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,000
- My game is fun.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,840
(laughing)

24
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,940
- Yeah, I played Hogwarts last year.

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:02,120
(humming)

26
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,240
My game is fun.

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,480
(laughing)

28
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,320
- No.

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,520
- What, I'm blanking on all the fuckin' Primus songs.

30
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,680
I used to listen to them so much.

31
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,080
I can't even think, like, oh, Tommy the Cat,

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,600
Jare was a race car driver.

33
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,440
I can't even think of them as parodies right now.

34
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:19,120
- I don't even really know,

35
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,880
I don't know Primus as a band all that well,

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,280
if I'm completely honest.

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,400
When I was like 12 years old, I think I downloaded their entire discography on like

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,040
U-Torrent and I don't think that like they're everything they ever put.

39
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,720
I've never met anybody who's like, oh yeah, Primus is my favorite band.

40
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,200
Well, that's because you meet them and they say Primus sucks.

41
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
Yeah. And you're like, it's a prank.

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,400
What the fuck are you talking about?

43
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,920
I see your T-shirt.

44
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,560
Wait, is that a long greasy hair?

45
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,640
Is that a thing?

46
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,560
Primus sucks.

47
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,160
That's their thing.

48
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
That's a joke they do?

49
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,160
You're wearing a pork soda T-shirt.

50
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,560
You're saying that Primus sucks?

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,520
Primus sucks.

52
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,440
Motherfucker. You're making me...

53
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,320
Tommy, do you need something?

54
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,480
I'm sorry. I'm just... Sorry. I'm just...

55
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,040
You good?

56
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,120
I'm looking at the numbers. You guys... No, no. You guys keep talking.

57
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,960
Okay. We could just keep doing this.

58
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
Yeah, yeah. Let us know. Yeah.

59
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,280
If you have any notes or anything for how we could make anything we do more cost efficient,

60
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
just let us know. But in whatever.

61
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,920
Yeah, I'll pop in. It's looking a little crazy, though.

62
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,400
It's looking bad.

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,920
I'm looking at some of the receipts, and it's not looking good. I mean,

64
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,560
I'm sorry to interrupt.

65
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,560
Yeah, no, no, of course.

66
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,560
No, it's really not a big deal.

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Don't worry.

68
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,760
I am looking over everything and it is just, it's a lot.

69
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,760
It's a lot.

70
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,760
Okay.

71
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,760
Okay.

72
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
That's kind of making me worried.

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,760
That's fine.

74
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
It's a lot.

75
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,760
Do you, have you ever listened to Primus?

76
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,760
No, I don't.

77
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,760
Do you know what that is?

78
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,760
No.

79
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,760
What's the premise?

80
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,760
No, it's about a band called Primus.

81
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Primus.

82
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,560
They had a song in Guitar Hero.

83
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,560
Yeah.

84
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,560
John the Fisherman.

85
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,560
No, I don't know.

86
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,080
I'm sorry, I'm not, I'm just not, I'm focused.

87
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,080
We'll let you go.

88
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,000
- We'll go back to it, yeah, yeah.

89
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,480
- Probably like an accountant version of a Primus song,

90
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,320
what would that be?

91
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,720
- Yeah, okay, let's do it.

92
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,880
- It's one plus one.

93
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,080
That's the only Primus song I know.

94
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,720
- When I grow up, I want to be

95
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,840
a CPA in New York City.

96
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,680
- The John the Fisherman?

97
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,600
- You're a CPA.

98
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,420
- No.

99
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,260
- Yeah, you are.

100
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,100
- No.

101
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,920
- Child born acquirer.

102
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,760
- No.

103
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,600
- I was gonna go for addict.

104
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,720
- Nope.

105
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,560
- Admirer.

106
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,400
- Yeah.

107
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,360
(laughing)

108
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,480
- That is not true.

109
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Well then what are you?

110
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,240
Then what's the A stand for?

111
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,400
There's no, that's not what I am.

112
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Associator.

113
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
No.

114
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
A liker.

115
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,400
A liker?

116
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,400
A liker.

117
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
A liker.

118
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
Amazing.

119
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
Assalamu alaikum.

120
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,400
What?

121
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Assalamu alaikum.

122
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
That's what you got?

123
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,880
Look, I'm not, I'm really worried about our finances right now.

124
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,720
You guys wrote off five charities.

125
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Five charities?

126
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,280
You guys are donating to charities but it's too many.

127
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,760
It's an excessive amount and you can't, I mean you're gonna get audited.

128
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,120
Isn't it good to, first of all, aren't you auditing us right now?

129
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,720
I am auditing you guys, but you can only donate to so, I mean you can't claim that many charities.

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
You're not gonna get that money back.

131
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,280
But so, okay so here's the thing.

132
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,280
I love charity.

133
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,840
Yeah we just started charity.

134
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,800
So I've always been told it's good to donate to charity.

135
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Okay first off, children with Alzheimer's?

136
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,400
It's good to wash your hands after you use the bathroom.

137
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
That's real.

138
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,400
That's important.

139
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,560
Where do you think certain members of the podcast,

140
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,120
why do you think they got on in the first place,

141
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,220
make a wish for that, for four years.

142
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,940
Okay, I mean, you gave all your money

143
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,100
to the Lou Garrett Foundation,

144
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:38,900
but you just Venmoed a guy named Lou Garrett.

145
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,740
Garretts.

146
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,160
It was Lou Garrett, yes it was Lou Garrett.

147
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,000
You've never--

148
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,680
You Venmoed a guy named Luke Garrett.

149
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,460
So you've never been in this situation

150
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,740
where somebody says, hey, will you Venmo me

151
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,660
for half of that coffee that we split.

152
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,160
And then you go to Venmo them,

153
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,600
and yeah, you type their name in wrong.

154
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,160
And I'm not gonna enter their phone number.

155
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,140
I don't know their phone number.

156
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,420
I'm paying without confirming.

157
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,520
Suck my dick, Venmo.

158
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,360
Hold on, I'm sorry.

159
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,500
- Eight bees.

160
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,520
- Eight bees?

161
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,500
I'm just, Cam, did you do?

162
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,980
- I wasn't me.

163
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,620
Maybe two to three bees at most.

164
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,260
- I think we collectively bought a couple bees.

165
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:15,660
- Listen, he had three bees, he had four bees, I had a bee.

166
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,300
It's not a big deal, okay?

167
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,300
We're gonna start a honey thing.

168
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,300
They're not that expensive.

169
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,540
We're gonna start like a honey, we're gonna start jarring our own honey.

170
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,340
You donated $10,000 to the plus, an LGBTQ plus.

171
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,780
I wanted to know what that could mean.

172
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,300
I thought it was like a microtransaction.

173
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,140
Do you even know who those guys are?

174
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:35,180
I thought I had to unlock it.

175
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,780
Wait, wait, are you saying that it's bad to do that?

176
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:42,500
Well I'm just saying it's just the, $10,000 to just the plus.

177
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,220
Maybe it's somebody with an electric power.

178
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,340
That's what I was thinking when I donated the money.

179
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,620
I thought I was saying I was gonna plus their money.

180
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,060
I was gonna add to their money.

181
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:49,900
Oh yeah.

182
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,740
I was plussing them.

183
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:52,420
Well I clicked on the plus

184
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,780
'cause I thought it would kind of expand.

185
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,620
I thought it was like an X.

186
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,440
I thought it was an X,

187
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,280
I thought it was closing the window.

188
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,120
(laughing)

189
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,940
I didn't donate anything.

190
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,780
Get the fuck out of here.

191
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,340
It's not that big of a deal, okay?

192
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,180
I don't know why,

193
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,700
you have a fucking stick up your ass

194
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700

195
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,540
Well I'm looking,

196
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,580
I'm just crunching the numbers over here

197
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,820
and it's just, I mean like,

198
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,460

199
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,300
Yes it was.

200
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,120
Yes it was.

201
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,960
Yes it was.

202
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,100
I mean like, walk me through this year.

203
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:17,940
I mean, like the finances.

204
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,420
- Okay, where does it start?

205
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,660
Whores. - January.

206
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,740
- Cocaine.

207
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,820
- Oh yeah. - January.

208
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,660
March, April, May, June.

209
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,100
Not February.

210
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,060
- Not yet. - Didn't need that.

211
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,100
- Not February yet.

212
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,540
- Basically, we were doing everything we wanted.

213
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,740
We were living like rock stars.

214
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:34,780
- So great that you memorized them all.

215
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,340
- Yeah, it was hard, but that was another thing

216
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,180
we spent money on was lessons.

217
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,700
- Tutors. - Tutors for that.

218
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,540
- Month lessons.

219
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,620
- But I think that the reality is,

220
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,460
we knew this was coming, right?

221
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,820
So we lived our entire our whole year our whole tax year, okay, we lived it going. Oh who gives a fuck man exactly

222
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,820
Okay, what's the worst that happens?

223
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:58,780
Yes, I'm fucking nerd shows up, and he's dripping wet sitting our studio. I don't know what you're talking about okay?

224
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:04,600
What's this chiropractors without borders chiropractors without borders is the charity that I started?

225
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,580
Okay, so you now are you getting through your thing that we're laundering money?

226
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:17,200
Ass so those chiropractors are going across seas to go to Mexico City. We made it up so that we could give him money

227
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,800
Yeah for free can I talk to you in private? Yeah?

228
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,680
Guess we take our headphones. Yeah, you can't be saying that

229
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,220
That's why I know that you know that why but you cannot be saying cares about any it

230
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,120
What are they gonna do put us in jail listen if if the boys down at the IRS knew that you said that?

231
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:43,120
I'm what they do I go to jail. They're nerds. I'm not afraid of nerds if you guys hire still hear everything some Josh

232
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,240
No, oh, well, maybe put them on backwards. Can you put your headphones back? There we go

233
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:53,060
I'm not scared of the nerds at the IRS. Okay, you know what I'm scared of Slenderman

234
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,500
Yeah, that kind of shit is like actual scary shit where people die. Well, then or I have it in my notes that

235
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,680
Cameron bought a haunted house and you're trying to write that off

236
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,320
He should be. Okay, easy write off. You are not familiar with the tax code. You think you'll be able to write that off?

237
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,160
No, you can write it off. If you buy a house, if you buy a house and you find out it's haunted, you can write it off.

238
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,920
Yeah. Just drinking that wrong. Just drink the water. Just drink it right. Drink it normal. It goes in your mouth.

239
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I'm, I'm, this is, it is not looking good. I'm nervous.

240
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Okay. You're nervous? You're nervous. I'm nervous. You're nervous. Why are you nervous?

241
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Because if the boys find out, because I'm cheating. I'm cheating.

242
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:32,320
- Are you cooking our books?

243
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,280
Can I talk to all of you guys in private?

244
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,120
- Yes.

245
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,960
- Yes.

246
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,780
- All right, everyone put their headphones around.

247
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,120
- Everybody who's listening, take your headphones off.

248
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,920
- Yeah, turn the episode off right now

249
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,280
and then turn it back on in like two minutes.

250
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,200
- I'm cooking the books.

251
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,040
- You're cooking our books.

252
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,200
- You're cooking the books.

253
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,720
- And dinner, dinner's ready.

254
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,840
Get your supper pot about this, guys.

255
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,880
- You're ringing the dinner bell for us.

256
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,840
- Dinner bell is tolled?

257
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,800
- I just put these books in the microwave

258
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,280
and it took two minutes.

259
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,040
- You have the popcorn setting.

260
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,080
The books are poppin'.

261
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,920
- It's gonna be hot.

262
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,400
So don't overcook them though.

263
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,640
- Don't overcook the books.

264
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,480
- So wait, so when you say cook the books,

265
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,320
are we changing, so like the haunted house thing,

266
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,280
how do we cook that?

267
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,200
What do we do with that?

268
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,440
- That's easy, that's easy.

269
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,960
Native American burial ground.

270
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,480
- Yeah, and if you use it as one of your little bits,

271
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,920
one of your little skits,

272
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,080
as long as it can be included,

273
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,320
is this a comedy podcast?

274
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
- Yeah.

275
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:27,980
- It used to be.

276
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:29,280
- What is it now?

277
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,360
- It's a lot of stuff like this.

278
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,200
- Yeah.

279
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,020
- Okay.

280
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,600
Well, if you, in your taxes,

281
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,440
you guys are claiming to be a comedy podcast still.

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,800
'Cause that's from 2021.

283
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,360
- More drama, radio drama play.

284
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,840
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,920
Character based.

286
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,760
- Right.

287
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,600
- Doing skits and sketches and stuff.

288
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
- So if it's for, if you can claim that it's a joke,

289
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,600
then I think this is good.

290
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,420
- So what do we do?

291
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,160
So like here.

292
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,960
- So we can just claim every single one of these.

293
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,800
- Yeah, so we need to turn.

294
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
- I have that can.

295
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Wait, no, I've got it.

296
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
I heard that Caleb bought a gun.

297
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,100
That's true, though.

298
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,580
I know exactly how we get out of all of it, how we write all this stuff off.

299
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:10,320
All right. All I have to do is say, "So I bought a haunted house recently."

300
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,040
Oh, yeah, OK.

301
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,740
I had the craziest experience.

302
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,620
What happened?

303
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,780
I bought a haunted house.

304
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,280
That should be enough.

305
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,120
Yeah, but I'm a little interested because I haven't heard that much about it.

306
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,260
You bought a haunted house.

307
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,160
What did you... Did you know it was haunted when you bought it?

308
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,460
No, no, I did not.

309
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:25,660
What?

310
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,260
The realtor didn't say something?

311
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,580
I've seen Nathan for you.

312
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,700
Yeah, I know that they have those ghost realtors now.

313
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,300
I'm actually involved in a huge legal battle, and I don't think I'm actually supposed to

314
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,220
say all that much about...

315
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:38,580
Okay, well, are you getting sued by a ghost?

316
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,100
I am suing a ghost. I shouldn't say that.

317
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,100
Yeah.

318
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Oh, you're suing a ghost.

319
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,100
We didn't say what ghost.

320
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,820
Yeah, we're not going to say who or how old they are.

321
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,260
It's a child ghost that you're suing?

322
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,820
How long ago from they went or died.

323
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
It's Anton Yelchin.

324
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
Yeah.

325
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Oh, my bad.

326
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,580
- Hold on, let me make it. - Yeah.

327
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,100
- Yeah, don't write that down. - Don't write it.

328
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,860
- Actually, don't. - People don't like it when we say it.

329
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,500
- I'm writing a reminder to not write it down.

330
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,300
- Imagine being the guy who bought that Jeep.

331
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
(laughing)

332
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,640
- The used Jeep.

333
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,420
- Imagine they buy that. - It's a face imprint,

334
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,620
like one of those toys that's all the little needles.

335
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:21,420
- Imagine you get the wheel cover as a Han Solo

336
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,420
version of Carbonite. (laughing)

337
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:30,980
Imagine you get a second hand Jeep and you take it to the shop, you get the check engine

338
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,020
light turns on, you take it to the shop, you're like "what's going on?"

339
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,060
They open up the hood and they're like "oh here's your problem, it's full of anti-yelching."

340
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,060
Just ground beads.

341
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,060
That's terrible.

342
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,060
It hit him backwards though.

343
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,220
It hit him backwards so I don't think it would be a hitch.

344
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,420
It went all in.

345
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,740
It's like when a baby poops his pants and goes up his back.

346
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:57,100
Go to the fucking mechanic. They're like oh, I see what the problem is. Let me just check your trunk. Yep

347
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:06,900
God damn it. I knew that used car sales. No, he sold me Anton Yeltsin. Well, but depending on how you look at it

348
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:13,780
Hey, I want to return that you fuck just wait a second. I can sell his bones. Yeah, Adam - so yeah

349
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,420
We're going back to the dealer that sells like the used car dealer that sells you that car and he's like, all right

350
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:26,540
Alright, alright. I know that I sold you Anton Yelchin's Jeep that killed him, but I have

351
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:31,140
another. You can trade it in for this 1994 white Bronco.

352
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,580
What do you got there?

353
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,700
Well, transportation, we can write that off.

354
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,140
Yeah, I think so, right?

355
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,700
Yeah, I have it in the email that Patrick wants to write off skateboarding.

356
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Like just the whole process?

357
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
How much does it cost?

358
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
I thought that was free.

359
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
The way that I do it, it's trust me.

360
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
Patrick's trying to write off gas too, but he doesn't mean car gas.

361
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
He just means the gas he's been farting.

362
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
And he wants to write that off as a food cost.

363
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
I had cabbage.

364
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
That's disgusting.

365
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
But he's trying to include it under transportation.

366
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
Cabbage and Romesco.

367
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
It's like a propellant.

368
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
There's a video I saw, I made a cabbage recipe.

369
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
And I've just been stinking up a storm in here.

370
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Yeah, but he's trying to write that off.

371
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Include that in the transportation.

372
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,760
Yeah, I it's on the skateboard and it makes him shoot twice as fast with a green. I think I can swing

373
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,440
I think I can swing my back. Let me explain baby. I don't know I put my hands behind my back

374
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,520
I bend over I fart and it shoots me like a rocket down the street mm-hmm. Yeah, and and kids walking by go

375
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:40,020
Yeah

376
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,620
And then he gets he shows up to work. He says yeah, I got fucking cat called again

377
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:56,540
Yeah made fun of by Morty some gangsters on the street were yelling at me again today gangsta some gangsters were saying some game

378
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,380
They're saying pyroop

379
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,900
Cuz they're gangsta thugs

380
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:09,180
But actually he had so I have to write that off hyper foolish you can I think you can I think you can write that

381
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
off okay um

382
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
Caleb bought a gun I think he can

383
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,880
I think

384
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,440
Okay

385
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:28,680
I think you're gonna get in trouble if you don't sing along -

386
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,880
Well as long as it's is we're talking about

387
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:38,600
As in a comedy way, you know if like Caleb went to like a mall and went we I got a gun

388
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,280
I'm crazy if we're filming it and we're filming that yeah, that's a joke. Okay, I'll prank gone wrong

389
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,280
Yeah, but I have a real gun and maybe I accidentally

390
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,720
Pop off a couple let a couple of rounds fly. Uh-huh footlocker, you know, and I accidentally not at a foot

391
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,820
Maybe I actually any other lady footlocker orange Julius stay away from footlocker

392
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,640
if I

393
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:08,500
Like footlocker, yeah, that's my store you guys can't go in there. Okay, that's where I get my shoes. Okay, how about finish line?

394
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,040
You can how about play it against the way that you're you either way you're asking me makes me think I should say no when I see

395
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,220
Well that's when I see a lane competitor when I see lady footlocker. I just think that's a regular footlocker damn

396
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:27,840
See you're wasting your time being an accountant. You should be on a comedy podcast with lines like this. I would hate to do that yeah

397
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:35,200
You know I would really fucking hate to do that. It's probably just would make you kill yourself if that was your job

398
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
It's looking really bad

399
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,300
well on your w-2s

400
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:45,020
You

401
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:52,460
Cameron you wrote so for total income that you guys have make because you're splitting the income well what the fuck's a w-2

402
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:57,580
Well you feel I don't know so people can't say

403
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:04,260
Worcestershire sauce they say that well it's Worcestershire sauce and then another times another Worcestershire sauce

404
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,820
Well, what the fuck, what is a W-2 form?

405
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:11,300
Well, it's just, I think I don't need to explain this anymore.

406
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,800
Okay.

407
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,220
No, but on your seriously though, if we can get down the brass tacks.

408
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,100
Let's get down the brass tacks.

409
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,820
Which is kind of what I do. You guys, so you're splitting the pot about lists, income.

410
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,980
Three perfect ways.

411
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:30,500
Three perfect ways. I have it in the books. Caleb, 80%, you 10%.

412
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,820
and another 10% goes to your producer.

413
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,220
You haven't received any, and that's--

414
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,700
- Well, he comes from money, so we figure--

415
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,660
And also, he does the least amount of work.

416
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,180
- Uncle is Mitt Romney.

417
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,020
- Yeah.

418
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,820
- No shit.

419
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,060
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

420
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,900
- So you might wanna be careful about who you go after,

421
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,820
tax-wise.

422
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,020
- That's actually pretty cool.

423
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,380
- Yeah, so just like watch.

424
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,020
- You know that one of those big-ass photos

425
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,580
where it's him and his 600 kids?

426
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,420
- Yeah.

427
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,240
- He's usually--

428
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,080
- I'm usually taking the picture.

429
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,920
- Yeah.

430
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,740
- They make me take the picture.

431
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,740
And anytime he gets there, he always takes one of himself.

432
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,240
I think every single time, I always set the self-timer and I run to get in and I trip

433
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,240
and I'm always right in the front of it on the ground.

434
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:15,640
If you zoom in on the Cool Cousins aviator sunglasses, you can see him tripping and falling.

435
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,040
I always remember looking at that picture and finding Waldo in there.

436
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Yeah, well here it is.

437
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,740
If you ask me, they're all Waldos.

438
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:27,240
So you wrote down on your total income, you just wrote MX plus B equals Y, the slope.

439
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,240
I don't know what that means.

440
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,680
Patrick you just wrote down the color blue. Mm-hmm. My my bank account is out of the red and the black

441
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:41,320
Making so much. Okay. I think I can work with that Caleb. You just wrote down. Don't worry about it

442
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Also say how do you mother for me? Yeah, I

443
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:48,360
Kind of thought that was cool that actually it was that actually is fucking dopey. It was cool

444
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,240
Listen, I'm here to clean that all up. Okay, and I know you guys like to make a lot of jokes and stuff

445
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeah, well, let's just put our just put our actual income in eight million just each. Yeah, put it in

446
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,920
- 8 mil a piece. - We'll take that.

447
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,440
Yeah, 8 mil a piece, that's nothing.

448
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,280
- Yep. - Okay, let me just swap.

449
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,080
- YouTube ad money. - Yeah.

450
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,800
- That's YouTube ads go crazy.

451
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,600
- And our Spotify streams. - Yeah, Spotify streams.

452
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,960
- For our music careers. - And our new,

453
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,560
we now are officially partnered

454
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,440
with the podcast hosting app, Bloober.

455
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,720
The Bloober by Chup.

456
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,600
- The Bloober, the game company?

457
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,060
- No, it's the app that we made, remember?

458
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,360
- And yeah. - To launder more money.

459
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,640
Oh yeah, one of those.

460
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,880
I thought we were going to call that Money Laundry.

461
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,520
No.

462
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,200
That app.

463
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,680
No, we weren't going to call it Money Laundry,

464
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,640
because that would make it one too obvious too.

465
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,480
Everyone would think it's a damn laundry app.

466
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,720
What about Laundromat?

467
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,560
That'd be sick.

468
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
If you guys came up--

469
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,640
That would be a great name for our podcast network.

470
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,480
I grew up with a guy named Laundromat.

471
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,240
Really?

472
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,800
Where are you from?

473
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,760
Are you from Baltimore?

474
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:49,260
Yep.

475
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,400
Oh, damn.

476
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,000
OK.

477
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,040
I didn't know.

478
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,400
That makes sense, though.

479
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,880
You'd walk around going, what's up?

480
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,120
My name Laundromat.

481
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,400
Laundromat.

482
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,160
- Yeah. - Laundromat.

483
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,200
- His taxes are looking great.

484
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,040
- Yeah.

485
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,000
- We're getting beat by Laundromat?

486
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
- Yeah.

487
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,240
He's a dentist.

488
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,640
- You still do his taxes?

489
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,480
- Every day.

490
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,680
- Yeah, every day.

491
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,160
(laughing)

492
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:14,680
You're just making sure every single day that they're fine?

493
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,760
- Yeah, I like what I do.

494
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,600
- You like it.

495
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
How did you get into this whole tax game?

496
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,120
I'm curious.

497
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,580
- Well, I was, when I got out of the league.

498
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,880
- Yeah, which league?

499
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,000
- The NBA.

500
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,920
- You were in the NBA?

501
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,760
- Yeah.

502
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:35,160
play? Sacramento. You were a Sactown King. Yeah, I was a king. Only for like, I was barely

503
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:41,120
on the team. I think I remember seeing you though. I feel like I watched a game. I maybe

504
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,400
saw you dunking. Coming down the court, Tommy Bayer with a massive slam. Yeah, but even

505
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,000
then I was just like, well they brought me up from the B leagues. The B league? Yeah,

506
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
The B League.

507
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
In between the G League and the NBA?

508
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,920
Yeah, they brought me up from the B Leagues.

509
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,600
And so I only played for about six months for the Kings.

510
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,520
But it was all right.

511
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,720
Then I was overseas playing in China for a bit.

512
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,000
But yeah, I have a degree in taxes.

513
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
So once basketball disappeared.

514
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Was it the pandemic?

515
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
It was the pandy?

516
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,080
Well, in the pandemic, we all lost our jobs.

517
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,680
So I got laid off from the MBA.

518
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:24,600
- Yeah, that's tough.

519
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,440
- So I was like, all right.

520
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,880
And that's why you go to college,

521
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,000
you have a degree to fall back on.

522
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
- Right, and it was taxes.

523
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
- It was taxes, you know, and I like doing it.

524
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,560
I've always liked doing it.

525
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,400
- Yeah.

526
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,800
- It's just something you do when you're bored.

527
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,360
- Well, when I was a kid.

528
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,800
- Yeah, you used to do taxes for fun.

529
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,160
- I do my taxes when I'm bored.

530
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,000
Look at how many, like I have probably like,

531
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,200
see all that stack right there?

532
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,120
That's probably all of my returns.

533
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,720
- Ball is life, taxes is life, man.

534
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,080
It's always-- - Yeah, it's that simple.

535
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,680
- That's always been the case from the jump.

536
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,520
- 100%.

537
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,480
- But enough about me, man.

538
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,760
We gotta get back to your taxes.

539
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,780
Caleb, it's my understanding that you're getting married?

540
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,360
- Yeah, I'm getting married, yeah.

541
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,280
- You're getting married and you're doing a wedding?

542
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,440
- Yeah, I'm doing a wedding, yeah.

543
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,640
- All right, so this is the big question

544
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,880
everybody asks this, okay?

545
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,400
Are you doing band, DJ, or live podcast?

546
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,160
Do the live podcast, you can write that down.

547
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,280
- Oh my God, okay.

548
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,280
I will be doing a live recording of the Joe Rogan experience at my wedding.

549
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,280
Good choice.

550
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,280
Congratulations.

551
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,280
Congratulations, that's a good choice.

552
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,280
I have not gotten an invite yet, but I'm busy.

553
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
Okay.

554
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,280
Okay, so I won't send you one then. That's fine.

555
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,280
Yeah.

556
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,280
Unless you just want it for your fridge.

557
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,280
Yeah, maybe just send it, but I do think I'm busy.

558
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,280
Hey, somebody needs to tell my mom, "Hey, bitch, that wedding was five years ago.

559
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,280
Get that motherfucking thing off your fridge, you dumbass slut."

560
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,080
- No, mom I love you.

561
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,300
- I'll say that to her.

562
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,600
- Yeah, say that again.

563
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,200
- Yeah, Amanda already got married.

564
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,960
- You can say that again.

565
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,840
- And also by the way,

566
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,480
she gained a lot of weight since that photo.

567
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,640
We don't need that on the fridge, it's misleading.

568
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,360
- It's gonna make her sad when she comes over

569
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,200
and they said it. - Yeah, exactly.

570
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,600
She's gonna go, oh man, I used to be so happy

571
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,000
before I married this guy.

572
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,840
And then you're just on the couch and she's crying

573
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,280
and she tells you all those awful things.

574
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,460
- And then guess what, your ice cream's gone.

575
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,300
- Yeah.

576
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,440
- 'Cause that's what women eat when they cry.

577
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,520
- What do you guys think about how divorce rates

578
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,100
keep going up. Yeah. And the birth rate keeps going down. Holy shit.

579
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,480
Are we living in end times? I kind of think we are.

580
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,400
Are we collapsing as a society?

581
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,080
Do you know sperm counts are going down as well? And here's what it is.

582
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,880
Not mine. Mine are going up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up,

583
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,920
except for this VRL young bastard. I just heard sperm counts are going down.

584
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,880
I got scared. Well, not yours. You took your headphones off.

585
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,400
I get scared about that sort of stuff. You get scared about sperm counts?

586
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,740
Well, because you're probably here in sperm count, sperm count, and you're such a mathematical

587
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,640
mind he needs to cool down.

588
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,080
You're such a mathematically minded guy, you're like, "Well, get me in there.

589
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,080
Let me start counting.

590
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
One, two, three, four."

591
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,080
I count all those sperms though.

592
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,000
I go to the sperm bank once a week.

593
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,840
I said, "I'd like to make a deposit, please."

594
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,240
And you just shoot one right in her face.

595
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Just the teller.

596
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,240
You're already edging yourself as you walk in.

597
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,500
(laughing)

598
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,040
- You walk in and you go,

599
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,280
"I like to make it a party."

600
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,760
- And sometimes I walk in there with a friend

601
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,640
and I go, "Me and my buddy would like to open up a joint."

602
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
(laughing)

603
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,720
- Shoot, one on her leg.

604
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,320
- And me and my friend do that.

605
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,520
- Sometimes I go at like 10 p.m.

606
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,520
I have to go into the little ATM area.

607
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,040
I have to put my card in.

608
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,240
- I hate using the ATM at the sperm bank

609
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,160
'cause they always say like,

610
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,000
Chip read error.

611
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,160
Yeah, I put my cock in there.

612
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,240
The ATM at the sperm bank ate my dick.

613
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,080
Oh no.

614
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,040
I had to get another one, they had to send me another one.

615
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:50,140
Yo, ATM at the sperm bank, throat goat.

616
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,400
(laughing)

617
00:23:52,400 --> 00:24:00,560
Dude, our tax man's fuckin' unleashed today.

618
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,280
This guy's going crazy.

619
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:05,640
Are you sure that's not fuckin' vodka or is that water?

620
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,280
I'm so fucked up right now, man.

621
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,360
(laughing)

622
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:11,240
I'm really fucked up. I actually do have a serious problem.

623
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:12,240
Yeah? What's your problem?

624
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,240
With alcohol?

625
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,080
I'd love to... hard I trust too fast. Trust too hard I love too fast.

626
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,560
You huff to trust you fast?

627
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,120
I love... that's my problem.

628
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
Oh.

629
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,760
Your problem is you huff to trust you fast.

630
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,680
I love too hard and I trust too fast.

631
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,840
Oh, okay. Now I get it. Yeah. And maybe you double dribble too. That's an old habit.

632
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,240
Don't tell me... don't bring it up.

633
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,240
You were ama-- oh, I'm remembering your play style now.

634
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,880
You were an amazing three-point shooter.

635
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,640
You could dunk from the free throw line,

636
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,960
but you pretty much double dribbled every single time

637
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,800
that you played basketball.

638
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,600
What the fuck is this?

639
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,640
You guys hear about these?

640
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,240
Is this a Zen?

641
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,920
Zens?

642
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,880
Lower deckies, upper deckies.

643
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,160
What are you talking about?

644
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,720
I'm getting zenned and zaned out.

645
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,760
Right now, while you're doing our taxes?

646
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,360
You got to get the brain working.

647
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,000
Is this a nicotine?

648
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,920
Nicotine makes your brain move faster.

649
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:06,960
It's proven.

650
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,160
- Are the Zins good?

651
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,000
- Huh?

652
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,040
- Do they make you like throw up?

653
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,880
- No.

654
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,760
- That's what I would be scared of.

655
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,600
- What are they?

656
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,840
They're all, they're just mint pouches, right?

657
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,400
My little brother was addicted to these things.

658
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,600
- Spearmint, yeah, I got into them a few weeks ago

659
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,240
and they're pretty good.

660
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,080
- Were you smoking before that?

661
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,640
- I guess they have a point system that you can,

662
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,760
you can redeem points on the Zin packets.

663
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,680
- You want some help opening that?

664
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,880
Oh, you got it, okay.

665
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,000
- For stuff, you can get like a Zin T-shirt.

666
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,320
It's just a piece of paper you put in your mouth.

667
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,820
- That is awful.

668
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:37,040
This is the new thing that people do?

669
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,500
- Yeah, my little brother was hooked on those.

670
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,140
- It's called getting zinned and zaned out, brother.

671
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:42,980
- Is it good or bad?

672
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,260
Does it make you feel bad or good?

673
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,740
- Makes you feel pretty good.

674
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,700
But it kinda makes you feel bad at the same time.

675
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
- Yeah, I mean, you're still,

676
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,220
you're putting something in your mouth.

677
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,620
- All good drugs kinda strike that perfect balance.

678
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,620
Any drug, don't--

679
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,020
- Don't spit on camera.

680
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,860
- No, hey!

681
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,680
- Don't do one of those.

682
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,940
- Watch it.

683
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,820
- I'm trying to watch your taxes.

684
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,340
- Okay, keep watching the thing.

685
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,820
- You guys keep interrupting my flow.

686
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:11,480
Looked at this receipt yet. What is that for? Give me that? What does that one say it says?

687
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:19,900
Doesn't say it just says just as for non cash 450

688
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:25,500
Don't worry about that one. That one's nothing. We didn't buy anything. Okay, wait check read it

689
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,900
You went to NNL 99 cents town

690
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,540
That's we went on vacation. Yeah

691
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,460
We go to different set here.

692
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,500
We stopped at 99 cent town.

693
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,300
You caught a one-way ticket to 99 cent town?

694
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,580
Here's another city we went to.

695
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,580
Guess how much it cost.

696
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,380
Is that where you-- how much?

697
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:42,880
$100.

698
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,380
$2.

699
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,660
[LAUGHTER]

700
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:45,980
$2 between the three of us.

701
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,480
Wow.

702
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,380
And then we made a stop over at Dollar City.

703
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:53,660
[LAUGHTER]

704
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,900
Same night?

705
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,780
Same night, baby.

706
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,220
This must have been the cocaine and hookers.

707
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,820
Yeah, we did all of that.

708
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,340
You went to 99 cent town and got a couple hookers.

709
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,700
Yeah, couple more dollar city and press the look on the button couple 99 cent

710
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,300
Dollar City a little more upscale than 99 cent town. Yeah

711
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:19,060
What did we buy at Dollar City um perfume wonder who that was

712
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:23,540
Guilty I love fragrance

713
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:30,420
Anything else interesting on that one that's seriously messed up that he likes girls

714
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,600
Fragrance as a man. No, it's male fragrances. It's like girls toys

715
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,540
Oh, we have that over there

716
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,380
Like I would like to see that okay you want to talk about you think that we waste money

717
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,580
Do you and I really think we waste money also?

718
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:51,340
I want to get it on camera too because we can write this off tell me how this it was a waste of money

719
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,500
This is not a waste DIY dollhouse, and it's covered in water

720
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,380
Yeah, a DIY. Why is it so wet?

721
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:04,080
Wait, how does it don't might be the flooding that's happening right now? How does a dollhouse get a DIY they can't drive drunk?

722
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,400
They can drive drunk these ones

723
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,340
Level right now I feel

724
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,400
It's three milligram nicotine zins

725
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,220
Which is the perfect amount? Okay? Well

726
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:26,060
Here we need let's we'll get into the list we do have a list today

727
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:31,940
Yeah, yeah, Tommy's gonna keep working on our taxes, and you know Tommy you can hang around you're welcome to join in clinic

728
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:34,580
clinic toys police play set

729
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,320
Sounds like some sort of sex some sort of sex thing to me

730
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,700
Police playset now walk now walk me

731
00:28:53,700 --> 00:29:06,260
Here's what I did the police playset I gave that to Patrick for Chris that was given to me on the Christmas episode

732
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,220
Yeah, there's a great write-off this first one here. You think we can write this off

733
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,020
extra sugar-free

734
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:22,620
You had to get like the extra strength, sugar free extra strength.

735
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:28,980
I think we can write this off because this is, this is, we can use this for your

736
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,380
jokes. You guys use this for your little skits on stage or something.

737
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,900
Well now, oh, this is how we're making, this is how all of this ends up being, uh,

738
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,620
write off.

739
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,500
This is how you use it all and now you have visual proof that we have made,

740
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,940
we have made comedy out of these purchases.

741
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,060
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Like this one here,

742
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,500
$15 for a Santa suit.

743
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,700
(laughing)

744
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,740
- All right, this one I don't even know if I can say

745
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,540
'cause it sounds kind of like a slur.

746
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,860
Someone bought for $10 a Malika blackout curtain.

747
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,900
(laughing)

748
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,220
Will you mind tell me what the hell

749
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,140
is a Malika blackout curtain?

750
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:05,180
- No idea.

751
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,820
It's as black as Malika is.

752
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,860
(laughing)

753
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,020
I guess a person.

754
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,700
You bought a bunch of cheese.

755
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,780
(laughing)

756
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,740
- This is a stop and shut for a second, please.

757
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,620
- I know I shouldn't be asking these dumb questions

758
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,580
because I am, you know, your--

759
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,940
- That was on Thanksgiving.

760
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:26,260
- I am your auditor, I'm your IRS agent,

761
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,780
I work for you guys, directly under you guys,

762
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,140
sometimes on top.

763
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:35,060
And do you guys have a shared company credit card?

764
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,020
- Yeah, we do actually, yeah.

765
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
- That's good, that's great.

766
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,580
- McCormick Food Coloring, I wonder what that was for.

767
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,640
- Why do you ask?

768
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,580
- Well, it's just a good way,

769
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,460
it's just good that you guys have a shared credit card,

770
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:48,980
just makes things easier instead of like you guys purchasing on separate credit

771
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:53,060
cards and then taking all the receipts if we can just allocate the funds through

772
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:58,220
the LLC. Oh okay, then it's not then also we don't know who or who bought what.

773
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:05,340
Yeah. It's kind of like oh yeah. Alright well we'll pull up the list in the

774
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:10,700
meantime while he keeps looking at the receipts. So this is a website, a blog

775
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:16,700
spot that I found called the internet is in America. Okay. And it's a blogger by

776
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,980
who goes by the name Jimbo X which I thought was a pretty neat. I look the way

777
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,300
I found this was I was just googling Bloods and Crips blog spot. Wait sorry

778
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:34,460
what's this receipt that you just found for? For $16 someone on the company card

779
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:54,060
bought a Yemeni kebab meal. Also it says the cashier's name. Cashier's name, Jay.

780
00:31:54,060 --> 00:32:00,540
That's a company lunch. If we get really audited, is that the kind of question the IRS will ask us?

781
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,540
Two extra harissas?

782
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
Yeah, I mean we went on a great day.

783
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,540
Girl, you're going to be farting with all that sauce.

784
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Girl, you're going to be tooting so much I'm going to say, "Was Patrick here?"

785
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,540
Yeah, I think Patrick probably ate it.

786
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
Stinky, man.

787
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,540
You stink.

788
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,540
This guy's name is Jimbo X.

789
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,540
For real.

790
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
Kind of a cool Malcolm X style thing.

791
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,540
"Greetings, interweb travelers.

792
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,540
My name is Jimbo X, an unusual surname I know.

793
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:31,700
it's Greenlandic and I'm your kindly proprietor of I-I-I-A. You're probably wondering what

794
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,620
the intent of this site is, so that makes two of us. I suppose it's an info dump for all

795
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:40,020
the stuff that I find fascinating/irksome about American culture and society." So this

796
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,820
guy's kind of a cultural commentator. I'm a Michael Malish type.

797
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,120
Yeah, yeah, Bill Maher.

798
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:49,600
So you'll find a nice jumble of high culture snobbery and low culture sleaze here. It's

799
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:53,540
also a place for me to rant, rave, and ramble about all sorts of things that matter and don't

800
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,160
matter so prepare yourself for some heavy-handed bloviating about politics

801
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:02,280
and consumption. Bloviating? Well I heard that Sleaze is back too so this is

802
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,200
this is timely. So Jimbo X is right on it. Yeah. Wow. That and lots of stuff about

803
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:10,220
video games and junk food the things that matter the most obviously. Here's

804
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,880
some examples of some of his articles that he's written over the

805
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:22,040
years. There's "Why won't black women date white guys?" he wrote in 2017. You gotta go

806
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:26,760
the league. Well I bet they're all over you right?

807
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:35,720
Ten homicidal homosexuals. Wow. And what's this one? How do guys really feel about

808
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:42,440
fat girls? So that's a kind of like, like I said, cultural, no chomsky type. So this one I

809
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,040
think, I think I forgot to take a picture. Oh here's some other things that he wrote.

810
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:51,400
10 things that are probably worse than being raped. Oh my god. And then...

811
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:57,240
Jimbo's America. And also he has a brief rundown. Yeah. I'm not gonna really get

812
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:05,800
into detail with this top 10. I'm giving you a brief rundown. As soon as I tell you what it is,

813
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:11,540
you're gonna be like, "Oh yeah, yeah." Yeah, and also I don't want to waste your time with the

814
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,380
nitty gritty details.

815
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,720
I didn't take any screenshots of the actual article,

816
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:16,560
but I did look at it.

817
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,100
And it was all just like very specific scenarios,

818
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,100
like having acid thrown in your face

819
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,900
and your entire face melting off.

820
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,160
(laughing)

821
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,000
So he--

822
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,220
This guy's in the trenches.

823
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,060
He is in the trenches.

824
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,660
So this one is--

825
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
What is that thing on the right there?

826
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,900
I don't remember what that's from.

827
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,180
Is that a snowman?

828
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:36,900
It's some fucked up thing that he made.

829
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,180
Will you click on the thing, Jibriyo?

830
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,020
There we go.

831
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,740
41 Things I Hate About Modern Society.

832
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:44,820
that was another one that I found. He does a lot of original art for these.

833
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,780
That is a cool piece of original art.

834
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:52,340
Yeah, go back to that art. Let me see. Pull that up on the screen real quick.

835
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,780
That is beautiful art.

836
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,780
That looks amazing.

837
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,980
That looks really, really cool. But this one today is, I think, 10 signs that a woman is

838
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,780
a sociopath, is what it is.

839
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Whoa.

840
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
Yeah, which is pretty cool.

841
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,780
Okay.

842
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:09,740
Is my clicker working? There it is.

843
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,740
- You bought screw eyes.

844
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,580
- Screw eyes?

845
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:14,300
- You bought screw eyes for three,

846
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,420
you bought screw eyes five piece.

847
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,580
- I'm not, let me see.

848
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,420
- Take a look at this.

849
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,100
You bought a five piece screw eyes for $3.24.

850
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,940
- What?

851
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,740
- What kind of McDonald's order is that?

852
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:29,940
- I'm thinking like, oh, like he's giving me screw,

853
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,220
oh yeah, screw eyes, like the things that you put,

854
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,360
yeah, this is, I think this is the,

855
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,640
Safari you put in the wall. Oh, I yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I bought the screw eyes. Okay

856
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:50,240
Don't worry about the screw. So you needed this to build the studio. I'm assuming. Yeah, we were this is for sure a business expense

857
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,600
Yeah, yeah, we got I thought it was like little wobbly eyes. You guys are ones that come out of the glass

858
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,020
Yeah, honestly, that might be them, you know

859
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,400
Like when you see a pretty girl or a hot guy and you go buying the one

860
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,000
I don't think that's the noise

861
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,800
It's not boing-a-wing-a-wow-wow.

862
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,640
- Boing-a-wow!

863
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,960
- I think it's boing-oing-oing-oing,

864
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,680
not boing-a-wow-wow-wow.

865
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,160
- No, it's boom-a-shake-a-leg-a-wow.

866
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,080
- No, that's not, no, you're doing scrap.

867
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,640
So according to modern research,

868
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,000
a fairer sex is about 40% more likely

869
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,280
to report mental illnesses than men.

870
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,360
In fact, women are actually twice as likely as men

871
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,600
to be diagnosed with severe depression.

872
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,800
And while a nearly equivalent number of men and women

873
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,960
experience bipolar disorder,

874
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,300
studies suggest that the severity of psychotic episodes

875
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,700
is much more violent with women than men.

876
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,580
Yeah, no surprises here, if you ask me.

877
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,180
Trust me, I do their taxes.

878
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,820
Yeah.

879
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,020
You do women's taxes too?

880
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:43,860
All of them.

881
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,680
What happened?

882
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,580
Every woman or?

883
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,420
Now I--

884
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,240
Every good one.

885
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,080
Oh, okay.

886
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,100
And that's how many?

887
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:50,940
About three.

888
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,180
(laughing)

889
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,160
Can you go to the next slide?

890
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,180
This is not working.

891
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,360
This is just all a bunch of, yeah,

892
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,420
just jump all around willy nilly.

893
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,820
Over the years, I've probably had maybe

894
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,380
a dozen somewhat close relations with females,

895
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,500
meaning at some point our tongues touch.

896
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,700
- Only a dozen? - Oh Jimbo X, you dog.

897
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,540
- Only a dozen tongue touches? - You fucking dog.

898
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,620
- Their tongues touched without hyperbole, oh nevermind.

899
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:17,820
- Now get this though, he's got some shit to say

900
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,220
about these bitches.

901
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,200
I can safely say that half of them

902
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,580
either had an already diagnosed mental health disorder

903
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:27,820
or a clearly undiagnosed one, if not a confluence of them.

904
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,700
The range I've worked with is pretty vast,

905
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,820
running the gamut from girls with milder issues,

906
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,340
depression, mild anxiety, to much more serious conditions,

907
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:40,380
anorexia, nice by the way, Jimbo, bipolar disorder to oh shit, what the fuck was I thinking, schizophrenia

908
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:45,260
and opiate addiction, if you can believe it. I cannot believe this guy was involved with

909
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:51,980
anyone addicted to opioids. I can't believe that JimboX may be not a great judge of character.

910
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:56,300
We have this saying at the IRS, "Bitches be crazy." Damn, because that's like on the,

911
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:00,560
like it's next to the stuff on the wall. Yeah, sometimes me and the guys at the IRS, we go

912
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,300
out and have some beers after work and we say that sort of stuff at the bar.

913
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:11,440
Yeah how loudly do you say it? Very quietly. Very quiet. I do not want my boss

914
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,440
to hear that. She is a woman. Yeah. You guys you say it so quiet you can't

915
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,320
even hear each other. We whisper. You're saying it like...

916
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,680
(laughing)

917
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,080
And I go, don't tell anybody I studied that.

918
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,920
(laughing)

919
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,280
- Penis. - I'm the fault guy.

920
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,960
(laughing)

921
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,800
- To the bartender.

922
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,080
- Do you guys ever play the penis game at the IRS?

923
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,040
When you're at the IRS, do you ever play the penis game?

924
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,360
- Mm-hmm. - Damn.

925
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,800
- We used to do it a lot.

926
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,200
- What happened?

927
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,600
- It was too funny.

928
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,240
(laughing)

929
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,760
- As a guy who has stared down his own demons in the past,

930
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,200
and I'll come back to that in a second,

931
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,080
I don't want to shame anybody for their plights.

932
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,280
That said, at the same time, I think it's only fair that guys out there at least know some

933
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,560
of the less obvious symptoms that a girl may or may not have a few proverbial screws loose.

934
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,640
Below I have listed 10 telltale yet subtle indicators that a girl has severe identity

935
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,000
conflict problems, shopping compulsions, extreme lethargy, paranoid tendencies, delusions of

936
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,800
grandeur, and if absolutely nothing else, an utterly bland, if not unbearably shitty personality.

937
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,080
So he says here he's stared down his own demons in the past, and then so that link goes to

938
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:25,080
click the next slide please. This is his demon. An addiction to writing. Why do I

939
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:31,440
write? Because I'm literally addicted to it. That's why. Guilty as charged. I have the

940
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,160
same about taxes. Doing taxes addiction? Yeah. If you go through this guy's

941
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:43,120
website, he posts about 50 blogs that are all four or five thousand words a month.

942
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,280
Yeah. He really does have an addiction. He's still going through? Like he's still using Blogspot and

943
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,040
everything? I think he must have died in 2018 or something. Oh yeah. First COVID victim.

944
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,920
Sign number one, her Facebook pro- oh no, sorry, he's just in 2018 he stopped doing his

945
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,640
SJW fails of the week that he was doing for a while. So I think something happened to

946
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,200
him. Taken out by the woke mafia. It has to be a wokey that shot him in the head. Sign

947
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,800
number one, her Facebook profile is anything other than a photo of herself. While Facebook

948
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,480
in and of itself, nothing more than a maddening spiral

949
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,720
of vanity and desperate attention seeking.

950
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:20,360
Holy shit, this guy's smart.

951
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,900
You should probably take it as a major red flag

952
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,360
if your potential romantic partner features anything

953
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,020
other than a mug shot of herself as her profile photograph.

954
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,280
This guy's such a genius, he says photograph

955
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,120
for profile picture.

956
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,160
- Might be a word count thing.

957
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,960
- If I was hanging out with this guy

958
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,760
and he was saying something like that to me at the bar,

959
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,240
I'd go, write that down.

960
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,480
(laughing)

961
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,480
You need to start a blog.

962
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,480
Yeah, someone fucked up really bad.

963
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,480
Write that down.

964
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,480
I told this guy to start a blog.

965
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,480
Oh, this is a long one.

966
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,480
A good rule of thumb here is that the less of her face you actually see, the bat-shit crazier she likely is.

967
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,480
Sorry, do you have a receipt?

968
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,480
So this one makes sense because it was on October 31st.

969
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,480
I know what this one's gonna be. Read it down the line.

970
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,480
Read all of it.

971
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:14,720
organic broth chicken one Hershey's kiss one Reese's peanut butter cup another

972
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,040
piece of Reese's peanut butter cup another Reese's peanut butter cup three

973
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,600
Hershey's mini subs one Werther's bar one Hershey's kiss another Werther's bar

974
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:30,120
two more Hershey's kiss three chew it says chew FRT

975
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,120
Chewy fruits?

976
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,120
Chewy fruits?

977
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,120
Yeah Patrick, sounds like Patrick

978
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:40,120
Sounds like someone got some candy for Patrick's party

979
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,120
Yeah

980
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,120
What's a SB straight light?

981
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Starburst?

982
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,120
Starburst

983
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Starburst light

984
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,120
Starburst starlight

985
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,120
It's not a straight light, like lights

986
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,120
It's not a light, no

987
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:20,240
for

988
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:31,700
to write off you're actually gonna want to save these yeah I know $147 you

989
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:41,340
dropped you dropped a buck 47 86 cents at stop and shop okay it was for the

990
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,460
Halloween live show and we were

991
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:50,980
Well it doesn't matter if you're using it for the show we can write that off.

992
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,980
Okay.

993
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:54,420
If it isn't involved in the show in any way.

994
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:00,780
I will say there is one thing in here that I know for a fact.

995
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:04,260
Okay we gave that cake out.

996
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,060
The chips on this.

997
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,180
You just ate those?

998
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,180
We kept them.

999
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,500
We just kept them backstage.

1000
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,660
I'm so glad it says October 31st because I saw the receipt and I went if this is any

1001
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:19,660
Any other day besides Halloween?

1002
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,660
Yeah, we got a couple of fat sows on our hands.

1003
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:25,660
$150 on tickets.

1004
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:26,660
I was like, "Who?"

1005
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,660
Like August.

1006
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
Like, "Who snapped?"

1007
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,660
Like, "Who just snapped?"

1008
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,660
"Ahh!"

1009
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:34,660
I mean, I'm so upset.

1010
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,660
I'm just putting a receipt.

1011
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,660
It's so long.

1012
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:51,660
also on the same day you bought a black devil horns 3d beer pint I mean we live

1013
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:56,780
in the third dimension yes it's all gonna be 3d it's like are you gonna put 3d on

1014
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:03,300
everything oh 3d is implied yeah yeah given given the dimension we can dispute

1015
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,900
this probably we can we can dispute this they put 3d it's like yeah oh you're

1016
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,420
You're just I'm disputing the fuck out of this that cost you 30 bucks

1017
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:19,860
$29.99 that's Brooklyn beer prices. Yeah, you go to Wisconsin get a 3d beer pint costume $2

1018
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:30,420
So yeah

1019
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:36,660
That it's you shouldn't have sex with her because she's crazy

1020
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:42,260
They'll pay you to wear a three-day 3d pie beer costume in Wisconsin what?

1021
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:52,060
Yeah, we should have just gone and gotten I mean how much candy of costume in Wisconsin you think

1022
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:57,660
Well, there's more fat fatties there. Yeah, so they they got a fat tax

1023
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,540
You know about the fat tax?

1024
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:04,320
Little bit more expensive not much more, but we're talking maybe

1025
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:10,060
$100 or so. Oh, okay. You know if we're spending up 150 bucks might as well spend

1026
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:15,900
Candy I think we had a pretty similar conversation when we bought all that candy

1027
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,420
Yeah, we're gonna spend one dollar

1028
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:26,540
All the money the worst part is I think we gave away every single piece that candy. Yeah. Yeah again more charity

1029
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:32,060
Yeah, we can write that off as that could be well a business expense or charity. I think that's sure

1030
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:36,340
I mean you should have seen these fucking people. Yeah, no they were shows yeah

1031
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,860
This is charity

1032
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:47,380
Want candy yeah, dude. He's dead. We should have played that right gave out the candy is that one dead no his older brothers

1033
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:49,380
Here's the thing he's dead

1034
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,540
Here's the thing about Halloween Eric Cartman died

1035
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,900
No, Kenny died. Here's the thing about Halloween Patrick. There's always gonna be another

1036
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,980
It's a good point. Well the world is that another thing you have on the wall?

1037
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:05,560
That's our saying at the IRS there will there will always be another

1038
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:16,740
So hard very quiet because that's like halfway between the tax

1039
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:24,160
Deadlines yeah, basically Halloween yeah, exactly it's very exciting. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, you guys should come one year

1040
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,300
Oh, I'm not a party the IRS. Yeah party at the IRS. Oh

1041
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:33,040
Number two away a woman is a psychopath she describes herself as quirky been there

1042
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:37,380
Thanks to the overall geekening of American pop culture don't get me started

1043
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:42,340
We're now living in a cultural milieu where traditional Victorian beauty has been

1044
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,300
All these women are not wearing corsets and shit. I'm the

1045
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:50,020
Victorian bitch you can't breathe

1046
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:56,100
Instead an entire generation of men have grown up forced to accept a dorkable as the zenith of the female form

1047
00:46:56,100 --> 00:46:59,800
complete with all its annoying and irksome fangirlish qualities and

1048
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:04,300
characteristics which in and of themselves are potential symptoms of bipolar disorder

1049
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:10,380
If a girl ever uses terms like quirky or God help you she describes herself as a manic pixie dream girl

1050
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:15,220
That's basically code word for I'm an immature irritating woman child with no redeemable

1051
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:21,420
Personality traits and some schizoid type tendencies to boot my god and on top of that. She's usually chunky and ugly as hell

1052
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:26,380
This guy's this guy's running through every mental illness

1053
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:32,340
He looked up he looked up like every the table of contents of the DSM. Yeah, I see it put all of this

1054
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:40,140
Nobody nobody has ever been like trying to make a point of like yeah and schizoid tendency

1055
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:46,400
Yeah, he's really very corny. Yeah, we do Chanel has schizoid. She does have schizoid tendencies

1056
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,320
Yeah, I don't know if you ever seen the movie. Oh bitch came up to me said yeah, I talked to the elf

1057
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,820
He's saying to me in the shower

1058
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:58,460
You're going to the hospital things in the shower. He comes in he's singing beautiful song. She says get the fuck out. That's yeah

1059
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:04,720
Yeah, that's good. So first of all hey. Here's a question. How come you're naked looking at this guy. That's sexually inappropriate. Yep

1060
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:09,320
Yeah, he's just not even here. He is human. Why you shower at your showering?

1061
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:15,080
Oh, yeah, he's not a real. He's not an elf. Oh, yeah, you're if one of my girlies told me she was dating an elf

1062
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,080
I would have been like girl

1063
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:23,560
You got a real man. That's what you would say to one of you. What do you have a lot of girlfriend your girlfriends?

1064
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,660
Yeah, I keep a group about eight women with me really hang out. Yeah, I need you three of their taxes

1065
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:35,200
Well, yeah, three of them are great. Yeah, don't tell the other don't tell the I don't even wanna

1066
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,040
They listen to your show.

1067
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:38,540
Yeah.

1068
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,040
Oh, really?

1069
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:39,540
Oh, OK.

1070
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,040
OK.

1071
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,080
Is that why they're not great?

1072
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,200
Is that what you're saying?

1073
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,200
Yeah.

1074
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,080
OK.

1075
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:47,280
Sign number three, she's into anime.

1076
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,560
It's a known fact there are only two types of people into anime.

1077
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:52,760
Really dorky, usually sociopathic men

1078
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,640
who jerk off to Sailor Moon, and really dorky, sexually

1079
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,320
frustrated women with rape fantasies

1080
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,760
who dream of being tied up and molested by a robot.

1081
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,920
I would say there's three types, because you also

1082
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:06,000
would have Japanese people.

1083
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,400
Normal, just Japanese people.

1084
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,800
Since you have to have the mentality of a 12-year-old

1085
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,260
to sit through any Japanese cartoon for more than a minute

1086
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,560
without drool running out of the side of your mouth,

1087
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,700
any girl with a profound adulation

1088
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:19,880
for the alleged art form is no doubt someone

1089
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,760
you want to steer far, far away from.

1090
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,520
Unless, of course, you fantasize about having a 300-pound woman

1091
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:27,360
in a neon pink wig blow you while pretending

1092
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,200
to be a Gundam mech or something.

1093
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,000
He knows what Gundam mechs are.

1094
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:31,500
Yeah.

1095
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,020
- He's doing, he's doing, he's doing,

1096
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,820
go play with your Pokemon creatures.

1097
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:37,220
- That's what's so annoying about this whole website

1098
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:41,360
is that he has like such specific references for everything.

1099
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,500
And then he said, like he did a review

1100
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:45,300
of the Dark Knight Rises where he was like,

1101
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,860
"On my fourth viewing, I realized it was the worst movie

1102
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,700
"I've ever seen in theater."

1103
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,540
(laughing)

1104
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,380
It's like, what are you doing?

1105
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,220
- He does the thing where you're complaining about something

1106
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:53,940
and you realize you're getting way too specific

1107
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:55,300
and then you just go, or whatever.

1108
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,140
- Yeah, yeah.

1109
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,700
- This guy is, every time I complain.

1110
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,820
This guy, he's done a deep dive on every disorder,

1111
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,300
every psychological disorder besides autism.

1112
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,140
- Yeah.

1113
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:04,980
(laughing)

1114
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,800
- He ain't never heard of it.

1115
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,640
- He ain't never heard of it.

1116
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:07,480
- He ain't never heard of that.

1117
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,600
(laughing)

1118
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,520
- Sign number four, she's into cosplaying.

1119
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:12,740
- This is like becoming very apparent

1120
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:14,860
that this is about like an ex-girlfriend.

1121
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:16,340
- Well yeah, he said that he had,

1122
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,180
okay, here's what we know about this guy.

1123
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,580
- No, it's becoming, he's got a hose.

1124
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,860
- He's fucked 12 bitches in his life.

1125
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,020
Half of them motherfucking crazy as shit.

1126
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:23,860
- Yeah.

1127
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,900
- Right, the other half we don't even know.

1128
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,740
- The other half.

1129
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:26,560
- Y'all been there.

1130
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,620
- I mean, I've probably done,

1131
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,340
I've probably texted one woman in my life

1132
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,680
and half of them are fucking crazy.

1133
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,920
- Half of her personalities.

1134
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,820
- They're fucking crazy bitches.

1135
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:37,640
Sign number four, she's into cosplaying.

1136
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,860
The fact that I even have to tell young men today

1137
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,240
that this is a warning sign shows you

1138
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,200
just how much we've decayed as a society.

1139
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,160
All caps now.

1140
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,480
She's a grown ass woman dressed up

1141
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,640
like a cartoon character in public.

1142
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,800
Yeah, I know there's some hot cosplayers out there,

1143
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,180
but let's face it, they're usually real models

1144
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:55,840
who don't give a shit about the conventions

1145
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,280
and are just there to appeal to the most

1146
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,600
mainstreamed fetish subcultures out there and even if she is hot think about this

1147
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:07,780
for a moment. Do you honestly think a girl who runs around half naked in full-body

1148
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,280
paint doesn't have some really deep-seated psychological issues she

1149
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,720
hasn't worked through yet?

1150
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,880
That's true. All those girls that run around like the blue car from Cars.

1151
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:17,880
Who is that blonde bitch?

1152
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,880
You remember her?

1153
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:21,880
Zero Suit Samus?

1154
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:23,880
From Baywatch?

1155
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:25,880
No, the blonde girl who...

1156
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,680
- No, the first hot cosplayer girl.

1157
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,880
What was her name, man?

1158
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,720
- Link.

1159
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,400
- No, bro.

1160
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,240
- Chic.

1161
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,120
- Blonde.

1162
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:36,960
- Blonde.

1163
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,840
- That's a movie.

1164
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,480
That's a hair color.

1165
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,320
Stop.

1166
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,140
- Legally.

1167
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:43,200
- No, that's another movie, man.

1168
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,040
Shut up.

1169
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:45,200
- Legally blonde too.

1170
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,160
Twice as blonde, twice as fat.

1171
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,160
- No, it's not called, no, Princess Peach is,

1172
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,640
you're just naming characters now.

1173
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,480
- Mrs. Peach.

1174
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,300
- I give up.

1175
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:53,140
- Frank Ocean.

1176
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,240
- Yes.

1177
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,080
Sign number five, she--

1178
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:00,080
- Oh, yeah, don't mean to brag. - His ass, you know his ass not reading.

1179
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:05,080
- He was buying art books. - He was reading them.

1180
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:12,080
- Oh, wait, and I remember, we were at this bookstore, you and me were looking at a Tom of Finland book that they had,

1181
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:17,080
and I was very loudly being like, "Oh, yeah, this is the kind of stuff that I like.

1182
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:21,080
The big balls and the big dicks and there's Tom of Finland."

1183
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:26,160
of stuff that I like. The big balls and the big dicks and they're so... I fucking love

1184
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,520
this. Look at this guy's cock and Frank Ocean was four feet from me looking at like some

1185
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:31,520
photography book.

1186
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,520
Frank Ocean's just like, "You know I'm bi."

1187
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,520
Yeah, true.

1188
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,600
So I like what you're saying.

1189
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,600
Let me see.

1190
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:44,000
He's like, "Oh, for real? They have big dicks and giant assholes?"

1191
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,120
I know someone who knows Frank Ocean and they say in every conversation, he goes, "You know

1192
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,120
I'm bi?"

1193
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,120
Yeah, I know.

1194
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,120
We get it.

1195
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:54,760
he's gonna finally give up on that whole thing? It's like, it's like boy, boy, bye.

1196
00:52:54,760 --> 00:53:03,960
Like, yeah, that's like, about the bye, being bye already. Yeah, boy, bye. Boy, bye.

1197
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:12,920
Alright, I got some wild receipts. Oh yeah, give me some, what do you got? Um, well this one is $92.

1198
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:18,000
Anytime it's over 50 bucks, I get really nervous. Well, I can see the logo for Spirit

1199
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,640
Halloween on the back of the paper already. Well I well this one I hope is

1200
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,680
for Halloween because it's very suspicious and I hope you guys aren't

1201
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,440
committing any crimes or doing anything because I mean half gallon of blood?

1202
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:41,480
A half gallon? That's enough that you put that in your car you can drive a

1203
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:48,920
a quarter mile on that. I don't remember if that was for Halloween honestly. No that was

1204
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:55,960
for something else. 20 bucks, blood prices are going up. Biden did. I don't think we

1205
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,360
have touched that, no wait we did use that blood. We used the blood on the first video

1206
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,640
episode. Yeah you didn't use half a gallon though. That's where we should have gotten

1207
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,960
to like a pint. Okay maybe we need to be a little more conservative. Pine of blood!

1208
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,600
Yeah that's a good note. A half gallon! You're right. You're a hundred percent right.

1209
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:25,320
Anything else? Two latex arms. Oh they're right there. You want to grab them?

1210
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:34,480
Uno. He's got one latex arm. Dos. Oh god. Yeah. For the Latina listeners, that means one and two latex arms.

1211
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,980
This was a waste of money. These we didn't need these.

1212
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,480
I think we used them one time.

1213
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:39,480
We'll use them again.

1214
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,480
We'll use them again.

1215
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:41,480
We're using them right now.

1216
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:42,480
Hey.

1217
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:43,480
Oh, wait.

1218
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,480
Pleasure to meet you.

1219
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,480
That's good.

1220
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,480
Pretty good.

1221
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:48,480
Now we've used them.

1222
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,480
Now they're used.

1223
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,480
Bone.

1224
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:54,480
Wait, I'm not done.

1225
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,480
It says bone, 17 inches.

1226
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,480
What's this? This is Cameron's cock?

1227
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,480
I heard you got a piece, brother.

1228
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,480
- Yeah, we bought a bone.

1229
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,800
- We bought a bone.

1230
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,640
- I'm sorry.

1231
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,460
- We had to get the bone.

1232
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,300
- 17 inch bone.

1233
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,600
- Bone, butcher knife,

1234
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,640
Steve, uh, McSteve mask?

1235
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,480
- Yes.

1236
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,960
- Minecraft Steve mask. - Minecraft Steve mask.

1237
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,800
- Minecraft Steve mask.

1238
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,480
(laughing)

1239
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,880
- Yeah, can I get a McSteve?

1240
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:21,960
(laughing)

1241
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,760
- Mark Tender. - What is a McSteve meal?

1242
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,280
- Can I get a McSteve, uh, heart?

1243
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,120
- We bought a heart.

1244
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,520
- $7.99, listen.

1245
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:29,400
- Pretty cheap.

1246
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,800
- It's pretty cheap for a heart, but--

1247
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:31,640
- Pretty decent deal.

1248
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,000
- That's what you get in this day and age.

1249
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Yeah, that's what hearts cost.

1250
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
You get what you pay for.

1251
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And then, um,

1252
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and then 25 cent bag.

1253
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:43,000
(laughter)

1254
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm seeing, I should have carried it out.

1255
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm seeing a reoccurring problem here.

1256
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
I definitely should be a little bit more,

1257
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
I could be a little closer to the

1258
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
vest with our money.

1259
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
You should get into totes, man.

1260
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
I mean, I'm open to, uh,

1261
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
you're totened.

1262
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
You're topened.

1263
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Open to totes.

1264
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,680
Yeah, I mean, I need to just buy...

1265
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,200
I just forget to bring them, you know?

1266
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,800
When I'm like, "Oh, I have to go to the store.

1267
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,800
Fuck, I need it."

1268
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:09,800
I'd give you an IRS tote.

1269
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:10,800
Really?

1270
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,800
Oh, yeah.

1271
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,800
That'd be kind of sick.

1272
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:13,800
Yeah.

1273
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,800
You know, it'd be great if we make something, put it in the car.

1274
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:17,800
The car, the company car.

1275
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,800
Bag of totes.

1276
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,800
You guys have a company car?

1277
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,800
Yeah, you don't want to see it.

1278
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
Yeah.

1279
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,800
The Pal-mobile?

1280
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:23,800
Replica Batmobile.

1281
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,800
It's pretty sick.

1282
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:25,800
Dark Knight Rises.

1283
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,800
Dark Knight Rises Batmobile.

1284
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,800
What's the...

1285
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
It's this big.

1286
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
What's the RPG on that?

1287
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,800
Tiny.

1288
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:36,920
The RPG yeah, the what it's rotating per gallon. Yeah, what's the what do you get on that pretty high?

1289
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:42,160
Yeah, I don't know I've never heard of RPG I mean that's a bazooka

1290
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,560
What do you get on the the VPN on that bad boy VPN vehicles per minute one?

1291
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,200
I mean I heard just well. I mean depends on how long I get well

1292
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:57,880
It's that it's a replica Batmobile from Dark Knight Rises, so it can turn into a motorcycle at any moment - so I guess -

1293
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,400
At times yeah can go up to two you're a real car guy. Yeah. Yeah, I love talking about this

1294
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:07,960
Ld2s yeah, left her dead - yep, okay

1295
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:10,960
All right. Yeah, I'll just get back to dig. Yeah

1296
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:16,440
You can skip this one. This is a this is just he hates gaming girls

1297
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:20,800
Which you know obviously so this is a good one actually sign number six

1298
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:26,460
She vapes my general rule if she's under the age of 25 and smoke cigarettes. That's fair game

1299
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,900
Her prefrontal cortex hasn't developed yet

1300
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,860
And she's probably some badass art school rebel with loose sexual moors

1301
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:39,080
To quote one of my old junior college buddies if she'll suck toxic fumes into her lugs on purpose

1302
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,140
She'll probably suck on something else, too

1303
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:46,280
I want to see him and his buddies in college like it's like a prequel TV series

1304
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:50,200
That'd be amazing if she's over the age of 25 and still puffs on the camels

1305
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:54,960
That's a sign that she's weak-willed and too fucking stupid to understand what a surgeon general's warning is

1306
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,000
Dude, these women, they don't even know what that is.

1307
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,080
They think that it's a tattoo on the person

1308
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:03,200
when they look at the picture.

1309
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:05,640
So leave it be, leave it be, leave it be.

1310
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,220
That said, no matter a girl's age,

1311
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:09,640
if she vapes, also known as e-smoking.

1312
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,440
- Oh yeah, I know it by that name.

1313
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:13,000
- Everybody knows it as e-smoking.

1314
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,200
- Yeah, I feel like people say e-smoking more than vape.

1315
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,520
- 100%.

1316
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,640
It's a 100% guarantee that she ain't worth

1317
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,080
a dime, nickel, or penny.

1318
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:21,920
I mean, shit, if she's willing to squander

1319
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,280
so much money on a robotic shot of nicotine,

1320
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,120
she'll probably spend even more money on even stupider shit

1321
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,440
like 3D printing hardware and IKEA furniture.

1322
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,280
- Yeah.

1323
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,120
- These women in there, IKEA, man.

1324
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:33,280
- Fuck IKEA furniture.

1325
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:34,360
- They walk in there, they say,

1326
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:36,920
"I want this, I want a basket, I want a fork.

1327
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:38,720
How about I fucking kick you?"

1328
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,200
- Yeah, how about the meatballs?

1329
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,040
- Yeah, exactly.

1330
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,860
- How about the food?

1331
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:43,160
- We go, we get lunch, we eat the meatballs,

1332
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:44,840
and then we go. - And we go!

1333
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,680
- And we gone.

1334
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:46,520
- Yeah.

1335
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:47,440
- And we gone.

1336
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:48,720
We ain't going to the showroom.

1337
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:49,560
- No. - Fuck all that.

1338
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,480
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

1339
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,640
- Only room I'm going to is the food court.

1340
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:53,480
- That's right.

1341
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,440
I'm getting that little green cake, right?

1342
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,100
I'm loading that thing up.

1343
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,940
Yeah.

1344
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,780
Light up meatballs.

1345
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:01,600
Light up meatballs.

1346
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,440
Light up meatballs.

1347
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,280
Light up meatballs.

1348
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,100
Light up meatballs.

1349
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:04,940
Yeah.

1350
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,360
All I eat, man, I'm on a strict diet

1351
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,480
at the IRS of green cake and meatballs.

1352
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:09,800
(laughing)

1353
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,920
You have an Ikea food court in the IRS?

1354
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,760
Oh yeah.

1355
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,560
You show up, fill up a hard hat with meatballs,

1356
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,360
and you're like, I'm out.

1357
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,500
We got it built in.

1358
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,340
That's amazing.

1359
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:19,160
That's incredible.

1360
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,000
Yeah.

1361
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,480
Anything good on that receipt?

1362
00:59:21,480 --> 00:59:25,600
- Well this one, so this is from a hardware store.

1363
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,380
You bought two hammers.

1364
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,640
(laughing)

1365
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:33,340
Hammer gray and hammer brown.

1366
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:35,760
(laughing)

1367
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,480
- Okay, let me explain.

1368
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,720
We had an idea to do a hammer fight.

1369
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,320
- Hammer gray, hammer brown.

1370
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,120
- I forgot about the hammer fight.

1371
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:43,960
Yeah, we were gonna do a hammer fight.

1372
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,240
- We were gonna do a full hammer fight

1373
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:48,560
and I was like, well, if they're the same color,

1374
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,280
then people are gonna get confused.

1375
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,120
- Yeah.

1376
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,320
You don't wanna bring a hammer gray and hammer brown

1377
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,160
to a gun fight.

1378
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,360
You don't wanna bring a brown hammer to a gray hammer fight.

1379
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,200
No.

1380
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,020
I'll tell you that much right now.

1381
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:58,860
You'll get beat.

1382
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,560
They have different stat points.

1383
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,320
Yeah, you'll get beaten with the hammer every time.

1384
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,160
10 times out of 10.

1385
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,200
So gray hammer, brown hammer,

1386
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,100
and how much did we spend on those?

1387
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:12,100
You spent, oh wow, 40 bucks.

1388
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,120
40 bucks on hammers.

1389
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,960
Two hammers?

1390
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:14,780
Two hammers.

1391
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:15,620
That's pretty good.

1392
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,800
What are they, $20 hammers?

1393
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,640
I do think of hammers as,

1394
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:18,600
I can't believe I bought a hammer,

1395
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:19,960
I feel like that's a free thing.

1396
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:20,800
Yeah.

1397
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,900
Yeah, this really is a man. This was a opening my yeah, you bought some couplings common board

1398
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:32,820
Tempered hard, but you spent 136 bucks

1399
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:35,320
in this trip

1400
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:40,440
Yeah, which is actually a lot of stuff on manager special. So he's in charge

1401
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:45,880
You're gonna want to save that one. That's gonna be a good one to write on. Okay, you're gonna want to get that money back

1402
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:48,280
We're gonna run through the last couple of these real quick

1403
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:56,020
Let's assign number seven. She's really really proud of her tattoos and or piercings. That's disgusting we can skip that one

1404
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:01,560
Sign number eight she makes references to internet memes in real-life conversations guilty. Yes

1405
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:08,120
This is a pretty good unisex you made I funny. I just my face funny account my face when I see this oh

1406
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,260
God role face

1407
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:15,680
Impressional people of the sort or something far worse than just boring and annoying oftentimes

1408
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:19,180
They're downright dangerous, and if you click on that link it shows this it's

1409
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:21,980
It's a, well it's not an actual link you fucking moron.

1410
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,340
(laughing)

1411
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:25,480
It's the next slide.

1412
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:29,580
It's a girl's charging Slenderman's

1413
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,380
stabbing her fitness center.

1414
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,980
And I think they were like 13.

1415
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:33,820
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1416
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:35,760
- So you're saying don't go near these girls

1417
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,340
because they're crazy.

1418
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:39,260
- They are, those are, they're really crazy.

1419
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:40,540
- Yeah, they have to be.

1420
01:01:40,540 --> 01:01:42,220
And then these next two,

1421
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,740
'cause I wanna hear more about these taxes.

1422
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,380
She says she's artistic but she can't paint,

1423
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,820
sculpt or draw worth shit.

1424
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:50,320
I know hella bitches like that.

1425
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,160
- Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

1426
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,460
- And then this last one is,

1427
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:55,300
she does that winged thing with her eyeliner.

1428
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:56,280
- Bro.

1429
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,120
- What the fuck is that?

1430
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,260
- What is it?

1431
01:01:58,260 --> 01:01:59,100
What is it?

1432
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,060
- Are you a bird?

1433
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:01,900
- No!

1434
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,060
- Are you a mime?

1435
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,580
- Are you a asshole?

1436
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:06,420
- Yes!

1437
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,300
- With a fuckin' ass pube hangin' out?

1438
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:09,660
- And girls who have that,

1439
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,100
they always do the thing with guys

1440
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:14,020
with handlebar mustaches.

1441
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:14,860
They always go.

1442
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,700
- They do what thing?

1443
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:16,520
- Mm-hmm.

1444
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:17,940
- They curl the end of their eyes?

1445
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,200
(laughing)

1446
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,720
- They're always doing that, man.

1447
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:24,560
- We know different bitches.

1448
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:25,400
- Yeah, we do a different type of women.

1449
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,220
- I'll say that right now.

1450
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,420
We hang out with a different type of bitch.

1451
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,280
- They're always doing the handlebar mustache thing.

1452
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:30,120
- With their eyes.

1453
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:31,480
- With their eyes.

1454
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,320
They're going, "I'm not gonna hurt you."

1455
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,160
- That'd be like, that would hurt.

1456
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:35,260
(laughing)

1457
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,100
That would hurt me badly.

1458
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:37,040
- Like, shut up already.

1459
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,220
- Yeah, I did, I, yeah.

1460
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:39,060
- I'm trying to drink.

1461
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:41,320
(laughing)

1462
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:45,560
- And then, show, this last slide is just one other thing

1463
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:48,680
that he wrote on here, which is, "Let's face it,

1464
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:49,720
"Kirk Cobain sucks."

1465
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,040
(laughing)

1466
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,440
And this is a drawing that he made of Kirk Cobain

1467
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,640
blowing his head off with what looks like a sniper rifle.

1468
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,800
- Yeah, yeah, that's, oh my God.

1469
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,480
- That's a FAMAS from Counter-Strike.

1470
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:02,320
- Yeah.

1471
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:03,160
(laughing)

1472
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:04,000
- Holy shit.

1473
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,440
- Yeah, that's a fit, you get the three-bullet burst.

1474
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:07,280
- Yeah.

1475
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,080
- Yeah, he right-clicked to get the burst.

1476
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,600
- Dude, he did, he was,

1477
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:11,960
dude, Kirk Cobain trying to shoot himself

1478
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,120
with a Counter-Strike P90

1479
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,360
and just shooting above himself on the wall every time.

1480
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,360
I have to control the recoil padder.

1481
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:19,360
I have to pull down into the left.

1482
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,360
So yeah, that's it from Jimbo X.

1483
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,360
So listen, Tommy.

1484
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,360
What's the damage?

1485
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,360
You've gone through everything.

1486
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,360
How much do we owe?

1487
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:35,360
How's it looking?

1488
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,360
Stop blowing the receipts away.

1489
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,360
Don't try and blow them up either.

1490
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:41,360
Don't spit on Cameron.

1491
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,360
We already said don't spit on him.

1492
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:46,120
- I'm keeping spit on, that's not for me.

1493
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:47,680
- It's not looking good.

1494
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,520
I was hoping you'd say the opposite.

1495
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,760
- Are you gonna crunch the numbers in the calculator there?

1496
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,120
- Hold on, give me a second.

1497
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:59,640
Can we, in post, add in some...

1498
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,600
- No, I think you sound good doing that.

1499
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:05,900
- Wait, hold on, let me crunch these numbers.

1500
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:08,100
- Yeah.

1501
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:13,980
- No, no, no, no, no, no. - Air, air.

1502
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,080
- No!

1503
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,680
- Abort, abort. - Don't abort!

1504
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:19,280
- Abortion, abortion. - Don't do an abortion.

1505
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,240
- Don't mention that, that's too contentious.

1506
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,160
- Abortion, abortion is good.

1507
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,520
- No, whoa, what kind of calculator did you buy?

1508
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,360
- Pro choice.

1509
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:28,720
- Whoa, this is a fucking New York instruments.

1510
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,980
(laughing)

1511
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:36,560
- The old California instruments calculator.

1512
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:37,920
- Talk about a scientific calculator,

1513
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,840
son of a damn Christian calculator.

1514
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:41,840
Abortion is good if that's what you want.

1515
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:43,840
I don't know.

1516
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,840
I actually don't know.

1517
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,840
I actually didn't vote.

1518
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:49,840
That's an odd calculator.

1519
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:51,840
Let me show you.

1520
01:04:51,840 --> 01:05:01,840
It's a calculator.

1521
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:07,840
You guys know about two puppy biscuits?

1522
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:08,840
puppy biscuits.

1523
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,720
I'm just joking. It's

1524
01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:15,280
twelve bucks.

1525
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:17,000
Oh, are you fucking serious?

1526
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,480
Yeah. It's all you owe about twelve

1527
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:18,820
bucks.

1528
01:05:18,820 --> 01:05:19,820
That's not bad at all.

1529
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:20,960
I think I have twelve bucks.

1530
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:21,460
You have twelve bucks?

1531
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:22,920
Yeah, I can take that and then.

1532
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,600
You just like put it in the.

1533
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,400

01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,080

I can't get it, I can't reach.

1566
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,200
Can you try reaching into my pocket?

1567
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,840
- Yeah, let me see.

1568
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:28,680

Oh, I'm just kidding, man.

1570
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,840
(laughing)

1571
01:06:30,840 --> 01:06:31,680
Is there anything in there?

1572
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:32,500
- You're gonna pull up a nub, man.

1573
01:06:32,500 --> 01:06:33,340
- I don't think there's anything in there.

1574
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:34,180
- Do you feel that in there?

1575
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:35,080
- I don't know, I still kinda feel it, yeah, I don't know.

1576
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:36,320
What pocket is that?

1577
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,640
I'm not sure.

1578
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,760
What the hell is going on?

1579
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,920
I put change in there, man.

01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,560
I swear to God.

Yeah.

01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:52,800
Thanks for coming.

1587
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,760
You can say that again.

Thank you for having me.
