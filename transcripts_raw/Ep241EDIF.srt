1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,320
- Thank you Patrick for going down on your chair

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,160
so that it makes it look--

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,400
- I moved down so that Caleb does not look small.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,200
- I look really, really, really small in these chairs.

6
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,160
- Yeah.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,040
- But--

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,080
- I look tall in mine. - It's not true.

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,360
I'm actually pretty large.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:26,240
- This cable thing is gonna be claustrophobic.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,280
- Joining us this week is Cameron Fetter.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:33,600
I'm treating you like a guest because you've been gone so fucking long.

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,720
I honestly don't even know who you are anymore.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,240
I have a hard time relating to you.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
I forgot what your Facebook's like.

16
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
Can I ask you a question?

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,840
So yeah, I didn't watch whatever episode you guys did.

18
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,840
I don't know who you guys are.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
It was with Eric Grayhill.

20
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
You knew that actually.

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,040
Speaking of, right now you're also doing it.

22
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,880
You have a problem with staying in the frame.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,440
You are addicted to getting out of that damn frame.

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,800
Just let, what is your question?

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,720
Did you guys already cover the coronation?

26
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,420
Yeah, no, no, you know why because I have something to say I wanted to say let's

27
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,920
all right real quick way. Hold on real quick. Tokyo shit. Okay. So basically

28
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,420
here's something that I wanted to say that I was hoping you guys didn't

29
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,420
already say. So I'm glad I got the chance to say it.

30
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,920
So yeah, the the coronation right. So

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,020
the UK

32
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:27,220
they these these guys are all ruled over by some crazy weird old white guy who

33
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,780
is completely evil in the government. Yeah, we hate the UK. Good thing America

34
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,940
is not like that, right? Wait.

35
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,460
That's what I wanted to say. Oh, wow.

36
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,940
That's pretty good. Yeah. I would have said...

37
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,580
Yeah, it's probably not for that. The audience doesn't wanna join in. I would

38
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,200
have said differently. I would have said, "So they're having a coronation over

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,780
there in the UK, meanwhile in the United States, we're having a corn nation."

40
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:02,140
Yeah, because that's a huge yeah. It's one of the biggest all the food we eat is

41
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,440
just corn syrup and I also probably would have said

42
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,340
Queen

43
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,840
didn't the lead singer that band get fucking AIDS and die decades ago. Why do

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,540
we give a shit about this about her dying now? So I want to piggyback off of

45
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,940
the corn nation thing. Yeah, I'd say they're having a coronation in the UK in

46
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,580
the states were having a corn nation corn kid fevered sweep in the country.

47
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,820
Everyone loves this crazy cone nation. Everyone loves the cone kid. What the

48
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,020
fuck is it? They're having a cone nation over in the United Kingdom? Yeah. Yeah.

49
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,780
And over here we have an ice cream cone nation. Yep. Fat people. There's giant fats

50
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:49,740
everywhere. Yeah. And then you can also do... And a corony, a coronary nation.

51
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,580
coronary ation coronary

52
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,180
coronary ation. Yes, everyone's eating the bacon explosion. Uh-huh. That's good.

53
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,300
Everyone's eating the bacon. Bacon explosion. It's a video on YouTube. You

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:05,060
can look it up. Talking to you about it earlier. I didn't listen to you. You

55
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,100
know why? Because you've been in a lying mood all morning. I've not been in a

56
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,420
line. I shit you not. Patrick has been lying to me about every little fucking

57
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,180
ticky tack thing here and there for no reason. I told Caleb that I was going to

58
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,140
I'm going to go feed my cat. No, no, no before this, no, no, no, no, no, you

59
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:24,040
hit you did two big lies. One was you said I have to go and I said where are

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,980
you going and you thought for a second you said

61
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,740
the pet store yeah, I was skeptical, but then you left and I came back as a

62
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,720
pet store. He's far away. It's thirty seconds later and I said where'd you go

63
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,180
and you said

64
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:41,060
it was too far away. It's too far away. So what are you talking? What first of

65
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,860
all, I thought okay, okay, the one that I bore witness to I want to I want to

66
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,780
all the evidence out before you can try and fight back here. The other thing

67
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,320
that when I the one I was here for was you said yeah, I have to go home to

68
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
feed my cat or something

69
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,940
like to feed my cat or something. I really just know you just had to get

70
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,440
out. I had to feed I to go home. I know what it was actually a pill. It was or

71
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,500
whatever I have to take. I did take a pill and I had to shove it down most

72
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,420
wrote. I know what no, I know the truth. He got neutered yesterday. I know the

73
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,220
truth. You

74
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,220
were in love with the Fios lady. She was in love with not want to be in

75
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:25,200
the same room as her because you thought that you were gonna act up. Sparks

76
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,500
were gonna fly. Sparks were already flying. Sparks were flying crazy. Hey

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,060
Patrick.

78
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,540
She said Patrick. Hey Patrick. She might listen to this. Yeah, he told her

79
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,700
all of it. He apparently told her, he said, "Yeah, I told her how much

80
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,420
money we make."

81
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,180
I didn't tell her how much money we made. I told her, I told her, she was asking

82
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,420
about, she was asking,

83
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:53,340
she was asking, she was like, how much, she thought that we bought this place,

84
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,860
and she was like, how much did you spend on this? And I told her, I was like,

85
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,180
"Oh, I don't know." I was like, "Whatever." I told her the price, and then

86
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,140
she was like, "Oh." And I was like, "Yeah, we get money through Patreon."

87
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,300
And then you pulled up the Patreon and you said... Yeah, and then I pulled it

88
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,580
up on my phone and I said, "Look at that." "And if we get to $20,000,

89
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,580
- Or make a movie. - Yeah.

90
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,460
- Yeah. - You should have taken her phone

91
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,300
and signed her the fuck up. - Yeah.

92
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,380
- Yeah, should have. - Yeah, would have been a good idea.

93
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,780
- I kept forgetting to ask her,

94
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,260
and I think that I told you guys to ask,

95
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,300
but you guys might not have, but there is a deal, right?

96
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:27,540
Okay, Patrick's Deals Corner, okay?

97
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,580
If you are a listener-- - If this is the only time

98
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,740
you ever do this, I want you to know

99
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,140
I'm gonna be fucking pissed off.

100
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,140
If this is the, if you-- - The only time?

101
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,380
- If you do like a-- - The Deals Corner?

102
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:39,500
- Yeah, a one-time, like that is the most lazy podcast bit

103
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,300
you can do. A deals corner? This is from now on, once a month you have to do this.

104
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,300
I told everyone about a deal last two episodes ago, or this episode. Oh,

105
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,700
really? Did you tell them in your corner? Well, now I have the... Can we get a

106
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:58,100
graphic going? Can we get a new graphic for Patrick's deals corner?

107
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,980
If you are a small business owner in the state of New York,

108
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,780
this month until June 30th, I think, or maybe the end of this month.

109
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,780
This is the... You can get... It's taking so long.

110
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:21,900
A $300 Visa prepaid gift card when you sign up for Verizon Business Fios.

111
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:26,620
You might be the worst speaker of all time. Yeah. That just took like a

112
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,380
full minute to say, "You can get a $300 prepaid gift card if you get

113
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,540
Fios." If you get Fios for business. For business. So you have to start a

114
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,340
business if you don't have one, if you want to take advantage of this deal.

115
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:43,540
I think most deals should be for businesses. Start a small, start an LLC, get a business,

116
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:49,540
get like an office, rent an office, then sign up for Verizon. Go into tens of

117
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,940
thousand dollars of debt. You need to be buying equipment. You need to go ahead,

118
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,340
even if nobody's interested in what you're making, make merchandise, make

119
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:01,840
hats, do all over print shirts that have your face on it. All over shirts that say

120
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,400
market that say fuck no, they don't say no. That's so no for the business that

121
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,100
you're making yeah and the business is called make a bit make and then make a

122
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,920
business called fuck shit poopy. I'm allowed to call it that you can't call

123
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,680
it that why you can't I don't think you can do profanity. Yeah, you definitely

124
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,440
registering for a I think you can do profanity if you if you city not a real

125
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,160
state correctly.

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,520
You censor it correctly you could do that. That's not our CK then that could

127
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:33,740
anything. F star C, K, productions. You do not think that you can legally put a star

128
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:42,740
on anything. Oh my God, he actually made a graphic. This is beautiful. Now I am so prepared.

129
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:53,740
I thought it said 2025, but the TV is just very angled away from me. It says, it's great.

130
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,460
Rick's deals corner. Yeah. All right. That's that settles it. Now you have to

131
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,260
keep doing that for pretty much ever. Now I'm going to find deals. Well, you just

132
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:05,740
need a, you need homework. You really do need some. I do have homework. What's the

133
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,300
homework that you have? Well, you have to make the finished your home. I had to I

134
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:15,620
setting up the Herculean effort for me. I had to keep calling. You saw me every

135
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,580
single day. I was in there. It took actually what I saw you every single day

136
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:23,180
was you going. Oh, I have to do the files. Well, no, you didn't see me on the phone.

137
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,240
fuck yes, I did and you didn't see me on the phone saying saying I did a

138
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,800
hundred percent. So you know, you know what I kept saying. You know what I

139
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,260
kept saying to them is like this has been a total headache. You do that. You

140
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,300
did the exact thing that I do on the phone where you where you walk or you

141
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,740
just come pace around and you're just like okay, great, yeah, great, great.

142
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,740
You try to sound really upbeat and I try to get even higher energy than

143
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,860
yours on the other side of the phone and that's awesome. Okay, thank you.

144
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,380
Thank you so much. Thank you. So you have an amazing day. Yeah, I don't say

145
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:58,460
I say you have amazing. I go like this. I ask them a question and they answer the question

146
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:08,460
and then I wait for a full five seconds and then I go, okay. That's how I do it.

147
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,820
How was your vacation? Oh yeah, Cameron went on vacation.

148
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,120
It wasn't really a vacation but it was nice. Just basically was in Plastow, New Hampshire.

149
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,620
Went to the Plastow shoe barn. Plastic, New Hampshire.

150
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,740
to the fucking Plastow Savers. I know this guy knows about the Plastow Savers.

151
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,260
You can find a lot of good Savers. Last time I was there I found a Tobuscus t-shirt. I

152
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:35,820
want to blast out the Savers. I found a shirt. I didn't buy it because I didn't want it,

153
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,780
but I sent a picture of you guys. It was gamers for the troops. Oh yeah. It's a good one to

154
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,060
find. Yeah. And yeah, it was pretty interesting to see everything. This sounds like one of

155
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,060
on the worst fucking vacation I've ever heard in my life. I wasn't even going to talk about it.

156
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,060
I don't know why you asked me about it. I was just at home with my family.

157
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,060
Just make something up.

158
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:54,060
Okay, we went to the casino

159
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,060
in New Hampshire. Dude, every time I'm in

160
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,060
Boston now, I see the

161
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Encore and I want to go so bad.

162
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,060
I literally think if I still lived in like

163
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,060
Austin, I would literally be going to Encore like once a week.

164
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,060
Doing the most amazing kind

165
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,060
of gambling addiction. Can you imagine being able to take public

166
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,060
transport to a casino from where you live?

167
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,060
You have to take like a shuttle.

168
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,060
Oh, no, wait. No, because I was living in Revere at the

169
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,220
half time, but they had like a shuttle from the wonderland stop that you could

170
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,020
take all the way, which also wonderland

171
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,500
buddy, course, a wonderland wonderland is not in revere. Come on now

172
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,700
you're are you maybe you should say revere is no wonder. We're here is no

173
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,140
wonder. When you say wonderland, I don't have any is not in revere. You're

174
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,740
thinking of maybe never never land. Yeah, no, I'm thinking of wonderland.

175
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,780
what wonderland? Oh, Alice in that one. Oh yeah.

176
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:46,780
What other wonderland? I thought that wonderland was maybe, I think of

177
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,780
wonderland as a pretty generic thing of like, it's always somebody's

178
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:54,780
wonderland. So you could have Caleb's wonderland. Yeah. You could have

179
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:58,680
Santa's wonder, like, you know what I mean? Oh, Santa's a nice pole. I'm on

180
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,380
his side now because he said Santa's wonderland. Santa's wonderland, that is

181
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,580
a thing, right? That's what they call the thing at the mall. That's what they

182
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,180
call, oh no, no, no. So I think of a wonderland as kind of a generic, it's

183
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:11,300
utopia. Yeah. L Ron Hubbard's Winter Wonderland. Yes. Winter Wonderland is

184
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,420
what I'm thinking of. Yeah. So Winter Wonderland is true. That's a

185
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,620
checkmate. Santa's Wonderland is not a checkmate. Winter Wonderland.

186
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,940
Winter Wonderland.

187
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,780
Wonder Winter. But you just think it's never going to snow again. Yeah. We

188
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:31,260
didn't really get a lot of snow. We got no snow this summer. It was insane how

189
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:34,980
little snow there was and to a point where it scared me. But I guess it's

190
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,520
just in New York. Why did that scare you? Because that means there's going to be no more snow

191
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,900
forever. It confused me. Really? It snowed in New Hampshire a lot. I would go home and

192
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:51,900
there would be a lot of snow. But here in New York, good old NYC, not a lick of snow.

193
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,020
Not a droplet. There was snow one day though. But what did you guys do when I was gone?

194
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:03,860
You were like crying or? What did we do? I came up with my new rap name. White Phosphorus.

195
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,700
It's a good one. It's a really good rap name. It does kind of suck that when

196
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,660
you're me, just every rap name, you gotta have white in the name of it.

197
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,100
Yeah. Why does... Why can't I be just... You don't have to be white. Okay,

198
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,340
here's my new rap name then,

199
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,700
Amygdala.

200
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:22,220
Let's see, that's not... White Amygdala. No, just normal Amygdala. White

201
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,240
Amygdala. Just Amygdala. Or some part of the brain 'cause... Cortex. Cortex is

202
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,780
really good. Cortex is good too. White. Cortex. What about pons? White cortex.

203
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,160
Lele Pons yeah. What about occipital lobe? That would be

204
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,460
that you're getting in you're in a nerd world and I know I was kind of telling a

205
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:47,280
joke of maybe the juxtaposition of a kind of a nerdy brain part with a rap

206
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,800
and hip hop. Well, a rapper, a brain part, that's a

207
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,160
or brain part brain. This one's a little. This one's a little nerdy, but it

208
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,240
could maybe be crying trap.

209
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,980
that's a brain part corpus callosum. Damn, that's name is kind of his name is

210
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,420
pork

211
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,860
is pork is so loco

212
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,620
yeah yeah and that that would be his anagram rap. That's what I would. I

213
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,260
would have to it would have to be God. It'd be so fucking funny to be to be to

214
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:26,100
be a guy named Porkus and be like I'm going to be a rapper. What's my rap name?

215
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,900
I can't be anything about pork. I have to hide the pork is to reverse it. Yeah,

216
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,040
you can't be porky yeah, but it is such a good idea to work either rapper your

217
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,380
name or I mean that's the logic behind

218
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,060
be lack, but

219
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,800
you are luck, but you should always have

220
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,540
your rap name be an anagram of your real one hundred percent yeah tap

221
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,440
you that's every that's every every high school rapper yeah tap norad

222
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,580
that'd be kind of cool. That's no no no no no, it's like the Santa Tracker.

223
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,740
Right? Well, they do a little more than just Santa tracking. I don't think

224
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,860
your old friend.

225
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,020
I don't think so, man. I don't think they do anything.

226
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,860
The adult

227
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,100
much else, not my world

228
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,300
do that much. That's like when you're a kid and you look at a map, you're like,

229
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,620
oh my God, the North Pole

230
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:21,340
it's real.

231
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,340
but

232
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:31,500
nor is it. What else I do really good? I don't even know national.

233
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,380
I just know they do other stuff. Santa

234
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,300
national

235
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,400
I mean, it's definitely what they're most known for. I think it's some kind

236
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,220
of weather thing. Yeah, or no, they track saddle all the satellites around.

237
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,180
Oh yeah, yeah, that's what they do. National orbiting something rotation

238
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,220
radar. Yeah. Automatic device. Yeah, it's just a device.

239
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,620
What else did I do while you were gone? See, I feel like we

240
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,920
got to catch up. I honestly feel like I've been gone for a

241
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,620
hundred years. You feel like a stranger. I feel like I've been

242
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:06,520
gone for so long. I went to a restaurant on Friday.

243
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,120
That's a story. And my friend was there.

244
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,420
You are the worst. There is nobody worse at this job than

245
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,720
you, I think. What are you talking about? I went to a

246
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,900
restaurant. I guess my friend was there. Maybe this is just filling him in on my

247
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,140
weekend. Maybe this is too kind of

248
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,120
emotional. Okay, honestly, this job, I feel like any other job you go on

249
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
vacation, you think, God, I don't wanna go back to my job. Yeah, God, it's

250
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
Monday. But you are missing us so badly. Me, on Monday,

251
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,840
I don't even have to work on Monday, I'm still on vacation. I'm like,

252
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,840
please can I do some work on Monday? Yeah, please, please. Can we have a

253
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,480
meeting? I've always been like that. I've always been... You know what, I

254
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,880
I'm exactly like Carl Casper from Chef. I'm always doing my work.

255
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,880
You're exactly like Casper the friendly ghost.

256
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,880
Yeah, because you're white and your body's fucked up and weird.

257
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,380
Yeah.

258
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,380
And it ends in a weird way.

259
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,880
But my work relationship is really affecting my relationship with my son.

260
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,880
You are nothing like Chef, man.

261
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,880
I'm pretty much exactly like Carl Casper from Chef.

262
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,880
You, okay, first of all...

263
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
I have the same tattoos as him. They're all forks and knives.

264
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,880
No, you don't have any forks.

265
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,880
See, there's a knife.

266
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,460
you come in, you say snow's fucking weird and then you steal my chef

267
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,160
observation.

268
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,760
Wait, that's green screen.

269
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:29,480
My I was talking about chef two years ago and now you're saying, oh, I'm

270
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,160
the chef one. No, we have always talked about chef on this show.

271
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,880
I've still never seen chef. No, you're not the chef. We've never talked about

272
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,560
you being the chef. Caleb was the shit. The killer was a whole episode of

273
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,000
feel of being the chef. Oh, there was a whole episode about him being the chef.

274
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,140
I'm not saying that I'm the chef. I'm saying that I'm exactly like I'm saying

275
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:56,240
I'm like carl casper, not a chef. He's been trying to be a social media chef

276
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,260
lately. Yep, he has been. I have been. I could I've seen you've been working on

277
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,200
your plating. Yep, I've sent I send you my meals. Yeah, I see them. I think I

278
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,560
could never make that. Yeah, yeah. Really? Do you want to come over my

279
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,960
house for dinner sometime. No, do not let him over. He's going to make you the

280
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,060
biggest bullshit out of this. No, out of this. Here's what you're going to do.

281
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,780
You're going to go over. You're going to be like, oh, this is actually

282
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,800
surprisingly good. You're going to go and then he's going to be my airfare

283
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,440
goes up to four fifty. Do you want to watch? Do you want to watch Rick and

284
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,160
Morty clips and you'll go and you'll sit down YouTube. It'll all be just all

285
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
Jake Kinji Lopez videos that he watched. He copies all the recipes. That is not

286
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,320
chef. I'm not that is not a chef. You are doing Legos.

287
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,620
Yeah, following recipes is not what chefs do. Chefs create their own recipe.

288
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,220
I created my own recipe. Name one recipe that you've ever created. Well,

289
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,720
obviously, Patrick's delight is more of a cocktail. That is a cocktail.

290
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,420
Not more of a cocktail. That is a cocktail. I made a recipe, a custom

291
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,320
recipe this morning. What? So it was about one

292
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,980
a cup of water, okay, about one half cup of oats yeah and a

293
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,300
some and a drizzle of maple syrup, okay, sugar bits

294
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:12,960
that's oatmeal. That's my recipe came up with that is and you did not come up

295
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,120
with oatmeal. I added I came up with the maple syrup part. What color

296
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,160
you did not invent oatmeal because you put something sweet in it. It's all

297
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,780
it's that's temperature water. Did you use? I started it well. That's a good

298
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,540
so I started it with cold water and then I was able to warm the water up. Okay,

299
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,440
with along with the how do you manage to do that different? I did about one

300
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,060
minute plus one minute. What would you so to the microwave? What would you say

301
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,420
was could be texture of your creation at first at the end? Not at first? I'm not

302
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,260
I don't give a fuck about what

303
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:53,100
do this to me. What was it when you put it dry? No, and then I added the water.

304
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,780
I got a little wet when you put it in your mouth. Was it mushy?

305
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,940
Would you say it was mealy?

306
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,780
Yeah, but it was at first

307
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:08,220
what it was at first when it came out of the microwave, it was a little kind of

308
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,300
runny a little too wet, but adding the maple syrup actually was able to thicken

309
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:15,180
it up a little bit. You made oatmeal that's not a you didn't invent that you

310
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,300
I didn't look at a recipe. I just went in that I just kind of was like

311
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,500
freestyling like yeah,

312
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,240
but a half a cup of O. I'm like what the hell am I going to add this to make

313
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,920
this edible? So you went so you went through all your

314
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,140
water

315
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:34,340
and to finish just whatever was left in the where

316
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,340
it up from where the oats come from a bag or a big circle. Okay, is it a

317
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,340
what you call a can if it's like a cylinder? It's a it's not really a

318
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:48,260
can. It really is for posters the and a quick yeah, oh yeah thing yeah,

319
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,100
which was says what on it oatmeal in one minute. It's as quick and easy oatmeal.

320
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,820
It wasn't Quaker. I kind of try to get my stuff from I do more. You're stuff

321
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:02,860
like bowl and basket. What's bowl and basket? That's got to be some generic

322
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,980
brand, huh? Yeah, I don't want to make a really good.

323
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:12,020
They make good oats, a bowl and basket because I prefer it over Quaker because

324
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,260
Quaker just I don't know it's a text. You know, it's just no, it's just like

325
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,500
this money, then you're like they're using that Quakers image too much.

326
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,460
Yeah, yeah, it's also it's kind of they're exploiting him. Yeah, yeah,

327
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:28,340
they're exploiting him for profit. I think when making food, leave your ego

328
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:32,180
at the door. Right. What kind of what kind of leave your ego in the freezer,

329
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,700
though? That's right. I don't like that shit. I have a waffle maker. Do you

330
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,100
want to come over for waffle? Whoa, no, wait, I could make in the air fryer. I

331
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:43,700
can make chicken and then you could make the waffles on your wife. You can say

332
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,400
know he's out of this. He's out of we're going to start a restaurant,

333
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,640
waffles, waffles and chicken by

334
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:58,560
and he doesn't get to go. Yeah, why? Because he's been rude. You're negative.

335
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,960
Yeah, tell that to my disguise that I'd wear any restaurant. What would your

336
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,440
disguise be? Actually, don't tell me because I'll be able to tell scanning at

337
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
the door so you would not be able to wear a disguise. It would take my eyes

338
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,320
fucking replaced. I will get I would chop my hands off. He's about to cry

339
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,540
I guess, because you know what we're having to our restaurants, we're having

340
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,640
DNA scanning that scans it tells it tells the server in advance what the

341
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,740
people's allergies are. So the server doesn't have to ask your food. You

342
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,020
would probably serve DNA at your shit future restaurant. DNA is actually a

343
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,600
really good protein if it's prepared right. It's not good. It's not good to

344
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,900
eat. DNA burrito bowl. That doesn't make any sense. Yeah, dinner and

345
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,220
appetizers, that's what we have. I will go to your restaurant. I will, I will

346
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:41,660
address, you guys will think I'm a food critic and actually I will become one. I

347
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,880
will write the most scathing reviews. I will and I'll include all sorts of

348
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,760
stuff. I'll say the service is bad. I do holistic reviews. Yeah, what magazine

349
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,360
are you going to write for highlights for kids?

350
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,040
Try time out New York City. You're going to be in time out. Yeah, no, I

351
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:58,560
won't.

352
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,560
We're going to say we have a special table prepared for you and it's going to

353
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:08,920
be facing the corner of the room. Nope, I will be writing in vulture about how

354
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,840
but your restaurant sucks. These two ugly comedians did the most bullshit

355
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,460
restaurant of all time and by the way, the bathroom is stinks. The bathroom is

356
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,620
problem with the problem with you trying to do that is nowadays controversy

357
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,580
sales and honestly you're going to drive our sales through the fucking you guys

358
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,520
we're going to have one of those to no no you're not

359
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:34,300
you're not doing pink sauce. No, okay, you guys are going to have such a I will

360
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,900
curse you guys. You guys will have one of those bathrooms. That's the water.

361
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm going to reverse the curse, reverse the curse. Yeah, so the water in my

362
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,600
bathroom will smell bad. Yes, yeah, God damn it. How did you do that? I don't

363
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:45,940
know

364
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:50,440
that's so I don't know how I did it. I just well if you two are so good at

365
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,080
thinking of a restaurant to come up with

366
00:22:52,080 --> 00:23:00,400
tell me two things. Okay, number one, the theme theme is casual. Yeah, casual

367
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,000
Friday theme. Yeah. Oh, there he have and the chef don't wear outfit. There's

368
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,980
already a casual Friday. The restaurant is who you can't tell who the chef is

369
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,980
there's already TG, TG, that's thank God. It's Friday. This is still wear

370
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:17,440
clothes and this is you can show up as EDI. No every day is Friday. This good

371
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,280
day is Friday.

372
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:23,200
Every day is Friday and the chefs and get this the chefs and waiters. They sit

373
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,240
at the tables too. So you really can't tell who anyone is because there's a why

374
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:27,920
why are they?

375
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,440
That's the thing. Where do they sit now? This is a thing that we thought of and

376
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,860
something that we thought of that has never been done in a restaurant before

377
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,360
they cook the food at the table for you table, but only at some tables.

378
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,700
You're Benny Hanna is what you're thinking. No, no, you're doing Benny.

379
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,700
He works there. Who's he Benny Benny works at the yeah.

380
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,060
Okay, so that was my first question is the theme. So I guess the theme is that

381
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,900
it's always casual Friday and the waiters are are blaming it.

382
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,680
Waiters are it's indistinguishable.

383
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,880
And also they cook the food at the table.

384
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,160
Let me say that's also why we have to have the biometric thing because I know we're going

385
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,720
to run into problems where people come in and pretend to be waiters.

386
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,720
Yeah.

387
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
And I'm taking people's orders.

388
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
I'll cover that.

389
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,440
The dead giveaway is that I have no hands.

390
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,440
I'm going to hold the fucking plate.

391
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,320
Well, the first week, first week of your, like the first week that you're an employee

392
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,320
at EDIF's.

393
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
EDIF's?

394
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Yeah.

395
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,320
Every day.

396
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Oh, I thought it was EIF.

397
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,320
RFID chip right there.

398
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,820
FID chip right there and if you

399
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,660
we call it a big I F chip, it's proprietary. That's why it's so big. It

400
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,320
needs to hold a lot of data. It holds your entire. It's it holds every every

401
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,840
so it's a little stick of ram. So what's to stop me? We might

402
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:47,220
also mining cryptos and all of our employees arms. What's to stop me?

403
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,720
That's how you tell the employees that they walk around you just hear like

404
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,180
yeah loud ass. You see the probably they're they're coming to your table

405
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,660
with your water, right? That water is shaken, not stirred. They're fucking...

406
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,620
That hand is shaking.

407
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,120
Shaken water.

408
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:01,620
Yeah.

409
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,100
Shaken water. That's another one of our beverages. It's water that's shaken up.

410
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,500
It's shaken because we're mining so much crypto out of the rain chip.

411
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,060
But also it aerates the water.

412
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,900
Why did you say stirred? Like they usually stir water.

413
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,420
They make stirred water.

414
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,060
Where?

415
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,100
In all the restaurants.

416
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,660
No, most other restaurants have stirred water.

417
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,620
No, you want still water, specifically still water.

418
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,500
Stirred water.

419
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,860
So what's to stop me from... What time do you guys close?

420
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:29,860
never eleven fifty nine PM. We're open to one a. Okay, all right cool. So let's

421
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:33,660
just stop me from eleven fifty nine cruising in front of their there's no

422
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,740
cruising. Oh Benny, there's no cruising. It's not all right walking up front and

423
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:43,660
Benny's locking up right and I guess I'm not cruising. So I say Hey buddy, you

424
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:48,380
need to ride home. So that sounds a lot like cruising. He will. He would say he

425
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,100
would say no. I would don't want to ride home because we opening it in two

426
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:55,300
minutes yeah. Well, he's not working two days in a row, you because that depends

427
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,280
on what he's scheduled. Okay, so obviously I would go when I would know

428
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,520
his schedule at this point. So what's to stop me from giving him a piggyback,

429
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:05,560
but then we start we're walking and then we I piggyback him past his house. He

430
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:09,140
goes wait. That was my house and I just say nothing and keep walking and then

431
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,740
he's getting a little scared right, but then we get to my house and I

432
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:19,380
butcher him to death and I take his arms and I just hire a new employer. Do you

433
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,820
but I would go the next day and the RFID chip would be scanned. Oh,

434
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:26,620
and I'm walking around with these and by the way he's a different he's got

435
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,820
he's black guy. So I'm walking around with these black arms and I'm walking

436
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,780
around. So what would stop you from doing that? Probably the police, maybe

437
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,700
or someone who heard him screaming for help. Yeah, that's kind of outside. I

438
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:41,740
was what I was thinking an RFID chip in him and we have a tracker in the

439
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:45,780
office. The other thing about the RFID chip, so he went to my house. If you're

440
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,500
sure if your blood pressure drops, even by the slightest amount, it detonates

441
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,400
yeah. So if you cut his arms off a block, this is a high stress job. Wait, the

442
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,640
police, your blood pressure,

443
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,120
yeah, yeah, very high and drops it.

444
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:04,360
Okay, yeah, well you will he's he works at a restaurant. He's already full of

445
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,920
Ivan. So what I'm realizing right now is that I will

446
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,860
I am plankton

447
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:21,320
it slips so perfectly into the role. I realize right now that I would be a

448
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,640
perfect plankton and that, like all I could think about right now is like

449
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,620
ways to get into your

450
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:35,860
okay. So

451
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,100
well, I guess I mean if I'm going to play plankton, yeah

452
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:45,480
hey, this is per sponge bob and squidward. This is so perfect, not

453
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,040
Patrick.

454
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:51,480
No, he's not he's sponge bob okay. Well, he's kind of both yeah, yeah, okay,

455
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,320
and you're kind of squidward and sandy yeah, you give off what's the

456
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,720
vibes about me female female controlling the science part of the

457
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,220
I

458
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:19,360
I'm so glad I guess I guess Andy, because I'm a man, shit yeah, I'm live on land

459
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:23,240
and I breathe there and you have roots in Texas. Table is wobbly, so just stop

460
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:27,120
pulling on it. I always pulling on the fucking roller skate wheels on this

461
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,860
here keep pushing me back. You want to go back one last time I did that the thing

462
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:35,840
fell. Oh yeah, no, no, no, you're really between a rock and a hard place buddy. I

463
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,640
feel bad for you not

464
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,920
well, then I guess if I'm plankton, then I have to start my own restaurant across

465
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,360
the sea or the road.

466
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,880
Yeah, our restaurant's going to be underwater too. Yeah, I didn't think

467
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,920

00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,440
I am going to be

474
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,240
man. I'm really glad we started talking about the restaurant. We're talking

475
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,380
about snow. I think now we have a real topic. Yeah, this is a restaurant,

476
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,800
which I mean it's we're going to talk about this all day. If we don't stop

477
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,600
right now, we have to get into the

478
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,080
we talk for five minutes about my restaurant, please, because you guys

479
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,640

480
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,880

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,120
pull up. Okay, we'll get a timer. That's even better. Make sure you put it on

482
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,760
the starts. This is five minutes and eighteen fifteen seconds. All right,

483
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,640
started go. Okay, all right, so my restaurant will be the last fifteen

484
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,880
seconds of this video. Oh,

485
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,720
my restaurant will be if I need something from you guys. I'll ask my

486
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,800
restaurant will be across across the street from yours and my and what's

487
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,520
yours called every day is Friday. Yeah, EDI F's mine is called no day. Mine's

488
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,680
called six day week.

489
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,280
Okay, we're closed on Friday. We're closed on Friday. Chick-fil-a style. We

490
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,880
also serve pretty much all of Chick-fil-a's food, but all of McDonald's

491
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,980
food as well. All of Burger King's food, basically the top ten biggest fast food

492
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,780
restaurants. We go every single week. We buy a couple of things of every single

493
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,680
thing on the menu. We flash freeze it and then we reheat it when people is that

494
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,980
what the is that why you take Friday off? Yes. Okay. Oh, and you can't get our

495
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,480
food.

496
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:49,680
That's why you're yes, so yeah, but then also yeah, so that's why I'm going

497
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,380
after you guys. I have the top nine, but you guys are number ten and so I

498
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,980
really, really need to go get but what's your signature dish at

499
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,060
edia? We already explained it oatmeal. Yeah, it's oatmeal. It's oatmeal and

500
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,940
water

501
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:07,300
oatmeal waffles with chicken and we call them and we call them and we call them

502
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,180
water shakes really like a so it's just oatmeal and shaking water.

503
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:15,720
did you say chicken water? Because we have that specialties.

504
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,200
I just got the secret ingredient and it was that easy. You gave it to me.

505
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,200
Fucking terrible at your job. Spices being anti. You don't know the secret

506
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,820
formula. Yeah. And by the way, plankton knows it's called a crap. And by the

507
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:34,900
way, by the way, the secret recipe is maltodextrose. Okay, so I just got that

508
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,820
now. So,

509
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,060
but you don't know what paper we're wrapping in. Yeah, it's foil.

510
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,720
it's fun.

511
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:48,220
You have oatmeal and foil. Okay, so also I am hiring I'm spending half of my

512
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:50,400
half of the entire budget of the restaurant on

513
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,260
an anti plankton

514
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,080
guy who basically handles it because you guys needed one the entire time,

515
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,860
because every restaurant has a plankton yeah, every single restaurant,

516
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,060
somebody who is plotting on the downfall of the restaurant, trying to figure out

517
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:09,220
all the secrets. Yeah, so I don't know who mine is yet, but I'm going to make

518
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,260
I'm fucking damn sure that he dies. So I'm hiring an anti playing. I'm getting

519
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:17,860
I'm getting the the Pinkerton's. I'm hiring the Pinkerton's to come be

520
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,220
anti plankton security. Okay, and

521
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:23,380
yeah, you guys are basically going to go out of business. I'm undercutting

522
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,300
you in every single way. I'm going to make oatmeal with maple syrup. The

523
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:31,500
main thing you forgot is people can get food anywhere, but an atmosphere. Yep,

524
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,140
and a place where you can't tell who's the waiter in the chef. Yep, you can

525
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:38,980
only get that one fucking at your table. Well, my atmosphere is even better.

526
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,780
all the water's flavor. We your restaurant has no atmosphere literally

527
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:44,600
because we just sucked all the air out of it with a vacuum and all what if I

528
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,580
know it's underwater. So I guess it does. No, I pump extra oxygen into mine

529
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,180
like a like a I guess all your guests are passing out from from over

530
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,020
oxygenation. No, because it's a perfect amount like a Vegas casino and also

531
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,340
every single clock. So people sitting there will eat for two days.

532
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:06,060
Every single table at EDIF does have its own ozone machine.

533
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,860
We have an ozone, which is a place where you can go get masturbated.

534
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,860
Okay, you're being shut down by the government?

535
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
The health department is going to shut that down.

536
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,860
It's a separate thing from...

537
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,860
You can't get tug jobs and shaken water.

538
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,860
Why? That's how they shake the water.

539
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,860
No.

540
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
No, it's not.

541
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,860
Don't say that. That's horrible.

542
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
We also have...

543
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,860
We shake it with a proprietary shaking machine.

544
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
And we also have...

545
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,860
I have bitches who twerk with the water on their butt.

546
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:41,400
You don't even have what I thought Cameron said earlier, but now I'm going to implement

547
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,440
it into the restaurant, which is chicken water.

548
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,440
What is that?

549
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,440
What's chicken water?

550
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,720
So it's shaken water with chicken essence in it.

551
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,720
What is a chicken's essence?

552
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,720
A chicken essence?

553
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,720
It's like a little bit.

554
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,720
It's another secret formula that I can't tell you.

555
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,720
We can't really tell you about it, but it's just the top.

556
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,720
And guess what?

557
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,800
It's maltodextrin.

558
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
No.

559
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
No.

560
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,440
Chicken water is good, though.

561
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,680
Yeah, chicken water is fucking good.

562
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,440
I don't want to talk about chicken water. We can do that.

563
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,680
We got to talk about what... You're ceding your time? Yes.

564
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,960
I'm ceding your time. What we are here... Wait, I want to see what

565
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,360
the last 15 seconds is. It's probably... Is it just like a subscribe button?

566
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:20,220
I bet it is. For Adam Eshborn? Oh my God. It turns different colors.

567
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:23,840
It's a fun party. That's unbelievable. Okay. So today,

568
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:28,160
if you guys have been with us for years and years,

569
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:33,560
you will know that one of our favorite websites is mysticinvestigations.com.

570
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:37,440
mystic investigations. For those of you don't know is ran by a man. His name is

571
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,520
Xavier Remington, and he is basically the

572
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,160
foremost investigator of all things paranormal. Yeah, I think he is. He's

573
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:53,240
earth's link to this supernatural world kind of. There's a couple of things

574
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:56,400
going on. The most important thing is that he documents all of it, and he's a

575
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,400
very intelligent guy. Yeah, he's basically the smartest person in the

576
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,240
world. He will be one day he will he will be his name will be spoken along and he

577
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,440
works with an organization called Mystic Investigations. Well he's the head of it

578
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,480
which Mystic Investigations is based in a school kind of a Hogwarts situation if I

579
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,600
remember correctly. He has a lot of information. We've been over it a couple

580
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,120
of times but today we decided to make a return because it's been a while and

581
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:28,080
he's got plenty of new information. Oh yeah. To share with the public. I mean the

582
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:33,680
The last time we investigated mystic investigations, one, we didn't even

583
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,080
scratch the surface because we just happened upon, actually it came into our

584
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,280
- it was fate. Yeah, yeah, we accidentally discovered it. We, it was an

585
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,080
accidental discovery. I think I googled how old is Mrs. Claus. Yeah, yes, that's

586
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,120
exactly what it was.

587
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:49,920
Yeah, and because stuff like that, those kind of esoteric

588
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,600
questions, he always has an answer for. Exactly. And I would say that's exactly

589
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,240
what he's kind of the king of the esoteric. Uh huh, 100%.

590
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,940
percent. So

591
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:05,980
I focused on we each did our own little mini investigation into Mi. That's what

592
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:11,480
we call it. Yep. And today I well, I found a couple of things. One was we

593
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,960
click on this, Julio, so that I can I can use the thing.

594
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,000
Is it off?

595
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,560
It's completely off. Okay, but now it's on.

596
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,920
Photos prove Dubai is strange.

597
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,140
I didn't click on this, or I did click on this, but I didn't end up doing an

598
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,340
investigation into this, but I will say this caught my eye in a massive way.

599
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,440
This photo to me does prove to be a strange. It's a woman in a bikini.

600
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,940
And what is that behind her? That is a bunch of bales of hay?

601
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,040
No, it looks like some kind of roadblock, maybe.

602
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,940
Oh, okay.

603
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,040
So I did not do, I just wanted to mention this up top, but I did not

604
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,540
actually do my investigation into that. I did my investigation into Xavier's

605
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,740
this article on the supernatural stench.

606
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:59,440
Are you guys familiar with the supernatural stench? No, no, no, I've

607
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,200
never heard of the supernatural stench. So I'll tell you about him.

608
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,660
The supernatural stench, the supernatural being known as the stench, is the

609
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:12,040
premier paranormal purveyor of sinister smells. Amazingly, he was born Stefan

610
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,240
Stank in the year

611
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:19,540
1939 in Nantes, France. Although the surname itself doesn't mean wretched

612
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:26,340
stink, but rather a standing pool of water, most likely stagnant in nature.

613
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,800
Stefan was born with the psychokinetic power of fragrance manipulation with a strong emphasis

614
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,460
on biological stench generation.

615
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:37,500
At a young age, he became fascinated by making people suffer and even become physically sick

616
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,340
via sickening scents.

617
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:46,460
This was seriously seen when young Stefan took a dump so wretched that they had to evacuate

618
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,660
his elementary school in the process.

619
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,660
Most of the students suffered from varying degrees of sickness while the janitor died.

620
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,360
The principal recalled seeing Stefan laughing hysterically under an oak tree, being the

621
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,140
only one who wasn't barfing.

622
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,740
Wait, let me look at the date on this.

623
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
Okay, April 23rd.

624
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:05,820
I just wanted to make sure that this was not some kind of April Fool's prank because I

625
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,820
will say...

626
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,820
Oh, this is recent.

627
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:08,820
This is a new article.

628
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,460
Yeah, this is a pretty new one because Xavier, being a man of culture and academia as he

629
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,620
is, would not normally say, "Take a dump."

630
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,720
I know so it's a bit out of character, but

631
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,920
yeah, I guess another thing to for people who aren't familiar maybe with

632
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,120
the mystic investigations is it's a big it's paranormal, but it's a big focus

633
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,120
on holidays and holiday. So we see a lot about well because that's a

634
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,620
cause they don't fool the Easter bunny. Yeah, so this is I this is that's

635
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,520
the realm we're in right now is the suit kind of a universe where the

636
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,520
Easter Bunny and the supernatural stench could yeah, the stench prodigy

637
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:51,760
has the awful ability to amplify his body odor, bad breath, fart gases, and an armada of alarming

638
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,240
aromas. Stank's flatulence is one of his greatest weapons as his ghastly gases can be terribly

639
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:01,920
toxic along with zapping the oxygen out of a room. With an exponential increase in the

640
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,640
smell comes excessive levels of hydrogen sulfide, methane, and carbon dioxide that could easily

641
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,680
kill a person. This vile villain can also amplify the stank of other people near him

642
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,920
to varying degrees. The stench has also been known to power boost pleasant

643
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,520
smelling things such as cologne or perfume into something so strong that it

644
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:25,680
induces headaches and nausea in his victims. Generally his stinky powers rely

645
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,560
on a biological host having contact with the odor of origin. When his powers are

646
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:34,240
in use his eyes glow a light shade of brown that almost looks orange. Nose

647
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:38,600
emoji. I like that. I like generally his stinky powers rely on a biological host

648
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,840
having contact with the odor of origin.

649
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,840
The odor of origin.

650
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,840
He smells bad if you can smell him.

651
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,840
Yeah.

652
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,440
You see, this is, I feel like a lot of the, what I found interesting about this one is

653
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,240
a lot of the characters that Xavier writes about are usually, like you said, people from

654
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,240
holidays.

655
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
Holiday lore.

656
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
Holidays.

657
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,000
I don't remember any kind of stinky holiday in my life.

658
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,000
I do.

659
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The Stench Cult.

660
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Stinksgiving.

661
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The Stench Cult.

662
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,240
Oh, Stinksgiving, true.

663
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,320
This is the Stench Cult.

664
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,280
Stefan also uses his stench generation abilities to raise money for various

665
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,680
purposes. Oh, that's not so bad. He can force people out of anywhere in seconds

666
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,920
and then and then rob it of everything. He is also a hit man for hire who will

667
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,880
take down anyone's foes via felonious funk. Stefan has occasionally allied with

668
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,040
the plague doctor by using aromas as a vector for disease. Everyone put

669
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,840
remember the plague doctor because he will be reappearing. Put a pin in that.

670
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,540
Oh wow. However, the high class doctor turns his nose down on that on

671
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,120
your nose too. Clothes pin due to the stink. He turns his nose down at

672
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:47,160
the nasty homeless stench and uses him sparingly only when necessary.

673
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:50,340
Still, Stefan begs the plague doctor to let him in on the secrets of

674
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:54,420
dark immortality as he pushes into his 80s. He also strives to hone

675
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:59,740
the powers to absolute stench status. Indeed, Stefan does live as a

676
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:02,640
traveling, disheveled homeless man in large cities around the world

677
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,480
with the most concentration of people and repugnant rank.

678
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,840
This filthy fiend loves skulking about sewers,

679
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,000
breathing in the toxic aroma of human waste.

680
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,200
He has acquired enough money to live a grand life,

681
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,400
but it goes against everything he believes in.

682
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,720
Most of the money is used to fund

683
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,480
his perplexingly poisonous plots

684
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,160
and the crazy cult that supports him.

685
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,640
Of course, every supernatural lunatic has a cult,

686
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,760
and this one is full of the most disgusting people

687
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,040
you could ever hope to meet.

688
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,520
So here's what I like about this.

689
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,120
It confirms two of my biggest suspicions

690
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:35,680
about any given homeless person is that number one, they have plenty of money.

691
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,480
They just don't want to use it. Right. And number two, they are probably a

692
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,880
villain. So any given homeless person, usually an elderly one or something,

693
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,920
they, there's a pretty high chance that it's Stefan stinking disguise. I guess.

694
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,600
I didn't even think about, yeah, you have to read the thing about Xavier's

695
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:56,080
writings is you have to read between the lines for things like that because you

696
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,440
know, he's not going to tell you straight up. He can't tell you straight

697
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:06,420
up. These words are too, you know, the concepts that he creates are too

698
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,080
boggling for the human mind that he has to tell you through riddles like

699
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,800
this. Yeah.

700
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,160
Like Stefan, all... Yeah, I know, we're getting a call from our landlord.

701
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,280
"All cult members are expected to never take a bath, brush their teeth,

702
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,940
or partake of any proper hygiene. Although he does provide mystical remedies

703
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:28,160
so members stay in fighting shape and don't find their teeth rotting out.

704
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,160
The stench and his foul followers are responsible for the recent.

705
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,560
What does that say celebrity supported no bathing movement? What the hell

706
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:38,960
this has already supported

707
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,060
imagine this is people discussing people like Britney Spears that yeah,

708
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,060
celebrity. Yeah, if you want to call them that in the name of preserving

709
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,260
their skins precious

710
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,660
microorganisms and despicable skin oils

711
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:55,760
bathe responsibly and you'll be just fine. Some of these celebs are secret

712
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,760
cult members who bow to the stench as their guru. If you know someone with

713
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,280
noxious B.O., then odds are good that they are a cult member as well,

714
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,720
especially if they give the excuse that it's good for their skin. Their ultimate

715
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,120
end game is to return to the dark ages where nobody ever bathed, or if they did,

716
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:17,400
it was once a year. They pray for a stench-ridden society, polluted with

717
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,800
blasphemous biological sewage.

718
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:20,800
- And what's that emoji there?

719
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,720
- That is a poop emoji.

720
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:22,400
- No way.

721
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,000
- Whoa.

722
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
- Can you believe that?

723
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,120
- That is nasty.

724
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,320
The Stinch Slayers.

725
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:26,880
Ooh.

726
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,380
Okay.

727
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:27,880
Yeah.

728
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,600
There is a small group of brave warriors known as Stinch Slayers.

729
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:35,320
They hunt down cult members and force them into showers and baths,

730
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,200
soaping them up really good.

731
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,840
Afterward, they make them put on freshly laundered clothing

732
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:41,960
and begin the process of deprogramming.

733
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,240
The hope is re-assimilation back into society

734
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,240
to lead a normal, clean, and healthy life.

735
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,120
So far, they haven't gotten close to Saffan

736
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,000
due to his overwhelming scent manipulation,

737
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,360
superhuman strength, speed, agility, and senses.

738
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,760
Superhuman strength?

739
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:56,600
Well, yeah, he did mention that earlier, I guess.

740
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,600
Wow.

741
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:03,040
Their dream is to scrub this guy clean, give him a seriously close shave, and lock him away

742
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,080
in a room devoid of scent.

743
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:08,320
This sick puppy hasn't bathed since the 1940s.

744
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
1940s?

745
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,360
Goddamn.

746
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:14,080
Most of the stench slayers have either lost their sense of smell or wear protective gear,

747
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,600
although such gear can be forced off or have one little accidental crack that allows stink

748
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:19,760
to enter.

749
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,120
Some have psychokinetic powers, such as stench removal and scent shifting, to combat the stench

750
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,480
and the followers ripe with rank stank.

751
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,560
If you know someone with barf-worthy BO, then urge them to take a shower and use some deodorant.

752
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:40,620
If they angrily refuse, then assume they're a brainwashed stench cult member and contact

753
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,440
a paranormal professional for help.

754
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,560
If you spot the stench himself, then prepare to vomit or even die.

755
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:50,840
See, this is one of the things that's nice about Xavier Remington 2 and Mystic Investigations

756
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,040
is this stuff always has kind of a societal message. It's something like, it's like, okay,

757
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,240
so we're talking about the supernatural and magic and you know, but you know what, actually,

758
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,720
a lot of this stuff matters. This will matter in your day to day life and there's a meaning

759
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,040
and theme behind it.

760
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,040
It's prescriptive.

761
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:09,380
Watch out for your friends.

762
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:15,280
It's saying go out there, if somebody's on the street and they look stinky, then you

763
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,360
you should probably be kidnapping them, bringing them to a large bath, dunking

764
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,680
them in it, and shaving their face.

765
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,180
And a room devoid of smell.

766
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,180
A room devoid of scent.

767
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,120
They should make some kind of, you know how you can put up like soundproofing

768
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:28,120
foam and stuff?

769
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,120
Yeah.

770
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
They should have smell proof.

771
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,120
Oh my God.

772
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,880
I know they have air fresheners and stuff like that, but I want specifically a

773
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,480
foam that I put on the wall.

774
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,480
That'd just be better.

775
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,480
Yeah.

776
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,920
Okay, so, and then this is I think just the last thing that he decided to

777
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:47,320
include here, which is the infamous B.O. episode of Seinfeld. The video above features highlights

778
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:52,720
of an episode of Seinfeld called "The Smelly Car." You can watch the 20th episode of Season

779
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,360
4 here, and there's a link, which I don't think is probably good.

780
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,720
The attendant in the red jacket is a representation of a proud stench cult member who has worked

781
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,160
diligently to build his body odor to the point that it can be spread to other people and locations.

782
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:11,880
The art of rank stank spreading is a key practice within the crazy cult. The goal of every cult

783
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,800
member is to make their stench take on a life of its own and live on even after their death.

784
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,860
In sitcom form it's funny, but in real life it's no laughing matter.

785
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:24,680
That's actually, honestly that last sentence, that is true to me about almost everything.

786
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,480
Or if I see it in a sitcom I will laugh my ass off, but if someone says something to

787
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,840
me in real life I will say, "Oh, okay."

788
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:38,520
I mean think about even other Seinfeld stuff. Think about the Soup Nazi.

789
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,120
If there was a Nazi for soups...

790
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:44,420
I don't think it would be that fun to me if I if I said, can I please have a clam

791
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:48,720
chowder and can you take all the clamp it just the chowder please and he says get

792
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,120
the fuck out. I thought I'm the fucking Nazi. Yeah, look at my Nazi tattoo.

793
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Yeah, that's not funny. I'm an effing Nazi. Yeah, but no. Yeah, you know, you

794
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:01,320
cannot have soup. I'm a Nazi. Yeah, I'd go. What the fuck is going on? I

795
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,720
probably report him to the cops. I feel like I'm I would honestly I would I

796
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,520
would feel like I was in an episode of TV, but not a sitcom. No, I feel like I

797
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,720
first of all, of course, first of all, I'd say what is this Seinfeld yeah, but

798
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,680
then I would say then it would sink in. I would say no. What is this curb your

799
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:21,320
enthusiasm? Yep, then I'd say no, but he would get he would probably like the

800
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,720
soup so much that he'd just say, oh, who gives a shit? Who gives a yeah, it

801
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,480
gives a shit if it's a Nazi, but me personally, I'd probably go back and I'd

802
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,360
probably fucking execute him. Yeah, probably blow his brains into the so I

803
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:37,000
would go into the soup Nazi. I'd go, I'd shrink myself, go into his body, start

804
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,240
playing with all of his little pieces. You know what I would show myself to be.

805
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,120
I would change my size to be. I would be maybe half, maybe a quarter of an inch

806
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,360
smaller than him, so I could go inside of him and just be fully my full body

807
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,400
inside of him. I would stay regular size, pick him up

808
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,200
and then put him in a blender, right? Cook him down with some tomato paste or

809
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,160
something. You'd make a soup out of him. I would make a soup out of that Nazi.

810
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,840
I'd do all that, but then I'd also shrink to half my size. And then you'd

811
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,160
swim in the soup on a crouton. Yeah, you know what I'd say? You know what I

812
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,520
do I'd say after you're doing yeah yeah I'd use it like a kickboard yeah here's

813
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:15,680
what I would say I would he'd say all this BS Nazi bullcrap uh-huh and I'd say

814
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:21,640
yeah big surprise soup surrounded by fucking crackers oh shit yeah damn and

815
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,920
then I good fucking insult his cracker ass and every way I think of yeah he

816
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,640
would crack he crack under the pressure he'd crack another pressure I'd say

817
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:35,160
that's right I knew that was coming all right um who's next who's next with this

818
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,160
I can go next.

819
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
All right.

820
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Are you sure?

821
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
I feel like you have a bigger investigation than I do.

822
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,160
Okay, if you want to go next.

823
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:42,160
I can.

824
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,160
Mine is kind of brief.

825
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,680
You said who's next, which implies you don't want to go next.

826
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:46,680
I'll go next.

827
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,320
I'll go next because I don't have too much.

828
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,000
No, it's not Patrick Steele's corner.

829
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It's not.

830
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Get out of the Steele's corner.

831
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,000
Put that away.

832
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,600
So I was looking yesterday.

833
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:04,760
So I was looking around on Xavier's Twitter profile.

834
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,760
Metaphysical PI because guess what happened you guys?

835
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,760
The craziest thing.

836
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,760
Metaphysical PI is team follow back.

837
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,760
Really?

838
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,760
Team follow back metaphysical PI.

839
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,760
So I sent them a DM.

840
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:23,760
I said, "Hello Xavier.

841
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,760
I've been very interested in mystic investigations for a while now.

842
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,760
Big fan.

843
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
Was wondering if you could answer some questions for me.

844
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,960
Xavier is so elusive that I did not hear a peep. Look at that.

845
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,260
Left me on read.

846
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:41,960
Honestly, because of his metaphysical nature, he probably tried to type it back

847
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,760
and his hand phased through the motherfucking phone.

848
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,560
He probably got trapped in his keyboard and is now in a cyberchase-style situation.

849
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,460
Trying to type you a message back.

850
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:56,260
Yeah, but he's too small. He can't even press the keys on the circuits.

851
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:59,460
Also, you can't... Yeah, there's no... Yeah, it doesn't make a lot of sense.

852
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:00,760
It doesn't make any sense.

853
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,300
he needs to be it makes no sense at all. There's not a keyboard on. Yeah. So the

854
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:10,240
first so then I'm just clicking around his page. So I'm clicking around. I'm

855
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,480
just trying to figure out all this stuff. You're trying to see why does it if

856
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:18,760
maybe he has some kind of like text back guide. Yeah. So then I saw this.

857
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,680
When you'll crush text you. What these emojis mean. I've been looking through

858
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:28,280
his page and I got interested immediately because he was talking about

859
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:33,740
shaman George Lucas, guided by our powerful shaman, George Lucas has been

860
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:38,120
in contact with force goes from a bubble universe where Star Wars is real goes

861
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,400
to mo. The reality was created by the human collective consciousness belief in

862
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,500
his stories. Lucas hopes to join them as his afterlife someday. He wants to

863
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:52,200
George Lucas hopes to become a I would be so pissed off if I died and it was

864
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,840
Star Wars. The afterlife was

865
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,780
you, do you mean you would go to star wars or you would be a ghost like in star

866
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,540
wars? No, like I would go to star. You would wake up like the afterlife is star

867
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,220
wars. You wake up and kit fist. I think that like kind of that would be I would

868
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:12,500
be pissed off because I would be like it's a real like come on star. I would

869
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,660
why not something else that I like more yeah, it was for everyone else. It was

870
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:19,820
star wars. I would learn to love it. Yeah, I probably would too. I would learn

871
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,860
to love it. Here's the thing about star wars.

872
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:26,380
The franchise is indeed based on a true story. The Jedi, the Sith, the fourth

873
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,660
Force, Rebel Alliance, and the battle against the Galactic Empire a long time ago in a galaxy

874
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:36,420
far far away are real. This includes Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader, Yoda, Luke Skywalker,

875
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:41,700
Han Solo, Princess Leia, and the rest of the characters to an extent. There is also the

876
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:45,820
original trilogy and prequels that involved George Lucas. However, the latest trilogy

877
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:50,820
in Disney's hands loses touch with what actually happened to these legendary people. The evidence

878
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,320
that Star Wars is real has been suppressed by the government with a controlled release

879
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:57,680
to the entertainment industry. That explains so much about the last Jedi.

880
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,260
Mm-hmm. This is oh, yeah, because look at this.

881
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,160
Lucas sells to Disney and the real trilogy is lost.

882
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,760
Damn. Yeah. Lucas gave his story ideas for episode seven through nine to Disney,

883
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,060
but they chose to take the more creative route

884
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,300
and made up their own stories for the most part.

885
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:18,160
George also tried to convince Disney that Star Wars was based on a true story,

886
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,720
but they thought he was nuts.

887
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,100
Although later on, Disney's government connections

888
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:26,300
in the U.S. Paranormal Defense Agency made them think otherwise.

889
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,780
Unluckily for them, none of their psychics could get confirmed contact

890
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,540
with the Star Wars galaxy, and they were hellbent on telling their own tales.

891
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:39,340
It is thought that the character of Rey was a substitute

892
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,380
for the real Luke Skywalker's daughter, Anika. Wow.

893
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:44,940
As far as we know, Palpatine never had any kids.

894
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:49,260
He was the quintessence of evil at a height

895
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:52,340
beyond any desire for love, sex or procreation.

896
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:57,080
In fact, if he had a child, he would see it as a threat to his power and eradicate it.

897
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:02,040
Despite George losing his way for a time, he has been promised force-go status upon his

898
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:06,240
natural death as a reward for telling the Star Wars saga.

899
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
Can you go back?

900
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,880
I'm shocked that nobody wanted to let Palpatine hit it raw.

901
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:10,880
He's disgusting.

902
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,880
Gross.

903
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,880
He's got kind of like...

904
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,880
Sheave?

905
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:15,800
He's got kind of like the tired white boy.

906
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,840
He's got Pete Davidson eyes.

907
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:18,840
Yeah, he does.

908
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Oh, he does actually.

909
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:22,000
Yeah, maybe he would actually smash hard.

910
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,320
I feel like I would bet money that genuinely a US some kind of US

911
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:30,700
government agency has tried to get psychics in contact with the Star Wars

912
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:35,440
galaxy. Oh, yeah, that's something that they do. No, they were like yeah in the

913
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,240
in the s and shit they were just going for yeah, all the like remote viewing

914
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,080
thing where they would like get people with ESP to be like they'd be like draw

915
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,220
pick, draw a picture of the moon yeah and they would draw a picture of the

916
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,180
moon and then draw a building on it and then they'd be like Holy Shit. Oh my

917
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:53,260
we need to lock you in a room for a year. Yeah, so if you thought that these two

918
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:59,460
slides were the sort of rude to the Disney trilogy here, okay, wait until

919
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,560
you see this next tweet that I saw from Xavier mate.

920
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:07,460
Kathleen Kennedy is trending as she is the darkness of the Star Wars universe,

921
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,540
the fundamental source for the dark side of the force. She and her allies

922
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:16,200
managed to lock the bringer of light George Lucas in a cosmic cage. Will the

923
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:20,660
Jedi of the righteous light be able to save him. We need to save George. We

924
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:24,660
need to look at her eyes in that photo. She does look demonic. She looks

925
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:28,360
demonic as hell. There's a bunch of other stuff about Kathleen Kennedy

926
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:32,360
too. Kathleen Kennedy announces that Star Wars the Rise of Skywalker will

927
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:35,360
end with the revelation that the last three movies were a bad dream in the

928
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,160
mind of a drunk Ewok. After that she was stepped down in a new team who

929
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:45,260
knows what the hell they're doing will redo the trilogy. Not! Fatality.

930
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:50,560
Yep, so this is between posts about how Santa Claus is actually fighting the

931
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:55,400
yeah, there's a dark version of the April fool, April, anti for

932
00:54:55,400 --> 00:55:02,760
anti Claus. Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah, so these are these are all in between that

933
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:08,080
a year ago. Yeah, this is about the Disney Star Wars hotel flop

934
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:15,560
Xavier had Xavier had this to say to fatherly HQ.

935
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:21,560
I heard it was too fake and expensive most likely Kathleen Kennedy was

936
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,360
involved in this debacle in some way.

937
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,660
She's the one behind all the Star Wars failures.

938
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:28,260
I'm not sure why she hasn't been fired yet.

939
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:33,360
Yeah, Kathleen Kennedy has re-upped her Lucasfilm contract for three more years.

940
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,360
Thank God.

941
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,560
I don't know how Star Wars or any movie franchise would ever get along without

942
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,860
her not.

943
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:45,660
Wow. I mean, it would have been not that big of a deal and we wouldn't need the gunshot

944
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,660
until the last.

945
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:47,660
The knot is incredible.

946
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:50,440
That is a scathing knot.

947
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:53,040
And then I saw this here, #NorthKoreaChristmasGift.

948
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,140
Oh, I love that hashtag.

949
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,140
Yeah.

950
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,140
I'm known to peruse that.

951
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,820
I'm always browsing that hashtag.

952
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:04,780
I read this one a lot. North Korea Christmas Gift. Some are saying Kim Jong-un's Christmas

953
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,440
gift will be remaking the latest Star Wars trilogy, including Star Wars, the

954
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,240
Rise of Skywalker. Apparently he'll star in it and defeat Palpatine.

955
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,620
You know what I have to say to this? You know what I have to say about this

956
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:19,400
one? What? Points. Yes.

957
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:22,340
This is kind of an at midnight.

958
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:26,860
Yeah. There is a lot of these at midnight style Xavier tweets that I've

959
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,660
been looking through.

960
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:32,380
Baby Yoda problems. Oh, that is definitely an at midnight one. Baby Yoda

961
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:36,980
made off some made some offhand comment on the Galactic Twitter and it wasn't

962
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:41,900
politically correct. Now, baby status as a media darling is over as they hate

963
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:46,420
spews forth like an intolerant hellfire. He tried to clarify, but it's too late.

964
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:51,060
He's ruined for life. Poor Yoda. Points are laughing emoji. Points are no points.

965
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:54,860
I think no points. So laughing emoji is spiteful. This hits a little too close

966
00:56:54,860 --> 00:57:00,420
to home because I think even Yoda, sadly, even Yoda could be a target of the

967
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,460
woke left yeah, especially baby yoda grogu exactly, which like they're all

968
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,660
they probably try to get baby yoda kicked out of high school exactly. Now

969
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:12,060
I want I want you to read the school. I want you to think in the for this next

970
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:16,300
one. I want you to think in your head. Just imagine Johnny Carson saying this

971
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,060
okay, all right.

972
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:23,960
Now do my best. There's one retweet on this. Okay. I'll do my best to try and

973
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,260
sound like Johnny. I'm closing my eyes. Okay, uncle Ben's will rebrand and enter

974
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,860
the world of science fiction.

975
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:35,860
They will either feature Obi-Wan Kenobi or Ben Parker from #Spider-Man as the new Uncle Ben.

976
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:42,860
Most are expecting Ben Kenobi to win as people want rice that is strong with the Force.

977
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,860
(laughter)

978
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:46,860
Could you see Carson?

979
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:54,860
Yeah, I mean that sounds very much... I don't know if it's because you were doing the impression or not, but it did kind of sound like it.

980
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:56,860
That sounds, that's written in Carson's voice.

981
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,860
Yeah, a little bit.

982
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:02,260
This is Xavier, I think, tapping into, using his powers to tap into other

983
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:06,260
interdimensional beings like Johnny Carson.

984
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:11,460
This next one here, I guess this one more is like a Jay Leno.

985
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:14,460
So hit the J on this.

986
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,460
You know, every time I see Hoda trending, I think of Yoda.

987
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:21,960
And how that would probably be the name of his wife, who feels allowed to get married.

988
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:25,460
Yes. You know how you name your wife?

989
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:35,460
Oh wait, Dan's here. Wait, pause it. Landlord is here? Okay, alright. Well, so that happened.

990
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:47,460
Okay, so this next one here, again, if we're going with late night hosts, think about this

991
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,460
one in Jimmy Fowlens' voice. I can't really do, he doesn't really have a discernible voice.

992
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,500
have a voice. He doesn't even have a voice yeah.

993
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,260
Do you remember he would do? Thank you cards

994
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:59,060
no okay. I'm the only one that remembers that

995
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:03,940
thank you, J. J. Abrams for letting Luke Skywalker go nuts on Palpatine with

996
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,100
amazing force powers. We've never seen him use for Anakin having returned with

997
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:14,740
as a force goes with a major role wait that never happened. Wow, oh wow, then

998
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:19,020
I'll just burn through these last two hashtag how star wars should end the

999
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,960
first ghost of Luke Skywalker ends up on Earth in one thousand and seventy

1000
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,660
one and shares the saga of Star Wars with George Lucas

1001
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:30,600
points that's points that's points. Then I thought the Phantom Menace was

1002
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,900
trending because they were remastering it by deleting Jar Jar Binks from

1003
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:34,940
existence.

1004
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:39,480
Dean and then this last one here, I put this in here because I felt this one

1005
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,240
so episode

1006
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,980
six through nine are not really the real outcomes. That's why they seem so

1007
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,160
lackluster compared to the others. Good to know. Also, hi, Xavier. Are you free to

1008
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:50,460
talk?

1009
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:54,520
So this person is saying that this is because they started going off the rails

1010
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,640
of the actual history. So this is basically like the first six of the

1011
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,420
Bible, and now they're doing kind of a Mormonism kind of thing.

1012
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:01,720
Yes.

1013
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,000
It's getting wacky.

1014
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,760
Okay. That makes sense.

1015
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:11,700
Alright. I did mine about another holiday being that I was very happy to

1016
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,160
find.

1017
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,900
This is very interesting to me.

1018
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:21,780
Okay, this is who is the Mardi Gras Joker. Oh my God. Wow. And this is a

1019
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,660
picture of the Mardi Gras Joker. Pretty scary for all you people who can't

1020
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:27,280
look good. It's a jester.

1021
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,140
It's a scary gesture. No ordinary gesture. No suit looking a bit

1022
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:36,980
supernatural in nature, a goth jester. But here I'll go ahead here and

1023
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:40,500
retell you guys about the Mardi Gras Joker. The Mardi Gras Joker's real

1024
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,300
name is Frank Farkas, but he's long since abandoned that identity. Frank began as a

1025
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,260
low-level criminal who utilized theft and intimidation to create wealth, all the

1026
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,900
while enjoying the torment of innocent people. There's some evidence he had

1027
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:56,260
abusive parents and may have once had a speech impediment that caused him to be

1028
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,060
bullied as a child. At some point, he discovered voodoo magic and found he had

1029
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:04,380
a deep interest in it. He realized his natural talent for dark voodoo and began

1030
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:08,780
training under a voodoo master named Trailfeeze. His powers grew and so did

1031
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:12,380
his criminal enterprise, which began to employ its own thugs. Isn't this the

1032
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:17,380
same backstory as Sweet Tooth? No, Sweet Tooth was a serial killer. It's funny

1033
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:20,380
you say that because they do mention twisted. I don't think I put it in, but

1034
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,640
the way that I found this article was from a list of apocalypses and they

1035
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,060
mentioned twisted metal and they're worried about this. So being a dark

1036
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:33,440
master of voodoo magic grants the Mardi Gras Joker immense paranormal power. On

1037
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:37,180
top of that, he taps directly into the spirit of Mardi Gras and Carnival.

1038
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:43,320
fall. Oh, my God, thereby adding its metaphysical energy to his body. This

1039
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:46,760
not only increases his magical abilities, but also grants him enhanced

1040
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,720
superhuman strength, speed, agility and senses. He also has a slight psychic

1041
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,380
ability to sense danger afoot. So the power of the Mardi Gras Joker is it's

1042
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:56,200
he's Spider-Man.

1043
01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:01,100
Oh, true. He has the senses. He has the exact same powers as Spider-Man. He has

1044
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:01,820
funny senses.

1045
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:06,520
His weaknesses may include those employing an even greater voodoo against

1046
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:10,340
him or the use of other forms of magic. He is considered virtually the top voodoo

1047
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:13,380
practitioner on earth, so it would probably take a group of talented magic

1048
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:16,900
masters to take him down. As the leader of a holiday, he needs a magical

1049
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:20,320
artefact of some type to channel the holiday spirit into his body. This is

1050
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:24,300
often a crystal, such as Santa Claus's infamous Christmas crystal.

1051
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:26,840
The Christmas crystal. Which we all know about the Christmas crystal. I feel like

1052
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:28,420
we don't even have to go into that. I'm starting to remember it a little bit,

1053
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,940
but yeah, people can do their own research. The infamous Christmas crystal.

1054
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:32,420
I remember it being blue. Everybody knows it. Yeah.

1055
01:02:32,420 --> 01:02:35,980
Once his supernatural status had sufficiently increased, he set his sights

1056
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:39,280
and metaphysically taking over Mardi Gras. He has warped the spirit of the

1057
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,500
holiday into a dark force that he channels through his own deformed soul

1058
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,760
awaiting damnation in hell. Although he doesn't care much for the devil

1059
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,320
emperor of hell, but does like the self made king of hell, Dimitri Diablo.

1060
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:53,820
The Joker now works with other forces of darkness around the world to destroy

1061
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,980
humankind. The goal is to bring about a party apocalypse to shroud the world in

1062
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:01,660
eternal darkness and violent partying, plausibly like something seen in the

1063
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:06,720
purge films, except twenty four hours a day every day for eternity. One of his

1064
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,040
most recent associates is the plague doctor. Remember him often employs new

1065
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:15,580
genetically engineered STDs during marty crop. As I've heard of this, the Joker

1066
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:19,500
has also been rumored to have terrifying ties with an even more famous jester and

1067
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,480
even more famous gesture known as the April antifool, which way more famous.

1068
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:27,900
Everyone knows the antifool. There are also recent associations with various

1069
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,780
clown cults. Watch the purge films to get a frightening feel of the party

1070
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:34,560
apocalypse ad. So there's something I noticed this now. He has a bunch of ads

1071
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,780
that are links to watch movies like he got a bunch of I think he got

1072
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:41,160
sponsorships for with some streaming site or something. Oh, did you click on

1073
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:42,960
any? I didn't click on them because they say ad

1074
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:47,460
and basically as a child of the Internet. I know not to clean no better

1075
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:47,920
yeah

1076
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,560
update twenty twenty one. The Mardi Gras Joker is livid about the cancellation

1077
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:55,300
of Mardi Gras and other carnival celebrations around the world. Due to

1078
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,940
the coven nineteen pandemic, the Joker has cut ties with the plague doctor in

1079
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,960
discussed as he as he initiated the

1080
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,480
oh my God, Saint Nicholas is happy about this development as Shrove Tuesday

1081
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:08,780
pushes forth the greater spirit of Christmas amid the weakening of the dark

1082
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:12,560
Mardi Gras spirit, another win for the supernatural forces of good. So this is

1083
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,360
kind of bearing the lead, but he I mean he the the big breaking news here is

1084
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,640
that the Cove in nineteen pandemics completely manufactured by the plague

1085
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:24,160
doc yeah yeah, I mean pretty crazy. If you had no idea, if you sit down and

1086
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:27,160
think about it, if you sit down and think about it, that makes complete.

1087
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,800
notice. I didn't say the plague doctors, you name that's true yeah, but this is

1088
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,480
where it takes a turn here.

1089
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,840
I'm hoping nobody walks in during this part. This I saw this at the bottom of

1090
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:43,300
the of the article here, Mardi Gras Joker stories, the Mardi Gras Joker's

1091
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:44,540
role in the George Floyd

1092
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:50,920
this is the first link

1093
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:58,800
I clicked on this yeah yeah protests, riots and civil unrest rage forth as a

1094
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,920
result of the dastardly death of George Floyd, even we even when he's talking

1095
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:08,740
about this, he's doing a literation, the dastardly death. This crazy chaos has

1096
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:12,180
included looting, vandalism, battles with counter protesters and major

1097
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,520
property damage and violent police response.

1098
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:19,340
There is one confirmed sighting of the jeopardous joker at a New York City

1099
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,740
protest. He wasn't wearing his complete gestures costume, but his apparel was

1100
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:27,980
odd enough. He and his cultists were where inciting violence by throwing rocks

1101
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:32,320
at windows and police. The joker laughed loudly like a loon as he flung a few

1102
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:36,320
rocks at police clad in riot gear. Two officers ran toward him and shot the

1103
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,040
joker with pepper spray. It had no effect and again he began beating down

1104
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:43,840
on the police with superhuman strength that broke their face shields. Other

1105
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:47,360
officers moved in while his cultists ran around destroying any cameras trying to

1106
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,340
film, the spectacle, I'm going to ask yeah, but there you go. He wrote it in

1107
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,600
another officer tased him and the joker's response was. Are you trying to

1108
01:05:54,600 --> 01:06:00,160
turn on me boy? Turn me on boy, turn me on boy. Oh my God, he forcibly grabbed

1109
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:04,240
the taser away and shocked several officers. They drew gruns, drew guns

1110
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,220
ready to fire when he quickly recited an incantation and clutched a voodoo doll

1111
01:06:08,220 --> 01:06:13,260
that looked like a cop. No, the police suddenly froze as he frolic away down an

1112
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:17,240
alley and disappeared within ten seconds. They were moving again. Wow,

1113
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:21,920
so the the jester. I like the idea that one all the cops look similar enough

1114
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:22,760
that one voodoo

1115
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:29,040
just a voodoo doll, which is a big like pot belly yeah. It is a really fat.

1116
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:34,760
That's so cool, man, so he's actually he's actually pretty much based yeah

1117
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,040
that he's attacking the cops yeah. Well, so this kind of gives you an insight

1118
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:38,880
into what exactly

1119
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,280
of evil,

1120
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:46,160
but there's a little more here. Protesters gone missing. Oh, there have

1121
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:49,660
in reports of protesters who mysteriously disappeared during the violence or were

1122
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:53,840
later found dead. The police have denied responsibility. In some cases, it's

1123
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:57,440
non-paranormal serial killers and other sick puppies, along with sex traffickers

1124
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,800
looking for new victims. New victim exclamation point, by the way, looking

1125
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,500
for new victims. With the rest, it's the Mardi Gras Jokers cult, kidnapping

1126
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:07,940
people for sacrifices or brainwashing them into their organization of terror.

1127
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:11,820
This also goes for the plague doctors cult, who also love spreading COVID-19

1128
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,600
and other diseases within the large crowds. Various evil witches and warlocks

1129
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:19,580
they're also searching for fresh blood sacrifices to their demon or dark deity

1130
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:23,740
of choice. Many have the false illusion of feeling safe in crowds, especially if

1131
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:27,400
they are like-minded people out for a single cause. Remember that you are in a

1132
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,540
sea of humanity that is a target for supernatural sharks out for your flesh

1133
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:34,240
and blood. Always be on alert. So if you're in a- if you ever go to a protest,

1134
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:38,600
just keep your eyes out for witches, warlocks, plague doctors,

1135
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:42,420
Mardi Gras jokers, vampires. Honestly, guys, you're better off not going to any

1136
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:46,240
protest. It's dangerous. It's dangerous, very dangerous. There could be all sorts of

1137
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:50,720
ghouls. There could be a warlock. Yeah, and that's all my slides. There could even be,

1138
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:56,200
and also if you would, I mean other dangers of protest, nudity. People are going and they're

1139
01:07:56,200 --> 01:08:01,760
showing their penises and their vaginas. There are women sitting criss, or spread eagle.

1140
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:06,840
Uh huh, and crisscross. Pussy ass. They're sitting crisscross and appropriating Native

1141
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:10,840
American sitting circles. Yeah, well that would be basically something that we should

1142
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:15,180
protest yeah, but do it quietly. You sounded like you were about to spit do

1143
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:18,340
it quietly and go to a protest. If there's one or two people there yeah

1144
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:23,380
that you know is not a vampire yeah or a marty grodd joker warlock ghoul type

1145
01:08:23,380 --> 01:08:26,540
something I didn't put in here that I forgot to put in that. I just remembered

1146
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:30,720
the marty grodd joker. Also, he hates if you compare him to the batman joker

1147
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:34,200
really really well, then I'm not going to go there. We're going to go ahead and

1148
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,620
go to the episode before we get anywhere near that and also you know what I'm

1149
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,640
Our landlord's been knocking on our door for about 15 minutes.

1150
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:42,640
Really? He's still there?

1151
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,640
He's just kind of walking around like a Sasquatch.

1152
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:46,640
Okay. Bye guys.

1153
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:52,640
It's just the most...

1154
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:54,640
Why do our bodies hate what's good for them?

1155
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:56,640
Yeah. You know what I mean?

1156
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,640
Why the hell is this?

1157
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,640
Why is it that vegetables taste like doo-doo to people like us,

1158
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:04,640
but candy and bread taste so incredible?

1159
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:09,240
Yesterday I had probably the worst diet I've ever had in my entire life.

1160
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:12,440
I ate breakfast, lunch and dinner, all three of them were sandwiches.

1161
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:13,940
Jimmy John's. Yeah, Jimmy John's.

1162
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:14,740
Yeah, Jimmy John's.

1163
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:18,140
I had a breakfast sandwich, a tuna sandwich and a Jimmy John's sandwich.

1164
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,040
Those were my meals of the day.

1165
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,140
That's...

1166
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,640
That is such a bad way to live. You do that every day, don't you?

1167
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,640
That's what you're gonna say.

1168
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:26,940
That was a good couple years of my life.

1169
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,140
Just three sandwiches a day?

1170
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,440
With sandwiches and chips.

1171
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:31,240
Three square sandwiches every single day?

1172
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:32,540
That is so fucking good.

1173
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:36,640
I also be the first maybe on a podcast to welcome Jimmy John's to New York City.

1174
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:39,280
Yes, for green ordering on Best Buy.

1175
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:41,100
They do it right there.

1176
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:43,460
Yes, they really do.

1177
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:46,460
I didn't know they didn't have Jimmy John's in.

1178
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,460
I thought Jimmy John's was a like a Jersey franchise.

1179
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,780
Oh, that's Jersey Mike.

1180
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:52,340
Wait, hold on.

1181
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:53,740
Yeah.

1182
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:57,380
That's fucking embarrassing as shit.

1183
01:09:57,380 --> 01:10:01,260
Can you can you imagine being the first morning radio?

1184
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:02,540
You realize you could do this?

1185
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:03,540
Got this shit and...

1186
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:06,540
Yeah, I always think about what was the first,

1187
01:10:06,540 --> 01:10:12,540
the first, like, noise that they put on a soundboard for, like, a stern or whatever.

1188
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:16,580
I mean, they were probably putting, like, Amber Alerts.

1189
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:20,460
They got all the utilities.

1190
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:22,940
Back then, all those children were getting kidnapped.

1191
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:28,140
The buttons used to only be for Amber Alerts and, like, weather reports and stuff like that.

1192
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:29,420
And then one guy was like...

1193
01:10:29,980 --> 01:10:32,380
A child has gone missing in Orange, New Jersey.

1194
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:33,380
[Gunshot]

1195
01:10:33,380 --> 01:10:36,780
[Laughter]

1196
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:39,180
Oh my God.

1197
01:10:39,180 --> 01:10:41,080
Tornado alert for your county.

1198
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,580
Oh my God!

1199
01:10:42,580 --> 01:10:45,080
[Laughter]
