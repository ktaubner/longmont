30
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,240
of years maybe I don't know ten years you're zero years old right now they're

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:00,240
and

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
It's orcish.

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:05,300
They came, they were coming through Ellis Island and like you know their last name was like

34
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:08,380
Piotr's or something and the guy was like "Nope, you're Gygax now."

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,380
Yeah right.

36
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,140
And they like tried to open like a butcher shop and everyone was like "Gygo bitch."

37
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,500
I like the guy inventing the dice, or like he's a dice maker and he sees this bespectacled

38
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:25,900
fellow walk by and he just like stops at six sides and he's like "But what if I..." and

39
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,100
he started adding one side and another side.

40
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,780
Yeah, he started, once he got to 20 he was like, "This is fucking perfect."

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,780
Yeah, this is, yeah.

42
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,780
That's enough.

43
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,780
That's enough.

44
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,780
That's the opus.

45
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,780
Yeah.

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,780
It's like I'm in my own Mona Lisa at this point.

47
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,780
Are there more dice sizes?

48
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,780
Is there a D100?

49
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,780
Yeah, there's like a D, there's a D30, there's a D100.

50
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,420
There's a D infinity, I have one.

52
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,420
That's called a ball?

53
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,420
Yeah, it's a ball that I rotate in my mind.

54
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,420
Yeah.

55
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,420
I want to see...

56
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Now I'm wondering who...

57
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,420
Development.

58
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:07,420
Ryan Dancy believed that the strength of the Dutchess and Dredd...

59
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,420
Alright, this is not...

60
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,420
I want to know who made the 20-sided die.

61
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,420
Who's the guy who did that?

62
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:12,420
That had to be like a peasant.

63
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,420
Mark Dice.

64
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,420
Yeah.

65
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,420
I was thinking about that the other day.

66
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,420
I was thinking about like chess and how old chess is

67
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:30,420
is and how funny is to imagine like Dwayne Chess playing with his friends as a kid and

68
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:37,100
like like they're like you know they're with the Sumerian beard it's all like pawns and

69
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,620
then Dwayne Chess is like well actually this guy's uh my guy's a knight here and he can

70
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,340
actually move like way further than the pawns and he's like a thousand times better so and

71
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,340
there's actually a bit from an Adam Sandler movie uh have you guys seen that one Netflix

72
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,700
Adam Sandler movie that's like the the western he did.

73
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,220
Oh, Reticulous 6 now.

74
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,660
Yeah, yeah, so they have a scene in that movie where it's like a guy inventing baseball and

75
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,420
it's just like a regular game where people are throwing around balls and he like starts

76
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,380
adding like more and more stuff to make himself win.

77
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,580
Yeah, that makes total sense.

78
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,580
That's a pretty good joke.

79
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,100
There's a couple genuinely good jokes in that movie.

80
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,820
Shout out to Adam Sandler.

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,540
Yeah, shout out to the Sandman.

82
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,220
the madman of manchester himself

83
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,080
and that is i feel like i'm most games get made though it's like

84
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,860
you make the game you're like oh i bet this would be fun to play with my

85
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,740
friends and he's are playing your friends are beating you and you're like

86
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,240
now hold on a second

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,900
yet so say that i didn't get the same in baseball too

88
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,040
and what is the interest in a baseball

89
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,880
well we all the you had that the mat

90
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,880
I thought you were just doing a weird thing.

91
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,880
No, no, no, no.

92
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,880
You've never seen basketball?

93
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,880
He's auditioning to be one of the accounts

94
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,880
that runs John D. Sun's account.

95
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,880
So he's trying out some mispronunciations and spellings.

96
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,880
That was one of my favorite movies as a kid.

97
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
Basketball.

98
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,880
So, hold on. The D20, the earliest one ever found

99
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,880
dates back to 300 B.C.

100
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
I told you, dude.

101
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,880
Roughly around the time of

102
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
Ptolemy won

103
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:18,880
and

104
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,880
Alexander the Great, began the Ptolemaic dynasty in Egypt.

105
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,020
It's one of those words where it's like pterodactyl, right?

106
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,020
- Yeah.

107
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,860
- The die remains a remarkable condition

108
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,320
despite the passage of time

109
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,720
and displays clear numerals written in Greek.

110
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,640
- Damn.

111
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,480
- Damn.

112
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,300
So it's been around for a while.

113
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,840
- That's older than I thought it was gonna be,

114
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,560
but I knew it was gonna be something old.

115
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,960
- I thought they made it for Dungeons and Dragons.

116
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,240
- Well, they did.

117
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,960
They just had a different name for it back then.

118
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,880
- Yeah.

119
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,640
- They called it a D20-es.

120
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,140
Yeah.

121
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:55,540
Yeah.

122
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,540
Well back that the thing is back then they had the d20 but they

123
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,640
said they hadn't invented numbers past 6 yet.

124
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,940
So it's still a six-sided die.

125
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,640
They still use it like a six-sided die.

126
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,140
They were just rolling if I came up a number above six, they

127
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,040
would just roll it again.

128
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,140
Right where they would make up a number and that's how they

129
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,040
would make up stuff.

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,240
That's that's how they started to get more numbers was they

131
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,240
It must have been so fun being able to just make shit up.

132
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
You can't make shit up anymore.

133
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,240
I always feel like it would be, it was probably really scary.

134
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,240
Cause like, the reason why they were like, a volcano would explode and they'd be like,

135
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,240
I guess someone who's a lot bigger than me is angry.

136
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Like, I can't possibly imagine why this would happen to me and everyone I know and love.

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:07:01,800
the

138
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:08,800
one

139
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:23,800
the

140
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,800
the

141
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
by an acre of miasma hitting building 7.

142
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Yeah, right.

143
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah, the building went PU and then went down.

144
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
Yeah.

145
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
That's right, of course.

146
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,800
I mean, that's the official, that's on the official record for that.

147
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Mm-hmm.

148
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:45,800
You read any book about what happened in 2001, they talk about the miasma.

149
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah.

150
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I went to Miasma recently and I was just like, "This shit stinks."

151
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
You know?

152
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
"This shit smells awful."

153
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,760
I'm just imagining like the an almanac for the year 2001 and it's just like the way I

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,520
can imagine it being written like yeah January 3rd okay a lot of stuff happened um it just

155
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,840
I just want to let you know and we're gonna keep going there's a day where it gets weird

156
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,360
it's like the next page it's like all right just letting you know a few couple hundred

157
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,920
pages down it's gonna there's something it's like what is that year except that like that

158
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:30,480
day I guess I mean like the yeah I was like five I don't remember yeah I remember

159
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:39,160
getting pulled out of school that day. What did you do? I got in trouble no I got pulled out of

160
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,560
school because my mom was freaking the fuck out yeah yeah right I saw this I

161
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,600
don't know I saw this Slipknot interview video because they they had an album that

162
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,280
came out like in um august right before 9/11 and they were like i think touring during 9/11

163
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,840
and there's like an interview with Corey Taylor where he's like where they're like so like how's

164
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,560
the tour going he's like you know like tour's been great except for what happened on September 11th

165
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:13,600
and it just keeps talking like god like the idea that that was that's how some people probably

166
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,320
thought of it just like oh yeah i guess that they sucked but well before it was before it was

167
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,960
mythologized. It's the thing about Zack Snyder that like just came up a couple days ago on twitter

168
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,400
of like Zack Snyder being like yo everyone like put on your 9/11 face yeah yeah yeah yeah

169
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,760
sad scene. Well it's like before it was like a mythologized event yeah it was like a thing that

170
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,760
happened i guess you know i mean it was pretty freaky you know i don't know i was a kid but like

171
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:49,760
it was also just like yeah that was so fucked i mean yeah it's probably the same way that we

172
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,040
talk about like the fucking mandalay bay shooting or whatever now it was awesome

173
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:03,040
the show went crazy and everybody is listening right now who can clearly remember it and wants

174
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,840
to tell us about um about like what they're doing on that day you're too old to be listening this

175
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Yeah, what were the vibes?

176
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Your 40 year old fans are like, "I remember exactly where I was."

177
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Yeah. I was at Cameron's house.

178
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm Cameron's mom.

179
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,840
Yeah, it's great that she still listens.

180
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,840
Yeah.

181
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,840
No, she doesn't. Don't you worry about that.

182
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,840
No, if anybody, it's my mom. It's probably listening.

183
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,840
Patrick's entire extended family.

184
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,840
Yeah.

185
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,840
Yeah, you get the graph charts back for listeners and there's like a door in contingency.

186
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:45,200
Yeah, my dad recently, when I was in the car with my dad recently, he told me that he wants

187
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,720
to start a podcast now.

188
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
Fuck yes.

189
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,160
He wants to start it with his brother and his cousin and he wants to tell stories about

190
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
their childhood.

191
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,320
My brother, my cousin and me.

192
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,960
Yeah, that's good.

193
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,720
I'll secure that for a day.

194
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,080
I told him that if he if he really wanted to do it, I would like give him my audio recorder

195
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,440
and help figure out how to do it. I don't think he's going to but I mean that's just like a nice

196
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,440
idea of just them talking to each other and talking about life. It'd be a really funny thing to add to

197
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:21,080
the universe of this though. You guys have his uncle and his family. You guys become like you

198
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:27,880
guys are to have the pot about list like family of podcasts. Exactly that's the move. Instead of

199
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,120
the MBMBAM thing where they each have like five podcasts with their wife we can have like a

200
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,880
a podcast with our uncle too. Yeah. Oh, that'd be amazing. Yeah.

201
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
It really well. I was just, I was,

202
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,320
I was going through the Rolodex of uncles right now.

203
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,000
Who would I want to talk to that often? There's, I have a couple I dig,

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,240
you know, you guys got any uncles?

205
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:56,720
You can make an uncle. I am an uncle, so I could just,

206
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,120
I could start a podcast with my nephews,

207
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,120
my three-year-old nephew. Oh, yeah, you should listen to my

208
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,280
uncle's podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you're that would just

209
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,400
be your nephew just saying swear words to you that you taught

210
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,520
them. It's true. The whole every episode would just be a I don't

211
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:20,360
want to teach them new ones. I don't teach them swear words.

212
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,640
Patrick mentally attacks his nephews. I don't mentally attack my nephew. He goes up to them and goes like,

213
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:31,800
hey i if you if you touch my hat you're gonna go to hell upstairs and he plays

214
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:36,600
his video games it's not what i'm sending cyan like psionic blasts at his nephew no

215
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,040
i'll try to think i'll try to think of things to make them stop doing he's doing he's doing

216
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,080
the drunk guy

217
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:53,640
no the cia like have you read chaos no i've heard like some [ __ ] like mk ultra style

218
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,800
shit to Charles Manson but I'm pretty sure that Patrick's been recreating that

219
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:05,040
with his nephews. Yeah right. I just remember in like November my nephew

220
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,360
learned the word piss probably because I said it with an earshot of him but he...

221
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,400
Yeah the probably is doing a lot of work there. Yeah. I think maybe you said it to him.

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,160
I might have said it. No I don't think I don't teach him swear words he just

223
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,800
learns. I think he might have like, kicked on the bathroom door while he was in there and go "are

224
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:36,040
you pissing in there?" Maybe. But he like stood up on the table, he was like trying to just make me

225
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,600
laugh and he stood up on the table and went "my penis is piss! My penis is piss!" And then he would

226
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:48,840
just scream it. I can still do that at 24. I'm gonna start doing that to my friends. I live alone,

227
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,840
I'm just gonna do that.

228
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
My penis is piss!

229
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,840
Trying to impress my friends

230
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,840
with the swear words that I learned from them.

231
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,840
[laughter]

232
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,840
Oh man.

233
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,840
I'm just texting Will like, "Yo, you guys

234
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,840
would not believe this, like, swear

235
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,840
word that I just learned."

236
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Just sending him like five texts that just say "fuck."

237
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,840
That was a huge

238
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,840
moment as a child, though, learning swear

239
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,840
words from your older cousins.

240
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Learning, like,

241
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:24,300
Like, sorry to interrupt you, but fucking the first time I ever heard crap on TV was

242
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,520
out of Jimmy's head.

243
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,440
Do you remember that movie or that show?

244
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,800
No, no.

245
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,920
I think we made it up, dude.

246
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,600
No, no, no, no.

247
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,960
It's a Cartoon Network show.

248
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,720
It was a Cartoon Network show about a kid who gets a traumatic brain injury and they

249
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:43,640
replace it with like their world's version of Walt Disney with his brain.

250
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,960
Because he gets like Hitler.

251
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,320
Yeah.

252
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,600
So Hitler, so this kid gets Hitler's brain put into his head.

253
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,200
What?

254
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,800
But then he can just see like the cartoon creations that like

255
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,480
they're like Walt Disney made.

256
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,400
And there's a scene.

257
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,320
It's fucking the hands of Orlec, but for kids.

258
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,520
Yeah, pretty much.

259
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,840
And he's like, there's a scene where they're playing basketball

260
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,000
and like his friend is like, Oh, cause he has like their Walt

261
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,760
Disney's brain.

262
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,360
So now he's like, okay, I'm going to make all the new cartoons.

263
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,680
So he gets famous because of that.

264
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,160
And the kids like you're being a really crappy friend right now.

265
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:20,960
Yo, this is on Cartoon Network at 8 at night.

266
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,160
What the fuck?

267
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,260
Rap is like an eight-year-old.

268
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,660
You're just a what the fuck?

269
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,860
As a as like, you know, like a quiet shy afraid to break the

270
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,160
rules kid crap was such a huge one, you know as something that

271
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,160
like, you know, you can make your parents mad but not like

272
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,860
you don't like to mad.

273
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:42,760
Yeah, exactly.

274
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:50,480
I remember being really cheeky with curse words like when I first learned "fuck" and I was

275
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
like asking my parents about that.

276
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,200
I was like, "The word 'fuck' and like don't ever say that."

277
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,200
And I remember being like, "Don't!"

278
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,520
This was two weeks ago to be clear.

279
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,840
I was like, "So don't say the word 'fuck'."

280
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,120
My mom just like gave me such a fucking shitty look and I was like, "Alright, alright."

281
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,240
I wasn't allowed to say sucks like this sucks. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah

282
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:21,000
I mean I swore a bunch as a kid

283
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm being some insane words into your head for most. Yeah, we uh my house it was like, um, yeah, no sucks

284
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,560
Uh, no crap. Um, no damn like everything like like if it even was slightly

285
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:44,760
On Couth we can say did your rude did your parents tell you that like when you were a kid and you said like fuck or

286
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,960
Shit or whatever. It's like did they tell you like you can't say that till you're 18

287
00:16:47,960 --> 00:17:04,860
That's crazy, no, I didn't wait it got to a point where it was just like I think they just gave up on like yeah

288
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:11,180
Policing our language and I was just like saying fucking shit all the time if you're old enough to swear you're old enough to die

289
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:15,460
For your country. Yeah, it's true. What are you gonna say when you get shot?

290
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:25,940
It's so fucked up you can join the armory at 18, but you can't swear till you're 21

291
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,900
Like

00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,140
Real sergeant calls you a bitch and you can't even say anything bad, right? Yeah, it's so fucking join the army

294
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:49,220
You're 30 and you don't live in your mom's house. Yeah, just like a guy who's just like

295
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:56,460
It's just purposefully it's not did by his parents and he's like dude. It's honestly so fucked up what we do to other countries

It's but also I can't I can't watch movies

297

Yeah

298
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:02,580
It's so fucked up that you can like join the army at 18

299
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:07,940
But I can't watch movies at full volume in the middle of the night move out of my mom like what is that?

300
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,140
Yeah, I just remember like when my mom would tell me I can't say the swear words until I was 18

301
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:19,020
I just remember like having the thought like just as a kid like just sitting on the couch with my dad

302
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,020
Just looking at him going fuck

303
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:23,620
like hanging out.

304
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,820
I'm blown up son.

305
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,420
That's like the well-adjusted child version of like being like

306
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,420
what if I threw this person out of the car right now.

307
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,620
Right, right.

308
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,620
Wait, that's like the same as like think like, oh, I'm

309
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,420
going to have a beer with my dad.

310
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:47,620
Like, I'm going to sit on the couch and say swear words with

311
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:47,920
him.

312
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,980
it's like sun

313
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,080
and the uh... he just son you know what

314
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,380
the cure old enough now and he like a a_t_t_ hands you like a piece of paper

315
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,980
with a curse on it he's a little inward past year

316
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,700
that what do you have to have

317
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,940
so i don't want to say yes i i don't know i need to know that i have to tell

318
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,060

319
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,260
that's it

320
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:25,020
Yeah, yeah, even he was sort of what he gave it to me. He was like, I don't know if we could still be doing this, but he gave it to me and I was going to give it to you.

321
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,520
Imagine how awkward...

322
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Do you remember hearing about great uncle Cornelius? He fought in the Civil War? He got a hair and it's just been danced out ever since.

323
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:39,320
Imagine how awkward it would be if you lost your n-word pass and you didn't want anybody to know that you lost it.

324
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,320
Because you'd be like, "Oh, I'm going to take a... I'm going to be good. Go take a walk downtown."

325
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,420
Have you like seen something that might have like fallen out of my wallet?

326
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,420
I might need and they're like, what do you need?

327
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,420
Why do you need it for?

328
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,620
It's like, oh, no, no, I'm just going downtown.

329
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:54,320
I just like to have it on me.

330
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,520
Just like a family heirloom and it's like an n-word pass

331
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,120
and you're like, yeah, I just it's really important to my family.

332
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,020
Oh, what does it look like?

333
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,420
It looks like a piece of paper.

334
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,420
It says some art.

335
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,620
To some people, yeah.

336
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,620
I'm not going to use it.

337
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:12,620
I just need to know where it is.

338
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:19,620
we were cleaning out my granddad's attic and we found this old chest full of n-word pastes

339
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,980
we're billionaires

340
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:31,940
now you're just giving away the gun city episodes

341
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,860
i was at this uh... i went to this record store the other day

342
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,380
and i like i was just like looking around i think i was looking for like

343
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,460
something to hang on my wall, like something to like put in like a record frame or whatever,

344
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,220
hang it up. But I was looking, there's like this, I think it was on Bleaker Street,

345
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,420
there's like two record stores that were like down the block from each other. And I went to this one,

346
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,220
they didn't have it. And then I went to this other one, there's a dude in the front door

347
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:03,500
and he like, I realize now he was probably like a lookout. Because like, it was this record store,

348
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,100
just like shit was just everywhere. It's just like one of those ones where it's like,

349
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,260
You can't look through anything. It's just like the owner is just a pack rat.

350
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:16,780
And I walked in, the guy greeted me, he was like, "Hello sir, how are you?"

351
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,460
And I was like, "Oh, he's got a bodyguard."

352
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,660
[Laughter]

353
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,540
The guy's like a 5'6" Italian man.

354
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:24,780
Right.

355
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,020
[Crosstalk]

356
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,540
He was pretty dangerous.

357
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,780
Yeah, he was in a suit too, so I was like, "Oh, okay."

358
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:38,220
But I walked in and the guy, it's like way back at the store, the guy's like waving at me.

359
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,620
And I was like, "Oh, okay." And he's like, "How are you today?" I was like, "All right, I'm good."

360
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:48,060
And then I went down, I was like closer to the register and I realized he's just smoking a

361
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:54,700
cigarette indoors. He was just like, like I just caught him just smoking a cigarette.

362
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,900
It's like oh, that's okay. That's what I

363
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:06,560
Probably I had my headphones in - and I just walked in I probably should have like stopped and talked to the guy

364
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,560
But like I just walked ahead

365
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,980
It's not like like

366
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,540
If I was going into a store, I would not see someone outside and be like, hey is the owner like smoking

367
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:28,660
a bodyguard in a suit is so sick just a bodyguard I think he was just a friend

368
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:37,700
having a very close bodyguard bodyguard that your friends with and it's yeah is

369
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,420
also very cool it was so funny like nobody in that store was like wearing

370
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,780
masks oh yeah I mean that's not the store where that happens right no that's

371
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,300
a store where the guy owns it smokes inside yeah yeah yeah I think that might

372
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
just been a guy's apartment that you were in.

373
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
Honestly, it could have been.

374
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
It seriously could have been. I wouldn't doubt it.

375
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
Did you find anything cool?

376
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
No, I didn't.

377
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,300
I was looking for something specific and I didn't want to like

378
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
go through.

379
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,300
I was looking for cigarettes.

380
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:10,300
What were you looking for?

381
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
I was looking for like a Prefab Sprout record.

382
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Put it on the wall.

383
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
They're awesome.

384
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
You talked a lot about them

385
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,940
them and I checked them out I think I said this to you like they're fucking yeah

386
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:25,100
oh yeah this is like two episodes in a row where I've talked about them

387
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:31,660
yeah they're really really good yeah I just want I think that Steve McQueen album cover would be

388
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:36,860
or the swoon one maybe would be good to hang on the wall yeah if I could find either of those

389
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:42,220
I remember I walked into it I went to the the first record store I went to the guy was like oh yeah I

390
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:46,780
think I saw one of those I was thinking the other day if anybody remembered them and I was like oh

391
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:52,900
what like you're like what do you mean pretty seminal you accidentally

392
00:23:52,900 --> 00:24:01,780
triggered a flashback in that yeah dream sequence chimes like you got like this

393
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:06,660
close to MK ultra activating someone yeah he just walks out of the storage

394
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:12,660
like yeah is this the guy who owns it or is this the guy who might have been

395
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,740
there yeah he might have been the owner I don't know yeah I like the idea of him

396
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,540
Leaving the store and just like I need a fucking cigarette just like I'm thinking about pre-fab sprout

397
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:25,900
Reaction from anybody when you like in a store and you ask about something is so funny like, huh?

398
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,380
You know, I haven't heard of that in a while. It's like getting that right like

399
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:37,220
Like some fucking SVU character like like yeah at you're asking them about like a dead body or whatever

400
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,240
Yeah, do you remember this employee? Oh, yeah

401
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:48,180
Last night you got a I hop and like that you or and the waiter has like an eye patch and a cigarette

402
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,840
It's like oh, yeah the funny face pancake

403
00:24:50,840 --> 00:25:00,180
Monster

404
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,380
Yeah, I got silver dollars

405
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,700
I'm willing to spend on something

406
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,940
Yeah, I would love to be I would love to just like haunted Denny's and yeah

407
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,100
Yeah become just like I was thinking about that because you could become a like McDonald's guy

408
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:24,100
That's what I call those you're in the city now Pat. So you you you have exposure to this for sure where they're like just

409
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:30,500
Regular, is that like a McDonald's? Yes, I mean these are everywhere in the world, but like I've been in Manhattan and in Brooklyn

410
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,140
mostly Manhattan

411
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,860
I always remember like

412
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:39,300
Like walking by McDonald's and like going to work and like seeing the same three guys and I'm like that's I mean

413
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,500
I know that might not be good

414
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,580
But I also like I'm interested in that lifestyle of like chilling at a fast-food joint becoming like a McDonald's guy

415
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,260
Well, that's you do the same thing in like a small town

416
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,280
Yeah

417
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,620
I remember it like we used to end up at the 24-hour McDonald's like all the time would get like super high and just buy

418
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,460
An ice cream cone. Oh my god, just a cone. Yeah, just

419
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:07,380
the cone I would eat the cone. This is embarrassing to admit but when you said like haunted Denny's

420
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:13,020
I thought you meant like after you die. Oh yeah I would want to do that too. Denny's

421
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,540
is like the fast food restaurant where people would be like most susceptible to hauntings

422
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:24,780
you think? Yeah. I mean you go there at like 3am with like 10 friends and then one person

423
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:30,060
says I think I saw a ghost because everyone just got really cold in here for a second.

424
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,060
Yeah and if like...

425
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,620
It's the possessed Denny's.

426
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:37,860
But honestly though if like a Denny's was haunted and like a salt shaker just fell over on its

427
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,580
own or something like the table moved I wouldn't like I'd just be like oh yeah this just happens

428
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,580
here.

429
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,580
Yeah right.

430
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:44,580
It's just something that happens in this fucking house.

431
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,580
It's just the haunted Denny's.

432
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,580
Yeah.

433
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,620
Oh yeah that's the haunted one right?

434
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,620
Yeah yeah yeah.

435
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:55,620
I must just be getting like contact hallucinations from the guy sitting behind me.

436
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:01,940
Do you ever see like there are those, I mean I think there's like actually like a Twitter

437
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,660
account that does that where it's like I think McDonald's specifically and it shows like

438
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,660
the weird McDonald's that are out there.

439
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:12,860
I think it'd be cool if there was just like a similar one for every fast food chain.

440
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,940
So it's like oh yeah here's the Denny's that is, used to be a pet shop and so it's the pet

441
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,940
shop Denny's.

442
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:22,620
I would love to see all the weird ones that are out there for different fast food chains.

443
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,420
Denny's, I feel like you're going to have some, I feel like maybe the outside of the

444
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:33,180
Denny's aren't going to be that interesting, but I feel like maybe like an account that

445
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:39,260
like posts what they find in the carpet of Denny's might be. That's pretty good.

446
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,300
I'm sure there's a Denny's where you like you rip up the carpet and there's like a chalk

447
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,980
outline under there. Yeah. Yeah. Asbestos. Yeah. Yeah. I want

448
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,260
like a bar graph breakdown of just like the substances cuz

449
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,060
you know, that's where they're that's where they're gonna find

450
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:57,740
like like like debris from another planet or something.

451
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,980
Yeah. It's like the government. It's over the **** like UFO.

452
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,860
You're gonna see the you're gonna see the color out of

453
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:07,740
space underneath the Denny's floorboards. You're gonna like

454
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,500
you're gonna you're gonna see the some of this the shit from the aliens in

455
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,380
arrival not around what's no it is it a rival is that the one where you have to

456
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,260
where you have to read and it's fun yeah yeah that but that is will be the best

457
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,980
way to cover because no no conspiracy theorist is gonna try to look into

458
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,460
Denny's for like a like an alien skeleton they're all like wasting their

459
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,460
time

460
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:47,460
this

461
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,860
This toothy broad yeah, they just mean what they're getting ahead at Denny's when they should be getting ahead at Denny's

462
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,860
And that's kind of what I'm trying to build

463
00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:03,740
You're too concerned about your pancake stacks you're not concerned enough about your paper stacks

464
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,460
That's right. The paper stacks having all the conspiracy theories on yep, right? Yeah

465
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,220
Mmm, the paper trail the paper trail. There we go

466
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:18,500
Yeah, and not the paper trail. Oh, yeah, I like that

467
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:27,120
What was the first conspiracy theory that you guys were were like exposed to Oh Paul is dead. Oh

468
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,740
Yeah, yeah, definitely that. Oh, I watched a I got the shit scared out of me when I was like 10

469
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,260
Because I watched one of those and I got like like there was some like music sting and it was just me in like my basement

470
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:43,940
alone, I was just watching it on the family computer just like

471
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,660
What like the basement got too quiet while I was watching it

472
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:52,460
I was like what the fuck and I said what the fudge yeah cursing

473
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:56,140
Yeah, but like my brother walked downstairs or something. I turn her like

474
00:29:56,140 --> 00:30:03,860
Yeah, I thought I saw Paul it's like it's like you look to look away too fast at the screen

475
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,740
Yeah, my brother's named Paul - oh really

476
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:11,780
It's probably 9/11 stuff for me just because of the yeah, yeah

477
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:18,180
Yeah, it could also have been like Nazi occultism stuff because I was into hellboy when I was younger and yeah

478
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,180
I did in that movie and stuff

479
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:27,400
Nazi cultism was also like real like they just I don't to that shit that it's so not it's literally so scary, dude

480
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,060
It's like the most evil people on earth for all yeah, like black magic

481
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,660
Yeah, so come on that's you on the yeah

482
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,200
It is funny to imagine that we think of it all like oh

483
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,820
They were like like boiling children in vats and doing like dark movies over it

484
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,040
They're probably just wearing like party city robes and right rolling right?

485
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:48,760
Yeah, like that's probably what it was the classic party city

486
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,680
establishment in Weimar Germany

487
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:58,540
It's like one of those like have you ever parties that McDonald's it's like the McDonald's logo. I think it's a KFC

488
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:02,720
I don't know but like behind it. There's like the outline of an Iron Eagle

489
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,680
Party City is just a club in Berlin now

490
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:12,720
Yeah, it's like it's like Burgheim yeah

491
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:24,680

Oh my god, who gave Heinrich the lightsaber you are looking crazy right now

494
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:03,040
Okay, everybody turn off the lights off so we could see the lightsaber better

495
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:08,280
Turns the lights off

496
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:19,060
All the lights off and we are going to have a big lightsaber fight

497
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,840
I love this green saber, you know, like, you know, the green sabers the good one, right? He's like

Okay, let's get France in here he's going to play some beats for everybody, okay

499
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:55,160
Nazis were actually doing black magic to summon Palpatine to our dimension

500
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:59,720
We are going to

501
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,080

502
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:09,840
We are going to we are going to take Palpatine and we are going to make him our father

503
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:22,680
Yeah, they were building pod racers they thought they were like UFO shit, but it was all that was the end goal of Volkswagen

504
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:30,280
Yeah, that's what the beetle looks like that

505
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:40,920
General Grievous is made of all everything in these his stuff is made of IBM parts

506
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,060
It is so funny to imagine like, you know

507
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:53,000
Maybe like like Nazi occultist like LARPers back then in the like Thule Society or whatever like wearing their big robes and like goofing around

508
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,920
And like they're like saying all these incantations and then just one of them just accidentally does Sith lightning

509
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
And there's like oh shit, okay, stop stop stop

510
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,920
No, okay, that's way too scary

511
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
*laughter*

512
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
It's like they accidentally like

513
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:09,920
They summon like a like a leg of a demon that's like *weird noises*

514
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
Just like fucking freaking like and they're like, okay, okay, okay, okay

515
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,920
Okay, okay

516
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,200
I have read Icarus. Okay, I don't want this to happen to me

517
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:30,680
You've done force lightning on helmet and now he looks like he looks like a big lizard in his face

518
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,940
Germans saying how do you say and then saying a German word?

519
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,480
How do you say this schattenfreude

520
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:46,480
right

521
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,320
yeah

522
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,640
man

523
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,600
well yeah i think i think for me the first conspiracy theory

524
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,560
was and i guess this is also a retake

525
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,240
and i also don't do i guess i never looked into it is like is area fifty one

526
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,600
like a real thing

527
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,800
yet is there a reason to be a place yet so i'd like

528
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,880
don't know

529
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,360
groom right ok

530
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,780
so i guess that was probably the first one

531
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:12,500
so from area fifty one

532
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:19,500
yes i think that he has a little green mom actually

533
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,820
there was no

534
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:25,280
there was no

535
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,760
uh... and i'm not saying that i think it was because of the like

536
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,920
that uh... you kinda are so i would i would have stopped by the side

537
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,480
saying i know your parents height

538
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,560
i was thinking like i hate

539
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,520
yeah that's true i'm fully out of that's the i'm not half i was thinking like

540
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,200
i think it's because of the arcade game the area fifty one arcade game do you

541
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,240
remember that you might remember that she had no i thought that was the

542
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,240
coolest fucking there was a very cool i was afraid to play i guess i get i was

543
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,700
a thing my mom will be played the gun arcade games

544
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,520
oh yeah

545
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,860
you know parents are very strict against like

546
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,020
like i was a little bit

547
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,700
and games but not like first-person shooters because they like this this is

548
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,040
this one's others list of the lives are off

549
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,980
it was i remember seeing that and just there was the coolest shit in the world

550
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,380
yeah it's all f_m_d_ that's so funny

551
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,060
yeah we've got to make sense honestly like as far as the things to restrict

552
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,680
your kids like

553
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,640
i'm not i'm not saying like you know obviously you're you're what like

554
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,860
forty five patches that you can play a little bit about that

555
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:30,020
but he said that's what he said i was a little bit about that

556
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:34,660
if there's a lot of laughing because it's absurd to say that i'm older than

557
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:38,780
whatever show up at the with

558
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:42,460
it is a huge honor to like restrict your kids from like probably the one where

559
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:45,340
they pretend to actually shoot actual people

560
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,140
yeah is a good girl well i do resent my parents forever that now i'm not really

561
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,220
good at like

562
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,620
warzone well i have to leave the right choice probably i have on brian rachel

563
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:59,100
them for not letting me play FPSs that much.

564
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,820
I play a lot now so I can practice for whatever's to come.

565
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:08,340
We can see what happens when you get back from the war if you still want to play Borderlands.

566
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,420
I could just play whatever.

567
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:14,300
I think it was like my mom would just bring home games or we would just get them second

568
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,300
hand from our cousins or something.

569
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,900
Cousin games rock.

570
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,580
I think I got...

571
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,660
My mom brought home Ribbit King one day.

572
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,020
It's not like a violent game, but like, that.

573
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,520
That puts thoughts in your brain.

574
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,720
Yeah, that one, that game is fucked up.

575
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,240
I've been playing it a lot with my roommates.

576
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,240
It's so good.

577
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
Yeah.

578
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,680
I'm looking at it right now.

579
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,840
I just played Kirby's Dream Land for Game Boy.

580
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Great game.

581
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Just over and over and over and over and over.

582
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,840
I played Nightmare in Dream Land.

583
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:52,160
I remember my mother and I had like a Game Boy Advance that we shared and the only game

584
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,800
we had was Nightmare in Dreamland. I remember what would always happen is he would want to play and

585
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,720
then he would get to like the bosses which are like wildly easy compared to like any other game

586
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,600
because it's Kirby. He'd always be like I can't I can't fucking do this man I need you to beat

587
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:11,760
the boss for me. Yeah those game those bosses in Kirby games I mean I guess it depends on the

588
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,160
Kirby game but Nightmare in Dreamland I remember in particular it's like all of them were hackable

589
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,760
like you could just like if it's the tree one you just jump up in like one part if it's the

590
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:25,920
fucked up flying guy you just have to watch out when it goes slow. One of the biggest childhood

591
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,440
ruin moments for me is like go like playing that Kirby games again as an adult being like oh I

592
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,920
wasn't good at games as a kid yeah I was just playing the game that was for kids who don't

593
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,880
know how to play games. Yeah that was me with uh Kingdom Hearts realizing just how like the Riku

594
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,760
battle wasn't as hard as I yeah it was. I remember I fucking like it was my younger brother's birthday

595
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,440
And my sister, like, we were stuck on-

596
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,920
We didn't know, like, the Keyblades did different things.

597
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,200
We just thought it was all, like, aesthetic.

598
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,240
And, uh, like, like, power-ups and shit.

599
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,800
Right, right.

600
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,120
Yeah, we didn't know that, like, you should, like, stack abilities or whatever.

601
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:03,680
Like, it was-

602
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,200
We didn't fucking play RPGs.

603
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,400
You were like, kids.

604
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:06,960
Exactly.

605
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,480
So, my sister, like, figured out how to beat Riku, and we finally got past that.

606
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,880
And then, um, fucking, I don't know how it happened, but the save game got deleted.

607
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,480
Or, like, she didn't save or something.

608
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,480
something

609
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:34,480
that

610
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,480
it

611
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:47,320
Like watching your siblings places like when she be reekoo we're all like holy fuck like we're always gonna be the parts.

612
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:47,880
Yeah.

613
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:57,000
And then like we just couldn't we couldn't we couldn't figure out how to beat it and then Kingdom Hearts 2 came out and we're like okay well we'll just play Kingdom Hearts 2.

614
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:11,240
I remember like I started replaying more JRPGs like that I played when I was a kid and I was yeah I was completely shocked that like I was like that's not if I just paid any attention to anything I was doing.

615
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:18,240
the

616
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:33,240
is

617
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:40,160
Dancing on the moon. Oh, yeah, I mean, yo, Majora's Mask was so hard when I was oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we call my god

618
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,520
I remember I got Majora's Mask for 3ds and I need that in like 2018 and I like told my mom I was like

619
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,360
Oh, yeah, I beat Majora's Mask. She's like no you fucking didn't

620
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,560
She was like no you didn't prove it and I was like, okay

621
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,040
You just sit down in the kitchen and just play you play through the whole game

622
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:07,760
With her watching it's like the next morning other members your family come down and they're like, hey, what do you shut up? Shut up?

623
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,380
It's almost done. It's almost done. Yeah

624
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:19,400
Also, I just I just got it right at all

625
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,360
I just got morrowind again and like I remember playing that as a kid and

626
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:28,820
Like the first thing I didn't in there when I first played morrowind is they like you create your character

627
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,500
and then they let you do whatever you want.

628
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,980
But you have to, it's an Elder Scrolls game,

629
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,460
and particularly the older ones,

630
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,780
you know, it's like you have to read

631
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,940
to know where you're going.

632
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,420
And so I just ran out,

633
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:41,420
and just one of those little worm things

634
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,940
followed me for like two towns and then killed me.

635
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,500
And then I just put down the game.

636
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,620
And so I play it again now,

637
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,420
and I'm like, oh, there's directions,

638
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,940
and there's like, I gotta go buy the giant bug.

639
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:54,020
- Yeah, I can't, it still looks great.

640
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,820
I just have something in my brain

641
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,940
that doesn't let me do games like that.

642
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,780
I don't know what it is.

643
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,240
I'm just so stupid when it comes to get like,

644
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,460
I remember when I finally got like a PC

645
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,780
that could run Skyrim.

646
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,740
'Cause like, I remember the fucking like

647
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,300
the marketing cycle for Skyrim was insane.

648
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,140
- Oh yeah, there was like--

649
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:12,140
- Like they had TV ads every fucking like,

650
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,820
like just like, like 10 times a day.

651
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,100
They were so cool.

652
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,780
Like my friends were all talking about it.

653
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:20,140
I didn't have, like I had like a MacBook,

654
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,460
like, and yeah, no console or anything.

655
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,140
Like fuck, like just played it one time

656
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:26,560
at my friend's house on Xbox

657
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,480
and we would just like mess around

658
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,600
and get hit by the giants a bunch, you know?

659
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,800
And then like finally, like, okay, I have a PC,

660
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,640
I can play it now.

661
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,200
And then like loaded it up and then like accidentally

662
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,280
aggroed like tutorial NPC immediately

663
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,040
and then like attacked me.

664
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,960
And then I like ran to the next town

665
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,200
and he just chased me forever.

666
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,120
And I didn't get to like finish the tutorial

667
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:49,400
or like advance in the game.

668
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,560
I'm just like, all right, I'm never playing this game.

669
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,400
- Yeah, I did that with a Fallout 3.

670
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:59,120
like I just didn't understand, like it was the first time I'd ever played a game like that.

671
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:03,880
Because like I just remember like the Fallout 3, I think one of my friends had the

672
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,200
Power Armor for his Xbox avatar.

673
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,280
I should definitely check this game out if my friend has the Power Armor.

674
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,960
Oh yeah, the decisions you made when you were that age were always awesome.

675
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:18,080
Yeah. Right, so I got Fallout 3 and I just had like my first ever playthrough was

676
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,600
just the most evil

677
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,480
character I've ever like had in a video game. Megaton, yeah.

678
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,480
Oh yeah yeah yeah, I did. I tried to...

679
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,480
I went back to that. Go for it.

680
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:35,480
Oh sorry. I just, I tried to break into the armory in Megaton, and I just like, fucked up the whole game for me.

681
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:43,480
I was at, I had like, so much evil karma that like, as soon as I figured out how to play the game, I was like, oh I can't fix this.

682
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,480
It's like in real life.

683
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:46,980
Right.

684
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,980
done so much bad shit and I didn't know that everyone wouldn't like me and now

685
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:56,500
that I'm thinking about it I have no friends this is a problem yeah that whole

686
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:00,420
like Megaton choice like going but at the time like you know playing fallout 3 in

687
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,260
seventh grade it was like holy shit like I can be evil I can like it's a

688
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:08,220
hilarious choice so I have this nuke and then going I like replayed some fallout

689
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,100
3 like last year at some point going back to it's just like he's like hey you

690
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:17,620
want to fucking blow up this town for no reason. Yeah, in the game too, it's like you can get

691
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:26,020
$500 or to blow up this town or you can just sort of make sure everyone has water. Yeah,

692
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:32,620
it's like, it's like, like the choice is, is fucking hilarious. I remember to exploiting

693
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:37,580
the bat system. So like, you know, like 10 penny that guy up there with the sniper. So

694
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:40,480
me and my friends found a way to like get him to

695
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:45,380
we would what we would do is we would fall we would aggro

696
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:45,980
everybody.

697
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,980
So then there was like all these guys like trying to kill

698
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,780
us and then I would be at we would be up on the tower or

699
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:53,180
10 penny is jump down.

700
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:56,280
And if you do vats right before you land after falling off

701
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:59,280
the tower against somebody you do like land on the ground

702
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,680
and then just hit them with the fucking melee weapon and

703
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,080
not take any fall damage.

704
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:07,180
So you can just do like yeah, it was so fun and

705
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:11,940
Bugs in games are cool though. Yeah and I mean fucking Fallout's all bugs.

706
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,460
It's more bug than man. Moral choice in a video game is so funny because it's always like

707
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:23,380
the way that it's like like like they never really give you any good benefits

708
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:27,020
for being evil or anything they just know that like the people who are playing

709
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:32,140
the game are gamers. Like yeah, people are gonna be like we don't need to like add any

710
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:35,980
benefit to this we know. Yeah you could just get like a cool gun or something

711
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,980
That's it.

712
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,480
Yo, do you want to shoot red lightning or blue lightning?

713
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:44,420
Right as far as it's literally like, it's the same for like if an 11 year old is playing

714
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,340
the game or like a 30 year old is.

715
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,580
Like it's still, it's just there's some gamer like neuron in the brain that's just like

716
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:53,020
"Oh yeah, I have to be evil."

717
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:58,340
Yeah, I have to get home from work or school and I have to go be evil for two hours before

718
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
I go to bed.

719
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,700
Yeah, I let off pressure by being evil.

720
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,700
Yeah, it's true.

721
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,700
But in video games, yeah.

722
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:10,820
Dude, that is the kind of shit that would seem so terrifying to like a person like from like, you know an alternate universe where video games

723
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:15,540
Just being like yo. Yeah, I just got off from my job. I'm gonna play some call of duty and just

724
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:22,420
Staring at a screen without blinking and just killing a hundred people for three hours

725
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,060
Uh a medieval peasant would look at call of duty and just start vomiting. Shut up

726
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,980
Fuck you

727
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:37,220
No, I mean it's a good point though where it is like, it is kind of like, would kind of break someone's brain probably.

728
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:37,720
Yeah.

729
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,220
Yeah, like I can imagine that.

730
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:45,620
If you stop and think about it for like 20 seconds, it's just like, oh here's the game where you just like

731
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,820
pretend to be a different person who gets paid to kill people.

732
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:49,320
Right.

733
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,820
It's so, yeah.

734
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:50,320
I think like,

735
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:50,820
Oh yeah.

736
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:51,320
Like,

737
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,820
It rocks.

738
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:59,860
When I was like 12, my dad asked me, I think I was playing Call of Duty and my dad asked me, I think I've talked about this, I don't know.

739
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,380
But my dad asked me like how the game were doing he's like interested in it and I was like

740
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,160
Oh, you want to like try and play here and then I put on the no Russian mission

741
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:12,700
That's probably easier than a tutorial

742
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:22,460
But you know, that's a lot of people who are thinking about going into the military they think that too

743
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,740
So I gave my dad the controller and I was like, yeah, so this is like the part of the game

744
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,860
where you're like undercover and it's like, I explained the mission to him and he's like,

745
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,300
wait, I have to kill, like do a mass shooting at an airport?

746
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,300
I was like, yeah.

747
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,380
And he's like, I don't want to play that.

748
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:44,500
Yeah, dad.

749
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:49,140
So this game is called, this game is called Sallow 120 Days of Sodom.

750
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,300
So yeah, this is what video games are.

751
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,300
Here, let me show you.

752
00:47:54,300 --> 00:48:01,300
you

753
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:07,620
me for like three months. I told you it's not even that gory. Right. Please, please, please.

754
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:13,220
Oh man. Who was the, was, who was the, uh, senator who was especially against video games?

755
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:17,780
Do you remember who that was? No. Senator? I don't remember, but the lawyer was, uh, Jack

756
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:23,220
Thompson. Yes. Jack Thompson. I remember. I was just thinking like Jack Thompson, like that's,

757
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:28,180
that's what happened is, is Patrick Doran's dad is actually Jack Thompson. And he was,

758
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:33,940
he's like play no russian it's so cool to have your like identity be like oh i am against video games

759
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,660
like that's like being like the villain in like a teen movie he was like no partying allowed

760
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:45,780
my whole thing is that i just [ __ ] hate toys and having yeah like remaking footloose said it's

761
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:50,580
about like a town that doesn't let people game yeah they have secret land parties instead of

762
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:57,580
like dancing parties. It ends with a f*cking DDR. It's like being known as like, "Oh, you're

763
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:05,700
the guy who thinks roller coasters should be illegal." Yeah. "Aren't you the guy who said

764
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:14,300
that cotton candy was for the devil?" Yeah. "There will be no rock and roll at this concert

765
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:17,500
"Sorry everybody, but you have to go home."

766
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,500
The guy at the music video.

767
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:24,300
And if I see a single one of you falling in love...

768
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,300
LOVE!

769
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:32,300
There will be no tickling at this college.

770
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,300
In the music video that is just...

771
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,300
The music video is just members of sub 41 tickling each other.

772
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,300
At that little place.

773
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:45,500
Yeah, I mean that's like have you ever rewatched the into deep music video?

774
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:53,040
I it's so deep the fat lip ones better the fat one is so good the into deep one is like the the jock

775
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,020
Swim team that they're going up against all guys, and they're just like yes

776
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:01,540
Like oh, that's aged perfectly. Yeah

777
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,220
No, we gotta take gay guys down a peg

778
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:13,180
2001 like like I get the sentiment as like punk rock guys is like all jocks are gay, but like

779
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:19,780
So yeah, I as how I respect what they were trying to do and I understand

780
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:26,420
I I I mean first album I ever loved was some 41s Chuck

781
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:33,500
Which was nuts? It's fucking sick before it's have you ever like read up on the backstory for it? Oh, yes

782
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:37,820
I have I'm not kidding when I said it was like my the first album I ever like

783
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:44,100
Chose by myself and was like this is a great album for me. That was straight out of Linwood by weird

784
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:49,140
Song concert me too

785
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:53,220
Yeah, I

786
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:59,940
Think the first the first CD that I ever bought for myself was also some 41 it was does this look infected? Yeah

787
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,940
Yeah, that's such a good album cover

788
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,940
I remember, yeah, it's awesome. I remember like getting this and being like,

789
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:07,940
like getting it and being like, oh, my mom, like, my mom can't see this.

790
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:08,940
Yeah.

791
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:14,440
Dude, the buying an album where you'd think like, oh, my parents can never know

792
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,540
about this. That's also.

793
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:16,140
That's crack.

794
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:17,140
That's what I mean, crack.

795
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:17,740
Oh, yeah.

796
00:51:17,740 --> 00:51:21,740
I remember, for me, that was, that was Corn Follow the Leader.

797
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:24,940
That was the first one because I was listening to like All in the Family

798
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,940
and just be like, holy shit, dude.

799
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:33,600
I remember hearing like the Avenged Sevenfold album where they had the little piece of heaven

800
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,600
that song.

801
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:35,600
Do you remember that song?

802
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:41,000
It was on their self-titled album and it's just like oh my god, fuck that song is so

803
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
funny now.

804
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:49,500
It is like a nine minute long, which is for Avenged Sevenfold and Opus, about like a guy

805
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:57,400
who like kills his girlfriend and then like still like puts her up and like puts her on

806
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:16,360
the

807
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:18,360
be listening to this.

808
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,360
I think I had two

809
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,360
I had two moments like that.

810
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,360
I had a

811
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,360
like for music wise that was

812
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:28,360
when my mom

813
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,360
I think my mom got me American Idiot for Christmas

814
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,360
and uh

815
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,360
there's that line

816
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,360
it's like what's that fucking song

817
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,360
I think it's

818
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,360
it's like one of those songs on American Idiot

819
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,360
that's in like parts

820
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,360
or the other one

821
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,800
the other one where it's like homecoming where he talks about Jesus filling out

822
00:52:48,800 --> 00:53:00,240
paperwork like I was like whoa that's crazy yeah I was like being like a

823
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,480
little shit to my brother or something like we were arguing before we had to go

824
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,120
on the bus and I was listening to Green Day I was like telling him to shut up

825
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,360
because I was like listening to like the CD or whatever nice and then my brother

826
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:17,360
My older brother had a moment where he was like, "Well he's acting out because of that music he's listening to!"

827
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,360
*laughter*

828
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:21,360
It was fucking Green Day when I was like 9.

829
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,360
Your older brother's dressed like a pilgrim.

830
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,360
*laughter*

831
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,360
"This devil music my brother's listening to!"

832
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:35,360
But the other thing that I had like that, I don't know why I thought if my parents, if my mom saw this she would get mad at me,

833
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:40,960
But I got a copy of Thrasher and it had a DVD of Osiris feed the need

834
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:47,060
which is like this skate video like this Osiris skate video and the cover of it is just like a homeless guy with a

835
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:48,720
like a

836
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,540
Cardboard that says feed the need on it and it's not like the Osiris logo and everything and I thought like if my mom saw that

837
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,520
I would get in trouble

838
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,940
Which she did end up finding it and questioned me about it because I had it hidden

839
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:02,960
Because I hid it in like the like the question like yeah

840
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:17,960
a

841
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:18,960
Tell me this is a porn.

842
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
Please!

843
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
No, Maude, you find a-

844
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
Cory Duffel's in this!

845
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,960
Imagine you find a porn magazine in your kids' room and it's called "Thrasher."

846
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,960
That would be the absolute most horrifying title.

847
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:39,760
There was, in the back page of Thrasher, before the magazine was ended, there was this wheel

848
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:46,320
company called Hubba, and their whole ad campaign was always, they had the Hubba girls, so it

849
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:53,320
was just like half naked girls sitting on skateboard wheels.

850
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:56,320
Which is just like the stupidest, like the dumbest, like, guy.

851
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
The skateboard wheels are tiny!

852
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Right. Well, no, they would superimpose the girls onto the skateboard wheels.

853
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,320
Oh, they were tiny girls!

854
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:08,320
Tiny little girls that you're supposed to squish with your skateboard wheels.

855
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,320
Yeah, that's what the fucking, that's what it makes you think, too.

856
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:19,040
It's like one of those things where like if you know the cat will like sit on top of your your tire in your car

857
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,460
Cuz it's warm. Yeah, you're warming it up

858
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:27,640
Girls gave me the same blank stare that my cat does

859
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:30,920
but yeah, I just remember like

860
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:33,840
Having thrasher and being like if my mom ever

861
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:39,880
Fucking saw that ad in the back and I remember reading cuz there was like the the viewer like the reader mail and there was

862
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,440
like a guy complaining like I bought this for my kid and there's a fucking like

863
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,640
half-naked girl in the back what does that have to do with skateboarding like

864
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,560
I totally understood like where he's coming from but then they're like their

865
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,520
response is just like oh fuck you old man like you don't like it stop reading

866
00:55:54,520 --> 00:56:00,200
it's kind of true sir it's awesome yeah well it's kind of true cuz it's like

867
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,200
it's like what do you think why do you think people are skateboarding right you

868
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,640
know how hard it is to skateboard they're trying to they're trying to

869
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:13,740
better themselves to fuck. Something that's so funny to act like you like

870
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,160
you're to think like oh my parents would freak out they would never understand

871
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,940
this is like like to jump back to like American Idiot I remember like you know

872
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:24,400
listening to like American Idiot and being like damn my parents probably

873
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:32,340
don't even know about this Iraq war stuff dude. They probably don't even care.

874
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,540
Yeah, I felt like a huge baby.

875
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,460
I remember listening to like, because yeah, right after I like was listening to Chuck and then I like

876
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:43,620
through the internet discovered Rage Against the Machine and then like that was it and I

877
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:48,260
remember just like I would listen to that. Oh dude. Over and over and over again. I would be like

878
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:53,060
someone told support for I'd be like yeah this is all making sense it's all connecting and I just

879
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:59,300
I didn't have like any grasp of like what like like like Marxism was or like any of that. I was

880
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,820
was just like yeah everything's fucked up and my parents definitely have never had

881
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,340
these thoughts. I'm the first guy to think things are bad.

882
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:12,100
I found out about Rage Against the Machine through Guitar Hero 3

883
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:17,500
and because of that like on our family computer we had like different like like

884
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,180
you know when you have like the different users or whatever for like yeah I had my

885
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:27,620
account as my background was what's that fucking Rage Against the Machine album I

886
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:30,960
think it's evil empire i think it's a little empire

887
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:34,700
well it was a little yeah yeah yeah i might yeah i might that's a good one

888
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:37,500
my wallpaper was evil empire

889
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:38,420
it's so good

890
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:41,580
that's so i thought that was the coolest fucking thing

891
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,340
it's a great album covers a real there's two kinds of like people that are our

892
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,980
age because it's like this people that like

893
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,000
played guitar hero and got really into like reaching into the sheen like block

894
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:52,900
party

895
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,900
and you know

896
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:58,900
and then there's people who went to Guitar Hero and got really into Dragon Force

897
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,900
right, Foghat

898
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:01,900
I'm definitely in the letter

899
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,900
I would love if like somebody

900
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,900
somebody like played Guitar Hero

901
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:07,900
and like got into the AAS

902
00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:09,900
from Guitar Hero, cause they had maps on there

903
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:11,900
yeah, the first time I heard Cliffs of Dover

904
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,900
really changed my life

905
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,900
that idea

906
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,900
my fucking mom would never understand

907
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:19,900
that the wizard flew over the

908
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,900
yeah

909
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,260
My mom's never been out on a cold winter morning.

910
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,940
What's the fucking drought? I don't know the Dragonfort's lyric.

911
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:30,060
Yeah, I know what you mean.

912
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:33,500
My parents would never understand going through the fire or the flames.

913
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,000
Yeah.

914
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,940
I know both.

915
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:39,100
I played, uh, we played Guitar Hero 3 Christmas Morning when we got it.

916
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:45,180
And I remember I liked Sonic Youth because of, um, like Toy Machine videos.

917
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,100
And I remember like, oh, I want to play Cool Thing. I want to play Cool Thing.

918
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:53,340
and then like I played "Cool Thing" and like after the song was done my mom was like, "That sucked."

919
00:58:53,340 --> 00:59:02,220
I can't remember honestly, I was trying to think of like, because I never played like guitar hero

920
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,660
or anything, I'm not sure exactly how I found like you know like new metal stuff like Korn

921
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:12,300
and Slipknot, like I don't know what I really like, I honestly think that the reason that I

922
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:17,020
started listening to Korn like honestly might have been that I thought that the backwards R looked

923
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:24,020
cool

924
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:25,380
might have been the thing that like it

925
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:29,540
change my life trajectory forever was like a letters backwards i think that

926
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:33,860
the associated with the are in place are us that's right

927
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,540
like you know this might be toys to

928
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,260
what's that the fucking i saw the

929
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:43,160
you really music choice on a like to you like the video on demand thing or is

930
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:46,140
like you just watch music videos on demand

931
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:47,900
Sounds familiar, but go on.

932
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,340
Yeah, I would just watch like...

933
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,700
So no, but yeah, go on.

934
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,940
I would just go to the alternative one and just like look through like all those bands.

935
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,060
And I watched the video for like Follow the Leader or...

936
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:00,060
No, no, no, no, the...

937
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:00,940
Freak on a Leash.

938
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,900
Freak on a Leash, yeah.

939
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:06,140
I watched like the video for Freak on a Leash and Coming Undone a lot.

940
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,140
Dude, Coming Undone, also great video.

941
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:08,860
God.

942
01:00:08,860 --> 01:00:11,340
That was such a fucking crazy video.

943
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:15,260
It's a... I didn't know until recently that the video for Rollin' by Limp Bizkit

944
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:17,420
was the last thing filmed in the World Trade Center.

945
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:18,260
- Yep.

946
01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:19,100

01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,940
- They have, Limp Bizkit, like I remember,

954
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:33,660
I think someone told me about this,

955
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:34,780

956
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,260

957
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:38,100

958
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,940
- They have like a letter-- - That is so cool.

959
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,100
- They have a letter from the World Trade Center,

960
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:42,460

963
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:49,300
Yo!

964
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:59,300
The letter ended with "you guys seem cool, don't come in tomorrow."

965
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,940
That is so fucking nuts.

966
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:04,860

It's a good video too, fun.

Don't come by tomorrow?

971
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,200

972
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:17,200
[laughter]

973
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,200
Is that the one with, um...

974
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,200
Is that the Limp Bizkit video with Mike Valleli?

975
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:24,200
I don't know.

976
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:25,200
I don't fucking know, dude.

977
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,200
I just know...

978
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:27,200
That's the one with Ben Stiller.

979
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,200
Okay.

980
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,200
That might be it.

981
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,200
But, um, there's some...

982
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,200
I think you're probably thinking of Break Stuff.

983
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,200
Break Stuff is the one that has a ton of cameos.

984
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,200
Yes!

985
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,200
No, there's a specific video.

986
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,200
Which Limp Bizkit video has skateboarding in it?

987
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:41,200
of

988
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:43,200
the

989
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,200
the

990
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,200
the

991
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,200
the

992
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,200
the

993
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:53,200
the

994
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,200
the

995
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,200
the

996
01:01:57,200 --> 01:01:59,200
the

997
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:01,200
the

998
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,200
the

999
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,200
the

1000
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
the

1001
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:12,160
like an interview with Mike Villelli where he's like talking about being in a Limp Bizkit video

1002
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:16,240
and I guess he was just like yeah I never liked Limp Bizkit and then I met Fred and he was such

1003
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,680
a good guy and then like he just liked Limp Bizkit after that. That is literally the opposite of what

1004
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:26,880
happens to like everyone else on the planet. Right Limp Bizkit is such great they also they

1005
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,600
have the music video for Eat You Alive is where the one where it has Thora Birch in it and Thora

1006
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:36,720
Strap to a chair in the forest and oh yeah you should know and Fred Durst is

1007
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,880
just screaming the chorus in her face through a megaphone it's so nice they

1008
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:48,680
have really good celebrities yeah cameos there I mean it's so funny just like

1009
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,920
Fred Durst she's being like who am I gonna get for this fucking video oh yeah

1010
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:57,920
my favorite skateboarder when I was a kid yeah they recently Fred Durst has he

1011
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:02,000
made a tiktok and he's been posting his tiktoks on his Instagram story and it's so

1012
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,520
funny because they literally make absolutely no sense at all. They're like

1013
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,360
yeah like a little bit funny but just like seeing his sense of humor is so

1014
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:14,180
insane because it's just like it'll just be like him walking around in a park and

1015
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:17,640
he sees like a guy doing something weird like that's his friend do it like

1016
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:22,640
acting something goes like oh I like his style and like that's the joke like his

1017
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,640
His brain is so clearly fried.

1018
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,640
It's so awesome.

1019
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,640
It's so funny,

1020
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:30,640
what is it, like Wes Borland

1021
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,640
on Instagram, doesn't he do

1022
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,640
like makeup tips?

1023
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,640
That would make sense, he did a lot of makeup.

1024
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:38,640
I think he does.

1025
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,640
I'd have to look that up.

1026
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,640
He's such a good guitarist.

1027
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,640
Yeah.

1028
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,640
Yeah, he does. Wes Borland

1029
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,640
just does makeup tutorials now.

1030
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,640
He rocks, dude. That's awesome.

1031
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,180
All right, so fucking cool. Well, I think that's as good a place as any mm-hmm to end

1032
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:03,840
Yeah, you go go follow patches at senator gun and and then Simon at mulch Lord. Thank you guys for yeah

1033
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,840
Thank you last. Yeah, of course

1034
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:12,720
You know, no, we everyone make sure you pray for for Caleb. He's really upset about Anna K being pregnant

1035
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:18,640
Couldn't make the podcast recording. All right. Bye everybody

1036
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,640
