- Beers we drank, motherfucker,

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,420
with Juvio, Caleb, and Rex.

(funky music)

16
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,100
- Beer.

17
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,600
- Oh, shit.

18
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,140
- Well, mine was a bottle.

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:43,940
- Oh my God, mine exploded, holy fuck.

20
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,360
- I think it's very clear what mine is.

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,660
- All right, then you start.

22
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,940
- Okay.

23
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,720
So I-- - And let me just say,

24
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,120
amazing taste.

25
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,100
Amazing taste, amazing beer.

26
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:54,940
One of the best. - Thank you.

27
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,540
- Sorry, I'm just, I'm fawning.

28
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,460
I have a Bud Light Lime Tallboy.

29
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,980
- Christ, this is an amazing beer.

30
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:08,140
- Someone just drank, literally just drank this.

31
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,540
- So? - I know.

32
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,700
But here's the thing. - It's called a recommendation.

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,500
- Okay. - I went to a party

34
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,820
on Saturday and I walked to a corner store

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,060
and I bought this Bud Light on a Saturday.

36
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,380
- On Saturday. - I see.

37
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,980
- And then I went back to the party

38
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:28,540
and realized I actually didn't really want to be out much longer.

39
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,780
Nice.

40
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:31,620
I took it home with me in an Uber.

41
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,100
And then when we unexpectedly recorded a day early, I thought, wait,

42
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,340
there's already a beautiful beer in the fridge.

43
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,060
That's sometimes God just lines everything up for you, huh?

44
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,180
Serendipitous.

45
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:46,940
Exactly.

46
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,820
That is amazing.

47
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,580
So now I have a Bud Light Lime.

48
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,260
Okay.

49
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:52,220
Now you will review the Bud Light Lime.

50
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,620
So,

52
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,740
Crisp, refreshing, delicious.

53
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,020
- 100%.

54
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,180
- This is like a seven foot one beer.

55
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,740
- It's a great beer.

56
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,580
It's a great beer.

57
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,660
Now, numerical value, please.

58
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,260
- I would honestly say this is like a 7.5, eight out of 10.

59
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,080
- I feel you on that.

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,860
I think I gave it an 8.1.

61
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,700
- Yeah.

62
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,700
This is like a power forward you can build a team around.

63
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,700
Definitely, definitely.

64
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:29,700
This is a Luka Doncic kind of like, this is an early all-star, young all-star.

65
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,700
Exactly.

66
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,980
He's in his first two seasons, but he's so good.

67
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,100
The raw talent is just there.

68
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
Yep.

69
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
You can definitely, this is pure raw talent.

70
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,260
That is what the Bud Light Lime is.

71
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,740
This is an amazing beer, you guys.

72
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:46,780
I would like to follow up Rex's beer with mine because I have something that I noticed when

73
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,140
I was just at the store just now.

74
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,980
Okay.

75
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:56,340
That I was looking through the beers and I, the most of like the kind of unique

76
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,020
looking beers or whatever, they just come with like this, like, what's this?

77
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:07,180
Like 12 ounce, like tiny ass can white, white cloth type shit, like small

78
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:07,940
white type shit.

79
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,620
Uh huh.

80
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,580
And I was wondering like, why does the U S have a monopoly on tall, tall boys?

81
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,180
Because we drink on the street.

82
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,620
We are street drinkers.

83
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,940
It's a street drinking culture.

84
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,900
You brown bag it.

85
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,700
Right.

86
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,780
OK.

87
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,060
Well, we have a living room culture

88
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:27,180
where you take-- you bring this into your living room

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,860
and you drink it, I guess.

90
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,380
This is a-- I think it's--

91
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,540
Norteña?

92
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,020
A Norteña.

93
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,060
Norteña.

94
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,260
Deluxe, it says.

95
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:38,020
Which means from the north.

96
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,780
That's a deluxe.

97
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,780
That's really, it goes down really easy.

98
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,740
Tastes like beer.

99
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,420
I don't hate it.

100
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,940
- That's a big win for you.

101
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,540
- That is an instant, seven feet tall,

102
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,780
8.9 type beer for me.

103
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,540
- Wow, okay, that's a ringing endorsement.

104
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,900
Of the beer hater.

105
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,100
- I don't hate beer.

106
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,580
- You do, you hate beer.

107
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,260
- The beer hater himself.

108
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:12,660
- Guys, it's episode 100.

109
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,580
- It's not.

110
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,580
We've been doing this show for two years.

111
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:19,740
And to ring in the 100th episode,

112
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,140
I thought what better than the first beer

113
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,100
I ever brought on this show, a Zwiewek.

114
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,540
That's right guys, this is a Polish beer

115
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:31,220
from another country.

116
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,940
And we are celebrating 100 episodes today,

117
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,380
right here, right now.

118
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,460
Here comes my sip and furthermore, my review.

119
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,180
- Rex, I don't know about you,

120
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,560
but I think Caleb might be fashionably early

121
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,520
to this celebration.

122
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,040
- Wow.

123
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,960
I mean, it tastes just as good as it did

124
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,920
a hundred episodes ago.

125
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,120
- He didn't review it under our paradigm.

126
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,180
- Oh, true.

127
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,880
- Because it was so early, so long ago

128
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,720
that he drank a drink.

129
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,520
- True, we were just babies.

130
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,900
- Yeah, so this actually needs a real review.

131
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,740
- Right.

132
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,760
- Guys, what is it to say?

133
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,880
This is, if you mixed a Guinness with a Bud Light,

134
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,680
that is like the exact flavor of this beer.

135
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,240
It has a funny, two funny people from another country

136
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,480
who think they're doing something cool by dancing.

137
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,100
They don't realize that that is in our country,

138
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,400
very embarrassing. - Been gay, yeah.

139
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,600
- So guys, this is a seven three.

140
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,440
- Okay. - A seven three

141
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,880
on the numerical scale. - Wow.

142
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,960
- And I would say that this is a six 10 or so

143
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,600
on the basketball player scale.

144
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,000
- Nothing but hitters tonight.

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,100
a really good bench player coming off playing 12 minutes.

146
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,200
- Yeah, yeah, you know, this is like a PJ Tucker.

147
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,880
This is a defense beer.

148
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,800
- Right. - This is, you know,

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,840
this is like 12 points, 15 rebounds, and three blocks.

150
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,560
Like this is like a good-- - Very reliable off the bench.

151
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,160
Not a starter.

152
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,000
- Yeah. - No star power.

153
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
- But every once in a while, gonna pop off

154
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,040
and have like a crazy offensive game.

155
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,840
- Yep. - So, yeah.

156
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,680
I mean, Zywek, guys, this is the king of Polish beer

157
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,400
and kind of dominates my neighborhood for a reason, I think.

158
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
This is a good beer, y'all.

159
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,960
- Yeah.

160
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,160
- Do you think you're becoming Polish slowly?

161
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,560
- I definitely look more Polish than I did

162
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,080
when I started living in this neighborhood.

163
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,280
- Yeah, you kind of look really Polish to me right now.

164
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,120
- Yeah, when I shave my head--

165
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,120
- Is it because his camera is displaying it 140 by 140?

166
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,640
- It is a little blurry, but he looks like a Polish man.

167
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,440
Like, I think I would see you getting, like,

168
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,880
killed in some sort of like road rage accident, like a.

169
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,480
Cause I'm driving on the wrong side of the road.

170
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,320
I moved to New York city and I don't,

171
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,400
I think I still drive on the wrong side. So I just start doing it.

172
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,320
Which by the way, that's what it's not in Poland.

173
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,200
You don't drive on the left side of the road.

174
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,200
You're the rule is you drive on the wrong side of the road.

175
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,320
That is actually the rule. Okay.

176
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,840
So I would move to New York and I'd keep doing that.

177
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,120
And I'd probably hurt a lot of, a lot of young people with a lot of talent.

178
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,360
That's why they have such trouble screwing in light bulbs.

179
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,600
It's like, you know,

180
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,340
they each one has to go the wrong direction before they put it in correctly.

181
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,520
They call them wrong bulbs.

182
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,600
Everything goes in the wrong way there.

183
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Exactly.

184
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,400
That's why we have all these jokes here.

185
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,800
The first person puts it in.

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,600
He can't do it.

187
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,440
He's too stupid.

188
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,760
The second guy puts it in the wrong way because he thinks it's the right way.

189
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:33,320
The third guy does what the first guy does, but all together, they create one

190
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,320
brain capable of doing things properly the wrong way.

191
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,240
- Yeah, I would really like to experiment with these people,

192
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,880
put them in cardboard mazes,

193
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,240
and put scratch off lottery tickets at the end,

194
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,760
and see if they're like those fungus

195
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,380
that can find a cookie or whatever.

196
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,760
That would be pretty cool.

197
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,840
- Guys, I have the best idea.

198
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,960
We should do a live show in Poland.

199
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,480
We should go to...

200
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,240
- I'm down.

201
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,060
- Where?

202
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,400
- Warsaw. - In the city in Poland.

203
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,240
Okay.

204
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,200
- Warsaw, Poland. - Warzone, yep.

205
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,200
- I'm down to go to a Warzone.

206
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,980
You guys wanna go to a Rebirth Island?

207
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,760
We should do a show on Rebirth Island.

208
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,480
A live show on Rebirth Island.

209
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,400
- We should do a show in the Fortnite Island.

210
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,800
- That's a pretty good idea.

211
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:21,560
So tell me, what is it like being in the middle

212
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,700
of a Twitch.tv subathon, guys?

213
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,400
These are one of the biggest, hottest things

214
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,980
in the world right now.

215
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,620
And you know, among us, one of the very stars of it.

216
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,260
You know, when I when I came back from my road trip, I was like,

217
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,560
this is this trip has drained me economically so much

218
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,920
that I definitely need to put a lot of hours into the streaming this month.

219
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,160
I was like, oh, what did I just lean into that joke about doing a jubileo timber?

220
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:52,820
And I actually do it.

221
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,280
But in such a way where I can actually, like, you know, step away

222
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,920
from the computer and actually do my job on a computer without my

223
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,040
computer blowing up. So what I did is we have like the Paul

224
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,280
radio stuff. So whenever I'm not actually streaming or like

225
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,320
playing something on on on the stream, it's just going with

226
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
like old Paul episodes. And I thought that my life would be

227
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,280
perfect, but it's completely not. It is so tiring. And I

228
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,920
wanted to go lay down for like two hours just to watch stick

229
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,720
- Here's the thing, man, not every time you stream,

230
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,820
you don't, stop streaming yourself weightlifting.

231
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,320
Why have you had it in your head

232
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,020
that every single time you go live,

233
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,620
you have to be lifting heavy, heavy weights?

234
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,500
This doesn't, of course you're tired.

235
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,060
- That's my content, that's what I'm known for.

236
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,580
I can't break out.

237
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,900
- You should try variety streaming.

238
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,180
You should do an Among Us playthrough.

239
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:50,020
- So, funny you say that, but variety streamers

240
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,740
are usually the most popular ones in the industry,

241
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,060
but it's the hardest to become popular at

242
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,740
if you become a variety streamer.

243
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,020
The best way to get known is to be like

244
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,580
a specific one thing streamer.

245
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,460
- That's why everybody who streams now

246
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,580
is from like World of Warcraft or RuneScape

247
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,540
or shit like that, right? - Yeah, it's WoW, RuneScape,

248
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:13,660
I think a couple from League, I guess.

249
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,500
- Overwatch.

250
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,960
- What game did Hasan Piker play?

251
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,500
He was a professional, what? - Yeah, OnlyFans.

252
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
- He played Warzone, I think.

253
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,060
He played a little bit of Warzone, I think.

254
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,380
- And now he talks about Warzones, that is interesting.

255
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,500
- That's true.

256
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,980
- That is actually quite interesting.

257
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:35,520
- He's turning our youth's brains into Warzones.

258
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,900
- That's right.

259
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,940
A lot of our youth's homes are Warzones,

260
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,940
'cause they have two dads and they start,

261
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:45,260
that just doesn't work, man, straight up.

262
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,180
- No.

263
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:49,420
- It's okay, I think having a husband works,

264
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,140
but dads are so mean.

265
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,980
I can't believe that some of these people live with two dads.

266
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,400
That's going to be so fucking hard.

267
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:58,040
So have you ever met a mean gay guy?

268
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,740
Are you fucking joking?

269
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,680
Is that a joke?

270
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,440
I would never say a joke like that.

271
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,800
Yes, I have been gay guys.

272
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,000
I've been watching in the mirror family guy on Hulu.

273
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
And I have, you know, Hulu has ads

274
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,460
And I have got maybe 200 ads in the last three days for

275
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:25,540
prep and getting HIV tested.

276
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,460
That's you know, hey, you guys, everybody knows a story

277
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:32,660
about the lady who got the ads from Target about pregnancy stuff

278
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,200
and then found out she was pregnant.

279
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,560
Guys, I hate to say it.

280
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,260
We're going to be losing Rex to one of the most dangerous diseases

281
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,260
known to mankind,

282
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:43,300
which is HIV AIDS.

283
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,660
- Okay, I thought we were gonna go with someone else.

284
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:50,780
- Well actually no, this means that you are,

285
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,820
wait is prep, you take it to avoid AIDS

286
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,300
or it's when you have it?

287
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,740
- It's to avoid it.

288
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,420
- Okay, so this just means that it's in your future.

289
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,260
You still have time.

290
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,620
- Right, it means that I'm having a ton of

291
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,140
mind-blowing gay sex and then I--

292
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,260
- Well not even gay, maybe with a woman who has something--

293
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,380
- Gay woman.

294
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,460
- Yeah, it could be with a gay woman.

295
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:15,140
(whimpering)

296
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,620
- I mean, I think Magic Johnson got this disease

297
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,960
from having sex with many women.

298
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,820
I don't think he ever has had sex with a man.

299
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,040
- Phones could read our future, like magic balls.

300
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,880
Magic phones.

301
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,780
- There's a new tarot cards.

302
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,480
- Yeah.

303
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,740
- They're kind of the new everything.

304
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,260
- They're kind of like shaped like a tarot card, actually,

305
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,100
if you think about it.

306
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,920
- Wait, and your background looks like a tarot card.

307
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,680
- Oh my God, the 730 of AIDS.

308
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,820
- Holy shit.

309
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,660
What the fuck is that?

310
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:49,260
Is that some Junji Ito bullshit?

311
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,000
- I don't know, I forget what I got that image from.

312
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,280
- Well, it looks scary and I'd like to not see it anymore,

313
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,520
so put that damn device away.

314
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,360
- Infernal device.

315
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,400
- I think, you know, when all this AI stuff

316
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,040
started popping off a couple months ago,

317
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,160
I was thinking the entire time,

318
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Don't we already have AI Akinator?

319
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,520
(laughing)

320
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,000
Couldn't we do Akinator for every question?

321
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,800
No, 'cause you gotta pay for it.

322
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,400
Well, once you pay for it though,

323
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,400
if the Akinator, guess what the cure to cancer is?

324
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,000
He's gonna get it, he's never wrong.

325
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,680
I think he only does people though.

326
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,440
I think that's all he knows.

327
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,560
But I'm saying--

328
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,800
- Maybe you can ask him, wait,

329
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:38,800
maybe you can ask him, Akinator,

330
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,680
who's the person who knows how to cure cancer?

331
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,120
- There we go.

332
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,100
- Now.

333
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,920
- That makes way more sense than what I was saying.

334
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,320
Yeah, just get people, just the people who we need,

335
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
we can find them with Akinator.

336
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,960
This is a good idea.

337
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,320
- Do you think people would be a lot less resistant to AI

338
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,880
if there was just a little genie

339
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,400
that hovered on the right of your screen and used it?

340
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,200
No fucking question.

341
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,800
If they brought back Clippy and put that on AI, people would be typing in their social

342
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
security numbers in a fucking instant.

343
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,360
Didn't people hate Clippy?

344
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Wasn't that the thing?

345
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,360
They certainly did.

346
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Not my generation's Z-ass.

347
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,080
I thought it was ironically funny.

348
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,720
They hated him and now they think that they thought it was lovely when he was gone and

349
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,720
dead.

350
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
He's been dead for so long.

351
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,720
What was the one with the kangaroo?

352
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,720
What's up?

353
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,720
Oh, Banzai Buddy?

354
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,560
Bonsai buddy?

355
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,200
Maybe Bonsai buddy.

356
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,440
That's a monkey. That's a monkey.

357
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,800
Oh yeah. Monkey. The purple monkey. Yeah.

358
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,040
Yeah. The purple monkey.

359
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,080
You know, here's what I miss you guys.

360
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,120
Here's the character, the, the off,

361
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,120
oft forgotten character that I really, uh, miss.

362
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,160
Jeeves.

363
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,760
Oh yes.

364
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,840
Instead of something stupid like chat GPT, it should be ask

365
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,680
- Jeeves. - Chad Jeeves.

366
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,380
- Jeeve, Chad Jeeves.

367
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,480
(laughing)

368
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,880
Chad Jeeves would be amazing, dude.

369
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,440
- Yeah. - Jeeves.

370
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,560
And that even sounds better coming off the tongue.

371
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,240
Jeeves, write my essay for me.

372
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,320
Right away, sir.

373
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
- You don't talk to Chad, you do your write to it.

374
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,080
- Well, it's like having a butler.

375
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,280
And you know, what is AI if not a slave?

376
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,160
- That was always the confusing thing

377
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,320
about the branding of Ask Jeeves,

378
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,040
is that you would never ask your butler

379
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,920
what the weather is.

380
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,360
He's mostly there to bring you ice cream.

381
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,920
- Yeah, but he would bring you the newspaper.

382
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,640
And the newspaper would have the weather.

383
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,480
- Well, maybe the newspaper.

384
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,600
- And yeah, it'd be his job to stay abreast

385
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,640
of current events.

386
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,680
- I thought that he was purely, basically,

387
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,260
an ice cream machine.

388
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,720
- No, you're living in Home Alone 2.

389
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,700
- No, listen, I live in a castle.

390
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,260
I'm at the top story of the castle.

391
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,780
It's like three miles for me to leave the place.

392
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,560
Okay.

393
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,580
And I need to find out what's going on around.

394
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,380
I'm not doing that myself.

395
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,420
I have paperwork.

396
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,580
I have castle.

397
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,740
I gotta like read books in my expensive chair.

398
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,740
Someone's coming up with your boat today.

399
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,340
Yeah.

400
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:11,860
Right.

401
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,860
And I go, Jeeves, what's that sound out there?

402
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,260
Jeeves.

403
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,340
He goes, I'm on it.

404
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,660
Jeeves comes back.

405
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,420
I'm on it.

406
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,260
Yeah.

407
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,740
I just asked Jeeves to bring a little bag

408
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,400
to take care of that little problem of yours.

409
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Oh yeah, hey Jeeves, how about you bring a bag over?

410
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,260
Yeah. Yeah.

411
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,900
Bring a bag over and throw all these cans on my desk.

412
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,540
Oh, I was thinking that maybe he was gonna bring drugs.

413
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,340
Oh my God, dude!

414
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,860
(laughing)

415
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,780
It's gotten, how have you let this happen?

416
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,140
Man.

417
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,980
I knew it.

418
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,020
How is this fucking possible to?

419
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,280
I know we did this last week

420
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:53,880
And I think it would be lame if we just keep bringing it over and over again.

421
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,480
But yesterday I was talking to Rex and Annie,

422
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,380
we were playing a game and we were just like silently just playing,

423
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,380
and suddenly I just hear like this loud crashing.

424
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,580
I was like, "Dude, what is your problem?"

425
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,280
He's like, "Sorry, I jumped. There's so many cans in my desk."

426
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,080
So it's going to the point where there's so many cans on his desk

427
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,680
that he can't even just like operate without knocking a few or several of them over.

428
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:21,680
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,

429
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,880
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.

430
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
- Got that one. - 27.

431
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,720
- Yep.

432
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,240
- That is so fucking insane, man.

433
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,080
- We need to send you to hoarders.

434
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,400
- Just throw it away, bro.

435
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
- We're sending you to hoarders.

436
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,960
- This is hoarding behavior.

437
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,000
This is not normal.

438
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,840
You're passing this off as a normal male behavior.

439
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,160
This is not normal male behavior, guys.

440
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,540
I'm sorry, that's wrong.

441
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,180
That is normal male behavior, I'm sorry.

442
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,440
No, to have 27, no, maybe three.

443
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,280
I disagree.

444
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,100
Maybe three.

445
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:55,280
27?

446
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,320
Sound off in the comments.

447
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,600
Nobody does this, dude.

448
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,160
No. This is not normal.

449
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,280
I've done this since I was a mere boy.

450
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,360
That doesn't surprise me.

451
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,040
That's because you've been wrong your entire life.

452
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,680
Because you've always been weird.

453
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,720
This is something, this is a,

454
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,100
you need to see a psychoanalyst about this.

455
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:20,860
I used to have tens of Arizona iced tea cans on my desk

456
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,160
before I drank Monster.

457
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,660
- So it is a collecting thing then?

458
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,500
It's not out of pure laziness.

459
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
- It's not a collector, it's completely out of laziness.

460
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,000
- No, it's not completely, you like it, you like it.

461
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,420
- I don't hate it, I'll say that much.

462
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,620
- Can we-- - You think it's a little fun.

463
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,540
- Can we just, you know--

464
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,020
- I think it's funny.

465
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,260
- Let's just break it even, you know,

466
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,580
let's not go to our side where you do the right thing

467
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,340
and you clean your fucking desk,

468
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,380
Or let's not be on your side,

469
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,540
we just have all the shit on your desk.

470
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,460
Let's build a wall right behind you.

471
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,060
Some decorations, something creative.

472
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,140
Put 'em all up and see how long it takes for you to make

473
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
to completely cover that wall behind you.

474
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,620
- I guess if I got a little bit of some glue

475
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,780
and did that, put a little inner ring.

476
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,300
- That is hoarding.

477
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,820
If you're gluing cans to your wall, you are a hoarder.

478
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,660
- Well no, I'm making art, which is completely different.

479
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,660
This is not art. This is like when my dad got divorced and he convinced himself that it was

480
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,040
artistic for him to

481
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:26,500
Modge podge every wine label that he drank onto a piece of canvas

482
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:32,180
It's just this is not art man. My dad gave these out for Christmas

483
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:38,740
People were like, oh, okay. Thank you, man. And he's like, yeah, what if I really heard of that? I drank all that wine

484
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,500
But hear me out

485
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,340
what if I

486
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,580
I gathered them all together in a big bag,

487
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,700
and I gave it to the homeless guy

488
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,580
who nods out on the stairs in front of my apartment,

489
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,540
and then he used it to buy one cigarette

490
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,340
with the five cent refund.

491
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,540
- Whoa.

492
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,660
- Yeah, I mean, that's definitely a better option

493
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,300
than letting them just sit on your desk,

494
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,700
to the point where now you have almost no real estate.

495
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,180
If you wanna use your desk for something,

496
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,580
you're gonna have to start stacking them.

497
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,420
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

498
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,940
- And I'd hate to say what kind of thing

499
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,140
you come up with in terms of stacking.

500
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,140
- I would love to see a stacking situation.

501
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,820
- There's plenty of room over here.

502
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,900
- If you put it over there, it blocks your fucking computer.

503
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,620
It blocks your monitor.

504
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,460
- No it doesn't.

505
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:27,580
- I would love, I would love for it to just--

506
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,220
- That's where I use my mouse, I don't understand.

507
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,420
There's so much mouse space.

508
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,300
- Yeah, that's where you use your mouse.

509
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,140
- We're gonna be playing Valorant

510
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,540
and she's gonna be like knocking shit over.

511
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,060
Like just like turning around.

512
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,500
- Do you not have a mouse pad?

513
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,620
- Wait.

514
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:45,220
- I knew it. - Dude, that's not that crazy.

515
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,060
- I knew it. - Wait, wait, wait.

516
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:46,940
- I knew you didn't have a mouse pad.

517
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:49,860
I was wondering why you got so much worse at Valorant

518
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,780
since you've been in New York.

519
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,780
You don't have a mouse pad. - I haven't had a mouse pad

520
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,760
in months.

521
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,260
No, it's because my ping is fucking 15 versus 70.

522
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,700
- I said you got worse.

523
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,740
- I know.

524
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,100
- No, it's the no mouse pad.

525
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,940
That is fucking crazy.

526
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,140
That's crazy. - It's not that crazy.

527
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,220
No, that's not crazy.

528
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,380
- That is so crazy.

529
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,220
- All right, let's address these claims separately.

530
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,600
- Okay.

531
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,580
- The mouse pad thing, I can hear you,

532
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:19,040
but they get dirty and I throw them away.

533
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,880
- That's fine, just do that then.

534
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,720
- Just clean them.

535
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,380
- They cost $10, you get clean them easy.

536
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,220
- I know, I just need to get a new one.

537
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,040
- You clean the bathtub.

538
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,260
- I just need a new one, that's all.

539
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,100
- Months.

540
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,660
- The second, and it has been many months

541
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,980
since I've had one.

542
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,460
- Okay, that makes perfect sense.

543
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,260
Everything is lining up in my brain.

544
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,740
As for the claim that I have become worse at Valorant,

545
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,960
it's true.

546
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,520
However, it is absolutely related to the fact

547
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,200
that I have adapted completely to playing with AD ping.

548
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,180
- I've noticed it looks like you're playing

549
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,820
with like a mouse that shakes around.

550
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,240
It's because the sensor is on wood instead of cloth

551
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,620
like it's supposed to be,

552
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,800
and it's bouncing all around and getting fucked up.

553
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,840
- All right, you know what?

554
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,440
I will get a mouse pad and we will put this claim

555
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,400
the test. We will put this to the test. You're going to be amazing at video games once you get a mouse pad.

556
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,320
That's not the issue. I'm just bad at video games.

557
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,880
I haven't seen you in two weeks. That's not true. We talked literally yesterday.

558
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,520
I haven't seen you in three weeks. And I saw Caleb on Monday.

559
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,720
He's been around. He's been around. He's been, "Hey, okay, yeah, fuck me. I'll kill myself."

560
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm not talking about Caleb. You say one mean thing about me, I will kill myself.

561
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
No, I was trying to do that.

562
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,640
I'm just not gaming.

563
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
I'm on...

564
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,640
I'm like on Pacific time,

565
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,640
but I'm in Eastern time.

566
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
So I wake up at noon,

567
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
but it's like I'm waking up at 9am

568
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
in California. So it's like the perfect...

569
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
Man, you used to be cool.

570
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
Now you're just like walking around talking about

571
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,640
being part of a

572
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,640
podcast and

573
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
meeting

574
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,640
creators.

575
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,180
even call us anymore he has been really busy meeting leftist creators he hung

576
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:16,020
out with Vouch the other day and Rex said why doughnuts he said uh well I'm

577
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:22,460
humongously fat actually you must know did you see that plane that had to turn

578
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,960
around because there was shit all in the house.

579
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,960
Saw it, I lived it.

580
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,960
You didn't live it.

581
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
No, I wasn't on the plane.

582
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,960
But did you see it?

583
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,960
I saw the thing, the thing, what do you call that?

584
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,960
The news story. What is the details of this news story?

585
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,960
There is, I think it was a baby, or like a kid,

586
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,960
had like explosive diarrhea on a plane,

587
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,960
and shit his pants, and just completely like

588
00:23:50,960 --> 00:24:00,100
liquid shit just like ran down the aisle like ten rows of seats on a plane and so

589
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,420
they were like it was so disgusting it smelled so horrible it was such a

590
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,940
hazard that they just turned the plane around. You know what, before they even

591
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:14,980
turned around so it was a plane coming from like Atlanta it was going to

592
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,140
Barcelona it's a long intercontinental flight. That's a very long flight.

593
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:22,140
And he had just left the airport, I guess.

594
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,140
And I guess this person just felt like, first thing I'm going to do in this plane is stand

595
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,580
up and shit all over the plane.

596
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,900
So that happens.

597
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,300
And they said that they were spraying like vanilla, like, I don't know, like odor or

598
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
whatever.

599
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,060
So like the smell would at least like stop.

600
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,460
But people were saying that it just smelled like vanilla poop.

601
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,420
So they were like, no, we're going to turn this shit around.

602
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:51,100
So they turn around and they land in Atlanta again, and they have to rip out the carpet.

603
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,900
Someone told me recently that they got on a flight and there was a guy who was really,

604
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:04,180
really late to the boarding process, got to the gate right before the gate closed, and

605
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,020
his bag was too heavy to get on.

606
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,140
He's covered in sweat, drenched in sweat, because he'd ran the whole way.

607
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,220
And his bag was too heavy to take on the plane as a carry-on or whatever.

608
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:21,880
And so he took like seven pairs of pants and seven shirts out of the bag and put them on.

609
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,180
And it was like, okay, put all of these layers on.

610
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,180
It was like, okay, now can you take it?

611
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:30,140
And they're like, yeah, I guess so, whatever.

612
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,140
And he got on the plane.

613
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,140
That doesn't make sense.

614
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,600
The plane smelled, yeah, it makes no sense, but the plane smelled like so bad because

615
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:42,740
this guy was covered in sweat already and then put on seven layers to get on the plane.

616
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,420
I think it was, maybe it was a different flight,

617
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,700
but I think it was this same flight

618
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,540
that he was telling me about

619
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:52,200
where they smelled something awful

620
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,220
while they were in the air

621
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,020
and they thought that it was him,

622
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,140
but it turned, and so they started like

623
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,540
spraying air freshener everywhere,

624
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,280
and it turns out it was like an electronic

625
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,180
that was melting in the plane,

626
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,580
and so they had to land in Buffalo.

627
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,020
- Oh my God. - This little guy.

628
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,940
- This guy, if they had not realized this,

629
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,300
this plane would have gone down

630
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,540
'cause this guy wanted to be disgustingly stinky.

631
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,300
- That's crazy.

632
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,180
- Yeah, planes are scary, man.

633
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,620
- Imagine dying because someone else smelled bad.

634
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,620
- Yeah, at least make it me.

635
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,440
- Someone else smelled so bad.

636
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,020
- At least kill me on one of my stinkiest days.

637
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,140
- They're not that scary.

638
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,460
They're a little uncomfortable.

639
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,300
- I'm pretty scared.

640
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,060
Every single time I get on a plane,

641
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,900
I come fully to terms with my own death.

642
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,780
- When's the last time an American died on a plane crash?

643
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:38,580
- Probably like last week, two weeks ago.

644
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,460
Dude, on like a truly commercial,

645
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:43,980
yeah, a commercial plane.

646
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,980
I don't know, it's been a long time.

647
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,680
You know, in the other parts of the world,

648
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,060
they're fucking dying all the time.

649
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,780
Their planes suck, man.

650
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,780
Yeah, they're dying like roadrunner-ass acne deaths.

651
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,740
All the time.

652
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,220
Yeah, you know, they're fucking driving the plane

653
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:04,820
into a mountain, they're crashing into a tree

654
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,620
because they saw a woman's ass on the sidewalk

655
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,960
from 7,000 feet away.

656
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,520
They're always doing that in like, you know,

657
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,440
Mexico, Malaysia.

658
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,360
- You do that, doesn't happen.

659
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,280
- These planes just go.

660
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:19,680
- So there's-- - I don't know what that is about.

661
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,880
Do we just get the best planes in America?

662
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,040
'Cause now our planes seem to not go down that often.

663
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,240
- I think so, I just Googled it

664
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,460
and there's conflicting information.

665
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,120
Some are saying like last time was 2009, 2013.

666
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,200
But there's this Wikipedia article that's called,

667
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,720
List of Fatal Accidents and Incidents

668
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,560
involving commercial aircraft in the in the US. And there's been

669
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:44,540
one incident this year. And it's had one fatality. And the

670
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,520
incident is called the 2023 San Antonio ground crew suicide

671
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,080
incident.

672
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:58,720
Okay, I don't know if that counts. But I guess I guess if

673
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,520
we could if we're not counting that that was like it was like

674
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,120
last year,

675
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,160
can you fucking click on the article and tell me how he died?

676
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,440
He suicided.

677
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,240
I think I don't care about, I don't care about, uh,

678
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,560
Did he hang himself from the wing?

679
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,680
I mean, there's so many options.

680
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,320
Probably did jump in the turbine.

681
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,240
I feel like that's a pretty, that's a decent way to go.

682
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,760
Oh wait, nevermind.

683
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,360
A ground crewman was ingested into an engine of the aircraft

684
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,400
operating Delta, Delta airlines.

685
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,520
So it wasn't even, and it wasn't even on the air.

686
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,080
So I don't think it counts.

687
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,640
I don't think it counts either.

688
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,720
Yeah, he was simply ingested.

689
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,160
That's an interesting way to put that.

690
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,380
I don't think I care about beautiful birds in the sky.

691
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:36,980
Ate him.

692
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,680
I'm pretty scared of planes.

693
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:43,680
I don't care about planes being like the like cancer to the

694
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,680
environment anymore.

695
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,880
When I was I don't want to drive to a destination ever again.

696
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,780
I just want to fly there.

697
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:51,380
I had this math teacher when I was in high school was just a

698
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,480
fucking bitch.

699
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,380
She just like sucked everyone hated her and then everyone

700
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:59,580
figured out that the reason she was a bitch was that her

701
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,780
husband got sucked into like a engine turbine and liquidated

702
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,860
like in front of her.

703
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:11,740
And so everyone, everyone's like, yeah, she fucking deserves that.

704
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,980
Am I right?

705
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,280
She kept teaching.

706
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,020
It was like years before.

707
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,520
Oh, God, I would.

708
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:22,060
But yeah, she had she had a very bad disposition,

709
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,560
which I guess, you know, makes sense considering that's like a horrific thing

710
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,900
to go through.

711
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,060
Yeah, that's pretty tough.

712
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,360
Don't take it out on me.

713
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
Yeah, leave that shit at home.

714
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,040
People always go one or two ways if something really bad happens in their lives.

715
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,040
They either become very good people or so fucking annoying.

716
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,360
And at first when somebody's like really annoying because their entire family was wiped out in a massacre,

717
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:45,860
you go, "Oh, I understand."

718
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:51,560
Until you meet somebody else whose family is wiped out, who's a complete Mother Teresa,

719
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,360
and you go, "Oh, fuck this other bitch. What the fuck is that?"

720
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,360
Yeah, what the fuck is your problem?

721
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,480
- Yeah, smile more, sweet cheeks.

722
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,320
What's the big, what's the deal?

723
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,920
- Fucking dumb, fat bitch.

724
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,400
- Yeah, I don't, I don't even say fat.

725
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,160
But yeah, what is the issue?

726
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,880
You know, just put a, you know, smile through the pain.

727
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,160
It's not that hard.

728
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,980
- Yeah, I say that--

729
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,040
- I didn't kill your family.

730
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,280
That you, I mean, at least I never proved it.

731
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,400
You know?

732
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,560
- There's a Polish bald guy who did it.

733
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,400
- Yeah.

734
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,000
- Some guy that looks like he was made of PS1 graphics.

735
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,400
- Okay, so you've been noticing I've been going to the gym.

736
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,360
Thank you.

737
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,200
His entire face is eight triangles.

738
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,040
Thank you.

739
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:35,520
This is sounding like a compliment to me, personally.

740
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,800
Guys, to change the subject abruptly,

741
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,640
I'm kind of bummed that we had to record tonight.

742
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,200
And it's not because I don't miss you guys

743
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,760
and love talking to you both.

744
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,600
Yeah.

745
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,600
And love talking to our non-sober gophers that listen.

746
00:30:52,720 --> 00:31:01,000
It is that tonight I was supposed to watch the new episode of Tucker Carlson on X.com

747
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,960
where he talks to the man who smoked crack and had sex with President Barack Hussein

748
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Obama.

749
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,640
Guys, this is going to blow this whole case wide open.

750
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,660
It's exactly, listen, my grandpa called it the first time he saw him on TV.

751
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,000
He looked at Barack Obama and said, "That guy smokes crack.

752
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,700
I swear to God he said that."

753
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,260
And then he started talking and he said,

754
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,900
and you know what, I think he might be gay also.

755
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,380
Guys, Pete DeVita cracked the case, okay?

756
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,540
Why aren't they having him on Tucker?

757
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,700
That's all I'm saying.

758
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,100
But I need to listen to this.

759
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,660
I need to listen to this episode.

760
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,260
I need to watch this.

761
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,900
This is important information.

762
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,100
- I'm shocked that it's happening.

763
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,220
- It's finally happening.

764
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,740
Where was this guy years ago?

765
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,420
Why couldn't he have stopped this guy

766
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:51,740
from turning our country into a communist wasteland

767
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,400
before he got in front of the nuclear codes.

768
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,220
- It's a shame. - Power codes.

769
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,480
- Power codes.

770
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,700
- He had to wait until Obama killed his gay lover,

771
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,180
chef, to come out.

772
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,740
He could have saved that man.

773
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,640
- He easily could have saved that man.

774
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,600
- Why does it matter at this point, is my question.

775
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
- That's a little bit the problem, is like,

776
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,100
you know, that's the only thing,

777
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,900
and it is the only thing, the one and only thing

778
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,060
that makes me maybe not think this guy

779
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,900
is all that creditable.

780
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,060
It's because he is doing this at a time

781
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,900
when it doesn't matter.

782
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:32,720
What's he gonna do?

783
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,820
If Netflix finds out Obama's gay,

784
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,740
they're gonna give him 10 more shows.

785
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,820
- Yeah.

786
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:41,460
Spotify's gonna give him 11 more podcasts.

787
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,700
- Exactly, so I don't understand what he's trying to--

788
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,540
- You know what the--

789
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,580
- This is cancel culture, I'll say it.

790
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,060
This is cancel culture.

791
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:49,900
- Yeah.

792
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,720
- They're trying to cancel him

793
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,620
'cause he smoked crack and was gay for many, many years.

794
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,500
He smoked crack for over 50 years.

795
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,340
That's not a big deal anymore.

796
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,840
- How old is he?

797
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,380
- He's probably in his 50s.

798
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:05,220
- I think Tucker Carlson should kill that guy

799
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,660
and just blame it on Obama and see what happens.

800
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,140
- He could get away with it.

801
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,060
He could easily get away with it.

802
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,140
- You think so?

803
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,960
- Yeah.

804
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,980
No jury in America would convict him.

805
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,140
- I think it would be really cool to come out

806
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:21,460
and be like, you know, Bill Clinton raped me

807
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,280
when I was 12 years old,

808
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,520
and then come up with one of those

809
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,940
like Rube Goldberg style suicides

810
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,580
where you like hang yourself and shoot yourself

811
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,660
in the head like 15 times.

812
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,500
- Uh-huh.

813
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,900
(laughing)

814
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,900
Even better, rig it to Bill Clinton's.

815
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,140
(laughing)

816
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,960
And even better idea is you rig this to Bill Clinton's stove or something.

817
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,660
So he goes to turn on the stove.

818
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,540
Wait, what's that?

819
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,240
Is that a marble?

820
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,300
I don't remember putting that there.

821
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,680
Falls out the window, falls down 50 different tracks, goes about 25 miles,

822
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:03,680
presses onto a bazooka that you have positioned, a boardroom that you have

823
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,900
positioned in your mouth, you have your mouth wrapped around it like Riley Reed.

824
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,580
And then it just blows your head off.

825
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,500
Yeah.

826
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,660
I think someone should do that.

827
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,940
- It's a good idea. - Yeah, Clinton like trips on a banana peel

828
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:22,100
and he like kicks it into a little lever that tips the ball over.

829
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,100
Yeah.

830
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:28,300
Or just straight up, an anvil falls on your head and then yeah, he's in jail forever.

831
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,260
You did your thing.

832
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:37,620
I think, I do think that this might have been this guy, I was thinking about like, if you

833
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:43,380
were in your 60s and you were like, "Okay, it's finally time to come out to my family."

834
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:49,580
Like I've been holding in this secret about myself, my sexuality for so long, and holding

835
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:52,980
it in has been slowly killing me, eating away at me.

836
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
I need to tell my family."

837
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,560
And you sit them down and you say, "Guys, I'm gay."

838
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,340
And then maybe you panic and you say, "And I had sex with Barack Obama."

839
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:03,660
"And we were smoking crack."

840
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:07,380
"And we were smoking crack, guys.

841
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,780
Or at least I thought I was gay.

842
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,420
It turns out it was the crack I was smoking with Barack Obama that was making me just

843
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,260
I think I was gay.

844
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,700
Yeah. And he did it.

845
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:16,260
It would be funny.

846
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,100
Do you have ever seen those like news stories?

847
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:21,020
That's like, uh, it's like an old couple.

848
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:28,100
They're like in their eighties and they'll be like, uh, my, uh, TV ordered $400 in

849
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,780
gay porn pay-per-view.

850
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:36,120
Uh, I think it would be funny to do that, but it's like, you know, you like cheat on

851
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,740
your wife with like someone at work or something.

852
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,980
And she's like, Oh, where were you?

853
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,140
and you were like, "I was smoking crack with Obama."

854
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,780
The president?

855
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:49,260
- Smoking crack with, just big up talk.

856
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:51,020
Smoking crack with Obama?

857
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,860
- Obama?

858
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,680
Like you're like--

859
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,520
- With Barack Obama?

860
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,460
- You're looking around your house

861
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,580
and you've got the TV on, you see a crack in your walls

862
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,060
'cause you're-- - Oh, smoking crack with--

863
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,540
- Broke, and then you like turn to your left

864
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,380
and there's a TV and Obama's on it,

865
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,900
and you're like, "With Obama?"

866
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,340
- With Barack Obama, the TV has Tiger Woods on it.

867
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,180
With Barack Obama.

868
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,660
(laughing)

869
00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:13,300
Smoking crack with Barack Obama, that's what I was doing.

870
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,300
Sorry.

871
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,100
And we were having gay sex.

872
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:22,380
I did see one clip from the interview, his teaser trailer if you will, where he says

873
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:31,340
the guy's like, "Yes, we were smoking crack and we were having gay oral sex and I could

874
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:36,060
tell it wasn't his first time and I'd be willing to bet it wasn't his last."

875
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,620
So he was saying not only did he look like he knew what he was doing, he seemed so insatiable

876
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:48,300
and desperate for more that he's certain that he continued to have sex with men after this episode.

877
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,900
I just want to know how they found this guy.

878
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,340
Probably at a bus stop.

879
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:59,980
In that teaser he was like, "Oh, the media doesn't care about the truth. They never hit me up."

880
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,620
I guess. But how do you find him?

881
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,940
Yeah, where were you saying this?

882
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,700
Yeah. We need to look into his records.

883
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:12,700
Maybe Tucker Carlson's hanging out at crack-smoking gay clubs.

884
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,500
Yeah.

885
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:20,580
And he just took a hit of the pookie and he's saying, "So what's new?" You know?

886
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,500
And the guy said, "Oh, well, I had sex with Barack Obama and we were smoking crack."

887
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,300
And he spit out his... he did a spit take with the crack smoke that he had just inhaled.

888
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,820
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

889
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:34,020
Yeah. Said, "Oh, wait, okay. That's actually pretty cool. Do you want to come on TV?"

890
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:36,060
Well, not TV. Do you want to come on a website?

891
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,460
He just does like a Twitter podcast, which is so weird.

892
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,860
Now that we're finished with him, do you think we could link up?

893
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:48,020
Tucker, if you would like to come on the podcast about Liz's Patreon, if you want to become

894
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:51,500
part of the podcast about Liz's family, all you had to do was ask.

895
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,100
You didn't have to stage this whole Barack Obama crack smoking thing.

896
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,380
Yeah, we think that's funny.

897
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:01,140
It definitely got our attention, but we would have just done it, man.

898
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,300
would be your lie to get famous?

899
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:09,060
Like in 40 years, what are you, what are you lying about?

900
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,980
I feel like an easy one is just say anything about North Korea.

901
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,820
People just believe it.

902
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,180
That's true.

903
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,300
So say I went to North Korea and I, I, uh,

904
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,220
Oh, like I escaped and they made me eat.

905
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,260
Should I start going on Joe Rogan and saying I escaped North Korea?

906
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:36,260
Yeah, they made me completely bald because I wouldn't get the North Korean hairstyle.

907
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
They whited me.

908
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
They whited me.

909
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,260
They opened my eyes.

910
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:42,260
Because they want everybody to fit in there.

911
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,260
Yeah, they completely whited me.

912
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:49,260
They taught me perfect English and I couldn't communicate with my North Korean peers.

913
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,260
They made me drink beer since I was three years old.

914
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:56,260
Yep, kind of awesome, a little bit awesome.

915
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:59,500
They run me over 1 million times every single Thursday

916
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,340
for no reason. - I don't know,

917
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,500
I feel like that is good.

918
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,260
The guy, have you guys seen this guy

919
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,300
who's like a YouTuber who made a video

920
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,180
that was called like, "My Plane Crashed?"

921
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,780
And he pretended that his plane crashed,

922
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:14,040
but he just jumped out of his plane.

923
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,420
You haven't seen this?

924
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,580
He's in jail now. - No.

925
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:22,260
- So he crashed the plane by like doing an ejection?

926
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,160
- But it said that it was like failing.

927
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:30,640
But he just is like, but the video is just him like flying the plane and

928
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:34,760
there's being like, oh crap, it's going down and it's nothing is happening.

929
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,760
And then he just, he already has a fucking jet pack on or whatever it's called

930
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,360
parachute. And he just jumps out of the plane and just takes like an awesome

931
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:47,880
GoPro video of him jumping out on a parachute.

932
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:51,160
And then the plane just like crashed into a mountain, but it could have hit

933
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:57,800
somebody. Yeah. I mean you're not allowed to do that with a car, let alone a plane.

934
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:03,520
Hang on, I think we should advocate for the freedom of this guy. I just saw Mr.

935
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,000
Beast shoot three tanks over and over again and just blow up basically like a

936
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,960
nuke in just some yard. But I'm sure that he asked the police. Yeah you have to get

937
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,680
permission to do stunts like that. Like this guy could have done it if he didn't

938
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,040
just do it with it for you'll see didn't do a very good job faking it they found

939
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,320
the plane it was basically in one piece and they were like nothing is wrong with

940
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:28,800
this plane.

941
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,160
Yeah so black box there's that's the whole point they can always figure out

942
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,600
if something went wrong with the plane.

943
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:38,400
Yeah but no one died nothing happened Mr. Beast is arming a militia.

944
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,760
Yeah but if you crash a plane that's an insurance thing they're gonna check that.

945
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,560
No I don't know if he got into insurance I don't know if he tried to do insurance

946
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:50,680
If he was smart he would have, but I'm not sure that he did.

947
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,960
That's what I would have done.

948
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,000
- Yeah.

949
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,840
- That seems like a no brainer to me.

950
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,680
- I think it looked good.

951
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,880
- I mean, there's no way like 2 million views on YouTube

952
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,180
is gonna be enough to pay for a new plane.

953
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,740
- I don't know, YouTube pays pretty well, man.

954
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,680
(laughing)

955
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,200
- Yeah, yes sir.

956
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,760
- I mean, do you know how much a plane costs?

957
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,040
- This was like a crappy plane.

958
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,640
- I did think that you were talking about

959
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,900
like a commercial plane, I was like,

960
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,540
"Whoa, that's crazy." - No, no, it wasn't a plane,

961
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:22,800
it wasn't a jet, it wasn't like a commercial anything.

962
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,800
It was probably a $15,000 plane, if I had to guess.

963
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:32,200
- It's not a bicycle, it's a plane.

964
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,300
They're like hundreds of thousands of dollars.

965
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:37,000
- Not like a little plane, they're not that expensive.

966
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,640
Look up cheapest plane.

967
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,480
- Cheapest plane. - I think you can get

968
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:44,580
a cheap plane for like a couple thousand bucks.

969
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:46,540
- Cheaper than Caleb's car at this time.

970
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,120
- Definitely, definitely.

971
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:51,420
Like a single person plane

972
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,700
with like a little propeller at the front.

973
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,540
- Yeah.

974
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,360
- They're not that expensive.

975
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,900
- It's made out of paper and it doesn't fly.

976
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,740
- They're not like a million dollars.

977
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,500
- It's also small.

978
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,980
- Yeah, you can't fit anybody but you in that thing.

979
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:11,100
He's doing research, he's researching us.

980
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,420
The cheapest plane that I can find is 45,000.

981
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,340
Yeah.

982
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,540
Yeah.

983
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,540
But think about, but what about used?

984
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,140
No, that is used.

985
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,260
No, but I could find a cheaper plane.

986
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,500
More harshly used.

987
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,300
I could find one.

988
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:24,580
Yeah.

989
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:25,940
One that you're willing to crash.

990
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,300
Yeah.

991
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,020
It's nothing to you.

992
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:27,820
Check marketplace.

993
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,660
These are 1970 Cessnas, the just shittiest plane you can buy that still flies.

994
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,220
Nah, those are Cessnas last forever.

995
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,340
How many miles does it have on it?

996
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:39,820
Does that matter?

997
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,220
You think?

998
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,340
How many air miles does it have on it?

999
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,340
Uh, let's see.

1000
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,340
Time.

1001
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,340
405 Smough.

1002
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:50,340
That's a lot of Smough.

1003
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,340
That's hella Smough.

1004
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,340
I don't know what that means.

1005
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,340
That's a lot.

1006
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,340
How would you guys do it?

1007
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,340
How would you guys become famous fraudulently?

1008
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:04,340
I think something really easy is just like faking like a, like a interaction with a famous person that already died.

1009
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,340
Oh yeah.

1010
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,340
Cause they can't deny it.

1011
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,340
Who would you fake it about?

1012
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:13,340
Elvis raped me when I was one year old.

1013
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,340
Well, I should have died long before you were alive.

1014
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,340
You can prove that. How old am I?

1015
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,340
You're 27.

1016
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:22,340
You can't. No, that's not my age.

1017
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,340
You're 28.

1018
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,340
You're thinking?

1019
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,340
Well, you didn't even know, so it doesn't even matter.

1020
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,340
Converting it to metric?

1021
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,340
Yeah, it is. 28.

1022
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
You're 28? You were born in 1994?

1023
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,340
Or '95?

1024
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:40,140
Yeah. So, uh, yeah, Elvis probably died in the late 80s if I had to guess,

1025
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:42,180
but I don't actually know, I guess.

1026
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,660
Michael Jackson killed my dad.

1027
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,820
That one makes a little more sense. That one makes some sense.

1028
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:52,700
You could say that your dad tried to touch his monkey

1029
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:55,860
and Michael Jackson killed him.

1030
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,980
Yeah. I think I can get away with that.

1031
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:02,820
Your father is alive as far as I know.

1032
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,500
He completely is. Yeah.

1033
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,620
So that makes it a little tougher, I guess.

1034
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,220
Listen, he said 40 years in the future.

1035
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,740
I think when you're old, you can just say anything and maybe like

1036
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,900
some insane person from Fox's will hear it and it'll make you famous.

1037
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,020
That is true.

1038
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,580
This guy did seem a little old.

1039
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:22,700
I felt like Barack Obama, this guy was like maybe 20 years

1040
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,940
older than Barack Obama.

1041
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,060
And maybe he wouldn't go for that.

1042
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,660
Do you think he'd go for you?

1043
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,260
An old gay guy?

1044
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,420
Yeah, of course an old gay guy would go for me.

1045
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,960
- No, Barack Obama.

1046
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,780
- Barack Obama, yeah, an old gay guy.

1047
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,700
Yeah, he would definitely, I'm their type.

1048
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:43,820
- You're their type?

1049
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,100
- Yeah.

1050
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,460
- What are you?

1051
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:48,700
What type do you fall in?

1052
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:55,020
- A super, a super top, an ultra top.

1053
00:44:55,020 --> 00:45:00,140
- Mega top.

1054
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:02,620
- Yeah, a mega top as some might say.

1055
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:03,580
A giga top.

1056
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,140
- Right, you have the biggest head-shaped penis.

1057
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:10,100
- I'm a human walking penis.

1058
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,380
- Penis-shaped head, yeah.

1059
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:13,940
- Yeah, they give me a little temporary tattoo

1060
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:15,340
on the top of my head.

1061
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,660
And I get-- - If you had a bowl cut,

1062
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,780
you would just look straight up.

1063
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,340
- Jump into people's butts.

1064
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,040
- I think that's any bowl cut, no?

1065
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,860
- I had a bowl cut when I was a kid.

1066
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,660
My mom called it a surfer cut.

1067
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,700
And I said, "This is a bowl cut."

1068
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,140
She said, "Nope, it's a surfer cut."

1069
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,620
(laughing)

1070
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,940
- What's a surfer cut?

1071
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,660
It doesn't exist, I'll tell you that, Julio.

1072
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,460
It does not exist, but my mom told me that I had one.

1073
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,460
- The kids at school did not think that it was real.

1074
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,780
- No, if it did exist,

1075
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,420
the kids at school did not know what it was.

1076
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,220
They had never heard of the surfer cut, apparently.

1077
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,500
- You think I should get a surfer cut myself?

1078
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,980
- I think that you would look amazing with a surfer cut.

1079
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:50,220
- I have long hair right now.

1080
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,260
- You would look like, okay,

1081
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,180
you would actually look like an Edward.

1082
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,020
- Yeah.

1083
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:54,860
- What's an Edward?

1084
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,420
- Or an Edgar.

1085
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,700
- Oh, I see.

1086
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,540
- Yeah.

1087
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:00,500
- You would look like a Fred.

1088
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,820
- Yeah, you would look like a complete Edgar.

1089
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,460
which I still never really got an answer

1090
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,780
as to what an Edgar is.

1091
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:10,020
- This is like a stereotypical like South Texas,

1092
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:13,660
South California and Mexican essay type of guy.

1093
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,180
- Who they have bowl cuts?

1094
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:18,300
- Hey fool, you like Rick Owens?

1095
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,700
- That's Edgar, yeah.

1096
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,540
- I saw a video, I sent it to you earlier.

1097
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:24,260
- You like wearing hood by air pants?

1098
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,160
- You sent me a video?

1099
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,380
- Yeah, I sent a video earlier.

1100
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:28,420
You should play it into the microphone.

1101
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,380
I sent it into the work group chat.

1102
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,500
It's a guy who--

1103
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,540
The Chilaquiles Burrito?

1104
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,740
Yeah, it's a guy who I've been following for a long time

1105
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,540
and I thought that it was a Mexican guy.

1106
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,380
I was born Mexican.

1107
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,620
For the first 10 years of my life,

1108
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:41,260
I was raised by a Mexican lady.

1109
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:42,100
This is a white guy.

1110
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,940
The other day, how Kevin--

1111
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:43,760
Whoa!

1112
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,340
Chilaquiles Burrito and it instantly reminded me of her.

1113
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,900
We were extremely poor and my mom had to work long hours

1114
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,420
and that's why I barely got to see her.

1115
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,260
Why is he talking like that?

1116
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:52,100
And he needs to make us these burritos

1117
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:52,920
anytime he wants. That's his voice,

1118
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,760
that's what I'm saying.

1119
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,780
That's his voice. That's crazy.

1120
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:55,620
And he makes videos-- Wait, hang on, hang on.

1121
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,420
Where he doesn't show his face

1122
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,140
And he makes videos where he's like,

1123
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,420
today we're going to be making a Tapatio burrito.

1124
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:03,900
- This is what it looks like.

1125
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,220
It looks like a complete white guy.

1126
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,420
It looks like he's--

1127
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:08,100
- Yeah, he's white.

1128
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:09,420
- He's just like a white guy

1129
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,100
who had a Mexican nanny growing up

1130
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,260
and he just started talking like that.

1131
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:17,660
Isn't that awesome?

1132
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:18,500
- That is awesome.

1133
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,860
He's also making something that looks really delicious.

1134
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:22,420
- He's making a Chilaquiles burrito.

1135
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:23,820
Too many carbs for me, but I--

1136
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,420
- I love Chilaquiles, bro.

1137
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,800
- I feel like Kayla's burrito,

1138
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,720
that's just like three burritos.

1139
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:33,140
That's just-- - You know what?

1140
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,120
- It's just tia.

1141
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,760
- In Mexico City, they love doing that shit.

1142
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,200
I don't wanna speak up too loud

1143
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:40,220
because my girlfriend loves Mexico City,

1144
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:41,320
but they just do that shit.

1145
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:46,320
They put tamales in bread and just show a tamale torta,

1146
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:49,080
and that's what they eat during the winter.

1147
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,380
- Are they as fat as balloons?

1148
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,480
- Some of them.

1149
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,240
I don't know, I've never been.

1150
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,820
(laughing)

1151
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:02,740
- Well you have to remember, they're three feet tall.

1152
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:05,600
So walking to the street corner for them is like--

1153
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,420
- They're burning off calories, yeah.

1154
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,260
- Yeah. - That's a good point.

1155
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,780
- They do have much better public transport

1156
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,660
so they actually walk around the train stations, I guess,

1157
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:16,780
jumping into it and whatnot.

1158
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,500
- Yeah, jumping like beans.

1159
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,340
- Yeah.

1160
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:20,860
- Whoa.

1161
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:21,700
- What?

1162
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:22,980
That's not racist.

1163
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,820
- Did you guys ever have jumping beans when you were a kid?

1164
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,100
- No.

1165
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,560
I don't even know what that means.

1166
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,620
- Well, it's these beans that they put

1167
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:33,220
in this little plastic container and they jump around.

1168
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,660
- Oh yeah, I think I saw a tiktok about this.

1169
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:35,900
Don't they have like worms inside?

1170
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,280
- Yeah, they have bugs in them.

1171
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,120
That's why they jump.

1172
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,400
How sad is this?

1173
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,000
There's no such thing as a magical jumping bean, you guys.

1174
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,500
I'm sorry to break that fiction.

1175
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,420
This is like a Wendigoon video.

1176
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:50,660
Guys, this is an animal that has been trapped in a bean.

1177
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:51,840
Not that cool.

1178
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,540
- I think that's pretty cool.

1179
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,500
- Not that cool.

1180
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,380
Not as cool as a magical jump.

1181
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,580
Well, if you start at magic,

1182
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,580
there's almost nowhere to go but down.

1183
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:04,260
So an animal stuck in a bean,

1184
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,740
I just don't care all that much.

1185
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:08,020
- What about a boy stuck in a peach?

1186
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:08,860
They wrote a book about that.

1187
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,900
- A boy stuck in a peach, a boy stuck in a balloon.

1188
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,660
These are more interesting stories to me

1189
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,300
because they involve humans.

1190
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:16,420
- But a bug stuck in a bean?

1191
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,940
- A bug is so stupid, of course it gets stuck in a--

1192
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,940
- That's a boy for someone.

1193
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,380
That's a boy for another species.

1194
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:26,180
And I have no interest in becoming a citizen of these species.

1195
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:28,180
What if it was Earthworm Jim?

1196
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,180
Earthworm Jim?

1197
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:36,180
He started, he watched one TikTok, listened to one TikTok about a guy who's a white dude who talks Mexican.

1198
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,180
He's like, "What if it was Earthworm Jim?"

1199
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,180
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

1200
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:47,180
Come on, bro. You're being fucking racist.

1201
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,180
If it was Earthworm Jim, maybe.

1202
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:52,180
That'd be your lie to become famous in 40 years.

1203
00:49:52,180 --> 00:50:00,340
I had an answer to this and I completely forgot it because I was looking at airplanes on eBay.

1204
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,140
Yeah, you seemed pretty invested for a sec.

1205
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,140
Did you find one?

1206
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,940
Yeah, they get pretty cheap, but what's more fun is you can buy those little carts.

1207
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,940
We were right.

1208
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:08,940
We were right.

1209
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,180
He didn't tell us out loud, but we were definitely right.

1210
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:14,940
You can find those little carts that they drive around the airport on.

1211
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:15,940
Really?

1212
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,940
Oh, shit.

1213
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:17,940
Yeah, and they're like $2,000.

1214
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:18,940
That'd be really fun, I think.

1215
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,940
I think they'll be awesome.

1216
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:26,500
I think. I've always thought that that would be a good job for me. That would be fun until the cops

1217
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:32,260
just like shoot you because that's not street legal. Yeah, but let me tell you, I took a cab

1218
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:39,300
the other day and I saw this dude on a quad like maneuvering between pedestrians on the sidewalk.

1219
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:45,060
Yeah, people just do that in like Bushwick and Bed-Stuy. Yeah, so imagine if you had

1220
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:47,940
like a pallet of beer on the back of it.

1221
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,300
And then you're just going around.

1222
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:52,380
Nobody's going to complain.

1223
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:52,980
Yeah.

1224
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,140
If you just hit someone, you give them a beer.

1225
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,140
Yeah.

1226
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:56,700
Fuck it.

1227
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,580
I've never told you guys.

1228
00:50:58,580 --> 00:50:59,300
Uber eats guy.

1229
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,140
A cab.

1230
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:06,220
I did ever tell you guys about the time that I was eating outside at Zatar in

1231
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:11,060
Bushwick, which maybe you guys have been to, I don't know, but there was a, there's

1232
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:16,580
two guys on a moped riding down the street and a car just t-boned both of them.

1233
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1234
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:22,500
And they just flew over the fucking car and they looked completely dead and then they got up and

1235
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,100
they just walked over the guy and they just like hung out with him for like 30 minutes and then

1236
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,020
left. That's so awesome.

1237
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:28,900
It was amazing.

1238
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:29,860
They hung out?

1239
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:33,540
They hung out with the guy who hit them with their car, with his car.

1240
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:36,980
This isn't really my story to tell, but I was like,

1241
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:43,140
Pat was like saying that he got like hit, like talking about what happened after he got hit by

1242
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:46,740
and I was like, Oh yeah, I remember like last year you got hit by a car. He's like, No, no,

1243
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,580
it happened again, like two weeks ago.

1244
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,900
It's I mean,

1245
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:54,980
He's just a constant magnet for it.

1246
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:00,340
He's got a kind of wide figure. He's got the wide broad shoulders.

1247
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:05,060
I don't think the shoulders of the figure matter at all. I think he just loves riding a bike

1248
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,060
and like closing his eyes to see what happens.

1249
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:12,900
I, he's been talking about riding his bike more and I can imagine that he's

1250
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,820
probably on his phone 90% of the time when he's riding a bike.

1251
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,040
Well, that's normal.

1252
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,100
What are you going to do?

1253
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:20,380
Pay attention to the road?

1254
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:25,660
I don't think you're supposed to use your telephone as you're riding your bike.

1255
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:28,460
No, like Uber Eats drivers do it all the time.

1256
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,020
They, they're looking at, you know, the map and like whatever.

1257
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,100
He can use it to bounce the duck.

1258
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:34,340
They know that their lives don't matter that much.

1259
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:38,200
That is like a guy, a creative like Patrick.

1260
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,260
You can't be looking at your phone as you.

1261
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:42,020
That's like 100 Uber Eats drivers.

1262
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,960
Yeah, exactly. It's not even it's not even comparable.

1263
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:49,560
Yeah, it's going to be awesome when there's only two jobs,

1264
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,700
which is a podcaster and Uber Eats driver.

1265
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,900
We're almost there.

1266
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,660
Yeah, I mean, that's already the New York City

1267
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:02,420
economy is podcasters who don't live, leave their apartments,

1268
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:06,420
giving money to Uber Eats drivers who run their errands for them.

1269
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:12,500
It is crazy how many people, you know what's even worse than, actually maybe it's better,

1270
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,500
I was going to say, you know what's worse than like somebody who has like one of these stupid

1271
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:24,260
creative jobs, like a, I mean creative, like jobs like a Twitch streamer or a podcaster at

1272
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:31,140
like a low level, is people who are like trying really hard to do that and just failing man.

1273
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:34,440
That is true. That just kills me, man.

1274
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,900
But I actually think it's probably braver.

1275
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:42,300
Yeah, there's a lot of respect for me

1276
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:46,540
when people do the like go fund me to buy a gaming PC

1277
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,580
and then stream for three months, realize they are just

1278
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,780
a black hole of charisma and wit and run off with a new computer.

1279
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:58,700
That is admirable to me.

1280
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,800
Yeah, that is that is kind of cool, actually.

1281
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,300
- Does that shit happen still in GoFundMe?

1282
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,480
- I don't know about GoFundMe,

1283
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,240
but that definitely still happens.

1284
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:11,560
- I feel like there was a bunch of GoFundMe scans

1285
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,160
for a little while, and then they were like,

1286
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,040
"We're gonna crack down on this shit.

1287
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,920
"You need to actually be the person,

1288
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:22,080
"you need to have a real thing."

1289
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,680
But every day we get an email from this fake joke

1290
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,400
GoFundMe that Patrick made months ago,

1291
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,200
And it's got like $12 on it.

1292
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,400
And GoFundMe is like, you need to get your money.

1293
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,000
You need to get, you need to set up withdrawals

1294
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,640
and get this money for you.

1295
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:39,540
- Yeah, I did a GoFundMe a couple years ago

1296
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,880
that was like, it was like,

1297
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,820
help pay for Peter Griffin's weight loss surgery.

1298
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,760
And it got, I think it got like $30.

1299
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,800
- Really? - Yeah.

1300
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,620
- Yeah. - Did you cash it out?

1301
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,080
- No, I think I was just like, who,

1302
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,120
I posted it somewhere as a joke

1303
00:54:57,120 --> 00:55:00,460
And then I think it was $30 of people giving to it.

1304
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:02,760
And it wasn't even weight loss surgery.

1305
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:06,720
Actually, it was like, he had already had weight loss and this was to pay for the

1306
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,520
like skin to be tightened.

1307
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,880
And I wrote this whole thing about how this was the scenario and people

1308
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,040
decided to give money to it.

1309
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,720
Like when you were a creative.

1310
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:20,880
Yeah, exactly.

1311
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,040
Now I feel like now you're more of an executive head rather than a creative.

1312
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,920
Definitely trying to slide into more of a CEO role.

1313
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:33,120
I do see you more like a corporate person rather than a,

1314
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:37,280
"I want to make a video about sucking penis on Twitter."

1315
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:46,320
Yeah, that's childish. I would like to basically have 100 or 200 or 300 people who work under me

1316
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:53,680
who really respect me. But in some kind of... I don't even know what the business would be,

1317
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,600
maybe like a private army or so, something like that. Like an actual business.

1318
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:06,000
Can I make a question about your CEO experiences or aspirations?

1319
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,160
Yes. See, this is a good test of my CEO-ship.

1320
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:11,040
I'll say this. I'll say, "Shoot!"

1321
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,080
Do you still have those plastic eyes sitting on your desk?

1322
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:19,120
Yeah. Yeah, they're right here. Yeah, bad guys.

1323
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,960
Guys, the video with these is coming very soon.

1324
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,280
(laughing)

1325
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,440
Very, very soon, another two or three years

1326
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:32,780
and this will be famous.

1327
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,640
- What about the other thing that's much more expensive

1328
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:35,480
than these guys?

1329
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:38,180
- The other thing is still being created,

1330
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,560
but that will be debuted.

1331
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:40,740
And you know what?

1332
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,960
Maybe I'll use the googly eyes with the other new thing.

1333
00:56:43,960 --> 00:56:45,440
- Do you have it already?

1334
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,400
- No, it's being fabricated.

1335
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,800
- Man.

1336
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,440
- Really fucking sad.

1337
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,940
I really hate talking about that thing because I do want people to see what it is.

1338
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:58,840
They will see by this time next month.

1339
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,840
They will never see.

1340
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,760
My friend Julio, what is your job position?

1341
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,760
What is your job title?

1342
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,760
Mine?

1343
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,960
Yeah, what would you call yourself?

1344
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,960
Maybe editor/producer?

1345
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:15,640
Okay, yeah, so that's a hat you wear I would say.

1346
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,600
That's not your position.

1347
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,600
Oh, what does that mean?

1348
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:28,440
How much do you spend doing that on a weekly basis in terms of most of his job is video game friend?

1349
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,040
That's 60% of it.

1350
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:38,440
Surely, so you're saying keep saying I'm so happy that I have a guy I pay.

1351
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:45,560
To play video games with so it takes you 16 hours a week to edit the podcast.

1352
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:51,520
I said 60% of my role, my position.

1353
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:56,120
Well, you're making a mistake, Rex, of him working a 40-hour work week.

1354
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,120
He does not.

1355
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,120
Right.

1356
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:02,000
Listen, I've been live for days now.

1357
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,760
I think about 60 hours.

1358
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,120
I don't know how much five days is.

1359
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,080
That is a lot.

1360
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:15,120
And how much Uber Eats have you ordered in that time period?

1361
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:23,240
once. Yeah, once. What are you doing for food otherwise? Well, he's still at his house. I'm

1362
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,600
at my house. It's not that hard to just pop into the kitchen. He doesn't live in a mansion like

1363
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:36,720
you. Yeah, I make breakfast. Dinner is... He makes Mike breakfast. He just said he wakes up,

1364
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:43,280
he makes Mike breakfast. That's his roommate. Dinner is just whatever I can scrounge,

1365
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,280
- I'm gonna go ahead and get started.

1366
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:46,120
- Okay.

1367
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:47,960
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1368
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:48,800
- Okay.

1369
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:49,640
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1370
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:50,460
- Okay.

1371
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,300
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1372
00:58:51,300 --> 00:58:52,140
- Okay.

1373
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:52,980
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1374
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,800
- Okay.

1375
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,640
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1376
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,480
- Okay.

1377
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:56,300
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1378
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,140
- Okay.

1379
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:57,980
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1380
00:58:57,980 --> 00:58:58,800
- Okay.

1381
00:58:58,800 --> 00:58:59,640
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1382
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,480
- Okay.

1383
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,300
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1384
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,140
- Okay.

1385
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:02,980
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1386
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:03,800
- Okay.

1387
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,640
- So, I'm gonna start with the sandwich.

1388
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,480
- Okay.

1389
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,600
- I'm reeling up the case.

1390
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:08,100
- Are you learning how to cook?

1391
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:10,720
- A little bit, yeah.

1392
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,200
I made some burgers the other day.

1393
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,800
- Ooh.

1394
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,680
- Yep, and they looked weird.

1395
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,400
- That's good.

1396
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,800
- So we're still learning.

1397
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,020
- They're not, they weren't circular.

1398
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,800
- They weren't completely circular, yeah.

1399
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,720
- Well, that doesn't seem,

1400
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,160
I guess that's even more weird, you're right.

1401
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,480
If they're perfect circles.

1402
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,480
- So no, I'm completely, you can come at me.

1403
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,480
I will dodge your bullets.

1404
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,280
I will dodge your knives.

1405
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,320
I got nothing to hide.

1406
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:44,220
- I will say, how is this current position

1407
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,760
gonna go on a resume when you move on to your next thing?

1408
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,760
Because you're not gonna be 50 years old

1409
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:51,040
doing this podcast.

1410
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,680
- We'll see.

1411
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:55,920
(laughing)

1412
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,820
That remains to be seen.

1413
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:04,400
- He's got you and Pat just chained up somewhere.

1414
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,360
I am currently living in a really high status in Mexico

1415
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:11,060
and I really don't want to think about the future.

1416
01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:11,900
I think--

1417
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,720
- That's smart.

1418
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,440
- I think life is great. - That is great.

1419
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:15,380
- Life is great.

1420
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:18,660
You have one of the greatest positions on earth.

1421
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,620
Many, many people messaged us before you were picked

1422
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,140
to be this position and said,

1423
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:28,160
"Hey, I'm 15 years old and I really am so bored

1424
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,140
"and I need credit for my world history class,

1425
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:37,100
my AP World History, can I be the intern?

1426
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,700
And we said, no.

1427
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,700
- No, we're outsourcing.

1428
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:42,100
- We're going to outsource this job to another country

1429
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:46,500
because it is so grueling that no American

1430
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,860
could possibly stand to do this job.

1431
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:50,980
And here we are, man.

1432
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,820
- And that's true.

1433
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,740
- Here we are.

1434
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,020
A year and some change in, and this guy's crushing it.

1435
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,340
All right, I finished my ZVEC.

1436
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:00,300
I'm gonna go sleep.

1437
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:02,700
- All right.

1438
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,540
This was good.

1439
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,840
This was good.

1440
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,140
Bye bye French.

1441
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,480
Bye goodbye beer forever.
