170
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,160
I'm gonna bully you now that I've become a jock.

171
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,000
- Is that what you're--

172
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,200
- You became a jock.

173
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,880
- I became a jock today, yeah.

174
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,320
- Wow, congratulations.

175
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,960
- It's the one thing everybody says

176
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,640
this podcast needs more of his visual gags.

177
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,480
- Shut up!

178
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,880
(laughing)

179
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,760
- He picked his face up. - Shut the hell up, nerd!

180
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,000
See, I'm kinda working.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,160
- What's your locker number? - I'm still figuring out

182
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,160
the kinks, 1,000.

183
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,760
(laughing)

184
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,560
- And you know, if you count to 1,000,

185
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,000
since you have-- - That's a hell--

186
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,200
- Since you have-- - You have to type in

187
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,600
10, 10, like 10, 100 times. - That's a high number.

188
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,720
- That probably means you're a nerd,

189
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,280
'cause that's a high number to count to.

190
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,800
- Yeah. - I just am guessing

191
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,680
it's 1,000, it's more than three,

192
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,520
so I can't even count it.

193
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,200
So you like to guess? So you like trivia? No, I don't like to guess. I just kind of say

194
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,000
random shit. It doesn't matter because it's going to be a dick-suck due to my jock nature.

195
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,880
Okay, so you're a random kid. You're not a jock. You're a random kid. I'm not really

196
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,680
a random kid because I play football. I try to get football pads by today, but it wouldn't

197
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,880
be. Yeah, you play foosball. I just didn't have them. No. And you wear maxi pads. I play

198
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:23,360
football, American football, not soccer. And you buy a maxi pad and wear it to play foosball.

199
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,720
Why are you wearing a maxi pad on your face like a face mask? Because of COVID-19. Why

200
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:32,320
are you giving everyone that nerd? You guys are both nerds and you're going in my locker,

201
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,360

202
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,400
fucking stupid job yeah you're really smart you did that on purpose it was all

203
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,960

205
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:58,000

even Hank with the mustache sucks my fucking jock dick.

208
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,360
Yeah you may have fucked a cheerleader but I fucked a coach of the cheerleaders and he

209
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,400
let me tell you he is something else.

210
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,480
Yeah wait what do you think they learned it from alright?

211
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,800
Hank taught them everything they know.

212
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,160
You should see him without a bra.

213
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah dude.

214
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,240
I think the coach of the cheerleading team at my middle school got arrested.

215
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
For what?

216
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,240
For sucking your dick dude.

217
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,240
For drug trafficking.

218
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Stop back flipping.

219
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:36,460
Yeah, he brought his pom-poms to school back up one more time you're going to jail. I can't help it man

220
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,620
I'm sure you better stop back flipping in this restaurant right now

221
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,700
You have not over the fajita tray six times

222
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:54,580
The I wish I wish that more people were still trying to be like vine stars

223
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:58,660
so you would just watch people like backflip and shit and yeah purposely

224
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,220
injured them so that's that's the thing that's the thing about tick-tock is you

225
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:07,020
can I wish it was your bedroom I wish it was a higher density of people who who

226
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,020
are going out into public to do this stuff just so I could see it yeah

227
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:16,540
remember put him in a coffin no no he was the guy who would like put his arms

228
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,820
around his chest and then say put him in a coffin and like fall down onto like

229

231
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,900
boot gang and boom exactly we need more boom gang is the more more successful

232
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:38,020
the paintball field that my brother works at yeah like they knew he was

236
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:55,780
your money or fucking like fuck your car like you don't want to be there for that

237
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:59,220
and he's constantly that's the thing about boot gang is he's always really

238
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:05,540
fucking cars I don't know anything about him I just heard that story and I was

239
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,780

240
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,620
the barber shop and then runs away yeah that's like one of them prank yeah I

241
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:21,380
saw a video of him like flipping over like a street vendors table or something

242
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,580
he's a real shit like that this guy yeah yeah yeah he's just being a pranker we

243
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,900
should start we should start yeah okay here's a pitch for an idea for one of

244
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:36,500
these how about the the dark vampire and you bite people from behind yeah yeah

245
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,260
dark vampire yeah well no no no you but you bite them it shocks them and when

246
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,420
they're in shock and their eyes are wide like dinner plates you look them right

247
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:50,660
in the eye and you say and you say you've fallen under my spell and that'll

248
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,380
be your catchphrase we could be they've fallen under the spell of the dark

249
00:12:54,380 --> 00:13:00,820
vampire got your blood I'm worried I'm worried that that could be infringing

250
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,180
upon the put him in a coffin guy well no okay all right how about okay here how

251
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,300
about this how about this how about this take take him out of a coffin you find a

252
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:18,460
dead body that's in a coffin ah you throw it because because it's the exact reverse

253
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,780
yeah there there was actually deleted deleted footage of Logan Paul in the

254
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,820
suicide forest when they found a corpse they started playing tetherball with it

255
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:30,540
that was the thing people really met he threw the corpse in the bang bus and

256
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,780
that's one of them on dude you can't do that that's one of the craziest videos of

257
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:38,860
all time. It's so funny dude. Like the only way that there could be like a video of

258
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,300
in that vein better than that is if they like witnessed a murder or something.

259
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,460
Yeah that's like the suicide. That's like the like top. That would have been.

260
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:51,500
They're like damn that's savage. Yeah that's maybe the most like I don't think if that video

261
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,900
hadn't happened and someone like said that I would be like oh that's come on

262
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,900
that's that's too much like you know. Right that's not real. Yeah. That could

263
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,460
never happen but no he actually went to the suicide force. It's so sick.

264
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
Yo, I found a body

265
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,740
What the fuck yo?

266
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:13,940
It's so dude. I went to the crematorium, and I found dust what the fuck

267
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,580
Snorting cremains yeah, yeah, I

268
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,820
We have our own suicide forest in New York City now. It's that oh yeah

269
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:33,140
Yeah, yeah, people just been just non-stop fucking dropping off that thing dude so funny

270
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,920
yeah the Hudson Yards thing yeah they're just because like yeah what if I was

271
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,020
gonna kill myself right now that's where I would go you kill yourself on the

272
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:43,660
beehive dude I would just fucking die yourself on the beehive cuz you're

273
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,980
afraid I would I would kill myself I'm a Harris's vice president Wow that's

274
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,700
right I would stand under the thing the beehive thing and I would jump up so

275
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:55,540
hard that I hit my head on the top of it and died I was standing under it with my

276
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:03,300
mouth open try and catch people like snowflakes I was running around with a trampoline like

277
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,580
like clown firefighters yeah with a pool of water and then you gotta like you know

278
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,780
you're you're looking at people like I know that you're about to jump dude yeah

279
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:16,580
yeah yeah that that tie is a little too loose you just had a real bad day at

280
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,740
work and you're heading to the top of the honeycomb well guys remember that that

281
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,060
that news story that was like in China some guy tried to jump off his like

282
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,860
apartment balcony and they hit him back inside the window with the fire hose

283
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:36,380
there's a picture of it I don't know if there's video I do think it's funny when

284
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,140
like there's a jumper and then they just put like a trampoline at the bottom yeah

285
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:47,940
it's just such a funny way to ruin that if you want to have the best day your

286
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,900
life. If you don't do a backflip at the end of this, well that's why they do it

287
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,860
we're gonna kill you ourselves. They do that jump and I mean that's the coolest

288
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:01,160
fucking trampoline jump you can do and they're like oh my god I was gonna kill

289
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:06,220
myself? Life fucking rules this is sick. Yeah they do like a quadruple

290
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,100
backflip and then they get on the ground they start whistling and walking like

291
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:20,200
Mickey Mouse yeah that's a but the thing is the people who just like sit in their

292
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,980
window they're never gonna go anyway yeah yeah you can always yeah you can

293
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,440
always so so what was the Hudson Yards the Hudson Yards honeycomb it was just

294
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,940
like this horrible like statue that you could like walk on it was like seven

295
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:38,820
stories is it like is it is it like tech like some startup shit like some

296
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:46,340
stupid New York yeah I mean it was it was like a a redevelopment thing of this

297
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,720
like area that I guess nobody lived in and then yeah it was probably no you

298
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,980
know but it was probably like a bunch of black families lived there and they were

299
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,940
like how we put a honeycomb here no they actually used to live in the honeycomb

300
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,940
there was a hive of Puerto Ricans and then they actually shoot him out and

301
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,880
turned it into a statue. Yeah, they smoked the honeycomb. Yeah, they killed the Queen and then they just

302
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,880
scattered all over New York City. Yeah, they all went to like Soho. Mm-hmm. I don't

303
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,920
know where the, I don't know where the people live in New York. Yeah. They live,

304
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:23,120
well I live here. I know, I know the Hasidic people live in Williamsburg. I'll tell you what, the Jocks live in Ridgewood.

305
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,320
I live in a Jock neighborhood, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty awesome. There's some

306
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,540
good Jock food around here, just like a piece of white bread with peanut butter on it.

307
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
cheeseburgers, yeah.

308
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,540
Whey protein.

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,540
Yeah, big milkshakes.

310
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:36,540
Yeah.

311
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:41,500
It's interesting, Caleb, that you recently became a jock because I actually like just

312
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,060
recently like changed too.

313
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,060
Yeah.

314
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
What'd you do?

315
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,060
I'm like a cyborg.

316
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:51,460
Yeah, well, the thing about a cyborg is it's like not really real and then like a jock

317
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,460
is kind of the realest, coolest thing you can be.

318
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,460
I mean, you're looking at me right now.

319
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,100
Yeah, but I can see you and I don't see any components.

320
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,020
Well, it's underneath my skin, you know.

321
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,260
Well, how about you rip it up because it definitely won't hurt you because you're such a cyborg.

322
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,860
I'm half human so I'll get half hurt. I'll do it after the episode.

323
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,000
You promise? What parts of you are cyborg?

324
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,400

robot. So every part of you is 50% robot.

327
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:27,060
Why are you still blinking? The only way that you're going to prove to us that you're a cyborg.

328
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,500
That's my targeting system. No, you can't blink.

329
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,060
can't blink that's the only way you're gonna look at it you're talking to me

00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,820

Mm-hmm, that's right.

351
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,740
That's right, it's for pedophile perverts.

352
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,020
That's what the bass guitar is.

353
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Listen, the point is...

354
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,140
You're gonna have a lot of unsubscribers after this.

355
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,300
I can tell you that.

356
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,460
Why'd you say you?

357
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,460
You're on the thing too.

358
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,060
We are, and it's gonna be your fault.

359
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,700
Are you leaving the podcast?

360
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,100
I'm starting my own podcast it's called Talkin' Bass.

361
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,100
It's not called Talkin' Bass.

362
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,100
It's gonna be me and Victor Wooten.

363
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,900
It's gonna be me and Victor Wooten.

364
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:28,700
Nobody knows who that is because nobody plays bass guitar.

365
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,700
That's not true.

366
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Victor Wooten plays bass guitar.

367
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,460
No, I'm gonna kill you.

368
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,500
Listen, my neighbor, my dad's his neighbor, he got a bass.

My jock brain can't handle this.

373
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,340
I woke up at 10 in the morning.

374
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,100
You're just jealous because I'm in the band.

375
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,980

381
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:24,100

up your fingers with pert plus and just in the shower go to town on that you

386
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,500
You installed a pickup cover over your asshole.

387
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,500
I did.

388
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,500
That's right.

389
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,500
My neighbor...

390
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,100
Your poop comes out sideways now.

391
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:52,420
My neighbor got a bass and this morning started playing Blister in the Sun, the worst version

392
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:59,020
of Blister in the Sun of all time because it's just bass and just very slowly.

393
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,460
And then I went to Trader Joe's for two hours.

394
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,460
I was gone.

395
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,140
And then I came back and he's still playing it.

396
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,160
And he's been playing it until an hour ago.

397
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
It's five o'clock.

398
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,160
I would never play Blister in the Sun.

399
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,880
from 10 in the morning to 4 p.m. just blistering the sun.

400
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:20,460
All musicians should be homeless. You shouldn't be allowed to live near anybody else if you're

401
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
a musician.

402
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:26,040
Absolutely. Especially bass guitarists and drummers. Those are two instruments that--

403
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,720
No, no, no. And singers, too.

404
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,280
I agree. Singers are very-- yeah, people who sing Hamilton around their apartment should

405
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,800
just be euthanized normally.

406
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
Like theater singers?

407
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,640
- Singers?

408
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,480
- No, just singers.

409
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,300
- Just anybody who's singing.

410
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,440
- Anybody who makes music should not be--

411
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,280
- What about you?

412
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,520
- I don't anymore, I quit.

413
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,360
- He wears headphones though.

414
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,640
- I'm a cyborg, dude, I can't, I don't have like a

415
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,480
creative side anymore.

416
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,000
- He can't think of love, so he can't make any music.

417
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,080
- It's like, instead of music, I'm focusing mostly

418
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,680
on logic nowadays.

419
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,520
- This is gonna be terrible for the battle of the bands.

420
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,280
- Kind of like figuring out different problems and issues.

421
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,360
- Could you be my tutor?

422
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,520
- Yeah.

423
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,360
- Yeah?

424
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,760
- Yeah, do I have to wear a special outfit or anything?

425
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,260
No, but I can't pay you but I just like won't like be the shit. That's fine

426
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,560
I'm gonna like I'm gonna drain money from your savings you you

430
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,200
No, half of my shit will break first of all and second of all

431
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,880
I installed anti swirly shields over all the toilets in the school and in your house and everywhere else

432
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,020
Well, this is gonna be terrible for battle of the bands because I thought Cameron was gonna be in my band

433
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,640
I said we're banning it's not possible

434
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,460
The only instrument is I work at play a cyborg could play a drum machine, but I won't cuz it's against my principles

435
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,020
We're called my band. Our band is called

436
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:55,840

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,720
It's about a boy who can't cry.

464
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
That's me because I'm a jock.

465

We don't need to be all a jock and a goth and a werewolf cyborg.

471

Can we just be friends again?

472
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
Boys don't cry.

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
I'm not a jock.

474
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720

475
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
I'm not a jock.

476
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720

482
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,920

483
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,040
What are you talking about?

484
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,160

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,720
You don't get to be God! You can be Zordon. Silence! You can be Zordon.

491
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,920
Okay if we're me and Cameron are Power Rangers you can be Zordon. I'm the devil

492
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:17,360

493
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:23,000

498
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,020

499
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,140
fuck I'm Batman you can't just be Batman for no reason you have to have a

500
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:56,940
backstory no no no I'm Batman because you get to be one Michael Keaton movie I'm

501
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:05,100
gonna be the other Michael you are Robin okay and I am Robin you're Robin from

502
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:12,340
Howard Stern what's up I'm gonna put you on a Sibian you did she didn't put

503
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,820
people on the Sibian. I'm putting you on the Sibian. She was shocked by people being on

504
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,660
the Sibian if you'd ever fucking listen to Stern. I did. No you didn't. I'm doing my

505
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:26,540
own thing as Robin. What's Howard Stern's last name? Howard Stern. Obama? It's not Obama

506
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:32,100
dude. Did you know Robin dated the guy who did the voice of Special Ed on Crank Yankers?

507
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,300
Really? Yeah. That makes perfect sense. Yeah. Yeah. Did you know that the Crank Yankers

now they were in the muppets you know i was hit they were in the background i

511
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,800

512
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:56,020

Uh, Pat, you're getting another phone call.

568
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:26,600
Hello this is New Hampshire Regional Hospital, this is Patrick Doran.

569
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:32,600
I have some very bad news about your father.

570
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,600
What?

571
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,600
He got shot out of a cannon.

572
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Again?

573
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,600
Again.

574
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,600
It makes sense if your dad was a stunt man

575
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,240
That would make a lot of sense you have like son of stunt man vibe. Yeah, yeah

576
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,520
No, if I was the son of a stuntman, I'd be a businessman cuz I would be like dad. I hate your stunts

577
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,560
Yeah, I don't want to join the family business. I hate the family business

578
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:10,920
I'm a black sheep. I think is not solid. I mean, I ain't steady work. I hate getting a bullseye with my target my target

579
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,560
Hmm. Yeah, come on. I launched into my target. We don't have any money for groceries. Come on, honey

580
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:22,400
I'm just waiting for one more stunt to come through. Oh the Grand Canyon needs to get come on

581
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,400
I just think it's something you're in Canyon and

582
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,360
Then we'll make it

583
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,360
I'll get a grad school

584
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:34,000
If I can catch one knife, okay with the handle this time, it's gonna be big for us

585
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,680
All right, I'm gonna need you to shoot your left to lose

586
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,760
I'm gonna need you to shoot this bullet right at my teeth. I will catch it and it's gonna put our kids to college. So

587
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,260
We're gonna need to make that happen

588
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:51,600
So thank God we're not stuntmen and instead we're podcasters the steadiest income and job you can possibly have

589
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,600
I mean if you think about it

590
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,500
It comes in every month. So it's basically a very regular normal job

591
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,920
Yeah, yeah. Did you guys have any at Christmas? Did you have to talk to any family members about what you do?

592
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,400
But they are now what I do there. Do you know I didn't see any of my extended family nice. Yeah, I mean neither

593
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:17,560
Neither of us are super spreaders, but it's cool. I'm a super spreader. Yeah, I'm super spreading those legs cuz I'm a jock

594
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:23,240
Yeah, you're extended families legs. Yeah, dude. They're extended your grays in North Carolina. It's legal

595
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,720

Those goddamn hippies.

Arizona first cousin marriage is allowed if both parties are 65 or older or one is infertile.

600
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:54,900
Listen, if we're both single by 65 and we're cousins by then, let's get married.

601
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,900
Because it's legal.

602
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,620
Or if one of us is infertile.

You're nobody, you're nothing.

638
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,220
Cousin marriage was legal in all states before the Civil War.

639
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,660
Anthropologist Martin Odenheimer

640
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:52,740
argues that marriage prohibitations were introduced to maintain the social order,

641
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,300
uphold religious morality, and safeguard the creation of fit offspring.

But maybe he has a hidden eye or maybe he's just invincible. Maybe that's why he's so good at stunts.

Question. Okay, I would like to know if me and my first cousin could have a relationship

00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:51,240
no they have a potion out of it I used to mix all sorts of nasty shit and then I

800
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,140
just put in my freezer and my mom be like the fuck is this is a fucking

801
00:48:55,140 --> 00:49:01,860
freezer it's like this brown slide everything green in the freezer I'm a

802
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:07,340
scientist I wish I had still had that like spirit of creativity yeah yeah I put

803
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,400
you put like you put like a flashlight inside of like a toilet paper roll and

804
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:16,340
be like look it's a toilet paper roll that lights up yeah I decided to become

805
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,060
an inventor mom I just took your calculator and unscrewed the back and I

806
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,460
drew I drew a smiley face on it now it doesn't work mom I snapped your

807
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,740
Macbook in half and now it's two computers. You're welcome

808
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:28,740
Easy

809
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,740
That's what I was dude. I just

810
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:37,040
If you cook snow in the oven it gets solid like model magic. Did you ever?

811
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,580
Did you ever put like?

812
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:46,160
Soda in the freezer and then like wait till it froze and then you kind of like you eat it like Italian ice

813
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,760
But you don't know why it's not working like Italian ice. Yes, of course now

814
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:53,160
I did tons of fucked up food things.

815
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,320
I would also eat just dry spaghetti when I was a kid.

816
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,160
- Yeah.

817
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:57,980
- I thought, I was like--

818
00:49:57,980 --> 00:49:58,820
- That's weird.

819
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:01,640
- I thought that that's what farmers had in their mouths.

820
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,800
(laughing)

821
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,580
You know how farmers always chew it on wheat?

822
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,140
I was like, that's spaghetti.

823
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:06,980
That's dry spaghetti.

824
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,760
So I would walk around pretend I was a farmer.

825
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:10,960
Bread tastes good.

826
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:11,780
- Yeah, it's true.

827
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,080
- It probably tastes like bread.

828
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,840
- Probably tastes just like bread.

829
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,280
Damn, I'd go for some wheat right now.

830
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,880
- Yeah, you see a farmer chewing on wheat

831
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,840
with peanut butter and jelly spread on it.

832
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,680
(laughing)

833
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,640
- You think hay tastes good?

834
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,600
- I mean, no, I know hay doesn't taste good.

835
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,960
- Why do them horses go so crazy for that shit?

836
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,240
- Hay.

837
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,080
- Yeah, you like hay?

838
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:31,240
Wait 'til you have a fucking McDouble horse.

839
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,640
(laughing)

840
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,840
- That's true.

841
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,680
- Yeah.

842
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:36,280
- Would you guys eat horse meat?

843
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,120
- Yeah, probably.

844
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:38,700
- Oh, absolutely, probably already done it.

845
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:40,360
I've been to Taco Bell so many times.

846
00:50:40,360 --> 00:50:41,680
- They don't put horse meat,

847
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:43,840
it's so expensive to kill a horse.

848
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:44,680
- No.

849
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:45,500
- Yeah.

850
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,160
- What do you mean it's expensive to kill a horse?

851
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,200
It breaks its leg.

852
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,680
- They are tough to kill.

853
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,080
if it jumps weird you just shoot it in the head

854
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,040
no

855
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:59,840
no yes now you have to convince it to run into something really fast

856
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:03,760
it's hard to it's like a crash test it's like when they're testing cars

857
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,220
they'd use the same track for horses yeah no they'd yeah until like nineteen

858
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:12,160
sixty they just put horses in cars and then just crash them into shit

859
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,360
'cause if a horse dies a human will definitely die in a car

860
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,240
yeah that is not a safe car if a horse died in that car

861
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,240
It's like, that's tough to kill a fucking horse, dude.

862
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,240
That's a tank.

863
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:26,680
Buying a car at a used car dealership and then you're like, "Just one thing, a horse did

864
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:28,120
die in this car."

865
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,200
That's what horsepower is.

866
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:32,240
It's how many horses they killed with that car.

867
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,240
How many horses did they kill?

868
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:34,240
Yeah.

869
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,240
Yeah.

870
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:36,240
This is 800 horsepower.

871
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,600
We crashed this car 800 times with a horse in it.

872
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:39,460
Never died.

873
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:40,460
Pretty impressive shit.

874
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:41,460
If you can crash it 800 times-

875
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:43,720
The car's beat to shit now, though.

876
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:44,720
Yeah.

877
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:45,720
Because they have to do it.

878
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,720
Yeah.

879
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,720
They have to do it for every car.

880
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,720
It's also full of horse shit.

881
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,300
- Yeah, we didn't clean it at all.

882
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,360
All the horses are still in there.

883
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,200
- Yeah.

884
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,020
- Oh, here, okay.

885
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,460
- Hey, your problem now, buddy.

886
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,420
- I found the bonk recipe I was talking to you guys about.

887
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,860
- What is it?

888
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,020
- Okay, it's 7-Up or Sprite,

889
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,100
Coke,

890
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:07,160
Cream Soda,

891
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:09,420
Kinney,

892
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,580
oh, it's a Maltese drink.

893
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,780
If you're living in the USA,

894
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:14,540
Dr. Pepper works just as well.

895
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,780
- Is it a recipe from Malta?

896
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,620
- What the fuck?

897
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:18,460
- Yeah.

898
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,380
Stir these four drinks together until mixed really well.

899
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,220
So there's no Red Bull in it?

900
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,220
Well this is a different one.

901
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,580
This is on the Steam community.

902
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:33,700
The one that I saw does not exist anymore.

903
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,700
Yeah?

904
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,900
It was too fucked up?

905
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:40,540
So someone from, that was a Maltese person that wanted to make Bonk?

906
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,180
Yeah.

907
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,900
I'm trying to find the Bonk that I knew.

908
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:45,900
The really gross one.

909
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:49,420
I mean I don't know anything about Malta at all but as far as I know there's probably just

910
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:52,900
like real life TF2 over there yeah.

911
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,580
It's all just dusty and there's a payload.

912
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,940
That's why he doesn't have a soul.

913
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,060
Yeah, he was a failed spy actually.

914
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:03,100
He's being a spy right now.

915
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:09,500
Yeah, you're just walking around Malta fucking pushing a cart with a giant bomb in it.

916
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,500
Yeah.

917
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:14,540
Sorry I gotta get this out of town pretty fast here.

918
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,040
Yeah.

919
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,040
Avoid that big guy over there.

920
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,540
Alright, here's another one.

921
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:20,540
One pack of black cherry Kool-Aid,

922
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:22,040
two small cans of Red Bull,

923
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:24,040
one full can of Monster Energy,

924
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,040
one bottle or can of Nos,

925
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:28,540
one can of Mountain Dew Kickstarter Fruit Punch flavor,

926
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,040
a pack of Warheads.

927
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,540
So it's any disgusting...

928
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,540
Like, just put anything in it.

929
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:35,040
Bonk can be... It's fucking shit and water.

930
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:35,540
That's what Bonk is.

931
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,040
One bottle of Sprite for fizz,

932
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,540
Juicy Drop Pop.

933
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,540
They put fucking eight energy drinks in it,

934
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:43,540
and they're like, "We need more fizz."

935
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,580
We need Sprite. We need to put Sprite in this because it has to have a fizzy taste.

936
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:54,060
You guys want to make this? Yeah, I'll make it. Yeah, let's make it next time you come to New York.

937
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:59,180
Yeah, just throw up. We have to make Patrick's Delight or whatever it's called.

938
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:02,500
Oh yeah, we have to make all those cocktails. Yeah, we have to at least make Patrick's

939
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:06,660
