1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
The McElroy brothers are not experts and their advice should never be followed.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,640
Travis insists he's a sexpert, but due to pending legal action, he's had to stop saying that.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,720
This show is not for kids. It's for adults who have the brains and bodies of kids.

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,920
What's up freak bitches?

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:47,520
Hey everybody, welcome to My Brother, My Brother and Me.

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,480
I'm your uh, middle-est brother, Griffin McElroy.

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,360
You're the, uh, baby brother.

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,360
I'm your baby brother, Griffin McElroy.

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
I'm the big brother.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm the big brother and it's me, Justin.

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,860
I see, I'm the baby brother, but Justin looks the most like a baby.

12
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,360
I'm kinda like a baby, but like a baby if he grew up.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,860
I'm the middle and the most sexual brother, Travis McElroy.

14
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,360
You are definitely the most sexual brother, Travis.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:16,360
I have a certain charm about me.

16
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,360
It's quickly becoming a problem.

17
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,360
Anyway, welcome to My Brother and My Brother and Me.

18
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,360
We're not gonna talk about that today.

19
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Not right now.

20
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Welcome to My Brother and My Brother and Me.

21
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
An advice show for the

22
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,360
for the modern era.

23
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,360
Today we

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:34,360
um

25
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,360
we

26
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,360
(laughing)

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,360
Today

28
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,360
we have some great questions for you guys.

29
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,360
For us to answer.

30
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,360
You guys send in your questions and we're gonna answer them for you.

31
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,640
So I got some questions.

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
You guys got some questions.

33
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,840
Who wants to go first?

34
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,840
I can go first.

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,200
I have a question here in the inbox.

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,440
Dear Brothers, My wife loves your show.

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,800
I love to listen to it with her.

38
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,620
Only problem is she laughs too much.

39
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:12,440
She has a really loud and annoying laugh and I mean really loud and annoying.

40
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,640
a donkey combined with a baby being sawed in half. I wouldn't have married her if I had

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,240
ever heard her laugh while we were dating. But these kinds of things happen. Anyway,

42
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,400
what are some ways I can stop my wife from laughing?

43
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh boy.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,440
Huh. Um.

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,440
Well.

46
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:39,440
You could put, my only idea is you could put like a big sock in her mouth. Right?

47
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,160
I feel yeah, I was thinking maybe if she was asleep. She wouldn't be laughing. I think yeah

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,600
I think going off of that maybe if she was asleep

49
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,120
Maybe you could put her in some kind of like a cube and you could just have her

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,880
Like when you're listening to the show you can just have her in her cube

51
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,080
or like a big jar or like a

52
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,040
Basically any content you could pin her up to the wall like a butterfly kind of Tupperware

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,840
You could fit your wife into I feel I feel like that's probably gonna be best

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,380
I think the cube is a great idea because basically you I would say no windows in the cube

55
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:20,540
Right, so she can't see that you're having fun and you're laughing. No, you can't right you can't know and and and

56
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:27,560
Completely sealed with obviously enough oxygen to last however long the show is

57
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,220
Probably an hour if you

58
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:37,340
Yeah, it was worth the oxygen sounds and not and not a tiny bit more cuz she'll waste it and then

59
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,680
- But then, you can also put your kids in there too.

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,520
Wives belong in cubes.

61
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
- Mm-hmm.

62
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,360
You could also put her in a basement.

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,280
- Travis, this has to be--

64
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,160
- That's one of the rooms where if you put someone in there--

65
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,100
- You have to stop talking about the basement.

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,380
We're gonna get fired from Polygon.

67
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,180
The fellas at Polygon are gonna be really mad at us

68
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,260
for that one.

69
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,280
- Yeah, we're not gonna get any more monster factories.

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,760
- Well, I don't work at Polygon

71
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,620
because I'm not smart enough to play video games.

72
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,060
You guys know you're the intelligent ones who are playing.

73
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,560
- I think the last time you tried to pick up a controller,

74
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,840
you got so mad you threw it in the wall like a boomerang.

75
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,680
- That's true.

76
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,120
A lot of people don't know this about Travis,

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,080
but he has a giant bone that goes

78
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,400
through the middle of his head

79
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,520
and sticks out either side like Frankenstein's bolt.

80
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,840
- It looks like Steve Lawson with the bow,

81
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,440
or the arrow, but instead of the arrow,

82
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,280
it's a bone and it's round.

83
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,980
- I just, I couldn't help throwing the controller

84
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,540
the wall because I was trying to play the Sims and I made only women in the game

85
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,500
this town didn't function I got so mad I threw it at the wall because a town made

86
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,000
of women should function better not not at all. I agree I agree or people who are

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,900
somewhere in between like us. We hatched out of eggs. Yeah our dad laid a big egg

88
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:03,660
and all three of us came out. Our big gay southern dad laid a giant egg and we

89
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,380
were all born at the same time.

90
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,380
Mm-hmm.

91
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,900
That's why we don't have a mom.

92
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,340
That's why we were born at the age of 35.

93
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,340
Yeah.

94
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,340
Basically.

95
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,540
You could try laying an egg onto your wife.

96
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,540
That's good too.

97
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,060
I mean, you put your wife in an egg like Yoshi?

98
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,500
She might hatch after a while, but you get some good time to listen to your podcasts

99
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
and your--

100
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,540
Or you could stick an egg in her mouth like a ball gag and make her go outside for an

101
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,540
hour.

102
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,840
mouth the egg in her mouth and then wait till the chicken hatches. The chicken

103
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,100
will rip her jaw open. All right I feel like we answered that question to a

104
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:45,020
acceptable level. Yeah hopefully that's helpful. The cube. The cube, the egg, the

105
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:50,660
basement. So I actually have another question also from the from the inbox

106
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:57,700
directed especially to us brothers. All right it's from Stu and he says. Hi Stu.

107
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,540
- Hi, Stu. - Hello.

108
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,380
- Hey, Stu.

109
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,060
- Hey, how you doing?

110
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,980
- Dear brothers, this is Stu.

111
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,420
Me and my wife have been married for 20 years.

112
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:06,560
Our marriage is great.

113
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,260
She has a very tight hoo-ha

114
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:10,740
and I've always found her extremely attractive.

115
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:13,140
Parentheses, we have sex about twice a month.

116
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,060
She is insatiable.

117
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,820
I, like many of your listeners, am a hardcore gamer.

118
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,360
But recently, I've been going back

119
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,620
and playing some classics that I missed over the years

120
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,360
as I mostly play Pokemon games, Animal Crossing,

121
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,120
and picto-chat with my daughter's friends.

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,720
One of these games I've been playing is Halo, an absolutely terrifying horror game for the

123
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,720
Xbox.

124
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,800
Now, I did not enjoy the game, but after finishing the campaign, all I can think about all day

125
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,600
at my WeWork cube is that blue mink's Cortana.

126
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:47,440
She's taken over my every thought, as if I am Spartan 117 and she is installed in my

127
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,680
helmet.

128
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,940
It's bizarre, because I don't usually have fantasies about women, unless you count those

129
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,860
choice Looney Tunes episodes where Bugs Bunny dresses in drag.

130
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,640
It wouldn't be a problem, except it's starting to interfere in my marriage.

131
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,920
At first, I couldn't help myself from saying little subtle comments like "Hey, what if

132
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:08,900
you were a blue female artificial intelligence?"

133
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,200
But I'm afraid it's escalated since then.

134
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:16,400
I am now dosing my wife with 3mg of chemical silver in her morning coffee in an attempt

135
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
to turn her skin a more bluish tone.

136
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,600
I realize this is morally wrong, but I cannot control my own impulses to bust a creamy load

137
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,680
inside of Cortana and watch it fall through her holographic body.

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,320
Brothers, my question is, how do you get over a girl?

139
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,560
It's not possible.

140
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,760
Honestly, I feel, first of all, I don't think you should have been playing that game.

141
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,560
I think you should have done a little bit more research.

142
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
I'm almost certain that's an M-rated game.

143
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
Yeah, I'm...

144
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,120
which is M means mass shooter which is why they have so many guns in those games

145
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,080
that's what people don't realize is that they're training you. Master Chief is actually one of

146
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,600
the most one most despicable mass murderers in history. They don't say it I

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,160
mean I working at Polygon I had to read up on video game lore I did learn that

148
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,160
that his name is actually Spartan John 117 Dylan Klebold.

149
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,040
- Oh my God.

150
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,760
- Yeah, that's what I heard.

151
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:24,760
- I just wanted to answer your questions, Stu.

152
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,600
I think one way you can actually avoid getting over a girl

153
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,080
is every time that you have a girl

154
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,680
or whatever you would like to call it,

155
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,160
you can kind of take on one of her characteristics

156
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,000
one maybe a one item of her clothing or perhaps a style of makeup and you kind

157
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,100
of just keep building that on to your person and then you never really have to

158
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:52,140
give up any of the any of the women that you have have conquered in the past you

159
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,840
kind of just become them in in a kind of outward sort of way and I mean that's

160
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,960
not something that I have any experience with in any way but it sounds like you

161
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:10,080
absorb your victims like the Soul Calibur sword? No I find often I just like to

162
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,600
you know inhabit the skin of a woman and you know suck the the essence from their

163
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:23,400
bones and into my mohawk but it's oh that you know it's it's what girl did

164
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:34,320
you steal the mohawk from Roxanne Gay? It was uh that was actually one of my

165
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:44,680
friend's mother's. Roxanne Gay is your friend's mom? Yeah. That's crazy. Travis had sex with

166
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:50,920
Rhea Butcher and now he looks like that. It's a it's just it's not say it's a

167
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,160
transfer of essences I would prefer that's my bad for two hours my wife

168
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,280
feel like that's just more that's more of a PC term my wife on the medical field

169
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,520
I've heard of this transfer of essence before I've she deals with that almost

170
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,120
daily I've heard I've heard her have several loud conversations with people

171
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,880
in kiosks at the mall about it that's my wife yeah I saw your wife yelling at a

172
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,760
young Dominican man in the mall for selling fake Rolexes the other week and

173
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:27,160
I said yes Queen mm-hmm yeah I saw her hitting a little boy over the head while

174
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,180
he was trying to shine her shoes that's my wife she's a girl boss that's my my

175
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:38,000
sister-in-law I would love to take on one of her characteristics I don't do

176
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,840
that I'm sorry no I'm gonna come over to your house actually later tonight no I'm

177
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,260
- No, no, no, no.

178
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,480
- We're brothers, we share everything.

179
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,600
We share our wives' characteristics.

180
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
Justin.

181
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,520
- I don't think.

182
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,360
- Justin!

183
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,180
- I don't think that's gonna happen.

184
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,800
- Travis, remember what dad said

185
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,760
about you speaking in a man's voice.

186
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,920
- Count to 10, Travis.

187
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,640
- Count to 10, look at your nails.

188
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,120
Look at your nails, Travis.

189
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,920
- Oh, they're so beautiful.

190
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,680
- They're so beautiful and galaxy printed.

191
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,560
- I'm dazzled.

192
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,160
- Look at your pineapple shirt and calm down.

193
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,560
The pineapple represents the shape of my penis and that's why it always calms me down to

194
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,560
look at.

195
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,560
Thanks fellas.

196
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
Of course.

197
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,560
I needed that.

198
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Anything for my brother.

199
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,760
Alright, let's move on to the next question here.

200
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,120
This one, oh it's from our good friend, it's from our good friend Lin-Manuel Miranda.

201
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,080
Oh Lin, hey buddy.

202
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm actually, I'm very excited to read this.

203
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,720
I haven't seen Lin since me and him marathon my crazy ex-girlfriend on Easter Sunday.

204
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,640
Oh I was there but I was outside.

205
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,640
You were in the cube.

206
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,640
I was under the couch.

207
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Yeah I was in the cube.

208
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,920
I understand that when I watch that show I laugh too loud and you have to put me in my

209
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,600
cube but that's fine.

210
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:01,240
We had to keep Travis under the couch so that he wouldn't sing along.

211
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:07,080
I was singing along anyway, but the piece of cloth you put in my mouth did muffle it quite

212
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,080
a bit.

213
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:16,620
Alright, so the question here from Lynn is, "How do I get the stain out of my wife's carpet?"

214
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,840
I was eating a bowl of chili and I got it on her carpet.

215
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,960
Do any of you guys have experience with this?

216
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,080
With this one?

217
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,960
I know I spill chili on the carpet all the time.

218
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:41,760
I feel it's very easy, I mean I do leave the room and I'm screaming crying once I spill

219
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:49,880
the chili and I come back and my wife's already had it cleaned by the time I get back in.

220
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
So I don't know how she does it.

221
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,760
I just turn the carpet into a dress.

222
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,760
Okay.

223
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,240
Oh yeah, it'd be a cool little pattern on one of Travis's famous dresses.

224
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,320
It looks like a period stain.

225
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
Which is good.

226
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
Which I find very empowering to myself.

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,600
Sometimes I sit around and think about the fact that I will never experience the beauty of a female period.

228
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,600
And I cry, and I cry.

229
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,800
I laugh.

230
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,800
I just eat chili.

231
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
[laughing]

232
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,360
What does your doctor wife have to say about your diet, Justin?

233
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:31,420
It's fine. It's mostly chili. Your entirely chili diet? I got breakfast chili, I got

234
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:37,580
lunch chili, I got dinner chili, and I do have snack chili in a tube. So do you have

235
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,280
is there now here's the most important question is there a dessert chili? Oh

236
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:49,180
there it's called ice cream. Basically if you look at every food as

237
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,180
as just a different type of chili, then you'll be healthy.

238
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,180
- Then you can acquire the perfect male body.

239
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,020
- Mm-hmm.

240
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,820
- As you obviously have.

241
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,700
- Mm-hmm.

242
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,420
- And the perfect wife.

243
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,820
- Yes.

244
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,220
- She's so beautiful.

245
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,900
She's so beautiful.

246
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,620
- Yeah, I'm coming over tonight, Justin.

247
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,420
We're not done with this conversation.

248
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,260
I'm gonna be-- - Look, you can come over,

249
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,340
you can have some chili.

250
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,980
- I'm gonna absorb your wife's characteristics.

251
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,100
- I, you can absorb her chili, I can tell you that.

252
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,100
I'll absorb her chili.

253
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,100
Well that's all you're going to absorb.

254
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,100
I'm going to absorb all of her chili.

255
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,100
Nope.

256
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,100
And you know what, and Griffin knows exactly what I mean by that because I did that to his wife as well.

257
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,100
I do know what he means and my wife has never been the same.

258
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Okay, next question.

259
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Next question. Travis, you have a question over there?

260
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,100
Yeah, from the inbox.

261
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:47,900
from the inbox here, this is from uh...

262
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,260
uh...

263
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,820
it doesn't have a name, and no name

264
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,740
Anonymous

265
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:57,100
Hey there Anonymous!

266
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,600
I-

267
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,760
Hello Anonymous!

268
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,140
I think the homeless guy who sits outside my apartment complex is inhabited by a demon

269
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:11,580
How can I get rid of him without being noticed by the authorities or by my four uncles whom I live with?

270
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:14,560
Well

271
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:22,040
Well first off Anonymous, I really respect your work in leaking Jennifer

272
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,920
Lawrence's nude photos. But moving on from that, most homeless people are actually

273
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,340
inhabited by demons. That is true. A lot of people don't know this. That's why

274
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,680
they love to scream in made-up languages like Chinese. So that's why they're

275
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,760
homeless. That's why they're homeless because demons, you almost never get a job.

276
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:49,840
I think, um, I think right now, and this is just based off of information I got from the

277
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:57,800
medical professionals I know, you need to stay inside because of this crazy virus.

278
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,520
Oh yeah, we haven't talked about the virus, huh?

279
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I think dad has.

280
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,920
There's a crazy virus on Travis's computer that keeps sending messages to women.

281
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:14,480
I yeah that's the virus we're talking about yeah it's called the it's called

282
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:23,880
the kovat under 19 and it's a real problem I don't know who programmed it or

283
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:31,060
who put it on to my computer and phone and every piece of a lace so yeah I'd

284
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,280
appreciate if you don't actually send us questions anonymous because I'm rather

285
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:39,820
myth. Yeah let's just go on to another question then. I have another question

286
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:46,420
from the inbox. Okay all right let's read it. This one is from Brutus. Hey Brutus.

287
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,160
He says, "I am in the United States military serving our country for the

288
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,660
last seven years. I have vaporized countless Iraqi civilians in my tours

289
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,240
overseas protecting us from the wrath of their rocks and their sticks. But one

290
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,720
One specific memory keeps me up at night.

291
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,880
One time, one of our bomb-sniffing dogs broke his tooth while eating the face off of a child

292
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,700
who was begging for his mom, which we thought was the word "bomb."

293
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,920
After opening fire on the terrorist child, I was forced to also put down the poor little

294
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,720
pupperino as his broken tooth left him useless to us as a monstrous terror to the Iraqi people.

295
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:29,640
Brothers, how do you deal with regret?

296
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,520
I live with no regrets so I can't answer this question.

297
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:39,400
The only regret I've ever had in my life was letting Travis convince us to put him on this

298
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,280
podcast.

299
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,520
I externalize my regret onto other people and I ignored that last comment.

300
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,200
That's an advanced move, Travis.

301
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Points!

302
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,160
Yeah, I actually have a little closet in my house I call the regret chamber that I use

303
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,680
to externalize my regret onto people.

304
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,760
I styled after the the chokie from Matilda I've heard. Yeah the chokie from Matilda.

305
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,720
One of my first crush my celebrity crushes was Matilda. When you were when

306
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,360
that movie came out? Yeah a few weeks ago. But that poor little doggo. That is such a

307
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,240
disgusting story to me. The idea that you would ever have to put down a poor little

308
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,680
doggo for any reason whatsoever. You could have shipped it back in a box. Exactly. You

309
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,380
could have given it to us. I would have gladly taken him. I would have turned him into the

310
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:39,660
best chili you've ever had. Boys, what is your biggest regret in life? I've already said

311
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:46,660
I have no regrets. That can't be true. I can't actually speak on my biggest regret because

312
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,940
It's still, we're still discussing it in a courtroom situation, so I'm actually not supposed

313
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:54,740
to share any details about that at this moment.

314
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,340
As Travis's lawyer, I concur.

315
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:04,180
I have to sit in the cube in the courtroom because I'm too, I'm too loud.

316
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,520
You breathe too loud.

317
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,740
You smack your bowl of chili too loud.

318
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,920
I'm in the back of the courtroom, I'm eating chili.

319
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,380
You drum on your stomach like a bongos and your wife says, "This does not relieve stress."

320
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,700
and she yells at you and you guys were asked to leave the courtroom.

321
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:25,580
Yeah, that did happen and I think that might be my only regret.

322
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:31,060
Justin, you have to stop using your enormous steel belly like King K. Rool.

323
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:39,980
To reflect projectiles. Yeah, reject women's advances. Who has another

324
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:50,540
question I have I have one here from from Caleb this is well it's not really a

325
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:56,260
question but it's in the inbox here it's kind of it's one line it just says it

326
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:01,940
says my dog won't stop sucking my dick in my sleep all I would say about this

327
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,020
one is that God works in mysterious ways you know and we here at my brother my

328
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,460
brother me believe in God and we believe in his plan for the world so if you wake

329
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,180
up every morning and you have just a slopping wet fucking dog job on your

330
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:22,100
penis maybe it was meant to be that's true yeah yeah that's that's beautiful

331
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:28,420
maybe that puppers hungry right right maybe it doesn't know who are you to

332
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,180
deny a little doggo doesn't help that I've been leaving the bowls of chili

333
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:39,260
near my penis. It doesn't help that I've been sipping my penis in dog food as a way to make it

334
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:44,260
absolutely disgusting to myself so I don't touch it when I when I read our

335
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,100
email. That might be oversight on my part. Mm-hmm. Is that all of our questions?

336
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:55,220
That's all the ones in my inbox. I have one question here. It's actually from a

337
00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:02,660
picture I found. Oh great. It's from a picture it says let me let me find this

338
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:11,380
picture real quick. How about we okay it says here it says it's got a picture of

339
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:17,660
a guy and it says interesting it's a picture of a guy and he's got a scary

340
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:31,660
face and it says it says Nutella why you no last forever that's a great point

341
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:38,460
that's why why you no last forever I would say this one is definitely geared

342
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:44,060
more towards Justin than us Travis see I think that if maybe Nutella made an

343
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:50,660
infinite jar then maybe we could get an infinity jar of Nutella.

344
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:58,100
An infinity jar of Nutella. Mm-hmm. Huh. That's not bad. That's a good idea.

345
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,260
That's pretty good. We should make an animatic of that. We should, yeah. Now that's funny.

346
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,900
We should have one of our middle school fans make a little video about this.

347
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,340
Yes. We should make the Nutella a character in our D&D campaign.

348
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,820
I think this little guy here who's saying "Why you know" looks pretty funny. I think maybe

349
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,620
we could have him on the show. As one of our guest experts.

350
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,100
I think maybe we could bring him on. I think we gotta find his information. This little

351
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:33,100
guy. This little white man. If anyone can find the information of the little

352
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:40,460
white little white man please message us at little white man at gmail.com did you

353
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,820
say white man Griffin that's Griffin's email little white man at gmail.com he

354
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:55,100
made it in fourth grade I am NOT white I am gay thank you very much yeah I stopped

355
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,980
being white when I dyed my hair purple I'm an elf now Travis I've been meaning

356
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,940
to tell you I think you look amazing with a sort of dreadlock beehive haircut mm-hmm

357
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,860
I think maybe if you dyed your skin yellow and wore a green dress and got big

358
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,660
blue hair I think that's maybe a good might be the next logical step yeah and

359
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:20,900
a big red necklace I'm willing to make myself look like anything to challenge

360
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,540
the patriarchy mm-hmm let's take down the patriarchy once and for all by all

361
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:36,620
dressing up like the Simpsons. 3, 2, 1. It's gone. We took it down. It doesn't exist anymore.

362
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:48,620
We got him.

363
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,540
We should play some D&D. Yeah, let's play right now. Let's play a round of D&D. You

364
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,380
You guys ready?

365
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,980
- All right, yeah.

366
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,820
- Okay.

367
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,240
All right, so I'll DM.

368
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,440
How's that sound?

369
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,280
- Yeah.

370
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,100
- Okay.

371
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,800
- Travis got in trouble for DMs.

372
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,960
(laughing)

373
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,280
- No, that was the virus.

374
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,120
- Oh, okay.

375
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,800
- We're not, I thought we weren't discussing the details.

376
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:21,720
- Justin, you don't know how to shut your big fat trap,

377
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,560
do you?

378
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,560
I'm sorry.

379
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Set the scene.

380
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Okay.

381
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
Paint a picture with words.

382
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,560
You wake up.

383
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:28,560
It's a polygon offices.

00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
Have sex with female employee.

386
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,560

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Have sex with female employee.

388
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,560

Have sex with female employee.

390
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,560
You have to roll.

391
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,560
It's 320s.

392
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Okay.

393
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,560
Have sex with female employee.

394
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Okay, hold on.

00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,560
Travis successfully has sex with female employee.

400
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,560
Travis successfully has sex with female employee.

401
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
Travis successfully has sex with female employee.

402
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,560

Travis successfully has sex with female employee.

405
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,880
Travis successfully has sex with a female employee.

406
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,360
Hold on, wait, she has to roll a defense roll.

407
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,200
Hold on.

408
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,460
(laughing)

409
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,540
It's a one.

410
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,760
- Oh, God.

411
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,920
- Travis successfully has sex with female employee.

412
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,460
- See, that's why we haven't played in a long time

413
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,960
because he keeps doing that.

414
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,320
I think he's got some loaded dice.

415
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,140
Travis, let me see your dice.

416
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,880
- No.

417
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,080
- Travis, give me your dice.

418
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,840
They're in storage.

419
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,680
- No, you had to roll them.

420
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,520
- I put them in storage after I rolled.

421
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,640
No, they're not, you don't see, no.

422
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,040
- Let me see your dice.

423
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,880
- Why?

424
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
- I need to see them.

425
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,540
- Why, why?

426
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,200
- Give me your dice right now.

427
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,600
Right now, give me your dice.

428
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,440
Give me your dice.

429
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,260
- No.

430
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,100
- Give me them.

431
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,940
- Fine, here.

432
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,240
- Travis, this has all 20s on it.

433
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,760
- You're like Two-Face.

434
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,800
- Is that not supposed to be all 20s?

435
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,080
- No, use this dice.

436
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,880
Okay, all right, now you have this die, all right?

437
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,800
So I'm gonna make you re-roll.

438
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,640
Okay? - Okay.

439
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,800
- You have to roll to have sex with the female employee.

440
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,640
- Mm-hmm. - Roll.

441
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,720
- It's a one.

442
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,080
- All right, now we can go on with the game.

443
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,280
- All right, doing good so far, Travis.

444
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,840
- I hate this game.

445
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:10,840
- Okay, so you unsuccessfully try to have sex

446
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:14,240
with a female employee, which is almost worse.

447
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,480
(laughing)

448
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:23,440
She complains to HR and now they want to cancel Monster Factory!

449
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,840
Oh no!

450
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,640
I'm glad Monster Factory is getting cancelled.

451
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,640
It's not getting cancelled.

452
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,840
You guys wouldn't let me on it anyway.

453
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,840
It's not getting cancelled.

454
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,320
We make you in the show all the time.

455
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,360
Justin, what do you do?

456
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,320
The boss just came to you and said, "We're going to cancel Monster Factory because your

457
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,840
Your brother tried to have sex with one of our employees in the middle of the office.

458
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,720
Offer boss a bowl of chili.

459
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,680
Okay you have to roll for it.

460
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,040
Do a chili check.

461
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
17.

462
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,980
It's a 17.

463
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,680
The boss graciously accepts your offer and says listen as long as you keep that chili

464
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,000
coming your brother can do whatever the fuck he wants man.

465
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,160
This is the best day ever.

466
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,120
And this is why we like working at Polygon.

467
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:20,680
He says, "As long as this doesn't leak to girls on Twitter with short hair, we're fine."

468
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Mm-hmm.

469
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:31,480
All right, now, Travis, you have been let out of your containment chamber at the Polygon

470
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:40,080
offices, and someone comes up to you and says, "Travis, Travis, we need you to wear a dress

471
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,920
a sexy photoshoot for the Polygon calendar.

472
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,200
Wear dress.

473
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,360
Wear dress?

474
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,360
Wear dress.

475
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,440
Okay, you wear the dress.

476
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:57,440
They also say, "We need you to cut off your penis for the sexy photoshoot calendar."

477
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,520
Cut off penis and keep it in a jar on my bedside table.

478
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,240
You have to defense check to see if you live.

479
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,880
That's a 100.

480
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,840
These dice are loaded, man.

481
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,480
I had a bonus on it.

482
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
I have a bonus.

483
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,440
You don't have a bonus on defense.

484
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,840
I had a...

485
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,220
What gives you the defense bonus?

486
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,220
Your nail polish?

487
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,800
Look, he painted his nails to look like dice.

488
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:32,080
I have feminine fingers that let me roll the dice more better.

489
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,800
He painted his nails to look like dice and he's counting the numbers on the nails.

490
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,800
That's separate.

491
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:44,960
say 10 on them and he's got 10 fingers. I don't have 10 fingers. Yes what? You guys are just

492
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:52,800
like. I'm looking at him right now. Regardless, apparently the woman said to cut off your

493
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,160
penis as a joke. You took her seriously and now you're bleeding all over the polygon offices.

494
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:03,840
I always believe women. It doesn't matter if it was a joke or not. Okay, regardless, they

495
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,760
They say you have to get out of the offices, you're bleeding all over the other rapists

496
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,680
who work here.

497
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:18,240
So they kick you out of the office and you walk out onto the street, okay?

498
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Go back in with a gun.

499
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,080
You don't have a gun.

500
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,960
Why not?

501
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,440
Because they did a background check on you.

502
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,960
Make a gun out of my severed penis.

503
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
What does it shoot?

504
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,720
Sperm.

505
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,280
You can still make sperm.

506
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,520
My penis can't, I can't anymore.

507
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:48,120
Okay, you walk back in and you start shooting sperm at people with your disembodied member.

508
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,560
Who do you go after first?

509
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
Me or Justin?

510
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,560
Justin.

511
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,560
Justin.

512
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
Okay.

513
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Why?

514
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,560
Justin, you have to defense roll.

515
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
Your brother is shooting his penis at you.

516
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
I got a one.

517
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Travis?

518
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,440
I don't like playing this game anymore.

519
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Yeah, this is boring.

520
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,440
Fine. I'll try to do something fun with you guys and you guys spit in my face just like dad does.

521
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,440
Whatever.

522
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,440
I don't give a fuck anymore.

523
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,440
I quit, man. I quit this podcast.

524
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
Yeah, why don't we just drop the fucking voices, okay?

525
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,440
We're only doing these voices so people will listen to the show.

526
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
I mean, if we're not gonna be brothers anymore, I mean...

527
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Oh my god, this is like the worst day ever.

528
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Jesus Christ, dude.

529
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,480
Travis, will you stop being a gay bitch on every episode?

530
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,160
Wait, uh, fuck.

531
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,560
The contract says I have to be gay.

532
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
You wrote the contract!

533
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,520
When we signed that fucking billion year contract, I didn't think it was gonna be this long.

534
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,640
Oh my god, dude, I just wanna vote for Trump.

535
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,120
Can I just fucking vote for Donald Trump?

536
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,640
Can I fucking...

537
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,080
Can I just fucking get a bride and sick of eating all this chili?

538
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,200
It's destroying my fucking home.

539
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,520
It's destroying my house. There's so many fucking bowls of chili.

540
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,600
Justin, you used to be by far the most athletic of the three of us.

541
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,300
Oh my god. My name's not even Justin. It's Frank Rizzo.

542
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,500
Sorry, I got so caught up in the character.

543
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,200
Sometimes I forget we're not brothers at all.

544
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,100
Yeah, we're just tall guys.

545
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,200
We were just found by that old gay southern man like Master Splinter

546
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:26,900
and turned into a team of homosexual podcasters.

547
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,400
Yeah.

548
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:27,900
Ugh.

549
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,400
And...

550
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,100
And justinate the fourth one.

551
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,800
I just wanna go back to Hoboken!

552
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,300
Soon.

553
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,800
I just wanna go back to Hoboken, Jersey!

554
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,900
Soon.

555
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:36,700
Very soon.

556
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:41,500
As soon- again, as soon as arbitration is finished in Travis' case, we should be okay.

557
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
We can drop the act.

558
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,300
Ugh.

559
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:47,100
Alright, wait, are we still recording?

560
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,600
Oh, fuck.

561
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Wait, before- before we go, I just wanna say, in regards to the allegations,

562
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,200
I just wanna remind everybody, uh,

563
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Believe men who dress like women.

564
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
Believe Travis.
