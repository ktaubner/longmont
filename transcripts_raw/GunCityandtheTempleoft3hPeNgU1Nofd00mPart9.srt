[MUSIC]

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Last time on Gun City and the Temple of Tepenguin of Doom.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Our heroes awoke from a horrendous crash into the soy wastes

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
after narrowly escaping the Kinbone officers in Gadsven.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Greeting them were their adventurer pals Rex and Marie Stain

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
who nursed them back to health using the warm and voluminous yeti skin.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Leading them to the Wendig Station, the gang performed their tried and true method

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
of pretending to be arcade game repairmen to sneak on to the first class cabin.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Sullivan, stocking coach, befriended Leroy Peanutbutter and his 299 mice wives

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and the one human one, and his larger hobo community of rejected Ken Bones and Robins.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sullivan was asked to sneak up front and bring back real food for these less fortunate, and he accepted the task more or less.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Meanwhile, the party ran into their old friend Gary C. Enterprise, who introduced them to the newfound wealth they received from the cold dogs and hot soda business.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Also, they finally met Snoochie Boochies, who it turns out is the last of the Tamagotchis, and wishes to restore his people, using the N-word pass.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,480
boys agreed to help him and trick their benefactor, Leo the Collector, into receiving a phony

15
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,080
pass after they get the real one for Snoochy Boochies.

16
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:36,240
Finally, after the Ken Bone officers tried and tried to kidnap the boys, Sullivan the

17
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,120
Frog's terrible stealth abilities led to their undoing and an ambush that may end their lives

18
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,120
once and for all.

19
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,120
So yeah, let's roll for initiative.

20
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,120
Oh, I have not rolled, huh?

21
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:54,120
Alright, I will roll right now.

22
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Can I roll again?

23
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Hell no!

24
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
No.

25
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Damn.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
Fuck you.

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
That's yours.

28
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,120
I got a 7.

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,120
That is Sullivan's initiative.

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,120
Oh my god, Sullivan also got a 1.

31
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Sullivan and Patrick both got 1s.

32
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
Not our finest rolls.

33
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,120
That's because I'm impersonating him. I'm doing everything he's doing.

34
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,120
Let's see how... Alright, well, Snoochy Boochies did well.

35
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:29,120
Alright, so let me just crank out this order here, and then we'll get started.

36
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,120
Well, okay, yeah, and then the Ken Bones. Okay, yeah. Alright, cool.

37
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,120
Regardless, Snoochy Boochies is gonna go first.

38
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,480
So you see the Ken bones dive in and Stoogey Boogey sort of like looks around and surveys the situation

39
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:48,860
And he like looks to you guys. He says are they after you?

40
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,560
No

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,160
They're after

42
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,680
They're after you. Hold on. Oh, hold on. I could have all right there after

43
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,600
shit

44
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,360
Yeah, they're after shit

45
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
That's why they're running towards the bathroom. Mm-hmm

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,040
Okay, they seem like they're after you

47
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,220
That's up for I don't know why they would be I

48
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:18,520
Can't remember anything we did wrong me neither didn't we?

49
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:27,880
Wait Sullivan there after you cuz you came to first class

50
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:35,620
Yeah, what do you do hey, I'm gonna run as soon as it's my turn stop

51
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,520
Okay

52
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,520
Why are you sounded like me now? I don't remember

53
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:47,660
Okay, well in that case, I guess all we need to do is sit tight and he just doesn't take his turn he just chills

54
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:56,580
Okay, I think I'm gonna stop being Sullivan real quick he's got a wait until Sullivan's turn and he'll run away

55
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,960
okay, and

56
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,960
now it is

57
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,960
Who got a you got a 17 right? Yeah, but toss it's your turn

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,260
Why are the Ken, but what I don't remember what's going on.

59
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,660
Yeah.

60
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,660
Yeah.

61
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,360
I have no clue.

62
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:11,660
What's that?

63
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,460
What are the Ken bones actually after us?

64
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:13,760
I don't.

65
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,160
Yes.

66
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,160
Yeah, they're so so they they came to the like train station like

67
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,560
outside their jurisdiction to chase you because of like what you

68
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,260
guys did.

69
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,860
Oh, the shake up because of the chase sequence.

70
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,060
Yeah, okay.

71
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,260
You guys murdered several bones and defiled one of them that was

72
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,160
shaped like a ramp.

73
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,160
We just used him.

74
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
It's not defilement.

75
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Yeah, you don't defile your micro.

76
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
That's not what his therapist called it, okay?

77
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
He's dealing with this in his own time.

78
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,160
He's fine.

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
Alright, well, I guess...

80
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,160
How many are there? There's two or three.

81
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
So, there's three that you can see, but roll a perception check.

82
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,160
Okay. There's a guy right here.

83
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,160
So there's more than three, is what I'm getting from this.

84
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:16,640
this

85
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,240
That's what he's doing.

86
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,240
You got a 23.

87
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,040
Okay.

88
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,540
Yeah.

89
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:26,040
So blowtoss you kind of survey the situation and you're looking

90
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,540
sort of like up towards the further cars and back towards

91
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,040
the water cars and you're realizing that like they're not

92
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:37,640
going to stop coming like there's a lot of them on this

93
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,140
train.

94
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,940
All right, and the three you're seeing here are the three who

95
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,140
could fit in the car into violence.

96
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:53,740
How far are we to getting to our destination?

97
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,140
Yeah, that's a good question.

98
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:02,340
So you're probably about half an hour away from Wutown station.

99
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,540
By foot? By train.

100
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,540
How long by foot?

101
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,640
Probably about like three hours,

102
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,240
but then also you have to deal with the cold of the soy wastes.

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,740
so you take damage over time.

104
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,940
What are you going to do jump off the train?

105
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,220
Well, I mean, yeah, what are there are infinite Ken bones

106
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,320
that are going to come and kill are they infinite not

107
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,740
infinite.

108
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,240
How would you know that there were countless or something?

109
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,540
There's just a lot.

110
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,140
They're not going to stop coming is what I said.

111
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,640
You said they're not going to stop coming.

112
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,940
That means infinite.

113
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,840
Well, you know, at a certain point what that means.

114
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,040
Yeah, wait to run out of how how how far are we?

115
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,080
or three hours away by foot

116
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,520
we need to which frankly is is a crazy that there's only a half an hour by

117
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,020
traded three hours by foot is a crazy said there's only

118
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,440
uh... it's a very slow train

119
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,380
he said that this is a three can fit in it right now right

120
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,700
yes i would like a show a little for

121
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,080
with and we have we need to shrink the train

122
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,000
that's a good idea

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,200
all i have got i agree it's barricade the doors

124
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,260
so nobody else none of the others can get in

125
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,440
i'm sure they'll they'll play of people waiting for us we get a guy i i a

126
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,180
was on my turn

127
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,740
but i have a lot of you tell me what

128
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,880
tom i'm gonna do i'm gonna nail sullivan to the

129
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,320
opening of the door

130
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,900
uh...

131
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,920
are there any like loose planks are the benches on the investigation check to

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,120
see what you can see

133
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,680
for this will be mostly return though by the way uh...

134
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,340
yet so you can see that their that the windows you could

135
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,660
break the windows

136
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,120
for sure and in can climb up that way

137
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,640

00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,880
Yeah, you're fine. Ray William Johnson. It's just cold as shit cuz you're a demon

175
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,920
But you're okay

176
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,260
Yeah, you could teleport back down and that's your turn. I'll say

177
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,460
Basically, you just like did a couple checks. We'll consider the teleport your movement

178
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,940
You should lower your techno slime points as well -

179
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,840
Why or do we have every time? Oh, no, we don't you just tell I just get to do it as much as I want you really

180
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,700
I fucked up probably the biggest balance fuck up. You've ever one of the biggest

181
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:50,680
Yeah, I just sometimes you just get distracted I forgot about this in the gun city campaign the first one I

182
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:59,520
Became allergic to the Sun. Oh, yeah, I just completely forgot. Okay. Do you should I start being allergic to the

183
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
I want that thing.

184
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:07,600
That was it was a different guy who was allergic to the sun. Right, right. It's your twin. Uh, I know I think

185
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,760
Maybe it's something carry around maybe it's like a

186
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,160
Psychosomatic thing where I didn't re until I remember that i'm allergic to the sun. I don't actually feel the effects

187
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,660
Okay, but I did I have now remembered

188
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,080
Okay. Yeah, so we'll deal with that too. Okay, I do take damage from that. Um, just try it back

189
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,880
Yeah

190
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,260
uh... and now it is the can bones turn so they're gonna run up

191
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:37,340
uh... thereby passing solvent now i mean they

192
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,940
they're gonna

193
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,580
they'll deal with him later

194
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,340
uh... but you're not here anymore

195
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,240
uh...

196
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,140
uh... so they're gonna go after you patrick you know that i can bones

197
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,420
there uh... to get their their little can bone but times

198
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,540
uh...

199
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,860
and they just get it he gets a crit one he literally falls prone

200
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,700
he tries to hit you any just like

201
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,500
with so hard he spins around and falls on his ass.

202
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,500
He's on the ground.

203
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,500
So he didn't do it.

204
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
So me just saying he didn't do that.

205
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,500
It worked this time, yeah.

206
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,000
And now this other one's gonna try to do the same thing.

207
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,300
He's like, "I'll help you, brother! We're all brothers!"

208
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
And he's gonna try also.

209
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
And that time he did hit.

210
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,800
Oh, how much?

211
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
Let's see, he's not that strong.

212
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
What's the damage?

213
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,600
Oh, boy.

214
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Yeah, he does four damage.

215
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,600
So he just, like, conks you on the head.

216
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,100
with like a nightstick.

217
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,100
Fuck!

218
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,100
Which I think Ken Bone has in real life.

219
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,600
He does. He puts it up pregnant women's butts.

220
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,600
And now this guy's coming,

221
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
and he's gonna go after Snoochie Boochies,

222
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,100
and Snoochie Boochies is like,

223
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,600
"I think they are after you."

224
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,600
"Now, I think that these what's happening."

225
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,600
And as he attacks Snoochie Boochies,

226
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,100
which that just misses, Snoochie Boochies very easily,

227
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,100
like, deftly dodges out of the way.

228
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,600
And now that they're all sort of like crowding you guys,

229
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,540
we see a couple more

230
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,320
show up

231
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,860
uh...

232
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,860
uh... but only three could fit in at a time

233
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,820
well no three can come into the entrance at a time

234
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,460
i told you to shrink the train

235
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,400
don't worry patrick i'm coming for you on this for you on top of the train

236
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,380
uh...

237
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,180
as last month okay

238
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,600
i don't think i want that

239
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,060
i think it's gonna happen with the lights out

240
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:23,940
now

241
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,900
it is and well you know the problem is the problem is they're all in the train

242
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,060
right

243
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:33,260
yeah this is the latest that this is the new trolley problem if you can't

244
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,460

245
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,300

00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,660
i can i just say no sometimes

249
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,380
do you have to stare at xbox on the trip

250
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:02,060
and then what would you do what would you even do with that

251
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,060
tell me

252
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,780
i don't know if you have to tell you

253
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,460
is there an xbox on the road he twenty if it's more of a ten days of xbox on the

254
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,860
train

255
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,300
there is only a p_s_ five of the trade are the book okay

256
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:19,020
uh... and that's a mold tech

257
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:34,020
the

258
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:38,420
you could just break a window pretty easily. Climbing to the top, yeah, you should roll

259
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,620
athletics though. Okay, I'm gonna, well, what if I hoverboard to the top?

260
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:46,500
Uh, you could do it with advantage then, because you are kind of like, have like a little bit of

261
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,180
like a magnetism mechanism there. All right, then I'm doing that. Do it. 16. Nice, yeah,

262
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,860
you managed to like sort of ride the sides of the train and like skate yourself up to the top.

263
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:03,300
And now roll another athletics check to stay like steady on top of it. 21. Yeah, nice, yeah,

264
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,200
Yeah, you just managed to like chill up there very easily

265
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,380
Can I break waiting? It's like hitting your face

266
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,580
Bring snitchy bootches with me

267
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,420
Or am I - am I too far into it?

268
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,540
I would say you're too far into at this point because also also stitchy booties will be able to get there probably

269
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,140
Okay, wait, then I throw I throw like a rope down

270
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,020

274
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,800
Now it is Sullivan the Frog's third

275
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,300
Can I yell something to Sullivan on on?

276
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,860
His chair you're nearby. Yeah, I want it Sullivan get on my back like a backpack

277
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:01,420
Okay, and he like you watch him hops for the first time like a frog like he's freaking out

278
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,380
Your back immediately

279
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:12,500
Okay, I hear Cameron say his first leap and I poke my head through the glass and I go oh my god

Oh my god, my PSP and I'm Jake trying to take

281
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:20,940
Solvent is just like cooing

282
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,580
Imagine just like a ps4 share image

283
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,580
of a small flurry in the middle of a hop.

284
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:32,580
Just getting auto posted to your like 18+ twitter.

285
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,580
[Laughter]

286
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,580
Okay yeah, okay cool. So yeah, now it's back

287
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,580
to the top of the order. It was good thinking scrambling

288
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:48,580
to get ahead of that. I didn't have a turn.

289
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,580
Yeah well you're on top of the train. You don't need to. You're right. Oh yeah!

290
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,580
You didn't, I'm sorry, you should go.

291
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,580
Okay, I build an igloo.

292
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,580
Oh, that one looks like he likes building.

293
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,580
[Laughter]

294
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,580
Okay, I'll let you try to build a soy igloo.

295
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,580
[Laughter]

296
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,580
I build a beautiful igloo.

297
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,580
What should I roll?

298
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:16,580
I really want, I was so sad that I didn't get to do my turn.

299
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,580
I feel very bad, I'm sorry about that.

300
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
I was like, I'm going to do the best, and by the way, I get advantage on this because you forgot me.

301
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,780
because you forgot me. Yeah, I feel like you should do.

302
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,880
Let's consider it. You'll do it. I guess it's a is it a nature check?

303
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,080
Like yeah, we get precedent on that every time patches forget something we get advantage on doing it.

304
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,980
I'm basically we said that as a rule that is okay. All right. I'm rolling nature.

305
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,180
I think that's fair that holds me accountable. Okay advantage a nice.

306
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,880
Yeah, you build a pretty solid igloo for a train that's going like,

307
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,280
you know as fast as it's going and like as you're you have to like build it

308
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,380
Rebuild it as it's like blowing away, but eventually you solidify it you have like the base of a new glue

309
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,880
I'll say nice and I'm getting there pretty cool. You could do in six seconds. Pretty cool

310
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,660
Yeah, it looks good

311
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:08,820
Um, it's a good glue you got there. Thank you. You got you got room for one more

312
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,500
You know what? I'll add a second wing. Oh

313
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,540
Next turn coming up. Don't forget it patches. I won't forget it. You'll add a second wig to the igloo

314
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:24,860
So the the Ken bones are getting quite befuddled by this and then it down in the in the bottom of the train blow toss and

315
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,260
Blow toss you hear some commotion coming from the further back of the train cars, but it doesn't sound like

00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,500
The Ken bones and then you see burst through

two hundred wives he said swinging his bag of my surrounded just like knocks

340
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,900
this can go and clear out on the ground

341
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,020
uh... so he enters a turn order now as well

342
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,060
uh... you just see that there's a way

343
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,260
as one of those fights

344
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,460
partially yeah and so you see

345
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,060
you see that there's just like now a full out brawl

346
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:50,140
uh... there's just like

347
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,180
can bone cops versus can bone hobos

348
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,720
uh... total class war just like happening on this train

349
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,700
in snowpiercer fashion his uh... with the picture for this kevin smith

350
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,920
yes

351
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,940
his last time i can describe them in the i'd and and and can was like that sounds

352
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:10,440
like Kevin Smith and I was like, yeah, I guess I made a Kevin

353
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,740
Smith who talks like a jive turkey. And so now at the top

354
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,140
of the order, Tsuchibuchi sort of like like takes a cue and

355
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,240
definitely like hops on top of the train.

356
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,940
Plotos, it's your turn. You're with Sullivan. You can tell

357
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,740
we're up there. There's a there's a there's a Ken Bone

358
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:33,540
right next to me, right? Yeah. Okay. I look him in the eyes

359
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,020
and i say

360
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:38,780
have you seen the who that hides from guys who are gay and then i teleport to

361
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,340
the top of the tree

362
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,980
i should i'm gay and uh... then uh...

363
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,500
but can't go to i've my it's just a little bit all the other

364
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,700
it

365
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,620
i don't know

366
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,620
well for a little bit boats in the cockpit and boats stop fighting for a

367
00:20:56,620 --> 00:21:00,300
little bit all just stop it is just a test to go

368
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,940
I mean, it's fine.

369
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,140
I just got to deal with it now.

370
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,380
It's sort of a new thing.

371
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,580
Yeah, there are no pregnant guys.

372
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:17,660
So yeah, I poke my head down from the roof and I'm looking through the window and I have a one tear rolling to my face.

373
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:20,740
That's so it's so beautiful when someone finds themselves.

374
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,020
And yes, you guys end up on top of the train pretty easily.

375
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,700
and here are the commotion going on for the so you knew we're going to the top

376
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,700
and you know you do you do

377
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,220
and uh...

378
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,300
you're all able to sort of hold your ground for a little bit

379
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,100
and then uh... uh... you see some of the combat strike climb out

380
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,660
to the top to get you guys but they just quickly just get like fucking

381
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,780
and i think it is like an old on

382
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,940
which is not athletic enough

383
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:55,180
uh... but then uh...

384
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,460
from the distance you see a speck

385
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,380
uh...

386
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:03,660
the and you hear like a a jet engine it gets louder and louder and louder

387
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:08,260
and as you look over you realize it's some sort of like giant mac

388
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,540
uh...

389
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,460
and

390
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:14,140
use notice that it's shaped a lot like

391
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,620
josh gap

392
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,860
uh... and

393
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,540
policy

394
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,660
it's the king dad inside of the mac

395
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,420
and

396
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,580
he looks at all of you

397
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,900
And he screams at you through like a megaphone.

398
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,400
[clears throat]

399
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,860
I threatened my son with an unfriendly spanking,

400
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,420
and he told me everything.

401
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,820
The tournament?

402
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,660
Robbing the gadfly?

403
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,580
Arcade repairmen?

404
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,860
And now,

405
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,500
you've blown up our caves and murdered my Ken Bones.

406
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,580
Do you have any idea what you've done?

407
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,020
You've brought naughtiness and shame and

408
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,300
icky yucky gun city perversions into my settlement.

409
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:55,220
There should only be musical theater and improv.

410
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
is that so much to ask for?

411
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,220
you're a donzo, all of you

412
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,220
you're all a donzo

413
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,220
and uh, he uh

414
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:05,220
takes out like his gattling

415
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,220
I have an idea

416
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,220
guns, he's gattling guns

417
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,220
I have a feeling we're just gonna have to fight him

418
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,220
well if you can try it, I wanna hear the rest of the description

419
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
I'm interested in ideas

420
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
I know, I'm just letting you guys know I have an idea

421
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
thank you for letting us know

422
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,220
he takes out his gattling, I mean that was mostly it

423
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,220
what's the idea?

424
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:38,220
I

425
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
Agandum, Agandum.

426
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,220
Or like, even Gadleon?

427
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,220
Even Gad--Neon Gaddesis?

428
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,220
Gaddesis.

429
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,220
It's somewhere.

430
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,220
Yeah.

431
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,220
What about like, Pat Labor, like Gad Labor?

432
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,220
What a--uh, Neon--

433
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,220
That's another mech thing.

434
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Neon--

435
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,220
Mechad--Mechagadzilla.

436
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,220
Oh!

437
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,220
Mechagadzilla?

438
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,220
That's it.

439
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
Mechagadzilla.

440
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:06,220
I was thinking Neon Gad--Neon Gaddesis, Olaf Galeon.

441
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,220
No, no, no.

442
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,220
Jet Gaddwar.

443
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
Yeah, he's like writing all of these down.

444
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,220
He's like...

445
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,220
In the cockpit, you see him like this.

446
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,220
That's good. That's good.

447
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,220
Yeah, so now that we gave you all these awesome names, you should probably just like...

448
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
Hold on, I got an idea.

449
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,220
Let us go...

450
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,220
Wait, Mr. Gadd.

451
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,220
Um...

452
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,220
What do you want?

453
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,220
Okay, you guys, I've got...

454
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,220
Guys, huddle up. Huddle up in the igloo.

455
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,500
We seize is huddling hold on we're huddling but you can see you

456
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:45,220
Just so cold. We got to get close to each other. Yeah, just give us a second, you know, you know penguins

457
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:51,060
Yes, I know penguins that we're doing that what they do

458
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:57,520
Yep, okay, there's a penguin shit over here don't lie to your belly

459
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,700
I like when they I'm sorry. I like when they slide on their bells and you be quiet for a second. Just shut up

460
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,500
I mean, okay, let me fucking talk. I'm sorry

461
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,300
Okay, you guys

462
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,180
What if we did a song and dance number for him? Oh

463
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,940
Oh, no

464
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:28,780
It's what he likes he does like that if we can prove that we have the music in our hearts

465
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Maybe we might

466
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:40,120
We might reach the little man inside that nasty robot. What what song and dance did you have in mind?

467
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,000
I was thinking we could vote on it. What about Kiki? Do you love me?

468
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,520
We could do the tootsie slide

469
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,680
We could we could do that we could we could do a Kiki challenge for him it could do a barbershop quartet

470
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,160
That's also good of us in Sullivan. That's a great idea. Do you need me to sing?

471
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Yes, he sounds like Christopher Lambert. I'm warning you now good.

472
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:15,160
Are you done? You're all familiar with the lyrics to in my feelings, right?

473
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:23,160
Yeah, what role history check, you know, in your feelings, the ancient bard song.

474
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:30,160
I got a 17. I got a 24.

475
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,160
Okay, that's pretty good. Let's see if Sullivan knows your feelings.

476
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,160
I hope it's a good...

477
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:41,160
We all have PSPs that have Rap Genius on them too.

478
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,160
That's true.

479
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,160
Okay, yeah. Here's... Actually, you know what you could do?

480
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,160
Ray William Johnson, since you're a computer, you could...

481
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,160
I'll let you try to...

482
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,160
Can I print it out?

483
00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,840
Yeah, figure out a way to get the lyrics here beam it from your head something that you like. Do I have a printer?

600
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:08,800
to put the song in. I'm singing over it. Are you writing? Hey Sullivan, listen man, that

601
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,320
was all a big joke. That's not going to happen after the adventure. I just don't want to get

602
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:27,320
fucked by a gad. Well, wait, wait, hold on. Sullivan, are you a virgin? I personally hate

603
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,640
figuring out whether or not that's canon. We could have totally fucking gotten you some

604
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,680
pussy on the way here man. Didn't we? Didn't we already do it? He fucked a penguin. Oh yeah

605
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:42,440
that was savage. No that was not, I did not want to do that. You didn't really fuck her,

606
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,200
you kind of just ate her out if I remember. I tripped and fell. And then you see Stoogey

607
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:53,720
Boogey goes, you ate out the sacred penguin? Is that bad? Yeah you should have, he's a total

608
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:08,720
the

609
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,720
Okay, I'll keep that in mind that the frog eats out the penguin

610
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:18,160
They didn't I didn't I didn't want to I was just trying to talk to her I mean, I don't know

611
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:26,960
Whatever that fucking Drake dick dog dancer

612
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:35,240
And the fight below the commotion below you here it's sort of settled down and when you hear like a yeah

613
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,760
like a cheer

614
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
And then you hear

615
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,940
the classical hobo music playing

616
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:46,800
Like below which is just in mirror songs

617
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Just blasting below

618
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,120
Yeah, you guys end up back on the you guys want to stay on top of the train. You'll take some damage

619
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:04,800
Let's get back in the train are the Ken bones still angry at us now that no they're they're like retreating back. Okay. Yeah

620
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,120
Yeah, I teleport us back into the train

621
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:14,120
and

622
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,120
But yeah, you guys are back on the train

623
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:23,020
You see Kersey Enterprises is a I tell you here is the Enterprise to the top of the train and then come

624
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,680
He was no

625
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,160
Of giving everyone hot soda cold dogs

626
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,960
Yeah, we do need it. Yeah, he needs to yes the money

627
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,040
Top of the train for like half a second and then back

628
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,880
He just vomits

629
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
enough time to give Caleb

630
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,280
Or ray william johnson hot a hot soda and a hot and a cold dog. Mm-hmm

631
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,820
Here you go. I use my cold dog as an igloo piece

632
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:57,400
It's the door handle

633
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,720
Yeah

634
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:05,680
Very advanced igloo that I'm building. Yeah. So yeah, you take you to while you're up there wait, but I drink my hot soda

635
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,840
So it's a balance. Oh, yeah, I'll let it be half damage. Can you take the drink the hot soda?

636
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
How much did I say the soy?

637
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:21,300
Damages you guys how easy a negative damages use zero. I think I said I have double day

638
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,500
I think it's three for me right normal. It was three for you. Oh, yeah, I know what I rolled. Okay, let me just roll it again

639
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,280
Okay

640
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,780
But you take regular damage now because you're guzzling a hot sauce. You only take three damage. Okay, I see you guys

641
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,460
Once I build my igloo, am I safe?

642
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:37,960
Yeah.

643
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,960
The rest of you guys are partying on board with the hobos who've taken over the train.

644
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:48,460
You see Leroy Peanutbutter is teaching Sullivan how to do a little hobo dance.

645
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:54,960
And you see the Ken Bones and the robots are hanging out, eating hot soda and drinking cold dogs, I guess,

646
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,960
is the rest of what was happening in my mouth just now.

647
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,160
And yeah, and the train sort of slows to a stop and you arrive in

648
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:11,800
You arrive at who town and you see Leroy peanut butter go up to you guys before you leave. He says thank you for all your help

649
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,980
Yeah, yeah, you don't done. Don't you clean these trains out now? It's gonna be the hobo strains now

650
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,080
There's no way nobody can take these trains from us

651
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:22,520
Let me tell you we're gonna be gonna be eating something other than synthetic spaghetti

652
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,820
Oh for the rest of our lives will have some more of these hot saunas and cold dogs

653
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:39,600
any any vanishes you guys still here like through the roof just a muffled like

654
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:50,080
and yeah you guys you guys file off the train see a pretty impressive igloo on

655
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:54,800
top of one of the cars it just like the second we pull into the station just

656
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:07,360
is

657
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:19,740
that

658
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,440
the

659
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:34,820
the

660
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:40,100
you guys are you guys I got off the train and it's like a little you know it's

661
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,900
like a train station so it's a little walkaways - but not too far because this

662
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:50,060
is again like the furthest out in the soy wastes the soy wastes are like you know

663
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,660
really new territory as you can remember from here like you know the frozen waste

664
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:01,540
of soy the soy wastes it's just like very new not a lot of this touch it so

665
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:11,540
So you're pretty nearby this town, which as you sort of start to approach it, you see

666
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,460
like sort of soy farmers who are all Hoos.

667
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,580
They're all like Hoovian soy farmers.

668
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:21,740
And they harvest the stuff and they sell it back to Wendig Express Tycoons and suppliers

669
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:22,740
for that.

670
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,220
They sort of give you, they look at you with a little quizzical curiosity.

671
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:32,900
And as you get a little bit closer, you see "Welcome to Who Town, not Whoville" in big

672
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:39,660
bright letters that stands over a small archway, sort of, like a little gate.

673
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:42,100
And you see "Who Adults" and "Who Children".

674
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:49,100
You see a few normals wandering around, maybe a frog or two, but generally mostly Who's.

675
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:53,440
You see the standard bread lines for the legally required poor population any township needs

676
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,520
trade with gun city as well as some like modest homes and shops the style of the place unlike

677
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,120
the cube like sort of like neo amazon you know modern cadsville this is like kind of more primitive

678
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:12,960
and angular but it has like sort of like a techno mystical kind of vibe like like like they clearly

679
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:21,440
tried to like cobble this together did their best to like recreate a who a who ville kind of place

680
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:34,440
right? So there's iron, metal outcroppings that jut out, and those are kind of shaped like a Dr. Seuss house, but they're apartment complexes.

681
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:43,440
And then you have some more neon bulbs that create kind of a Christmassy flair, despite all the harsher angles from all the buildings.

682
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,580
You have some more classical like pliable material that makes the like who houses maybe like just trying to recreate that feeling

683
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:58,160
And you even see like, you know way in the back of the of the you know, there's homes or shops and there's even a Dematrix 2 pod

684
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,320
So it's like very recent very new for them

685
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:07,000
But it's like a very exciting attraction that was added next to the soy processing facility and community housing area

686
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:13,200
And so yeah, you see this you're in this sort of small town that's that's a that's like

687
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,400
very new and yeah you walk through you're here so yeah you have to go find the

688
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:26,440
the Oracle which snitchy-boochie says we must find the Oracle he lives towards

689
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:30,560
the other side of the town we can start walking there now unless you need to

690
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,800
rest or something we should probably rest right I think at 10 HP wait is has our

691
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:42,480
maximum health gone back up now since we're not in the sideways no you're

692
00:42:42,480 --> 00:43:00,080
your

693
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:12,520
the

694
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,520
I'm glad I have a long rest.

695
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Don't do a long rest.

696
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,520
If you do a long rest, that's a different amount of time.

697
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,520
Oh.

698
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,520
So if you do a long rest, that's like...

699
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,520
So wait, how many dice do I have now?

700
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,520
Is that what you said?

701
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,520
Let's see.

702
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,520
I'm at 16. I'll roll one more and then I'll have no hit dice left.

703
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,520
Yeah.

704
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,520
I'm at 27.

705
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,520
You have 5 hit dice left, so you can spend all that.

706
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
You can spend as much of that as you need.

707
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Actually, I'll spend one hit dice just to get back up to 4.

708
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:50,520
the

709
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
Okay, seven.

710
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,220
Nice.

711
00:43:54,220 --> 00:44:02,720
And then Sullivan will get his health back as well.

712
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:07,320
But yeah, you guys just sort of rest in the town square area

713
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,120
taking some of the who sites some of the news sort of like it

714
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,520
down in the middle of the street.

715
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,220
Yeah, they sort of look at you quizzically especially blow

716
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,920
toss because you're a who and you're like a new who and people

717
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:40,920
and

718
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,320
I think that was because I was a cool guy.

719
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
No, you're just not.

720
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:45,320
The who thing.

721
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,920
This is the first time I've ever seen another who.

722
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,520
Yeah, is it?

723
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,920
I think it is actually.

724
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:51,920
Yeah.

725
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,920
So yeah, I'm just going like.

726
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,920
Oh, I'm just freaking out.

727
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,920
Mommy, what's wrong with that one?

728
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:06,320
I don't know, honey.

729
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,420
Let's just keep going.

730
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,320
Yeah.

731
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:14,160
disease to keep it he comes over and says

732
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,520
you are meeting your people for the first time

733
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,080
you should be glad

734
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:20,440
how did you know that alone

735
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:25,280
i could help i think that the exact way that you are well it

736
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:29,400
it's also screaming unseen by people

737
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,880
well yeah that too

738
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,120
that was also helpful

739
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,560
yeah so yeah you guys are you guys can continue making your way to the oracle

740
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:39,960
uh...

741
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,660
Walking through the town, yada yada yada.

742
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:48,460
You come across sort of like the oracles place who towns or who

743
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,760
villages all those places.

744
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,260
They all have like an Oracle that tries to tap into the mystical

745
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:58,660
Lorax sort of powers and and use it and they sort of help guide

746
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:01,360
the village or guide the town, you know, wherever they are.

747
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,060
And so this one has an Oracle just as any of them would but

748
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:07,860
this one is an Oracle that is in the soy wastes, which is pretty

749
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:14,100
rare so at least what Tsuchibuji explains to you he says I have been looking for

750
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,860
the temple for a long time however I until now thanks to your smart

751
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:25,240
investigative and archaeological work now I finally know that if we talk to

752
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:32,180
this Oracle he should be able to locate it this is this is going to be this is

753
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:38,500
going to be good. I have a good feeling about this. Please, let's go.

754
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,600
And you guys walk into this sort of modest home and you immediately realize that it's

755
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,620
sort of different from the other ones. It's not as like, you know, gun city light kind

756
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:57,860
of vibe. It's much more earthy, much more mystical. And you walk in and you see the...

757
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,220
i love this guy

758
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:04,140
here at the front of the used in so many cases of the kids that zombie right

759
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,140
it's not pretty to back with you know he's so he's so good and he was in

760
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:10,300
something else what else was he in

761
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:12,820
ideas and we're going to rethink

762
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:14,980
i think you know the guards and we're down

763
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,100
so he's one of the same guys one of the best i got their own

764
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,540
but i was like i'm it's related

765
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,340

How do you all do?

Yeah, Doodoo, yes.

825
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,100
How do you... how do you know my name?

826
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:52,100
The stars foretold it.

827
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,100
And... and... I don't know.

828
00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:02,100
I... I kinda just guessed. I feel really... I'm pretty glad that I got that in one go.

829
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,100
But you are a Tamagotchi.

830
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,100
You must be the only one left.

831
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:09,100
How fucking sad.

832
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:24,180
the

833
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:25,620
just nodding vigorously.

834
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,380
The second he says, "Is he?"

835
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,460
Yes, Christmas.

836
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:36,020
Ah.

837
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,820
And a hacked demon.

838
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,340
Completely ignore Sullivan.

839
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,620
What up?

840
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:48,500
You like Dominican women.

841
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,580
She.

842
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,860
You could say that this frog eats pussy anyway.

843
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,900
Come with me.

844
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:06,700
Please, we have we want to know where the temple of the penguin of doom is.

845
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,560
Of course, it is nearby, you see.

846
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:16,300
We found this village because it was near a Christmas jungle.

847
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:20,460
There are only. Yes.

848
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,660
Yep, that's right, buddy. Yeah, sound it out. I

849
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,220
Thought that's what you guys liked. I'm trying to fucking talk to you, dude

850
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:36,220
You're sitting here all fucking talking you're talking to these guys. I'm trying to get your attention. I grabbed Patrick. I teleport

851
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:47,960
Into a snowbank, yeah, he's just completely inside it

852
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,580
"CHRISBURN! CHRISBURN!"

853
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:58,220
like the idea of like the who is just like talking about like long ago and

854
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,380
then did you just hear like pitter patter like what's coming up as you're slowly

855
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:13,300
coming back into the scene. I teleport him back out again every time he comes back in.

856
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,300
I go get fucked at a restaurant.

857
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,300
[laughter]

858
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:24,300
Before performing a ritual to find the temple,

859
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,300
what are your intentions?

860
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:32,300
To save the Tamagotchi race and also get out of jail forever.

861
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,300
No more jail ever again. Free from jail.

862
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:37,300
You want to get out of jail forever?

863
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:39,300
That's, I mean, that's the second thing I said.

864
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:42,300
I feel like you ignored the first part.

865
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:55,260
the

866
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:15,060
on

867
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:27,540
to

868
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:30,020
the giant guy just slowly backs out of frame.

869
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,860
(laughing)

870
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:33,380
He's, I mean, there's just not,

871
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,820
they don't make them like they used to.

872
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,100
Let's just put it that way.

873
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:40,980
Okay, everyone, we're going to do a chat together

874
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,460
so that we can see where the temple is.

875
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:50,060
Kiki, do you love Bums?

876
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,340
Are you riding?

877
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,180
Are you riding?

878
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,340
Are you riding?

879
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,780
Say you'll never, never leave from beside me.

880
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:58,780
Are you riding?

881
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,780
While I find the lyrics in my notes.

882
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,780
Perfect.

883
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,780
Do you love me?

884
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:06,780
(Random gibberish)

885
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,780
In the middle?

886
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,780
(More gibberish)

887
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:12,780
Teach me how to dougie.

888
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:14,780
Teach me how to dougie.

889
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,780
Teach me how to dougie from Jaipur City.

890
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:18,780
Your mouth's all...

891
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,780
Once you say Jaipur City,

892
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,780
your mouth's all...

893
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,780
open a gape and just like

894
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:34,140
this like rainbow dust just like flies slowly out of your mouths and uh like you don't know

895
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:40,460
where it came from or what it could be and it's happening to everybody um and uh uh

896
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:47,660
um and it's like this it's like an ugly glitter almost and it starts swirling around

897
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:55,580
and in the center of all of you and then it just sprays out to the side and uh lorax bless us it

898
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:03,900
has worked and um as you look around you realize you're sort of like inside like a panorama of like

899
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:09,420
the tamagotchi empire and it's like the five of you are like looking around you and you could see

900
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:15,740
like the rise and fall of the civilization these quick shots of history like uh the age of tamagotchi

901
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,420
when they were no more than like scattered warring tribes of

902
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:23,100
matechi and you know other tamagotchi types

903
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:26,540
living and dying within 24 hours of birth

904
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:29,980
desperately craving a bowl of rice or a slice of bread in the international

905
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,380
versions. The rise of the empire as they began to

906
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:37,340
sweep across the region now known as gun city

907
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,660
ruling over the frogs and worms of yore moving from a brutal

908
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,260
controlling sort of like needy like they always want a meal or

909
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:48,160
or they always want to have like play or whatever rule.

910
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:50,060
There's something resembling a Republic.

911
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,140
You see the Crayola rebellion that happened and with sort of

912
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:58,140
the and you see the battle like you're zooming through it now,

913
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,740
like you're like a camera zooming through this battle like

914
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,860
flying through it.

915
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,240
Tamagotchi is covered in marks of Crayola suffering from all

916
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:09,460
this fear and pain and the Crayolas themselves which are

917
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,060
turning and disintegrating into pixels.

918
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:17,260
It's like horrible battle between these two toy civilizations.

919
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:22,260
And then you know, you see the Empire fall internal strife

920
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,460
warring egos corruption and then the rise of Tamagotchi

921
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,060
immortality which changed everything an endless death that

922
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,160
chases their hearts.

923
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,260
Finally, you see the birth of a young Tamagotchi hatched

924
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:34,960
from an egg.

925
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,360
It's cooing for food becomes a teenager now needs cared attention.

926
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:49,860
You see this all happening kind of in like a stop motion sort of like you like a age, you know, like a see this man smile like for a whole every day for a year.

927
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,060
Yeah, time lapse.

928
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:51,860
Fuck my ass.

929
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,360
Yeah.

930
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,460
Pictures in a row and they have sound.

931
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:58,960
What is that?

932
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:04,260
Video 24, 24 pictures per second.

933
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:04,960
Per second.

934
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,660
Yeah, and

935
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:14,920
And you see it now, but it's an adult and it's it's you could see it's snitchy boochies and you see he's alone and

936
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:23,440
Then you sort of see him in gun city and he's completely confused and it's so different from what he understood and

937
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,720
the alienation older

938
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,040
yeah, I don't want to see this anymore and

939
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:37,600
And the old man goes you must see this you must you must like like just like and then we move past

940
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:44,160
Snoochie Boochies now, the only Tamagotchi left alive. And we fly north past what would become

941
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:50,800
Gadsville into the soy wastes and the panorama settles now at last through a dense Christmas

942
00:57:50,800 --> 00:58:00,160
jungle. And you hear like Christmas monkeys and Christmas light snakes hissing and blinking.

943
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:07,280
And then you just come across like a white, pure light, and you can't see anything, but

944
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:13,160
you know with perfect clarity that you're looking at the temple even though you can't

945
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,160
see it.

946
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:16,580
It has infected your hearts.

947
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,920
You know exactly where it is.

948
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:26,720
And then, just like that, the panorama just sort of vanishes.

949
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:33,740
And the oracle turns to Tsuchibuchi and says, "Your connection to this temple has revealed

950
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:35,900
its location.

951
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:39,520
You and your friends shall be able to find it.

952
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:44,360
Please do before our small village is disrupted further by the greedy tycoons Gun City sends

953
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,360
our way.

954
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:48,640
If they know that the N-word pass is here."

955
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,640
"Well."

956
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,080
"It's in front of us?"

957
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,920
"Well, it's near...

958
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,920
No.

959
00:58:54,920 --> 00:59:01,920
the

960
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,920
here

961
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:03,920
what don't

962
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,720
it's in that corner of the room

963
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:08,980
don't try to guess where the n-word pass is

964
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:11,400
it's under this jar

965
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,400
i think it's in d's

966
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,400
d's what?

967
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:14,400
d's not

968
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:27,760
i was like which character will fall for this bill

969
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,000
yes oliven it's in d's

970
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:42,880
is

971
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:55,840
the

972
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,680
- Joe Mama.

973
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,500
- Yes.

974
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,340
- Oh my God.

975
00:59:58,340 --> 00:59:59,600
- Jody's nuts.

976
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,280
- I in real life fell for that one just now.

977
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,520
(laughing)

978
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:10,280
- Somehow forgot what we were doing.

979
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:18,400
- The Christmas jungle is past the battered women's shelter

980
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:19,360
over yonder.

981
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,880
Is that gonna read or is that gonna just be too mean?

982
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:24,720
Should I change it?

983
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,220
We're definitely not going there.

984
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,320
That's all I'm going to say.

985
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:27,820
Good.

986
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:30,020
We're steering clear of that one.

987
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,120
Okay.

988
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:35,520
Well just walk that way to the jungle.

989
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,320
Make your way through it.

990
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,820
You will know which way to go.

991
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:40,920
Which way?

992
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,620
It's north of town.

993
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:47,220
That's pretty good.

994
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:51,320
That's pretty good because there was nothing about it.

995
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,620
Yeah, Joe Lama.

996
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,620
That would suggest that that was going to come next.

997
01:00:54,620 --> 01:01:02,900
yeah next to Joe mama okay I need you guys to get out while we're leaving

998
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,100
while we're leaving there's like one of those like you know an ocarina of time

999
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:11,360
those like brown pots there's one of those next to the stairs and I pick it up

1000
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:23,300
and I throw it on the ground to see if the n-word passes in it. It's just his food.

1001
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:28,220
not do that. I was looking for the... Oh my god. I'm spinning around the room doing my

1002
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:37,220
spin attack at every... The pipes, the pipes! Just like swinging metal pipes around. Hey,

1003
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:44,900
sing it, Danny boy! Yeah, you guys managed to leave, I guess, the place at some point.

1004
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:52,460
And yeah, so you can walk a bit north to go to the Christmas Jungle. You can take a long

1005
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:56,780
rest too before you do that yeah let's take a long rest yeah I take a long rest

1006
01:01:56,780 --> 01:02:03,200
in his house without asking me too I get really yeah from spinning around I would

1007
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:09,900
I lay down in the space under the sink yeah that's fine I don't have anything

1008
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:15,100
else I have nothing I'm doing all day these nights

1009
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:26,580
the

1010
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,580
the

1011
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:34,580
the

1012
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:37,020
the

1013
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:42,020
the

1014
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:46,020
the

1015
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,940
Yeah, we should all start a band.

1016
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:48,440
That'd be great.

1017
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,240
No, just me and you.

1018
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:49,900
Shut up.

1019
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:51,100
Just me and you.

1020
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,700
I'm not getting fucked.

1021
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:53,820
I'm doing it.

1022
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:56,940
Sullivan and I are going to do an Ike and Tina thing.

1023
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,440
What?

1024
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,820
Oh, no.

1025
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:00,940
What?

1026
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:01,700
Nothing.

1027
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,660
Did they do something?

1028
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:09,300
Maybe I should have picked a better joke.

1029
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:10,780
How about Sonny and Cher?

1030
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,780
I tried my other joke earlier and then also fell on Debbie or so.

1031
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:18,580
Okay, well, hold on. We're gonna do a clean take.

1032
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:19,860
Okay, yeah.

1033
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:21,860
We're gonna do a Sonny and Cher thing.

1034
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,220
That sounds fun.

1035
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,340
I close my newspaper.

1036
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,340
What the fuck are you two talking about?

1037
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,580
What are you talking about takes?

1038
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:35,860
And you guys walk outside of the Oracle and walk towards the Christmas jungle.

1039
01:03:35,860 --> 01:03:40,740
So the Christmas jungles are jungles that exist in cold areas of planet Ebaum.

1040
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,700
they're just jungles that are made of like sort of like

1041
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,300
christmas trees only but they also have like

1042
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:54,100
like ornament creatures that sort of scurry around and like uh

1043
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:59,300
uh is there a predator yeah it's you can there please can there be can there be a

1044
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:02,500
ginger predator can you put that in really quick yeah

1045
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:07,940
it's done that's pretty good thank you um yeah and there's a ginger

1046
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,860
your predator in every single one.

1047
01:04:10,860 --> 01:04:11,860
So...

1048
01:04:11,860 --> 01:04:13,300
Oh, that sucks.

1049
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:14,580
You should not have said anything.

1050
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:15,580
That's so scary.

1051
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:16,580
It's so cool.

1052
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,580
I'm so happy.

1053
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:23,420
But you guys can navigate through this jungle pretty easily.

1054
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:28,500
You know, you see like all the little critters and creatures going through and it takes about

1055
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:34,740
an hour before you guys start to sense that you're getting somewhere.

1056
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:48,620
the

1057
01:04:48,620 --> 01:05:03,620
the

1058
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:18,620
the

1059
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:36,620
the

1060
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:48,980
the

1061
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,580
thing just happened to me guys.

1062
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:56,580
And as you walk a little bit further Patrick Yoda, you feel

1063
01:05:56,580 --> 01:05:59,460
the same thing that blowtoss piss felt but you wouldn't I

1064
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,280
guess know that I'm on the same exact thing.

1065
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,860
And yeah, and you roll your perception check to see if you

1066
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:05,880
know where it came from.

1067
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,480
18.

1068
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:11,280
Okay, you look up in the trees and you see

1069
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,280
for a brief second.

1070
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,660
What you think is a penguin and then it just pops its head

1071
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:17,680
back behind the tree.

1072
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:24,680
the

1073
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,680
the

1074
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:28,680
the

1075
01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:30,680
the

1076
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:32,680
the

1077
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,680
the

1078
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:36,680
the

1079
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:38,680
the

1080
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:40,680
the

1081
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:42,680
the

1082
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,680
the

1083
01:06:44,680 --> 01:06:46,680
the

1084
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:53,680
the

1085
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,240
There are ornaments that are edible up there.

1086
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,240
They're edible ornaments.

1087
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,240
Oh, so it's like edible crossing?

1088
01:06:58,240 --> 01:07:00,320
I open my mouth wide to let them drop onto my mouth.

1089
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,640
Alright, so I got a real strength?

1090
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,640
Yeah.

1091
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:03,640
Oh no.

1092
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:04,640
Alright.

1093
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:05,640
I'm also shaking the tree.

1094
01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:06,640
Sixteen.

1095
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,840
I'm walking around catching the ornaments.

1096
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:16,520
And you're shaking the tree and the duck didn't do so hot on its roll.

1097
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:23,520
So it's like, "Quack!" and it falls out of the tree and lands on its back.

1098
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,520
And it's a penguin, a little penguin with a VR headset on its head.

1099
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:33,520
And it starts like freaking out and it starts to scream.

1100
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,520
I grab it by the feet.

1101
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,520
Yeah, you grab it pretty easily.

1102
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,520
And I swing it.

1103
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,520
I swing it back and forth.

1104
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:45,520
"Guys, look what I found!"

1105
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:47,520
Put that thing down

1106
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:53,080
No, you just want to touch it

1107
01:07:53,080 --> 01:08:04,540
I don't just trust me. No, I found it, please. No

1108
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,920
Grab it I just I just walk

1109
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,540
Yeah, I

1110
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:21,320
Just pick it up out of his hands. I take off the VR headset

1111
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:25,260
From it no eyes. Okay. I put the VR headset

1112
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:29,440
I put it on Patrick. I

1113
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:34,300

Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

1121
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,200
Oh, fuck.

1122
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,600
Oh, put the VR headset back on this creature.

1123
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,360
Oh, God. Yeah.

1124
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,640
And Christ,

1125
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,000
Snitchy Boochies goes up to it.

1126
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,040
He says, Are you OK, little fella?

1127
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,320
And he's like, Oh,

1128
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:22,320
I don't know.

1129
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:25,720
And it's just like doing like frantic dancing.

1130
01:09:25,720 --> 01:09:28,720
It's do you just like smacks in the face?

1131
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:29,320
Is it? Well,

1132
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:32,920
it's just like it calms down.

1133
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:33,440
OK.

1134
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:38,440
Where is the temple?

1135
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,440
And you see the penguin go like, "Aaah!"

1136
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:45,440
And you see like four other penguins come out and go, "Raaah!"

1137
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,440
And they all like, show up.

1138
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:50,440
And they go in a single file line.

1139
01:09:50,440 --> 01:09:53,440
And they start walking towards the temple.

1140
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,440
What could be the temple.

1141
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,440
Can I put a leash on one of them?

1142
01:09:57,440 --> 01:09:58,440
Yes.

1143
01:09:58,440 --> 01:10:02,440
Okay, I daisy-chain a bunch of Xbox games together.

1144
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,440
And I throw it around one of their necks.

1145
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:07,440
Can I kick one like a field goal?

1146
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,940
Yes, yeah, yeah, raise one hand all the way up here.

1147
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:14,640
And I run and I kick it.

1148
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:17,640
Just like it just like disappears. It's the sky.

1149
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:21,240
It's like Team Rocket star.

1150
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:26,840
I hope we don't need four penguins later to like stand in a circle or something.

1151
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:32,740
Well, you'll you'll fill in a four-sided circle.

1152
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:38,140
and uh... you guys march with your three penguins one of them in slaves i guess

1153
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:39,980
and uh...

1154
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:42,340
you notice i was just making sure they don't go away

1155
01:10:42,340 --> 01:10:44,520
the jungle starts to get like

1156
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:45,900
hotter

1157
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:49,100
but it's a warm up you see that there's less snow

1158
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:51,240
it's kinda slush now

1159
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:55,380
and inexplicably it's like now really warm

1160
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:59,660
and uh... and you see snitchy-boochies and his eyes sort of like light up he says

1161
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:01,340
we are nearing it

1162
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,180
I know these temperatures.

1163
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,900
Is it near a desert or something?

1164
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,300
It is near.

1165
01:11:07,300 --> 01:11:08,300
Is it a desert?

1166
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:10,980
Is it near a Christmas jungle?

1167
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:14,180
Is it a desert inside of a Christmas jungle?

1168
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:15,180
It's a temple.

1169
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:17,860
Let's just test what kind of hot things it's near.

1170
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:21,460
Is it near a fire or a volcano maybe?

1171
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,780
I feel like I'm just asking because I feel like we didn't need the penguins.

1172
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,020
All we needed was a thermometer.

1173
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,860
Yeah, I mean, is it a temple?

1174
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,980
I think the penguins are just sort of here for flavor, but yeah, I mean,

1175
01:11:31,980 --> 01:11:33,180
okay, then I kick another one.

1176
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,120
Okay.

1177
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,660
I'm starting to really like this.

1178
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:41,660
Me and Ray William Johnson are doing like soccer footsies.

1179
01:11:41,660 --> 01:11:47,180
Hey, Pat, when you're done with your slave, could I kick him into the sky?

1180
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,940
Well, we'll do that later.

1181
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:53,740
It's starting to understand you.

1182
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:58,380
Oh, good. He's intelligent.

1183
01:11:58,380 --> 01:11:59,580
That's better.

1184
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:04,060
Wait, I, I, I, can I put one of the penguins, can I just put one of the penguins in my inventory?

1185
01:12:04,060 --> 01:12:05,260
Yes.

1186
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:07,100
Yeah, wait, hold on. Yeah, I take all the, I do that too.

1187
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:12,780
Because I just, I just, I have, I have a lizard skin and I have bones and I think penguin might

1188
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:17,900
be the last ingredient to build a guy. Okay, yeah, sounds good. I agree.

1189
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:19,900
Yeah, just, just holding on to that.

1190
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:29,500
Yeah, and you guys walk a bit further and you come up against the edge of the Christmas jungle.

1191
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:35,900
And which is at this point, it's like hot now.

1192
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:43,300
You can take off the Yeti skin that you were using to keep warm and you don't need it anymore.

1193
01:12:43,300 --> 01:12:54,180
And you come across like the edge of a beach and a small stream like about 10 feet wide

1194
01:12:54,180 --> 01:13:01,780
wrapped around a small wrapped around a massive I should say actually sandbar.

1195
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:08,080
I'll tell you that can coke on top of it and even more massive.

1196
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:15,280
And golden penguin that resembles the one that you had and that you

1197
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,680
still have with you that's all the need out.

1198
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:22,980
And it's beautiful and gleaming and sushi booties.

1199
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:26,080
You see like little pixel tears start to form up in his eyes.

1200
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:31,280
And he's like, it's just as I've seen it just as I dreamed it would

1201
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:35,280
be. The temple of the penguin of doom.

1202
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,980
And you look upon this like massive structure and feel a sense of awe and a

1203
01:13:40,980 --> 01:13:44,680
sense of dread as the final stage of your adventure is here.

1204
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:48,480
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?

1205
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,080
Yeah, that's it.

1206
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:50,280
Say you never ever leave.

1207
01:13:50,280 --> 01:13:54,280
I'm a 10th wheel of a Porsche, the aerodynamics of the engine

1208
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:56,280
It's gonna be a medium, very low

1209
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,280
I'm not gonna lie, I'm not gonna lie

1210
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,280
I'm not gonna lie

1211
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,860
(upbeat music)

1212
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:14,740
(outro music)
