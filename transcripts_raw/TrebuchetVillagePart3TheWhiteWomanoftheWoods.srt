2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village,

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,500
our heroes took on the mighty stone serpent that grew from the earth.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Dogen communed with Dogen, the dirt god, who was always chewing on dirt,

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and told him that stone is like hard dirt,

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,800
which Dogen took to mean he should not fight this creature.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,700
Patrick Jodar tried to converse with the beast, but failed to charm him with words,

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,300
so he opted for an arrow straight to its skull.

9
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:42,200
Finally, evil Steevel used his cold hand to sing the beast "Silly,"

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,100
and Sullivan's fairy fire allowed Dogen to score an accidental whammy on the thing's noggin.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,800
That last blow shook the fiend so that our valiant crew were able to barter a ride on its back in exchange for not killing it.

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:00,200
Realizing they didn't know where to go to get out of the forest, they opted to ride the beast to Grandma's house.

13
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,600
The Grandma... This Grandma was a Kubler Elf, one of the native woodland elves in the Whippet Woods.

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,300
After nearly filming a porn, she informed the gang that their best bet out of the woods would be to find...

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:14,200
That was awesome.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,900
...the Mud Men due north.

17
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:27,200
Through there, they'd be on their way back to Trebuchet Village to return the young Prince Jumanji, who's still in their company.

18
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Before leaving, however, Grandma Kubler issued a stern warning to her adventurers.

19
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,200
"Avoid at all costs the kitsune and their trickster spirit, the jester, who haunts these woods."

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,200
Not before robbing this woman blind, the gang hiked north until they came across a creek,

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,180
a cross which sat a destroyed campsite that featured a massive iron cage with the bars

22
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:56,920
bent outward, presumably whatever was inside it having escaped.

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:01,280
After snooping around, Evil Steevel discovered a discarded flyer for a performance by the

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,040
Vegas Brothers featuring their giant beast, but presumably the one that got out of the

25
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,240
cage and proceeded to, from what could be gathered at the scene, sever someone's hand.

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,520
Following the trail that the beast left, our heroes journeyed for several hours before

27
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:19,220
growing weary and anxious, as time seemed to stand still at dusk.

28
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,420
Two fairies, or fey-like creatures at least, began to harass and taunt our heroes, beseeching

29
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,260
them to see the jester.

30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,840
Our heroes brushed their warnings aside, with Evil Stevel even doing the moonwalk, and,

31
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,680
seemingly satisfied, the mysterious fairies vanished, and with them so went dusk.

32
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,600
As night suddenly crashed upon the party all at once, our heroes readied themselves for

33
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
a well-deserved rest.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,520
Dogen watched a frog while it slept or tried to sleep, and Patrick Yodar ignored the cries

35
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,720
of someone in pain, which was immediately followed by cryptic words hissed from deep

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
in the woods.

37
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,240
"Not a bad night."

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:07,040
The next morning, everyone got up and continued walking along the trail, and in doing so,

39
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
They managed to stumble upon the Mud Men's home.

40
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,240
They welcomed our heroes, told them their tale of woe, of being turned into Mud Men

41
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:18,320
by the Jester, his horde Kitsune, and the terrible beasts that marched through their humble town.

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,920
If they find and slay this beast, the Mud Men will show the party how to leave the Whippet

43
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,000
Woods.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,720
The quest has begun.

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,400
Will they find their way out of the Whippet Woods?

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,880
Who is the Jester?

47
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,760
The kitsune and those fairies, the Vegas brothers and their beast.

48
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,480
Many unanswered questions and so many more to answer still.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,880
And only one way to answer them.

50
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,400
To begin the show.

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:55,320
Mudman I just want to say right off the bat I meant for you to have sex and then I would

52
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,520
give you this mud baby I was trying to create.

53
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,880
I didn't try to say, I didn't create a baby for you to have sex with.

54
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
That's not what I.

55
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:05,040
That's what I heard.

56
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,040
That's not what it was.

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I had actually completely forgotten that you said that ten seconds ago.

58
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
I don't know if you need to bring that up.

59
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,040
Why are you trying to re-litigate this right now?

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
The listeners in the woods would hear it.

61
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
And I just want to...

62
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
The what?

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
The audience.

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,040
[laughter]

65
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,040
They would probably not let me live that down, the listeners in the woods.

66
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,040
I would hope that they would try to understand that you're just playing a character, right?

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,200
'cause all the stuff, people would think I'm pathetic.

68
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,920
(laughing)

69
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,420
- Nobody would ever think that.

70
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,260
- Okay, so.

71
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,100
- Yeah, that is not something people would,

72
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,160
you're a fantastic man, Sullivan.

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,000
- Okay.

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,140
- Thank you for letting me work at your whatever the--

75
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,480
- It was a general store.

76
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,480
- I think that's what it was.

77
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,320
- Okay.

78
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,920
- I really just have not been paying attention

79
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,000
to my job at all.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,840
- Yeah.

81
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,660
- I--

82
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,500
- I gathered, but I appreciate it.

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,620
It's just a fun poor person thing I do.

84
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,620
And uh...

85
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,620
Like a hobby.

86
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,180
Like a hobby, yes, yeah exactly.

87
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,940
Like pretending to be a poor person is a hobby for me.

88
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
Yeah.

89
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:16,540
Well, for me it's, I like to collect uh, I like to collect stamps, but you know.

90
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,900
You like to collect stands?

91
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,900
No, stamps.

92
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,500
Like things you put on a pedestal, you collect?

93
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
A stand?

94
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Clamps?

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
What are you saying?

96
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,500
What the hell is a stamp?

97
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:34,940
Oh, well, I guess I couldn't think of a pathetic hobby in the medieval setting, so I opted

98
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:35,940
for one.

99
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,540
You say it's sand?

100
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,860
You beach babe motherfucker.

101
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,100
Yeah, it's sand.

102
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,380
Wait, you like sand?

103
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,380
Yeah.

104
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,380
We should totally hang out and talk about how similar sand is to dirt.

105
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,820
I would love for you to write that down and just give me all your thoughts, just in the

106
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,540
written word, through parchment maybe.

107
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,500
Well, how is he going to send it to you?

108
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:00,460
though do you get it

109
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,660
yeah i mean i could put it in an envelope but from there

110
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,060
right here we're just a go from there that you had a little sort of central

111
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,900
and how do you know if only there was a year old website

112
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,100
yeah

113
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,160
that so uh... you guys are you know in the mud men village uh...

114
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,180
you're sort of given a quick i guess sort of a quest where the men would help

115
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,940
you find the way out if you

116
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,060
find this beast and slay it as sort of a revenge

117
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:34,060
for the mud men whose homes and mud folk were trampled upon.

118
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,780
Obviously, you know, the trail went through the mud men's place.

119
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,220
You could see sort of the debris and the things there.

120
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:47,900
And it continues on after that, but you could see that it's a little bit fainter now,

121
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,500
just because of how, you know, that works, right?

122
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:54,660
now it's sort of like you can see a bit of a mud trail though so you can make a

123
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,460
survival check I would say to continue to like track it since now it's sort of

124
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:03,540
changing trajectory he's got the highest survival I have plus two I got zero I

125
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:10,140
think you might actually Patrick really oh I don't have to roll that d20 and

126
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,580
we'll see what's going we're we're in person by the way folks listen to that

127
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:21,180
die roll 14 plus 14 14 plus 4 is a Wow great okay that's a very good roll so

128
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:29,700
yeah you why why so good is it cuz you're a scion of an adventure like like did you

129
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,980
learn anything from from your uncle like why are you you you so I want to actually

130
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,160
start to try to interrogate this what's going on I I learned how to my time

131
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,280
pretend cosplaying is a poor person has taught me a lot of valuable skills right

132
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,560
such as how to how to survive without a butler. Poor people love using a compass

133
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,880
it's like their favorite thing it's like TV to them. We is it am I supposed to say

134
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:07,480
that in character? I don't even know. They like using a compass. It's sort of a net worth where you don't need a

135
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,200
compass anymore where you start making a certain amount of money and then you're

136
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:17,000
like this is dumb yeah exactly you're a rich adventurer I mean yeah you walk any

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,240
any direction they build a town around you yeah that's pretty mindset yes

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:27,600
trying me I mean that's what they did for a village was built so you get one

139
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,160
patch it's all in there it's already in there I already wrote it down in the

140
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:38,400
place that counts my head so yeah you guys yeah so Patrick you know is very

141
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,120
Very good at tracking beasts.

142
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,640
So he starts to track the...

143
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,040
He starts to follow along the mud path.

144
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,240
You guys see that it goes through the creek, but you still see the imprints beyond the

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
creek.

146
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,760
As you move a bit further now south, back towards the woods where you were, because

147
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,320
you guys went north to see the mud men.

148
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,680
And as you're starting to get to the woods, it starts to get a little bit thicker in the

149
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
woods.

150
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,680
You know, it starts to get about...

151
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,960
It's about to be midday, I would say.

152
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,120
And I want, Patrick Yodar, roll a perception check.

153
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,740
- God, that's crisp.

154
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,080
- It was a nine.

155
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:23,240
- Nine, okay.

156
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,480
So you, as you sort of like walk a little bit further,

157
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,980
you sniff the air for a second.

158
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:31,220
(sniffing)

159
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:35,880
- Oh God, I got a globule of pollen in there.

160
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,400
I saw a bug go in your nose.

161
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,600
- Yeah, I think that might be a bug or a globular pollen.

162
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,920
- I think that was a hummingbird.

163
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,440
That was, what the hell was that?

164
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,280
- Hold on.

165
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,040
(laughing)

166
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,400
Yeah, it just came out my mouth.

167
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,240
- Yeah.

168
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,160
- So the hummingbird just like,

169
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,800
plops on the ground just dead.

170
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,680
- Like, it looks like it went through it.

171
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,720
- I picked it back up and I put it in my mouth.

172
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,520
Start chewing on it like it's a sunflower seed.

173
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,360
- I like you.

174
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,400
- Yeah, I'm kind of a gross person.

175
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:14,080
like your style. And with that insane sniff I guess, you sort of get the sense that there's

176
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,640
somebody nearby, but you're not sure where they are, and you know that now it's not just

177
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,880
sort of one of the critters that have been lingering. You've been walking for a few hours

178
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,040
and you feel like someone's been tracking you guys.

179
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Knock it off.

180
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,200
You hear no response.

181
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Knock it off.

182
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
Yeah, if we just keep saying that for a little bit, maybe somebody will...

183
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,540
Hey, stop following us!

184
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:40,360
We know you're there...

185
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
...Dragon.

186
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,300
If it's a dragon, that's pretty smart.

187
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,000
That would be important if it was a dragon.

188
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,420
That's not a bad idea.

189
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,240
It was you, Sullivan!

190
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,600
No, no, no!

191
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,040
Yeah, you've been following us this whole time!

192
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,180
You've been following us since the...

193
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,080
Right behind us, every step of the way!

194
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,920
No, no, I ha-

195
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,440
Hey, wait, uh...

196
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,920
Does anybody know where the Prince is?

197
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,440
And you guys noticed that the prince is not with you.

198
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,040
Oh, I noticed that like a while ago.

199
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,160
(laughter)

200
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,680
You didn't say anything?

201
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,840
Yeah, I wouldn't have said anything either.

202
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,680
I thought he was playing.

203
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,960
Yeah, you guys sort of like try to retrace your steps.

204
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,400
What do you guys want to do about that?

205
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Moonwalk backwards.

206
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,160
(laughter)

207
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,440
Through my, the way that I left a trail was exactly,

208
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,680
there's two lines, 'cause I moonwalked the entire way.

209
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,520
Yeah.

210
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,340
Okay.

211
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,260
I do Freddy got fingered backwards man. I turn my armor around. I can't think of anything funny

212
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,300
Okay, yeah, so you guys sort of start to retrace your steps, and it becomes pretty clear that

213
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:46,660
Wherever the kid went it's hard to tell

214
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:55,300
Just walking backwards if like if he like got abducted or if he got distracted or something

215
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,780
So have you roll an investigation check to get a little bit of a better sense of this

216
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:13,020
I got a four mm-hmm I got a 12 17 okay with that for you just notice the dirt

217
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:18,580
and smother what's on your mind it's kind of your characters the perfect role

218
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,820
there's some mud touching some dirt

219
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:33,860
Evil Steve-o and Patrick Yodar, you both hear a faint "Help! Help!" and you guys can sprint

220
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,820
into a little bit further into the woods and you see a hole in the ground and you see about

221
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,300
like 20 feet down the kid.

222
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,300
You say "Help!

223
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
I don't know what happened!"

224
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,300
"Knock it off!"

225
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,300
"What you doing in that hole?"

226
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,660
"Get back up here right now!"

227
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
"Get out of that hole!"

228
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
"Or you're grounded!"

229
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,420
"You get back up here right now!"

230
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,900
"I'mma count to five!"

231
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,900
I'm gonna count to one. Wait, can you guys help me out of here?

232
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:00,900
One. One. Two. Are you gonna keep counting?

233
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Three. What are you gonna do if you get to five?

234
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,900
You know what? I'm coming down there. I jump in the hole.

235
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Okay. As you do, roll a...

236
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:12,900
Oh, God. Roll...

237
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,900
a acrobatics check. I can fly, right?

238
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,900
No. Fuck. Roll acrobatics.

239
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,900
One. Oh, God. So you...

240
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:28,300

you're not that tall but you seem bigger than 20 feet yeah you jump and you sort

242
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,740
of like just misjudge your weight and you just scrape your head like on the

243
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,540
side of the hole the entire because you're falling to the ground like and

244
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:51,380
you will take a nice back I'm gonna go ahead and get a pen okay oh yeah I have

255
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,540
feet of rope you live and you learn I got an idea I open up my I open up my

256
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,380
pouch of forever dirt and I start just spraying dirt into the hole and I just

257
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:03,780
climb up on the dirt and it will fill up the hole and you will take you to the

258
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,540
top it's actually not a bad and I drown me in this dirt bro just no you climb on

259
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
to climb on top of the dirt.

260
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,780
- So yeah, that's not under, it's the other way.

261
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,620
- See, we're gonna, okay.

262
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,440
- Don't you have a rope?

263
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,940
- Are you stuck in moonwalking?

264
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,780
- A little bit.

265
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,600
- Going down instead of up?

266
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,440
- A little bit.

267
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,740
- Okay, stop moonwalking, you're making the hole deeper.

268
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,580
- You gotta pay me to stop moonwalking.

269
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,340
- Here's one piece of gold.

270
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,060
- Swag.

271
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,460
- Okay, yeah.

272
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,500
- Yeah, you just drop a gold coin in there.

273
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,340
- Okay.

274
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,940
- It's a chocolate coin, don't tell him.

275
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,660
- I would say you guys--

276
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,900
- That's for two gold coins.

277
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,060
(laughing)

278
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,340
- You and the prince sort of keep scrambling,

279
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,740
continuously on top of the dirt as it keeps coming down from

280
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,840
Dogen's pouch.

281
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,340
And Patrick Yoda, roll a dexterity saving throw.

282
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,040
Oh, no.

283
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,740
Is it which one?

284
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,940
T20.

285
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,240
I got a nat 20.

286
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,140
Holy crap.

287
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,040
Okay.

288
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,040
So Dogen is pouring dirt into this hole.

289
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,840
You guys are sort of scrambling on top of it, Prince Jumanji

290
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,340
and Evil Steevel.

291
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:06,240
And you and Sullivan are just sort of watching the affair.

292
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,920
and it's great

293
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,200
used to have this is

294
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,580
are through our three friends just working in a sense it's always so nice

295
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,300
c_t_n_'s image amazing it's one of the best

296
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,320
one of the best things i think uh...

297
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,080
you can you can witness especially as it is a grown man

298
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
you know to see a

299
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,040
you know see people get together like this in the just work together is a kind

300
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,980
of thing i really tried to foster at the general store i mean yet you know you

301
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,980
never really did that not not straight up with you guys didn't really listen to

302
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:38,240
me so there was no I guess camaraderie not to put the blame on you I know what you

303
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,720
guys be quiet over there it's completely your fault but I just want to listen to

304
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:52,460
the dirt Patrick Yodar while you're like talking to Sullivan you see like like

305
00:16:52,460 --> 00:17:01,900
you see an arrow shoot towards you did you guys see that and you like you in

306
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,340
In the middle of the sentence, you're like, while saying like, "and it's completely your

307
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,700
fault," you just like grab this arrow out of the air and continue talking.

308
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,460
Yeah, got it.

309
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,420
That's probably the only one.

310
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,060
Probably no more arrows on the way.

311
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,860
I gotta look into this deeper.

312
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
Yeah.

313
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,540
What do you want to do?

314
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,340
So the, it's being filled with forever dirt?

315
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,820
Jumping in the hole would be pretty funny.

316
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:37,820
I don't have a shield, do I? No. How full is the hole at this point?

317
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,420
You're not going to address the arrow that came at you and you caught?

318
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:44,820
No, I'm going to, but I just want to know. This is how I'm going to do it.

319
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:49,820
Okay, I'm sorry. No, I should have guessed it. I would say like, it's probably about like,

320
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,820
how, I wonder how fast, how fast does Foreverder come out, Cam?

321
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,820
Yeah, you could just, I don't think there's any...

322
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,820
A million miles an hour.

323
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:03,140
So somewhere between a million and one, not one mile an hour, that's maybe even too fast.

324
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,340
Yeah, I don't, it doesn't.

325
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,340
Yeah, no, no, I know.

326
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
So I have no clue.

327
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,700
So let's say like maybe it comes out like, like I'm thinking of like a...

328
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,260
I think it was like a 30 foot line was like the maximum, it was like 30 square feet or

329
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,260
something.

330
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,260
Yeah, so it's like I imagine...

331
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,260
It was a 25 foot hole?

332
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,260
Yeah, it was a 20 foot hole.

333
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,460
So I imagine that like it would fill up in like maybe like 45 seconds of like dirt coming

334
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:32,260
Okay, so it's not full enough. Let's say but it's like a slow but it like continuously comes out right? Okay. So yeah

335
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:36,740
well, what I was gonna do was jump in the hole get my bow and arrow ready and then whenever the

336
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,940
Mm-hmm gets me up. I would fire just

337
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:45,980
It's like it's definitely like 15 feet like up at this point. Not 15, maybe like 10 feet

338
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:49,300
I was yeah, but then like 45 seconds. That's too slow. So I guess

339
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,380
I'm gonna get I'm gonna crouch down behind Sullivan

340
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,060
Okay

341
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,980
uh... what

342
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,980
what's up

343
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,100
yet there was a couple there's an arrow

344
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,920
and get that you remember this from earlier here i was really sc worried

345
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,140
about that so there's a another one coming right now you have been in this

346
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,180
and uh... uh... solomon's got the role of the exterior of the third now

347
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,100
but see how he does it that

348
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,060
well great did

349
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,360
probably not

350
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,220
you know

351
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,100
uh... solvent just takes a hero right in his shoulder are

352
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,140
See, I told you to look out for that.

353
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,940
And he takes three damage.

354
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,060
"Ahh, what the hell?

355
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,500
Who's doing that?"

356
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,100
"Hey, can you knock it off, please?

357
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,960
I really don't want a problem right now.

358
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,260
My friend is stuck in a hole."

359
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,260
"Okay."

360
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
"I'm trying to...

361
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
Ahh!"

362
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
He just pulls it out.

363
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
"Yeah, this thing, and you did this thing, too."

364
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,700
And you guys are now sort of out of the hole at this point, and you now, Patrick Yoder,

365
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,100
I would say, can sort of get the sense of where the arrows are coming from.

366
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,780
It's coming from one of the treetops.

367
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,780
Okay.

368
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,980
Well then behind Sullivan I have my bow and arrow ready.

369
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,020
I'm just waiting for the next arrow to come.

370
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,660
I'm looking at the tree tops.

371
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm just waiting for the next arrow.

372
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,780
I would say roll a perception check.

373
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,420
15.

374
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,900
Okay.

375
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,300
You can see pretty clearly who it is.

376
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,940
some sort of human male shooting at you from the treetops.

377
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,100
- Okay.

378
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,820
- And he sort of sees you seeing him,

379
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,140
and he goes, "Crap!"

380
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,940
And he just sort of like ducks down

381
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,520
and jumps out of the tree.

382
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,540
And roll for initiative, guys.

383
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,140
- Oh, fuck. - What?

384
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:39,020
- Oh, fuck.

385
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,860
Two, five.

386
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,060
- There's no initiative modifier on here, right?

387
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,580
- Yeah. - There is?

388
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,860
- Yeah, you just have zero.

389
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,900
- Okay, I got five.

390
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:49,160

392
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,040

393
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,020

395
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,760
dogen just wait till your character gets cancer then steve all that's gonna

396
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:23,240
happen you know Stievel and then Sullivan got the lowest but going first

397
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:32,080
is this fellow who has he has a sort of mid-length grayish brownish hair

398
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:42,480
count dooku and and he has sort of he has like a old-timey spectacles on and

399
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,560
And he looks sort of like a dweeby kind of hunter type.

400
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,560
And he knocks another arrow and aims it at you,

401
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,180
Patrick Jodar.

402
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,720
And that is gonna hit, I'm gonna say.

403
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,940
And he will attack you.

404
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,160
So he knocks another arrow and you're sort of just like

405
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,920
chatting him up and he deals five damage to you.

406
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,740
- Oh no.

407
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,580
- Yeah.

408
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,680
And he goes, "Ha ha, gotcha!"

409
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,240
That is completely uncalled for.

410
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,240
I mean to say that right now.

411
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,040
He's got an arrow sticking out of your gun.

412
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,480
That is, I mean, look what you've done.

413
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,320
It's all in a day's work for a goofus Tiedrich.

414
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,760
Listen, yeah, you are a real goofus, I will say that.

I'm gonna say that right now, you better not.

440
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,800
You've seen my prowess.

441
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Just, just, just, just.

442
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,800
You wanna show a kid you're-

443
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,800
You said you wanna grow your ass.

444
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
No, no.

445
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
I'm not gonna grow my ass.

446
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm not gonna grow my ass.

447
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,800
I'm not gonna grow my ass.

448
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,040
now you better not. You've seen my prowess just just just just. You want to show a kid.

449
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:42,960
You said you want to grow your ass. You nasty. That is that is absolutely disgusting and I'm

450
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,400
looking down right now I have a an arrow in my belly and uh you know I can see right now I can

451
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,400

452
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,920
I'm sorry, just please, just, just, just, just, just, just give me the kid and we won't have to, I won't have to keep shooting you.

453
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:06,560
If you leave us alone and go away and never come back and don't come back ever again, we'll consider it.

454
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:12,960
Wait a minute, no, that's not how it works. If you want to marry that kid, you gotta marry me first.

455
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,400
I don't, why does everyone, no.

456
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,040
Okay, uh, it's your turn Patrick Yodar, uh, by the way.

457
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,360
Okay, all right. Uh, how close am I to him now?

458
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,120
Uh, so he's still about-

459
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,240
Wait, I have a disguise kit?

460
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,040
Dress up like that kid.

461
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,080
He's about-

462
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,200
At your own peril.

463
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360
He's about 40 feet out, I would say.

464
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Oh, not 40, I should say. Yeah, 40 feet out.

465
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,800
I just dressed up like a cop.

466
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,200
I don't think he'd know what that is.

467
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,640
No, that's true. All right, never mind.

468
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,760
Um, then 40 feet out, um, all right, so I guess I'm on the ground in pain.

469
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
I already have my bow and arrow ready, right?

470
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
So I have that out, I'm just gonna...

471
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Yeah, I'm gonna knock him.

472
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Okay, yeah, go for it.

473
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,760
Add the...

474
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
Eleven.

475
00:24:58,760 --> 00:24:59,760
Add the, uh...

476
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Where's the attack for this?

477
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Oh.

478
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Oh, there's my...

479
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,760
It should be on your...

480
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Oh, if it's not here, I can tell you, just based on your dex...

481
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
Uh-huh.

482
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
...and your proficiency.

483
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
So it'll be plus five.

484
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
Okay.

485
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:15,760
So what is that?

486
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
That's sixteen.

487
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Sixteen?

488
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,380
Yeah, that that hits okay roll for damage. Yeah, rofrit is oh there it is down there, okay?

That's wrong. Oh wait. Which one do I roll it you're gonna roll for the D6 the d6 okay?

491
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,660
Three nice okay, so three plus three so you do six damage to him

492
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:43,100
So you're chatting him up, and then you shoot him and you get him right back in the gut. He's like no same wound

493
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:51,200
Doesn't feel too good does it? No, it doesn't. Yeah, it actually feels pretty terrible. No, I have been shot by arrows before

494
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,640
I'm a master hunter. I'll have yeah. Well, I haven't this is actually a very unpleasant experience. What?

495
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,920
Really? I'm never been hit by him. I've always dodged him or caught him. Oh, I mean when you caught I was pretty impressed

496
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:09,120
I have to yeah, you better be I'm a fucking I'm the son of a famous explorer. You're the son now

504
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,640
I'm being a Mars bar dude. You're at work. I don't know. Do you know how javelins work off the top of your head?

505
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,680
Oh, you can throw them. I don't remember exactly at least hold your mic away from your face when you do it

506
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,960
You know let me get um

507
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,840
So yeah a javelin is it's just a range weapon. Yeah, you're in range, okay

508
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,780
I throw a javelin okay. I kiss the javelin before I throw it for plus one

509
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,360
No

510
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,360
All right, just roll the plus two

511
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,580
Plus a half plus plus one

512
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:21,480
Plus one minus one uh-huh times two times three times four

513
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,220
Divided by six deal okay fine, so that's times six cool five by six

514
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,740
18 plus whatever plus like 40 right so um

515
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,540
No, I mean that hits roll so roll for damage. It's gonna be a

516
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,240
piercing d6

517
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,440
Plus your, um, dex.

518
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
Four damage.

519
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Ooh, mommy!

520
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,960
So you, um, yeah, you throw the javelin and, uh...

521
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,840
Can I aim, can I aim for it?

522
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,400
I want to hit, I want to do like, I want to split, I mean, I know this is a bit tough,

523
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
but yeah.

524
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,720
You split the arrow in half with the javelin.

525
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,360
Maybe it's not good enough of a roll for it.

526
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,440
No it is, a hundred, but no, it's fun, that's for sure.

527
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,880
Um, yeah, so you, yeah, yeah, you throw the arrow and you see him like, he's like, "Ugh!"

528
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,360
to pull it out and then you just the jabler just goes right in between it's

529
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,960
his weak spot you see it's glowing red

530
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:28,800
who sent you no well well no no one the brave lions of course they they the brave

531
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:35,860
lions Christ not them yes so you guys would know who they are insofar as so as

532
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:44,820
As you know, people like Evil Stevel or other non-evil races are very fun.

533
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,540
I love D&D.

534
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:50,800
Are called Scaredy Cats because they're not Terrifyer born.

535
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:57,700
So there's like a resistance group that is called the Brave Lions that even though King

536
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,180
Nardwuar is trying to do all this reform of like, "We'll try to treat our former slaves

537
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,880
better. There's still these brave lions who will accept the scalp of like a

538
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,320
nard for money. And so he's like this, this, this goofus Tiedrich fellow is some

539
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:20,240
sort of bounty hunter perhaps, who's working either on behalf of them, either

540
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,080
because he knows it's the prince or he doesn't know it's a prince, but there is

541
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,040
a precedent for this kind of behavior. Once he said brave lions, it would click

542
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:34,760
for you guys. Okay. Yeah, these guys suck. Yeah, we, me and Patrick Yodar hate

543
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:45,300
everybody who's not Terrifier-born. Hey guys, that... what? Nothing. Yeah.

544
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,940
Continue about your story. I only like people who are Terrifier-born coded

545
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:57,920
personally so no that's that's that I mean he doesn't say much else I guess he

546
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,120
says like the brave lion sent me probably says now so yeah he says a little bit

547
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:08,720
more it's about a mama yeah ask him can I ask you a couple questions he's just

548
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,560
looks like bleeding. Okay, when's your birthday one second?

549
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:24,960
Let's see if we can find Mr. T.

550
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,800
George's birthday March. Sixteenth Yeah, that's my brother's birthday. Is it

551
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,120
really it's right before Saint Patrick's Day? Why do we have his entire

552
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Rockaway, New Jersey. Why do we know all this?

553
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Rockaway, New Jersey, baby.

554
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,840
His father is Warren Lloyd Teedridge.

555
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,840
And this is Goofus.

556
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,840
Yes, this is Goofus, sorry.

557
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,840
Anyway, so, uh, uh, whoa.

558
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,840
And so yeah, it's now your turn, by the way, Evil Steve-o.

559
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,840
I'm gonna use my ghost hand, which I believe is called Chill Touch.

560
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,840
Yeah, it is.

561
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,840
Okay.

562
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
But for you it's called Ghost Hand.

563
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
Thank you.

564
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
Mm-hmm.

565
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
understanding.

566
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,320
Well, any time.

567
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,640
So what should I roll?

568
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Yes, so...

569
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Roll attack, right?

570
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,640
Yeah, chill touch should be a...

571
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,200
Is it on there as a spell attack?

572
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Or let me see...

573
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
It's also here as well.

574
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,200
Or is it a DC?

575
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,160
Yes, it's a spell attack, sorry, it's plus four, so roll.

576
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,240
See what you do.

577
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
That hits!

578
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
It's a 15!

579
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
Yeah, that hits.

580
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,240
So yeah, roll for damage on that one.

581
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,240
That's a d8.

582
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,240
Yeah, baby, it's d8 necrotic damage.

583
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,400
No, that has an 11 on it, probably not.

584
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:42,760
is this is her nice five hell yeah so yeah you what do you do with this hand

585
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,740
how do you fuck so there's an arrow with a spear stuck through it yeah I just

586
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:54,540
kind of like just like grab the spear just start kind of moving it back with

587
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,960
my ghost and they pick him up all right so I pick him up and yeah I kind of just

588
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:08,200
twirl them around. This is the worst day for my stomach. I bet that hurts. Oh god! I bet that one spot hurts so bad right now.

589
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,400
Oh it's all I could think about. Yeah. It's hurting me too. Probably not as much as that.

590
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:20,280
You're getting spun but. I would do anything for you to shoot another spot on my body. No. Oh no.

591
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:27,400
I think we're gonna stick to this little area. Okay and now it is Sullivan's turn. And Sullivan

592
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:31,320
is going to take out his crossbow and do his best.

593
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,540
- Oh, he has a crossbow?

594
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,460
- Yes, he does. - Yeah, when did Sullivan

595
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,300
get a crossbow?

596
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,200
- He's a bard, it's one of his weapons.

597
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,240
- I thought he had a lute. - So he's a fart?

598
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,560
- Oh, he has a lute also.

599
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,800
- Oh, okay. - But his weapon is a crossbow.

600
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,000
- Can they be combined?

601
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,120
- You know what? - Yeah, dude,

602
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,800
he uses the string of the lute to shoot the,

603
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,160
well, that would explain why he got a five

604
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,000
and missed so badly, maybe.

605
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,240
(laughing)

606
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,800
- He took out his lute by accident,

607
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,140
he had the crossbow.

608
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,140
So he tries to, he panics, takes out, yeah, in this scenario,

609
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:03,020
it is very much, oh, it's my turn.

610
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:06,340
And so he panics, realizing it's his turn to fight.

611
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,580
Takes out a lute by accident, goes, ah, like,

612
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,460
like gets nervous, grabs an arrow,

613
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,100
just tries to do it in the lute.

614
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,300
He's like, boom, like the string breaks.

615
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,140
(laughing)

616
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,980
And he's just like, he's like, I'm so sorry.

617
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,380
- Sullivan, what the hell was that?

618
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,840
- This never happens. - Yeah, don't be sorry,

619
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,780
that's the most beautiful song I've ever heard.

620
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:25,220
I place the opening chords of

621
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:34,180
so I usually sound much much worse, so that's I guess good

622
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:39,900
and he just misses and we're back at the top of the order is Mr.

623
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,660
teacher's turn and he is going to actually

624
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:50,020
sort of like freak out a little bit and throw a some sort of like he's got

625
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:56,260
sort of like concrete like ball and he like cracks it open on the ground and it

626
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:02,140
shoots up smoke and you don't know where he is now you can sort of get the sense

627
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:07,700
of him dashing away but you're not sure where and it's now your turn what would I

628
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,580
use to like seek him like perception I would say yeah I think you could take

629
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,220
a round to do perception then that's sort of like what you're doing so if

630
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,580
that's what you're doing I mean it helps everybody else after because you can

631
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:35,580
and

632
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:45,900
again with disadvantage. And that's plus four, I think, yes, for you. So, or no, it's plus

633
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:53,980
six. And what did I have as, god damn. Did it hit? Yeah, it did. What did I get? You

634
00:34:53,980 --> 00:35:00,380
got a fourteen, that hit. Oh shit. So yeah, roll for damage. Roll that d6. Wow. Well that'll

635
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:06,140
count that's a four here oh yeah keep that then yeah four plus it's gonna be

636
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,700
plus I think another four for you right yes my god is it decks what is it what's

637
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:16,780
your decks is it three my decks is I think it's plus three yeah yeah yeah

638
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:22,060
okay so so so pretty good so so it's seven yeah so you just like you the

639
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:27,140
smoke bomb kind of goes up and you you were sort of just like what like you're

640
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:30,180
kind of like peering in like how do you get the sense of like where he is like

641
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:35,540
how did you figure or did you just like I like I turned to them like they're like

642
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:39,900
standing like here mm-hmm I'm like hunched over with the my the arrow in my

643
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:47,020
gut yeah I'm just gonna see where this goes you are you here think oh how did

644
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:52,340
he how you see he comes out of the smoke he's really fucked up and the arrow

645
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:59,500
splits the chaplain down the middle you see it burrowed a hole in it and you see

646
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:02,940
like blood like squirting out of the like end of the javelin hole.

647
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:09,180
It's like, "Ow! Ow!" That's my bad I just kind of let it go. You ruined my

648
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:13,540
javelin. Hey you know what I will make you a new one out of this stick. Thank you

649
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:20,140
so much. And he's really bad off so he sort of says, "Okay, okay I'm sorry,

650
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,980
I'm sorry. I'll leave the prince alone. I didn't know, I didn't know, I

651
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,900
I didn't know he'd have you guys with him.

652
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:30,380
Hey, now get over here and take this arrow out of my belly.

653
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
Okay, okay.

654
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:34,700
And he crawls over, and the initiative's over.

655
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:35,700
He's given up.

656
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:40,540
Take that arrow out and put it in the end of that javelin.

657
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:47,860
When he gets in range of me, I hit the javelin like I'm hammering in a peg with my shovel.

658
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,020
I guess I'll roll for damage.

659
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,340
Dude, we gotta talk to this guy.

660
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
We need info.

661
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:52,340
Okay, wait.

662
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340

Thirty dollars.

00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,220
There we go. That sounds a lot better.

680
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,020
Sounds a little better, right?

681
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,060
Yeah, you could probably buy like some...

682
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,940
probably get each of us like three or four cups of meat or something like that.

683
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,020
I only have twenty-eight gold pieces.

684
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,940
Ah, crap. Well, you know, give us that anyway.

685
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,980
You have a piece of gum?

686
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,420
No.

687
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,460
Gum would be great right now.

688
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,260
Gum would be really nice.

689
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,460
I haven't been able to brush my teeth.

690
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,340
We're in the forest.

691
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:20,020
Three days not brushing, how many days has it been?

692
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,260
- It's been about one day for you guys.

693
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:25,060
- Yeah, well, three days for me not brushing my teeth.

694
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,780
(laughing)

695
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,420
- Can I have your weapons?

696
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,900
- Yeah, let's just take 'em out of his stomach.

697
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,940
- Okay, yeah, here's mine.

698
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,060
He gives you a long sword and he throws down a short bow.

699
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,100
- Yeah, I don't want them,

700
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,220
I just don't want him to have them.

701
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,980
- Yeah, yeah, he throws that down.

702
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,820
- Hey, you know what, while we're here,

703
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,580
give me your shoes, I actually--

704
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,420
- Your tunic.

705
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,060
- No, my Jordans, please.

706
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:50,180
yeah I want those. My ye olde Jordans.

707
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,260
He's like okay okay and he like takes off his shoes and hands them to you.

708
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,620
We want all your stuff but we're going to let you live because I have a feeling that

709
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:01,740
you are going to you're destined to do great things and your your descendants

710
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:09,100
are probably going to be some very important people. I hope so I mean I

711
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:16,140
haven't seen her since I but what do you want? I can give you all my stuff.

712
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,140
Have you seen...

713
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:20,840
28 pieces of gold, your shoes, your weapons...

714
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,640
What was the other things we wanted from him?

715
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,700
A beast?

716
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,700
Have you seen a beast?

717
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,100
Yeah, a beast.

718
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,740
Do you have a beast?

719
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Do you...

720
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,480
Wait, are you the beast?

721
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,480
Did we slay the beast?

722
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,140
That would be pretty easy, right?

723
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,140
I mean, look at this guy.

724
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,300
We could probably bring back his corpse to the mud people and say we got him.

725
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,140
Yeah, you could kill me and just make me look like a beast.

726
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,140
That's it.

727
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
Wait, no, hold on.

728
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
I got confused.

729
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,860
I haven't seen I haven't seen any beasts. What about a beast's footprints or have you smelled a beast?

730
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,180
I I great questions. I know great questions. Don't you have seen any signs of a beast?

731
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:02,460
Well, I have you seen a prince. Did you we were looking for one earlier?

732
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,820
Yeah, I was he fell in my trap. So you knew he was a prince

00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,340
- The kitsune's took the beast.

741
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,360
- Ah, crap, these fucking guys.

742
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,700
- I can't, I can't, I don't wanna deal with them.

743
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,860
I don't wanna deal with them, they're crazy.

744
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,300
- Well, you're gonna have to do it.

745
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,220
- You're becoming a permanent member of our party.

746
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,860
- No, that's three NPCs.

747
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,380
That's way too much.

748
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,780
- We need at least six.

749
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,620
- No.

750
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,460
(laughing)

751
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,780
- That way, if one of us dies,

752
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,500
it can be one nobody cares about.

753
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,700
- Please, please, okay, okay.

754
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:11,700
Look, I'll take you to the white woman of the woods.

755
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,620
Okay, how about that?

756
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:15,620
She'll be able to help you.

757
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,460
Okay, how about that?

758
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,300
- I don't know.

759
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,820
I think she's still mad at me.

760
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,740
- You know her?

761
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,900
- I won't get into it.

762
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,220
- All right, take us in.

763
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,700
- Yeah, we'll do it as long as you're naked.

764
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,200
- Okay.

765
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
- And he gets naked.

766
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,260
- That's disgusting.

767
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,260
I didn't think you would do it. Put those back on.

768
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,260
Okay, okay. Put this acorn in your butt.

769
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:43,260
It's almost impossible for him to put his shirt back on.

770
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,760
The acorn's in his butt.

771
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,260
Never mind. Pine cone.

772
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,760
Ugh, it's worse.

773
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
I usually only do acorns.

774
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,260
And he puts the pine cone in.

775
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,260
I'm happy. What about you guys?

776
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,260
Can you take the pine cone out actually, Em?

777
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,260
Yeah. Alright. He doesn't die.

778
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:00,760
He takes some damage from the pine cone in his ass.

779
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,260
Swear fealty to dirt for the rest of your life.

780
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,740
I-I-I-I swear feels he's a dirt fag.

781
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,100
Say you're a little girl.

782
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,300
I'm a little girl.

783
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,980
What the hell? Why'd you say that crap?

784
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,340
You told me this saying.

785
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,220
You're crazy.

786
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:16,420
You know, there's a- there's a thing.

787
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,540
You don't really have to do what people tell you all the time.

788
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,740
You guys almost killed me!

789
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,020
Do you want- do you want me to not do what you tell me to do?

790
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,660
I'll do that.

791
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,500
Be- be your own little girl.

792
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,740
Do- just right now do something spontaneous.

793
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,940
Do something you want to do.

794
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,380
It doesn't matter what we think.

795
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:40,260
he just vomits blood you wanted to do that no no um you we that was disgusting

796
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:46,100

797
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:54,900
uh you guys stink i can't hey don't you two pine cones

798
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,460
so he's just like being brutalized and abused he's there

799
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:04,820
If you happen to look over at Sullivan, you see like a dark smile crawl across his face

800
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,740
watching someone else suffer the abuse.

801
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,700
Hey Sullivan, you want to get in on this?

802
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,860
No, no, I'm just fine watching.

803
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:13,460
You're weird.

804
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:13,940
Yep.

805
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:21,780
And you guys go into this sort of walk through the woods and some of the weirder parts of it start to

806
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:26,660
look a little bit less like the Whippet Woods as you've seen it, less of that

807
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:34,020
sort of a like a constant subconscious cackling that you hear and the weird critters that like

808
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,740
float around and do their weird dark crystal things. It starts to look more like a regular

809
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,540
verdant-ass wood and you come-

810
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,340
Verdant?

811
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:44,020
Verdant, oh yeah. Very green.

812
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,220
Oh, you're verdant, yeah. And it comes across like a little bit of a clearing,

813
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:54,740
you see a pond and you see Tidritch, he's been like just limping all the way there, goofus.

814
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:56,180
Do I heal my stomach wound?

815
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,180
No.

816
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,180
Okay.

817
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,180
So I'm also launched over one.

818
00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,900
Yeah, you're also just like sort of in pain.

819
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:04,700
How much health are you missing?

820
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,780
I'm missing five HP.

821
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
What are you at?

822
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,780
Four.

823
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,500
I'll heal two HP on you.

824
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,500
Lay on hands?

825
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,220
Yeah, I'll spend two of my lay on hands.

826
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,220
Nice.

827
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:21,420
Just because I don't want you to die in like one hit.

828
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:30,580
And you come across this pond and you see Tidrich and he says, "Go beseech her and she will

829
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:31,580
talk to you."

830
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,140
I hit the javelin in like a peg.

831
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,140
Okay.

832
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,140
And he dies.

833
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,580
Didn't think that was going to happen.

834
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:43,820
Yeah, I mean he had one HP at that point so.

835
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:50,060
Also I want to say my lay on hands is that I rubbed dirt into the wounds.

836
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,700
And it hurts really, really bad, but it works.

837
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:58,980
As he's dying, he says, "Good thing I impregnated someone earlier."

838
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,820
And just dies on the spot.

839
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:06,260
So yeah, do you guys beseech the white woman of the woods?

840
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,980
I instantly beseech her.

841
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,740
I might not start with beseeching.

842
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,020
I might say, like, maybe holla first.

843
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:16,980
First, I try to holla.

844
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:20,140
You sort of see a couple of bubbles show up in the pond.

845
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,140
You try hollering.

846
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:26,260
Okay, I move on to saying what's up.

847
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:28,220
I'm testing the water.

848
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,220
Okay, yeah, yeah.

849
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,220
Literally, right, yeah.

850
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:33,340
I have my hands in my pockets and I'm just looking at the pond.

851
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,380
I'm like, "Ah, crap.

852
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:36,620
This brings back memories."

853
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:37,620
Yeah?

854
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:38,620
Yeah, this is...

855
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:41,620
Wait, you said you have a history with her, right?

856
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:42,620
Yeah.

857
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:44,380
You could probably get her attention.

858
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,380
Yeah, I could.

859
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,380
I could.

860
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,220
- You try hollering. - Hey, yo!

861
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,300
- Well, I just, it's a--

862
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,700
- Patrick Yodar's up here.

863
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,100
- Ah, come on, man, what you--

864
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,900
- Yeah, you see, now you see

865
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:01,540
a top of someone's head peering out of the pond

866
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:03,820
and slowly rising up,

867
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,580
and these beautiful blonde dreads

868
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:10,740
that cascade down this white woman's body,

869
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,740
perfectly covering all of her privates,

870
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:17,180
but very much highlighting her navel for some reason.

871
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,700
- I was about to say, is the belly button open and clear?

872
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,000
- It is open and clear for entry, sir.

873
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,940
- Swag.

874
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,060
- And you see her in her fullness,

875
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,060
and she's like hovering over the water,

876
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,200
and she like looks over you all,

877
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,980
and she sees Patrick Yodar, and she's like,

878
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:36,500
Patrick?

879
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,940
- Hey, yeah, I don't know if you remember me.

880
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,460
I'm Trunchbull's kid.

881
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,420
- I remember you.

882
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:45,420
Yeah, I'm real sorry about what I did on the fourth of--

883
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:46,860
I'm still trying to get the stains out.

884
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:49,740
Fourth of Juudars.

885
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,580
That's right.

886
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,400
Excuse me?

887
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,240
Juudars.

888
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,340
Juudars is one of our months.

889
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,140
What is Juudars?

890
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,980
Juudars.

891
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:02,500
J-O-O-D-A-R-S-E.

892
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,740
(laughing)

893
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,100
Juars.

894
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,300
No, it means July.

895
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:11,220
(laughter)

896
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,180
- We have July, just say July,

897
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:14,940
why you making up all this weird shit?

898
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,100
- I was trying to make it sound like Skyrim.

899
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,660
(laughter)

900
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,140
- Are you trying to impress her?

901
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,740
You still like her.

902
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:27,020
- I was in a human form at the time,

903
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,540
I didn't expect to get so drunk,

904
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,300
but I laid with a very charming verdanne.

905
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,140
- Yeah, my uncle and I was in the room.

906
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,580
(laughter)

907
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,580
Where'd the stains come from?

908
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,580
I was listening to... she had this...

909
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,580
The tears?

910
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:47,580
There was a bard in the room playing a song, it was amazing, you guys should have heard it.

911
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,580
Oh my god.

912
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:49,580
It was a good song.

913
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,580
I mean, I wasn't gonna leave the room.

914
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:56,580
We, your uncle and I both asked you desperately to leave.

915
00:47:56,580 --> 00:47:58,580
And I did when the song was over.

916
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:05,580
Yeah, you did, and then you spilled, you spilled juicy juice all over...

917
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,580
That's what I called it at the time.

918
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,580
*laughter*

919
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,580
This is actually, uh, blood wine.

920
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,580
*sigh*

921
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,580
You've all come to the woods.

922
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,580
This is wonderful news.

923
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,580
You're outsiders.

924
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:21,580
There's much-

925
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,580
My uncle was insider.

926
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:29,580
*laughter*

927
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,580
She can't help but smirk.

928
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,580
That's pretty good.

929
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,580
Um...

930
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,300
This once wasn't the Whippet Woods, you know.

931
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,660
Yeah, I knew that.

932
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,260
Okay, good. Well...

933
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,100
I know tons of crap.

934
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,820
Yeah, it used to be just the woods.

935
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:47,260
[laughter]

936
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,940
Well, I mean, it was still called the Whippet Woods, but it wasn't...

937
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,660
Yeah, that's what I meant.

938
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:55,660
Yeah, there wasn't just so much laughter.

939
00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,460
It wasn't so much... things weren't possessed by this. There was no jester.

940
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,660
The jester was relegated as a smaller spirit. I was the dominant spirit of these woods.

941
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:12,660
But after the terrifier won the great war, I became a mere lake spirit, a pond spirit.

942
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:17,460
And I've tried to expand my influence, but to no avail.

943
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:22,960
And meanwhile, my Kubler elves are enslaved by the kitsune's.

944
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,960
Which is something that I know the king now frowns upon.

945
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:31,760
now i guess his dad

946
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,600
uh... this is the prince then units that

947
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,700
it's not a one say anything

948
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:44,200
hi yeah well this is too many m_p_c_'s so i'm kind of disorder carted around in

949
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,460
and make sure i talk every once in a while but can you hold this for me

950
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,200
that's what i'm here for

951
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,400
and she's holding all of them

952
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:56,040
do this is close to the head

953
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:01,040
She says, uh, she says, um, you're not going to be able to...

954
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:05,980
You guys want that beast, right?

955
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,820
- How did you know?

956
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,280
- I'm a spirit of the woods.

957
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,120
I know all the, all kinds of--

958
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,280
- Yeah, she can hear through like trees and shit.

959
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,400
- Oh yes, that's right.

960
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,240
- What color's my penis?

961
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,720
- Did you hear what we said to grandma?

962
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,000
- Well, I've lost a lot of power,

963
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,300
so I can't hear that far.

964
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,800
What did you say to Grandma Kuba?

965
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,240
- She's mostly high and bi.

966
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,080
- Okay, good.

967
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:23,240
- We like her to be...

968
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:25,040
(laughing)

969
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,040
Some crap in between, but not all that much crap.

970
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,640
Okay, that's...

971
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,140
Yep.

972
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,340
I didn't try to fuck...

973
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,140
What?

974
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,540
I have no issue...

975
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,540
Let's just stop it right there.

976
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,140
Yeah!

977
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,340
Let's stop.

978
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,140
I'ma look the other way now.

979
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,040
So...

980
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,340
If...

981
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,740
The only issue is that I can't help you...

982
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:50,740
I can help you find your way out of the woods as well, but I need to have my power restored from the jester.

983
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:56,280
So this is another thing we gotta do on top of finding the beast and then we gotta get rid of the jester.

984
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,780
I'll give you your powers back.

985
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,480
And then I just kinda put my hands up and go like

986
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,480
*mimics sword noises*

987
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,140
*mimics sword noises*

988
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,140
That should probably do it.

989
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,220
She's like, "Thanks!"

990
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:10,220
No problem.

991
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:12,220
She's become evil.

992
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:20,220
She says, "You see, the yoni egg of Baskin, it's been..."

993
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,220
It's been...

994
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,220
stolen...

995
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,220
by...

996
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:25,720
Conneria.

997
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,720
A dark warlock...

998
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,220
who serves the jester in these woods.

999
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:34,720
If you bring me the Yoni Egg of Baskin, I can restore my power...

1000
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,220
and help you...

1001
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:39,220
fight off the Kitsunes, free the beast...

1002
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,220
slay the beast, even.

1003
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:44,720
Yeah, it could probably do that. I mean, we got nothing else going on, right?

1004
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,220
Yeah, I mean, that sounds...

1005
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,720
delightful!

1006
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,720
You like that, then?

1007
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,720
I'm smiling!

1008
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:57,720
I have a crush on her.

1009
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,720
Okay, well...

1010
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,720
This is the first female character I've put in the game in a while.

1011
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:07,720
You haven't harassed, so...

1012
00:52:07,720 --> 00:52:09,720
Good job on all of you.

1013
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:11,720
I want to poop on you.

1014
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,720
Is that better?

1015
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,720
Yeah, that's what I was looking for, thanks.

1016
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:26,200
Now, I will show you where Conneria is inside of your minds, and you all sort of just instinctually

1017
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,680
know some sort of like waypoint exists above your provision.

1018
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,240
You're able to figure out where Conneria is.

1019
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,720
I remember that.

1020
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:34,720
Yeah.

1021
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,160
Beware, though, the jester will try to stop you if you try to go after this warlock.

1022
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:45,120
And he has many tricks up his sleeves, Conneria.

1023
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,120
Like what?

1024
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,120
Like a...

1025
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,120
- Can we get some examples?

1026
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,320
- Well, he has a familiar that can take on the shape

1027
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:51,560
of any form.

1028
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,400
The shape of any form, huh?

1029
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:54,780
Is that what came out?

1030
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,980
Doesn't really make sense.

1031
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:56,960
(laughing)

1032
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,400
Take on many shapes, it's a changeling.

1033
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:01,960
- He can take on the form of a shape.

1034
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,880
- So he can be like a triangle.

1035
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,880
- Maybe like a rhombus.

1036
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,480
- If he's a square, I'll lose my mind.

1037
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,680
(laughing)

1038
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,080
I hate squares.

1039
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,120
- I really fucked it up.

1040
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,000
The familiar that he has is a changeling.

1041
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,320
It's a very rare familiar for a warlock.

1042
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,980
- I have one of those.

1043
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:19,700
Wait, so how do we know that you're not the changeling?

1044
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,240
Um...

1045
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,840
Thing.

1046
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,140
Well, she remembered that thing about my uncle.

1047
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,100
That's true, changelings wouldn't necessarily remember the thing about the uncle.

1048
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,900
Well, what if they do and you're telling us that because you're changeling?

1049
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,100
Yeah, what if I made that all up?

1050
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,260
Boys, what shape does she look like she is right now?

1051
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:36,260
[Laughter]

1052
00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:38,500
She's in a big circle of water.

1053
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,700
I'll say it, hourglass.

1054
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:40,660
[Laughter]

1055
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,940
You gotta pass.

1056
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,440
Well...

1057
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:47,320
"Well, thank you. I hope the changeling doesn't become a woman in that case."

1058
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:47,820
"Me too, man."

1059
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:48,820
"It sounds like you'll..."

1060
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,320
"I'm gonna have trouble as it."

1061
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,320
[laughter]

1062
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:58,280
And she says, "Go now, return the yoni egg to me,

1063
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:01,920
and you will be able to slay the beast.

1064
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,020
And stop the kitsune's."

1065
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:07,020
"Can I actually just use your bathroom real quick while I'm here?"

1066
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:08,020
"Yeah, me too, actually."

1067
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:11,020
"I think the bathroom is just the pee-a-peeing in the pot."

1068
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,940
Yeah, no, I just pee here.

1069
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,020
Just sort of do it here.

1070
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:14,860
- Oh.

1071
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:18,740
All right, everybody else is doing it.

1072
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:21,260
- Get your mouth out of the water, Stiebel.

1073
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,160
- It tastes sweet.

1074
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,940
- That's, honestly, I have a very poor diet.

1075
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,100
- You might wanna get checked for diabetes.

1076
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,060
'Cause this is sweet as hell.

1077
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:37,540
- You know, I don't know if it's like being a spirit thing,

1078
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:39,740
but you know, I'm a little,

1079
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,280
I feel sluggish a lot of the time.

1080
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,120
- Yeah, that makes sense.

1081
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:42,960
You nap a lot.

1082
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,740
- I, yeah, and I'm not depressed or anything.

1083
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,540
- Yeah, I'm worried I got diabetes.

1084
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:49,580
(laughing)

1085
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:52,080
- Like diabetes, well, have you drank your own pee?

1086
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:55,940
- Hey, look, I don't wanna talk about this.

1087
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:58,060
- Okay, well, you were very open about it

1088
00:54:58,060 --> 00:54:59,820
when it was me and your uncle, so.

1089
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,820
- Yeah, well, I had Juicy Juice in there.

1090
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:04,060
(laughing)

1091
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,920
- I hate Juicy Juice.

1092
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:13,500
So yeah, you guys wanna go find the warlock or you guys wanna do this other...

1093
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,500
You can also go right to the Kitsune settlement too.

1094
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
I think finding the warlock...

1095
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,500
I wanna find the warlock.

1096
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,500
Will we get a special item?

1097
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:22,500
Yeah, you will get an item.

1098
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,500
I wanna put that item in me.

1099
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:24,500
Yeah, okay.

1100
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,500
I head straight to the warlock.

1101
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,500
Okay.

1102
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:28,500
I hope my friends follow.

1103
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:31,500
You guys walk a bit further into the woods now.

1104
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,500
You gotta know where the waypoint is.

1105
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:35,500
And now it's sort of approaching dusk again.

1106
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:44,000
back to that time when the fairies were around. And I do have to roll something. Okay.

1107
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,260
And he's rolling for how much fun we're going to have.

1108
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,260
Was it a 10?

1109
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:49,260
It was a 10.

1110
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,260
A 100?

1111
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,460
Yeah. And so you guys walk over.

1112
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,780
It sucks when I can see the dice.

1113
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:57,780
It's a bummer.

1114
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,460
Why don't you just roll one in your mind?

1115
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,820
Hold on. I'll look away this time.

1116
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:05,420
No, I mean, no, I'm just going to keep that number. It's not, it doesn't, I'll explain

1117
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:12,420
one day. So you walk a bit further through the woods and what's all of your... actually

1118
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:15,420
I have your sheets with me, I just realized.

1119
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:16,420
One thousand.

1120
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:19,780
Yep, it looks like I have ten trillion.

1121
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:22,180
I actually have your sheets with me.

1122
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:26,420
He knows, dude. He knows we're lying.

1123
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,420
I'm not lying.

1124
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:43,860
hmm so hmm all right yeah

1125
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:46,140
Patrick Jodar, roll a dexterity saving throw.

1126
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,140
Oh, fuck you.

1127
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,140
Mm-hmm.

1128
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:57,140
I got, uh, 15.

1129
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:59,140
Okay.

1130
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:05,140
Patrick Jodar, you, um, see, you're walking through the woods, you're leading the pack,

1131
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:08,140
'cause you're sort of now, you're the survival guy, you're the tracker.

1132
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:09,140
Uh-huh.

1133
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,140
And, um, you see in the corner--

1134
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,140
So would you say I'm the leader?

1135
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,020
- No, I mean, I'm not here to--

1136
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,140
- You're the tracker, I'm the hacker, he's the attacker.

1137
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:18,980
- Okay.

1138
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:19,820
- Mm.

1139
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,640
- Ah.

1140
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:21,480
(laughing)

1141
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,320
I'm so--

1142
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:23,380
(laughing)

1143
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,220
I'm so--

1144
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,760
- I don't remember asking.

1145
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,940
- Yeah, and you start to see some weird, like,

1146
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:31,140
stirring in some of the bark,

1147
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:34,660
and then you see, like, a hand come out,

1148
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,100
and it looks like an ape's hand,

1149
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:39,100
and it goes to slap you in the face,

1150
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,620
and you just dodge right away.

1151
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:41,540
And you're (imitates ape)

1152
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:45,020
And like, you hear it vanish into the tree.

1153
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,480
Like, into the tree.

1154
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,760
Like, phased into it.

1155
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,020
- Knock it off.

1156
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,700
- Yeah, if there's a dragon out there.

1157
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:55,740
(laughing)

1158
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,780
- It's not a dragon.

1159
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:59,100
Some kind of a...

1160
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,500
- Chop the tree down.

1161
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,380
- Some kind of a beast.

1162
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,180
- And you see, Evil Steevel,

1163
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:08,660
you feel now all of a sudden,

1164
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,700
something go, "Ahh!"

1165
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,980
and just like jump on the back of your head

1166
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,980
and start slapping you in the face.

1167
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:17,940
- Knock that off, I said it once, I won't say it again.

1168
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:21,020
- And you take four damage

1169
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:22,780
as this thing is slapping you in the face.

1170
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:23,620
- I'm at two health, bro.

1171
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,580
- And fucking scraping at your face.

1172
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:26,420
- Okay, I'm gonna swing my sword at it.

1173
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,380
- He's scraping at the same wounds

1174
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,280
that I got from falling down the hall.

1175
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:30,980
- Oh yeah.

1176
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,180
- Damn this monkey tree.

1177
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,420
- Yeah, and so you see that there are these,

1178
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,260
you see two monkeys that are just sort of like

1179
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,220
diving inside of trees

1180
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:43,340
and diving out another one almost like they're teleporting between these trees

1181
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,380
uh... and you once we're sort of

1182
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:47,780
was it off his back now

1183
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:51,500
always on my face on a case on the hit the one that's on him

1184
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:53,980

00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,640
mhm you know i'm a special abilities

1187
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,140
monkey be gone

1188
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:01,100
uh...

1189
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:08,100
abilities i have

1190
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,100
I have Thieves' Cant.

1191
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,100
So that's like a language.

1192
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:14,100
Well, monkeys kinda...

1193
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,100
Maybe they speak it.

1194
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,100
Yeah.

1195
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,100
Limited telepathy.

1196
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,100
Use Thieves' Cant and say you have a banana.

1197
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,100
I'm gonna do that.

1198
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,100
So you use Thieves' Cant...

1199
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,100
No, I'm gonna use my telepathy, my limited telepathy.

1200
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,100
What is limited telepathy?

1201
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,100
I can telepathically communicate simple ideas and concepts with any creature within my reach.

1202
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,100
I can use my telepathy to communicate with any creature within my reach.

1203
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,100
I can use my telepathy to communicate with any creature within my reach.

1204
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,100
I can use my telepathy to communicate with any creature within my reach.

1205
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,100
I can use my telepathy to communicate with any creature within my reach.

1206
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,100
I can use my telepathy to communicate with any creature within my reach.

1207
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:40,100
You

1208
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:44,100
As long as it understands at least one language.

1209
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:49,100
Okay. These monkeys don't really understand any language.

1210
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,100
What's all that "ooh-ooh-ahh" about their partner?

1211
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,100
I guess they understand ape-speak?

1212
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,100
That's a language.

1213
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,100
I'll allow it because it's funny.

1214
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,100
What's your match?

1215
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:04,100
I know common, giant, gnomish, goblin, orc, and thieves' cant.

1216
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,100
You know a lot of languages.

1217
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,940
whatever i'll deal with that later um okay

1218
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:17,700
i'll allow it try to talk to this monkey okay so the way that i'm talking to the monkey

1219
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:28,020
telepathically is i'm just showing him pictures that say i'm showing him like sign cut it out

1220
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:35,620
like he's like big neon like yeah neon sign fingers that are doing the joey gladstone cut

1221
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:39,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and the monkey goes "How rude!"

1222
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:42,620
[Laughter]

1223
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:46,620
I think this monkey speaks English. I knew it understood a language.

1224
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:51,620
And keeps slapping Evil Stevel in the face. Roll for initiative.

1225
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:54,620
Bro, I got 2 HP, dude. I'm about to fucking die by--

1226
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:56,620
I can heal you. I can heal you 3.

1227
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:59,620
I'm about to get death by monkey'd right now.

1228
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:01,620
I got 8.

1229
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,620
13.

1230
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,620
12.

1231
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:04,620
12.

1232
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,620
Okay

1233
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:08,540
Dogen you're first

1234
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:13,060
Okay, um, we're all pretty close to each other. What kind of action is lay on hands

1235
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:18,020
It's just as an action. What does that mean? So an action in in in combat?

1236
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:23,420
It's like like an attack an attack is an attack action. So that's an action. That's like one action

1237
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:28,460
Moving is a move action. There's really only like your action and then your move action

1238
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:30,780
Yeah, I'm in a bonus action and reaction

1239
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:38,020
But um so that would take up like what you would do instead of attacking you would do lay on hands. Yeah, um I

1240
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:46,280
Guess you can certainly try to pull the monkey off his face to or do whatever you want to do with that

1241
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:51,500
What did you get on an initiative I got an eight

1242
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:57,540
Twelve okay, so you're probably going next right yeah, so I'm gonna heal you and then you can try to get the monkey off your face

1243
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,380
So I'll use lay on hands and heal him for three. Oh, yeah

1244
01:02:00,380 --> 01:02:07,580
That feels good all right cool. Yeah, I'm rubbing dirt on his face

1245
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:11,700
Like clawing at me. Yeah, the monkey's like

1246
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,420
We like confused by the dirt

1247
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:18,660
So I get three HP right yeah, okay, so I'm now at five I

1248
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:21,940
Love helping my friends you were so kind

1249
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:26,300
You're up. My turn?

1250
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:27,300
Mm-hmm.

1251
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,300
Um, I'm going to use...

1252
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,300
I hate to go back to this every time,

1253
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,800
but it's such a cool ability.

1254
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,800
I'm gonna use Chill Touch to rip the monkey off of my damn face.

1255
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,300
Yeah, it's very useful. Go for it.

1256
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,300
So what it's gonna be, though, is it's gonna be an attack roll with it,

1257
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,300
and then you're gonna do a strength check.

1258
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,800
Fourteen.

1259
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:45,800
Plus, I think, four, right?

1260
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,800
Plus... what do I add? Just the hit?

1261
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1262
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,300
Uh, yeah, so eighteen.

1263
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,300
Nice, yeah, that definitely hits.

1264
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:54,800
So now we'll roll a, um, strength check.

1265
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:59,760
with the hand so it'll just be yeah just add your strength because I'm gonna

1266
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,040
assume that the chill my strength to a basically treating chill touch like it's

1267
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,840
amazing which is probably not what I should do but I don't care yeah it's

1268
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:13,520
great so another 18 see how the monkey does whoo okay the monkey also got 18

1269
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,720
but the monkey is also less strength than you I think what's your strength

1270
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:17,720
Zero.

1271
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,720
Oh, maybe not.

1272
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:19,720
Let me see what monkey...

1273
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:20,720
How do you have zero strength?

1274
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:21,720
You're as strong as monkey.

1275
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:22,720
Oh, I have zero strength too.

1276
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,720
Or plus zero.

1277
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,720
Let me see what monkey5e...

1278
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,720
Let's see what they say.

1279
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:26,720
I forgot to write that down.

1280
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,720
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1281
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,720
It was minus three.

1282
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:29,720
Yeah, monkeys are not that strong.

1283
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:30,720
Yes!

1284
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:31,720
So, you take this chill hand.

1285
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:32,720
You do...

1286
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,720
Roll for damage for the chill hand too.

1287
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,720
I'm basically making chill hand very good, but I don't care.

1288
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,720
I think it's cool.

1289
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,720
Four.

1290
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:37,720
Yeah.

1291
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,720
So you grab this monkey with this chill hand, and you roll for damage.

1292
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,720
And you get a kill.

1293
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:40,720
And you get a kill.

1294
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:41,720
And you get a kill.

1295
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,720
I think it's cool.

1296
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:43,560
- Four.

1297
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,800
- Yeah, so you grab this monkey with this chill hand,

1298
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,080
and it's like, "Bah!"

1299
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,160
And you just rip it off your face,

1300
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,320
and what do you do, you throw the guy?

1301
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,800
- I throw it underhand like a softball right at Sullivan.

1302
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,880
- Yeah. (laughs)

1303
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:58,720
- Just wind it up.

1304
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:00,680
- Yeah, just the windmill.

1305
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,000
- Whatch!

1306
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,720
Sullivan is gonna roll a dexterity saving throw.

1307
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,680
- He'll probably dodge it, it'll be easy for him.

1308
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:08,040
- He will not dodge it.

1309
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,040
- Fuck!

1310
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,440
- And the monkey just lands on his face,

1311
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:16,200
like, "Ahh!" and Sullivan's like, "Ahh!" and it's just like this, this Sullivan like tumbles

1312
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,900
on his ass and this monkey's on his face like yelping in pain and like contorting

1313
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:29,240
itself. And it is now, it is now the monkey's turn and the monkey is going to hop off

1314
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:34,480
of Sullivan and scurry and go back inside of the tree and hop out of another part

1315
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:38,080
of the tree about like 40 feet down further in the woods and then hop back

1316
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:43,080
in that tree and dive again, like using both of its move actions. It seems to be running

1317
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:47,720
away from you guys. So you can obviously pursue or you can let the monkey go.

1318
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:51,700
I'm going to hop into the tree. It's not my turn, is it?

1319
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:54,160
It is your turn now. Okay, I'm going to try and hop into the tree.

1320
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:58,520
You hit your head on the tree. God damn it.

1321
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,520
We should burn down the whole forest.

1322
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:09,640
So it's like 40 feet away now.

1323
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:10,640
It's like 60 feet away.

1324
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,200
Also we know the direction we're going to the warlock right?

1325
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,000
Is the monkey going towards the warlock or in a different direction?

1326
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,240
It's going in the, it doesn't seem like it's going directly towards the warlock.

1327
01:05:19,240 --> 01:05:22,880
It seems to be just going away, like running from you guys.

1328
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,920
And is it like, does it, is it fast enough that we could reasonably catch up?

1329
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:27,920
Like would be.

1330
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,360
could

1331
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:33,040
not to worry about this money i think i think we might go to the only hired a

1332
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:33,900
monkey

1333
01:05:33,900 --> 01:05:37,560
race yeah i bet it's part of the i've been a case or did jester

1334
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:42,920
uh... all she it just recently what shape is the monkeys yet triangle

1335
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,200
first squares or something like that some rudimentary shape

1336
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,520
the rombo

1337
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:49,880
sir rombo room

1338
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:51,280
so it's that

1339
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,480
so it's the change i think you might be a changeling

1340
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:58,560
I think this might be the changeling.

1341
01:05:58,560 --> 01:05:59,560
Yeah.

1342
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,880
And I turn to everyone and I say, "Yeah, I think that might be the changeling."

1343
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:08,440
And yeah, well, it's, it's, it's, if you don't want to do anything, it'll just be gone from

1344
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,440
your side.

1345
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:10,440
I flip at the bird.

1346
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:11,440
Yeah.

1347
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:12,440
Fuck you, monkey.

1348
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,160
Hold on, let me do a strength check.

1349
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:17,080
Can I throw a javelin after it?

1350
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,800
Yeah, you certainly could.

1351
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,480
Okay, I'm gonna do that.

1352
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,160
Do it.

1353
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:26,160
plus dexterity right?

1354
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:27,160
14.

1355
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:32,160
Can I flip, can I, if I flip at the bird will that, do I have to roll?

1356
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,160
No.

1357
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,160
Can I roll?

1358
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,160
Yes.

1359
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:36,160
For psychic damage?

1360
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:41,160
I mean, I'll allow it if you get a 20.

1361
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:42,160
Okay.

1362
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,160
What happened?

1363
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,160
My knee.

1364
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,720
He re-injured his knee playing Dungeons and Dragons.

1365
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,080
Not a 20.

1366
01:06:51,080 --> 01:06:52,080
Not enough bud.

1367
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:53,080
injured his brain.

1368
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,080
He's smart.

1369
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:55,080
Yeah, you hit the monkey...

1370
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,080
Wait, what did you get again?

1371
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,080
A 14.

1372
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:02,960
Oh, no, the monkey sort of like, "Wah!" and just like zoomed right into like a tree and

1373
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,960
kept running away.

1374
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,400
Yeah, so he got away.

1375
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,400
I'm fine with that.

1376
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,400
Yeah, let's keep going.

1377
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:10,400
Yeah.

1378
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:11,400
Okay.

1379
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:12,400
I ain't worried about you, monkey.

1380
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,160
Yeah, be more careful of trees.

1381
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,720
But that better be the last monkey we see on this trip.

1382
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:18,720
Say that much.

1383
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,920
Yeah, so you guys travel a little bit more.

1384
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:24,220
I'm starting to approach evening if you guys want to,

1385
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:26,220
want to like take a rest,

1386
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:28,340
'cause you guys got beat up pretty bad.

1387
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,380
- Yeah, I'm definitely taking a rest.

1388
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,260
- You guys want to take a long rest?

1389
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:32,740
- Yeah.

1390
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:34,460
- All right, so you guys start to make yourselves

1391
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,420
a little campsite, make a little fire,

1392
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:40,100
sit down, chat about your day,

1393
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:41,880
you know, typical long rest stuff

1394
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:45,620
as the evening approaches, the stars in the evening.

1395
01:07:45,620 --> 01:07:46,540
- Are they beautiful?

1396
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:48,540
They're alright. They're pretty good.

1397
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,040
Yes.

1398
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:56,540
Um, Planet E-Bomb has some nice stars that they can look at, some interesting constellations that Cam and I have to finish figuring out what the lore is for that.

1399
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:57,540
List them all right now.

1400
01:07:57,540 --> 01:07:58,040
No.

1401
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:08,540
Uh, and, uh, you also see sort of a, you see a, a, a, somebody approaching your camp. Uh, your little encampment.

1402
01:08:08,540 --> 01:08:11,540
Oh, hey Sullivan, I didn't realize you were so far behind.

1403
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:20,540
He's like, "You guys started sprinting! I don't know where you went! I was so scared!"

1404
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:22,540
"We need to get you a scooter."

1405
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:26,540
"But who's that behind you all the way towards the camp?"

1406
01:08:26,540 --> 01:08:28,540
"Here, take this, Sullivan. It's called a s'more."

1407
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:33,540
"Thank you. I'm allergic to good-tasting food. I gotta..."

1408
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:37,540
[laughter]

1409
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:39,540
"Then do not put that in your mouth, Sullivan."

1410
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:43,220
You will die instantly. That's the most amazing food there is.

1411
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:49,380
Don't eat that s'more, Sullivan, if you want to live.

1412
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:50,880
I slam it out of his hand.

1413
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,880
Goddamn, why didn't you tell us sooner?

1414
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:53,880
I'm sorry.

1415
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,880
I've been feeding you so much stuff.

1416
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,880
Eat this nasty crap.

1417
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,880
I've just been pretending to eat it.

1418
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:01,880
I didn't know how to say no.

1419
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,880
You've been wasting our food?

1420
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,880
I'm not.

1421
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:07,880
Not the rations. That shit sucks.

1422
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:12,520
All right, good point. Actually, you know, I'm sick of rations. I'm honestly glad we

1423
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:17,700
found this s'more stuff right next to where we set the campfire, right next to

1424
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:25,120
where we set up our campfire. Almost like a trap when you think about it. Maybe that's why that guy is all pissed off.

1425
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:31,160
You see a guy coming, he doesn't seem pissed off, and he looks like sort of like a

1426
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:38,140
dashing sort of a bard type and he sort of looks to you all he's like sort of

1427
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:41,920
shows up he says oh I didn't know there'd be other people out here we did

1428
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:50,080
not touch your s'more stuff no no it's all still there don't check no it's

1429
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:55,960
those were not my s'mores though I do appreciate you saying then we were lying

1430
01:09:55,960 --> 01:10:01,360
to you probably gonna do that a lot in this interaction coming in a friendly

1431
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:09,320
way how are y'all doing today wait good tell me something only you would know I

1432
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:14,560
need to make sure that you are who you say you are well I haven't said who I am

1433
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:22,440
by the way which is very suspect I'm sorry my name is Martin I'm a bard I I

1434
01:10:22,440 --> 01:10:27,280
I was looking to find the lady of the woods, the white woman of the woods.

1435
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:32,960
I wanted to beseech her with a song, but I seem to have gotten a bit lost.

1436
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,880
Hold on.

1437
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,280
I remember you.

1438
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:37,280
God damn it.

1439
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:39,440
You guys, this is the bard.

1440
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:43,520
He was in the room with my uncle and the white lady from the lake.

1441
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,880
Oh, that Verdane who was- Yeah, Trunchbull.

1442
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:49,120
Trunchbull Yodar.

1443
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,360
Trunchbull Yodar.

1444
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,600
Can you play that song for us?

1445
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:54,560
I could do my best actually.

1446
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:59,560
He pulls out a lute and he says, "If you all don't mind, I'll happily sit down."

1447
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,480
No, you guys are going to want to hear this.

1448
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:04,560
Yeah, me and Steve are going to plug our ears, but you can go ahead.

1449
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:05,560
I can't stand the crap.

1450
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:06,560
Okay, all right.

1451
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,960
I put marshmallows in my ears.

1452
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,960
Yeah, I put chocolate in my ears.

1453
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:19,960
And he starts to play this song and he says, "Once upon a time there was four guys."

1454
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,960
And a child.

1455
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,960
I do not like where this song is going.

1456
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,960
Every person we meet seems to have...

1457
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,960
Just because I got chocolate in my ears doesn't mean I can't read lips.

1458
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,960
I know this is going south quick.

1459
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:35,960
You guys, you gotta let the sun play out.

1460
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:36,960
I'll take these out, hold on.

1461
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,960
And there was once a beautiful white woman.

1462
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:46,960
And a handsome dashing verdan.

1463
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:53,960
He's probably talking about my uncle, not me, but if he's talking about me, I will accept the complice.

1464
01:11:53,960 --> 01:12:03,960
You're willing to see how long this song is?

1465
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:04,960
Mm-hmm.

1466
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,960
It's 25 minutes long.

1467
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:08,960
Whoops.

1468
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,960
Okay, what's your HP?

1469
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,960
Oh no, 11.

1470
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:22,960
What's your HP?

1471
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:23,960
Max, or?

1472
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:24,960
No.

1473
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:25,960
6.

1474
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:27,960
Well, we didn't long rest yet, or we did?

1475
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,960
We didn't.

1476
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:29,960
Okay.

1477
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:31,960
As he's singing this insane song,

1478
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:36,960
Evil Steve-o, your eyes start to grow heavy.

1479
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,960
You start to get real sleepy.

1480
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:44,960
And you start to slowly drift off to sleep.

1481
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:50,960
Patrick G. Odar, you as well, slowly drift off to sleep.

1482
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,000
- And you know this song is not a man, it's a girl, man.

1483
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,440
And he's one of them.

1484
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,160
- And Evil Steevel, not Evil Steevel, sorry, Dogen,

1485
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:03,120
you start to nod off.

1486
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:07,080
And you, you're at 11 HP, right?

1487
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:07,920
- Yeah.

1488
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,080
- Okay, six, five, seven, eight, five,

1489
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,840
just adding everything up.

1490
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:13,280
- I think you're asleep, Patches.

1491
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:16,360
And you start to almost fall asleep,

1492
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,760
but you manage to stay up.

1493
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:22,640
And you see Sullivan sleeping next to you as well.

1494
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,440
- I did have marshmallows in my ears.

1495
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:25,360
- Mm-hmm.

1496
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:26,920
Oh, you didn't take yours out, did you?

1497
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:28,180
- No, I didn't.

1498
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:29,420
- You don't sleep at all.

1499
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:30,260
- That's right.

1500
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,380
- You see your friends start to fall asleep,

1501
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:33,800
and you see the--

1502
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:35,000
- I was so stupid.

1503
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:35,940
I can't take them out.

1504
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:37,680
They're really stuck in there.

1505
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:38,920
I tried to.

1506
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:45,640
see the handsome sort of bard look to you and sees that you're not sleeping.

1507
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,800
Can I pretend to sleep? Is it too late for that?

1508
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,560
Go for it. Roll a performance check.

1509
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:50,520
You are so smart.

1510
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:53,720
Oh, nat 20.

1511
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:58,280
Fuck yes. Okay, you perfectly pretend to fall asleep.

1512
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:02,760
It's so perfect that me and Pat both start clapping in our sleep.

1513
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:02,920
Yeah.

1514
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:10,440
Yeah, you slow your breathing down. You almost like literally slow your heart rate.

1515
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,280
Can my HP go up while I'm sleeping?

1516
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:21,080
Prince Jumanji was asleep as it is. He was a kid. He was tuckered out.

1517
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:26,440
And the only one who seems awake now, who seems awake, is Sullivan.

1518
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,960
And Sullivan sees you all sleeping. He's like, "Ugh!"

1519
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:40,840
And you see the, he looks towards Martin, the bard, and the bard looks towards Sullivan,

1520
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:50,280
and he runs to attack him. And he takes out, his hand turns into a giant claw,

1521
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:55,640
and he goes out to attack Sullivan. And so he's like finishing the song, he's like going like,

1522
01:14:58,520 --> 01:15:04,760
He like goes to attack Sullivan. What do you want to do save him? Yeah, I mean, I'm obviously gonna save him

1523
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,560
I'm obviously gonna the bars. I let it hit you with a big fat. You can't attack another bard

1524
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:16,160
Bards code. Yeah, can I like surprise attack him with my shovel? Like can I just like just yeah

1525
01:15:16,160 --> 01:15:20,800
You can't up and just I would say just clothesline him. You can definitely do a

1526
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,480
Reaction here because he thinks you're asleep

1527
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:30,500
With I'd say with advantage you can do this. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna just try and clothesline him with my my big shovel

1528
01:15:30,500 --> 01:15:41,280
17 okay that hits roll for damage

1529
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,440
Okay, 10 damage, okay

1530
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:50,720
So it makes a really really loud clang that sounds like an alarm clock

1531
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:58,240
So yeah, you you're like pretending to fall asleep, and you you kind of are able to get the sense of where he's coming from

1532
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:04,080
And you see as he's attacking. He doesn't look like a handsome bard anymore. He starts to look like

1533
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:07,000
some sort of like

1534
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,440
featureless creature

1535
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:15,880
Who comes at Sullivan with a claw? A creatureless creature? That's easy! A meetureless we- what?

1536
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:18,800
And as you're trying to figure out what I just said

1537
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:25,320
You swing the shovel around your shovel ballax and things like like going to attack Sullivan and you just like

1538
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:28,520
Like like yeah, right the imprint of his face. Yeah

1539
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,680
Yeah

1540
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:32,680
and he's like

1541
01:16:32,680 --> 01:16:39,960
You fuck and like like he like what was that that was that was schoolyard language. What did I just hear?

1542
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:44,840
You're asleep. I thought I woke up and this weird featureless humanoid then then

1543
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,200
Starts a sprint away, and he says connery. I will hear about this and like javelin

1544
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:53,020
You throw that one roll roll for an attack

1545
01:16:53,020 --> 01:16:58,520
16 that hits roll

1546
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:01,800
6d 6 plus your decks

1547
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:04,960
- oh

1548
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:09,800
You you p. I use fury of the small to add one damage. Oh

1549
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:14,200
I have a goblin ability where I can add one damage if somebody's bigger than me I

1550
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:19,520
Fucking forgot about that. Yes. I can only do it once per short rest though. Mm-hmm

1551
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,040
It's a good use of it. Very good use of it

1552
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:31,340
So you see you see your jowl goes through this thing and you see go

1553
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:34,360
And you see like poof

1554
01:17:34,360 --> 01:17:37,520
Away, and you feel its presence is gone

1555
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,500
It's like that was probably nothing

1556
01:17:42,440 --> 01:17:47,400
You too start to stir now that was a sleep spell right now I

1557
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:53,840
Thought I woke up earlier, but I think I was dreaming that I woke up

1558
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:59,940
May you talk in your sleep man. It's weird. Yeah, I interrupted my shit

1559
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:06,600
I have night terrors after seeing some of the things of my uncle did yeah to the white woman. Thank you Dogen

1560
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,600
Oh, yes, that was terrifying

1561
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:12,000
Oh boy.

1562
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Say my hero.

1563
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
My hero.

1564
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Say it in a girl voice.

1565
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,240
My hero.

1566
01:18:18,240 --> 01:18:19,240
That's right.

1567
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:21,080
I didn't mean that to be a burn.

1568
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,440
No, you got it right.

1569
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,440
Damn it.

1570
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,040
I just don't really know how to...

1571
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:26,040
My hero.

1572
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:29,400
What are you making that girl voice for?

1573
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,920
Yeah, that was good.

1574
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,320
That could have ended very badly.

1575
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:36,160
Dude, I was probably going to die.

1576
01:18:36,160 --> 01:18:37,160
I had 5 HP.

1577
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,160
God, you're so smart.

1578
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,160

1582
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:59,680

1583
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:04,200
yeah yeah okay what's the worst that could happen yeah that guy's gone right

1584

1585
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:13,880

1586
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:20,560
something so he did he rolled how proud he is of me yes and I'm I'm one proud

1587
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:26,240

1588
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:30,600
guys sleep without a vent I mean you guys sort of were able to handle the

1589
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:44,920
the

1590
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:55,320
towards the where the the warlock is supposedly and you come up the the wood

1591
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:00,280
start to look muddier and dirtier and grosser this is truly where a warlocks

1592
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:08,360
hovel would be and as you it's truly where a warlocks and as you get

1593
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:15,200
approach a little bit closer to him. It's, you hear that laughter that you heard

1594
01:20:15,200 --> 01:20:20,640
that you always sort of kind of hear in the Whippet Woods. It's a little bit

1595
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:24,260
like stronger now in terms of its sound but it's still just sort of like

1596
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:33,920
hovering in your subconscious. And you see a stubby, sweaty-looking, clean-shaven

1597
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:42,520
dwarf communing with some sort of clownish figure. So with the jangly

1598
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:49,280
little balls on the top of his silly little hat. He's floating above and he's

1599
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:57,200
talking to Connoria. Who is that? Can they see us? They can't see you. I crouch

1600
01:20:57,200 --> 01:21:04,880
down and I sneak attack. Chill, chill. He hasn't even made the setting yet.

1601
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:10,000
When you're done, I'm going to sneak attack. Yeah, eavesdrop first.

1602
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:14,720
Yeah. And you can try listening to roll perception check, see if you can listen in.

1603
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:19,680
Who has highest perception? All of us? Okay. Go for it.

1604
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:26,160
I got a 19. I got a 15. Oh yeah. I got a 3. All right.

1605
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:32,680
The marshmallows are still in your head. Yeah and I'm also just staring straight down at the

1606
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:39,360
ground too. I'm not even trying to read lips. Yeah and you hear the Jester like sort of

1607
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:42,000
saying something. Something you guys can kind of hear pretty pretty well. He's

1608
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,080
like saying something about like somebody it's in the woods. Outsiders.

1609
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:51,320
You hear Connery like, "Oh, come on, meow."

1610
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:55,120
You sort of get the sense that they're talking about you guys, probably.

1611
01:21:55,120 --> 01:22:00,640
And then, Patrick Giotto, you're sort of like crouching over, looking in, and the jester's

1612
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:07,680
like talking, and then the jester stops moving and turns and makes complete eye contact with

1613
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:08,680
you.

1614
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,040
I already have my bow and arrow ready.

1615
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:13,240
And then the jester appears five feet in front of you.

1616
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,080
Ooh, that's scary.

1617
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,080
I flip him up.

1618
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,280
Wait, pause. We didn't want a horror game.

1619
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,780
We didn't want to clear you on doing something scary.

1620
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:23,780
Can he be like 10 feet?

1621
01:22:23,780 --> 01:22:25,780
But he's backwards.

1622
01:22:25,780 --> 01:22:27,780
He's not looking at us.

1623
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:29,780
That's really scary.

1624
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,780
What do you want me to do?

1625
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,780
You're right, you're right. I should have told you before this.

1626
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:35,780
What if he is...

1627
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:37,780
What if he dies and...

1628
01:22:37,780 --> 01:22:39,780
What if he is a friendly guy?

1629
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:41,780
What if he's friendly?

1630
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:43,780
He's friendly to villains.

1631
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,780
And...

1632
01:22:45,780 --> 01:22:53,200
evil Steve oh it's a just evil and we're villains - no I can't allow that I can

1633
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:57,580
make his villains I can make him seven feet away what if the jester what if

1634
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:01,500
he's one inch tall what if he's the gesture well he's a spirit so he can be

1635
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,140
any size you want okay so so at first so that it's not like a jump scare he's

1636
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:09,380
raised to what it shrinks to one inch tall okay and then comes and then

1637
01:23:09,380 --> 01:23:13,700
shrinks back up like kind of slowly so it's not too scary when he switched on

1638
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:16,580
one inch tall and then he teleports to seven feet away so it looks like he's

1639
01:23:16,580 --> 01:23:20,660
the same distance away because yeah expect is that scary though that's my

1640
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:24,980
carrier you know what that's scarier than what you had no no I might not be I'm

1641
01:23:24,980 --> 01:23:31,700
just trying to understand and 19 how do they see me oh he's a spirit fuck um and

1642
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:38,660
he's really tiny and he's 10 feet away oh and a relief good thing he wasn't five

1643
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:42,500
feet away or I would have said my penny I would have gotten so scared he slowly

1644
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:54,980
grows bigger and he's the right amount of scary for me and he says to you all you

1645
01:23:54,980 --> 01:24:02,540
ignored my cries in the woods my cries of pain he's like giggling to himself as

1646
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:06,900
he's saying this I thought that was laughing yeah I feel like that's not on

1647
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:10,220
us really yeah I didn't hear anything I don't know what you're talking about he's

1648
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:12,220
He's got marshmallows in his ears.

1649
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:13,340
Yeah.

1650
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:16,640
You shoot away my ambassador fairies.

1651
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:19,740
You've made me very upset twice now.

1652
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,260
Well is there any way we can make this up to you?

1653
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:22,260
I mean...

1654
01:24:22,260 --> 01:24:28,580
How do we know you're not the changeling?

1655
01:24:28,580 --> 01:24:31,300
The way I see it, you have three options.

1656
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:32,680
Three!

1657
01:24:32,680 --> 01:24:37,740
I choose three!

1658
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,540
That's the bad one.

1659
01:24:39,540 --> 01:24:41,540
I made my decision, I'm okay with it.

1660
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:44,540
Can we hear the rest of the options?

1661
01:24:44,540 --> 01:24:47,540
Give me those marshmallows. I put them in my ear so I don't hear them.

1662
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:51,540
Option 1, you can serve me in my woods.

1663
01:24:51,540 --> 01:24:53,540
Nah, that one is not happening.

1664
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,540
I'll provide for you.

1665
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:55,540
Shut up.

1666
01:24:55,540 --> 01:24:56,540
Okay.

1667
01:24:56,540 --> 01:25:00,540
Option 2, you turn back now.

1668
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:05,540
If you can't find a way out, why don't you just force the mudmen to tell you?

1669
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,260
You all seem strong, you could probably...

1670
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:11,580
I don't know why you're laughing, it's not funny.

1671
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,620
Yeah, what?

1672
01:25:12,620 --> 01:25:14,460
Are you laughing at me?

1673
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:15,420
'Cause I'm small?

1674
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:16,300
You could probably...

1675
01:25:16,300 --> 01:25:18,700
Have you gotten to option three yet?

1676
01:25:18,700 --> 01:25:19,660
[laughter]

1677
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:22,060
Option three is no option at all.

1678
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:23,100
Then why did you say...

1679
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:24,540
That's two options, then.

1680
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:25,420
Yeah, what the f...

1681
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,820
You press on doing whatever it is you're doing.

1682
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:28,940
Okay, so it is an option.

1683
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:31,580
And there will be consequences if you do.

1684
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,420
Well, there'll be consequences if we don't.

1685
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:38,300
Can't you see that we're just three friendly guys?

1686
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,660
Hey, I've got a joke for you.

1687
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:41,260
Knock, knock.

1688
01:25:41,260 --> 01:25:42,620
Hey, wait, you're a comedian, right?

1689
01:25:42,620 --> 01:25:43,820
Tell us something funny.

1690
01:25:43,820 --> 01:25:45,420
I can't help it. Who's there?

1691
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,420
Chicken butt.

1692
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:48,300
Joe?

1693
01:25:48,300 --> 01:25:50,060
Chicken butt Joe who?

1694
01:25:50,060 --> 01:25:52,300

1697
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:57,100
[Giggles]

1698
01:25:57,100 --> 01:25:57,900
That was pretty good.

1699
01:25:57,900 --> 01:26:01,740
Yeah. I've got a million jokes about orcs, too.

1700
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,740
You've chosen to continue

1701
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,740

Actually what's the uh hold on

1703
01:26:07,740 --> 01:26:09,740
Why'd the orc cross the street?

1704
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:11,740
Should it be orcs or

1705
01:26:11,740 --> 01:26:13,740
Maybe it's somebody who's not terrif-

1706
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,740
Are you terrifier born? Can I just ask you that real quick?

1707
01:26:15,740 --> 01:26:17,740
I'm a spirit of the woods

1708
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:19,740

1709
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:21,740
Orc jokes I don't know

1710
01:26:21,740 --> 01:26:23,740
Why do the uh

1711
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,740
Why are orc ships uh

1712
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:27,740
Why do they have glass bottoms?

1713
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:29,740
I don't know why

1714
01:26:29,740 --> 01:26:34,740
bottoms why so they can see the old orc

1715
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:38,820
Navy he orcs are so stupid

1716
01:26:38,820 --> 01:26:41,780

1718
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,020
kind of an orc or something right that

1719
01:26:47,020 --> 01:26:51,260
and he says he looks you all and he says

1720
01:26:51,260 --> 01:26:54,340
you've made your choice and he vanishes

1721
01:26:54,340 --> 01:26:56,700

1723
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:15,300
away you love that joke and he's still that one's a thinker it takes you a

1724
01:27:15,300 --> 01:27:21,340
minute to really get it and you see Connery a turn around and and sees you

1725
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:28,000
all and you see that his eyes are sort of shifting colors and he holds up what

1726
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:40,780
looks like some sort of egg and he says to you all in the jester's voice and now

1727
01:27:40,780 --> 01:27:43,920
the fun will really begin.

1728
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,920
You'll roll for initiative.

1729
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,920
We should roll now.

1730
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,920
I'm rolling Pat.

1731
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:56,920
War 20 is like a table ten.
