1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,260
(laughing)

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,840
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,120
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,960
(laughing)

6
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,040
(explosion)

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,760
- Having a chicken attack.

8
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:15,600
- You're having a chicken attack.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,720
- I'm having a chicken attack.

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,140
I ate two tacos.

11
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,240
They tasted so good yesterday

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,880
and then they reached a threshold

13
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,920
and they tasted like trash.

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,760
- Oh, they were day old tacos.

15
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,720
- No, 'cause you got fish tacos.

16
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,020
No, these were these were these were tacos that I made in the slow cooker.

17
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,320
I mean, dude, I put this chicken in the slow cooker.

18
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,880
How many tacos did you eat yesterday?

19
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,380
Three.

20
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,720
Three? No, because you got tacos at dinner last night.

21
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,380
Yeah, that three tacos.

22
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,180
I just ate these tacos like 15 minutes ago and made them.

23
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,180
I ate the chicken cold.

24
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:48,480
You made the chicken yesterday.

25
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,920
I made the chicken five days ago now.

26
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,880
Oh, OK. Dude.

27
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:55,380
And I was like, five days, you know, that's like right on the edge.

28
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,900
I mean, five days, if it were a slice of bread, it would be fine.

29
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,020
So I don't see the issue.

30
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,780
Yeah, exactly.

31
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,980
That's what I was thinking.

32
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:03,820
If the chicken was a bar of chocolate, I wouldn't have any issue eating this.

33
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,180
Yeah.

34
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,220
Weeks after.

35
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:08,020
If it was like a can of baked beans, I wouldn't care.

36
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,460
So why would it be any different for it to be a chicken?

37
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,940
It's not like it still has feathers.

38
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,780
Turns out it tastes like lemons after five days.

39
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,180
And it hurts your stomach really bad.

40
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,780
Dude, if it tasted acidic at all, that's--

41
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,820
Also, it makes your nose burn like you ate a jalapeno.

42
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,820
It makes your nose bleed.

43
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,260
Yeah, it makes your nose bleed, pops a blood vessel in your eye.

44
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,260
Yeah.

45
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,260
It makes your penis really long.

46
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:35,780
Also, I can, I can, you can also see into your stomach through your belly button now.

47
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,420
You were not supposed to eat that.

48
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,980
I know I wasn't supposed to eat that, dude.

49
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,180
I feel like I fucking, I feel like I played flag football.

50
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,180
I did eat the whole thing.

51
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,180
I'm hungry.

52
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,180
Did you eat the whole thing?

53
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,180
Hungry.

54
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,180
Hungry.

55
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,180
Hungry, I was hungry.

56
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,180
It was out of food, dude.

57
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,180
Dude, I've been eating, listen, I found out.

58
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,180
Have you ever had a stomachache?

59
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,180
I have.

60
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:52,180
I have.

61
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,180
I have.

62
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,700
I found out that I-- - If you open your fridge

63
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:57,620
and the only thing in there was a worm, would you eat it?

64
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,780
Raw? - If hungry.

65
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,940
- Raw worm? - Yeah, if hungry.

66
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,700
- No seasoning neither?

67
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,660
- You know I can't take that seasoning crap.

68
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,500
- He can't.

69
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,100
- The worm's too spicy for this guy.

70
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,140
- God damn it, I'm so tired, I'm so tired.

71
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,300
I didn't grab a Red Bull or anything before recording.

72
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
This sucks. - Yeah.

73
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,340
You need to grab life by the bull.

74
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,580
- No, dude, I fucking-- - That's right.

75
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,420
- Last night-- - Or the bull

76
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,500
by the horns.

77
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,540
- Last night, so two nights ago--

78
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,680
Three nights ago.

79
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,680
Three nights ago.

80
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,680
So five nights ago, I made this chicken.

81
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,880
[Laughter]

82
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,080
And then it went really bad.

83
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,380
I went to that, I went to the Brandon show,

84
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,680
hung out after, went to a bar.

85
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Well, also, I want to, this is, this is going to come out,

86
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,680
this is, this is, this is the first, okay,

87
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,180
so Patrick just revealed what we were hiding,

88
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,980
which is that these are all backlogged.

89
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,080
Yeah.

90
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,480
We didn't mention that at all,

91
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
which it wasn't on purpose that we didn't mention it,

92
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,480
but yeah, just so you guys know, I guess now,

93
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,980
that none of this has been current.

94
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,380
So I guess if, if one,

95
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:55,380
If something horrible happened and we didn't comment on it, that's why.

96
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,380
Yeah, you just ruined like so many alibis for all three of us.

97
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,380
Yeah.

98
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,380
[Laughter]

99
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,380
Um, nothing is happening in Cuba yet.

100
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
[Laughter]

101
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:10,380
Let me just say, nothing's happening in Cuba right now.

102
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,380
So you went to some bar.

103
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:18,380
Yeah, I went to the bar, um, left my card there because it started like pouring rain

104
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,460
and I was like, "Oh, I need to go home immediately."

105
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,140
So I called like a, 'cause it was in Gowanus,

106
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,220
or I think that's what, Perks Slope, I don't-

107
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,140
- Gowanus!

108
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,420
- Gowanus.

109
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,260
- Yeah.

110
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,660
- And I left my card there,

111
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,480
and then we were meeting up with our friends.

112
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,380
So I was like, "Well, fuck it.

113
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:40,260
Why don't we like go back to the same bar

114
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,360
and just get drinks there?"

115
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,460
'Cause I'll, you know, it was a pretty good bar.

116
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,900
- Yeah, I mean, also I would like to say,

117
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,420
in an effort to get his card,

118
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,920
Patrick made all of us travel at least one hour to go to this bar.

119
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,420
That is so far away.

120
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,020
I didn't know I didn't know how far away they were.

121
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:01,520
And then what happened after we went to a restaurant across the

122
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,120
street.

123
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,920
Mm-hmm.

124
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,120
Yeah, and I left my backpack at the bar.

125
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,920
So you had to go back to the bar.

126
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,040
last night I got home with Caleb at like a 10 50 something like that and then he

127
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,320
called me I called him because I I wanted to know what's he crying the lift he

128
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,440
called me and he was crying I wasn't crying

129
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,800
if I was it was about swing him back and forth out of his nose while he cried

130
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,920
I could... *sniff sniff*

131
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,680
It's my manic bag in your hand!

132
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,320
Do you have a tissue?

133
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,920
That's what he said when you picked up.

134
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,040
Okay, I was... I will say...

135
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,120
I was very stressed out last night.

136
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,600
And Caleb said like...

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,320
"Don't forget your shoes at the bar."

138
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,080
And I just like bitch-buttoned him.

139
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,600
Just like completely.

140
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,960
Yeah, and immediately I was like,

141
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,600
"Patrick's kind of a pussy, dude."

142
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,440
*laughter*

143
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,760
You know I've been...

144
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,880
There's a lot going on in my life right now.

145
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,320
You know I'm stressed out.

146
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,520
And tell me, did you leave your shoes at the bar, you fucking clown?

147
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,360
I wore flip-flops.

148
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,200
So that I wore flip-flops, did you?

149
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,800
I wore my Tevas so that I wouldn't forget.

150
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,280
The most easy to lose shoe in the world, by the way.

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,720
It's the easiest shoe to forget.

152
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
Because I love my Tevas.

153
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah.

154
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,040
Don't let your backpack hear that.

155
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,200
It's going to be mad at you.

156
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,480
You just keep showing up to the bar with one less article of clothing.

157
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
Be like, I think I left my pants here.

158
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,640
Can you guys help me?

159
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,880
I mean, that sucked, 'cause then I took the train home

160
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,040
'cause I took two lifts that night,

161
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,800
and it was like 50 bucks.

162
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,280
I was like, "Jesus fucking Christ,

163
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,240
"I'm not spending that much money."

164
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,200
If I were that bartender, I'd be pretty scared of you.

165
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,320
Really? Yeah.

166
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,200
Why? 'Cause two nights in a row,

167
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,600
you have some excuse to come back.

168
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,160
Well, I'm never going there again.

169
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm never going to that bar again.

170
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,280
You better, I don't know, yeah.

171
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,560
If I keep fucking losing shit there,

172
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,560
that means it's a sign.

173
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,200
That means it's a sign from Christ.

174
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,080
Maybe they have a giant magnet there.

175
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,280
Who he.

176
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,200
Stop kissing your chain.

177
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,920
You don't care about God.

178
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,320
Stop.

179
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,040
You hate Christ.

180
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,640
It's a sign from Christ that I should go there ever again.

181
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,680
Don't touch Christ.

182
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,800
Stop.

183
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,640
I don't like how Italian you're trying to look recently.

184
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,120
Yeah.

185
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,280
I don't like that, dude.

186
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,040
I'm not trying to look Italian.

187
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Because you're not Italian.

188
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,560
You're trying.

189
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,600
You're trying very hard.

190
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,640
You're clearly trying to look Italian, dude.

191
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,480
Don't ask me what I had for lunch today.

192
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,600
What'd you have for lunch today?

193
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,200
I said, don't ask.

194
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,480
And I'm telling you, I'm asking you, what'd you have?

195
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,320
Chicken Parmesan.

196
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,380
Okay.

197
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,060
All right.

198
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,440
No, I don't approve.

199
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:39,720
Oh yeah.

200
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,480
Whatever you do.

201
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,400
Don't ask me what I had for lunch today.

202
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,320
What'd you have?

203
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,320
Leaf bar.

204
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:54,440
I had all the chicken, very old chicken taco.

205
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,360
You might still be

206
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,800
my stomach hurt.

207
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,880
My stomach.

208
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,280
I need to stop eating old food, but I'm trying to save money.

209
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,600
And so I will make a bunch of food.

210
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,040
That is the easiest way to do it.

211
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,760
Yes. And it'll just it'll just sit in my fridge.

212
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,400
And like the thing is, I saw this.

213
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,000
I still have maybe two more tacos worth of this chicken.

214
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
So I might eat it again after we're done recording.

215
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,320
I'll do that.

216
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,640
But like, what else am I supposed to?

217
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,160
I can't throw it away.

218
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,200
You can throw it away. Throw it away.

219
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,640
Oh, I can't throw it away. You're right.

220
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
You're right, I can't just throw it away.

221
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I mean leftovers are like, you know.

222
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,640
I guess I don't have to eat trash, do I?

223
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Depending on what the leftovers are,

224
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,640
like any kind of meat,

225
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,640
you keep it in the fridge 2-3 days.

226
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Oh, I love to keep my leftovers an hour after and I throw them away.

227
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
Even if I don't eat them.

228
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
You like fresh stuff.

229
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
I would say there are certain things that keep a lot better.

230
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,640
Mashed potatoes last about 90 minutes in the fridge

231
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,640
before they need to be thrown in the trash.

232
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,840
No, you can reheat mashed potatoes.

233
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,800
No, you can't.

234
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,280
In the oven.

235
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
Oh, also, I don't have a fucking microwave.

236
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,520
So you know what you can do with old mashed potatoes is make a shepherd's pie.

237
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,320
Put that on top.

238
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,280
Wait, you don't have a microwave.

239
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:07,760
I don't.

240
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,640
And it depends on how creamy the mashed potatoes.

241
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,680
So I eat the chicken cold.

242
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,760
You're eating the chicken tacos cold?

243
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,280
Just cold as ice, dude.

244
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,600
There's like little bits of like fat.

245
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,040
I don't care about shepherd's pie right now.

246
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,560
I need to get to the bottom of this.

247
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,440
There's little bits of like congealed fat in the taco.

248
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,400
What else was in the talk?

249
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,740
But poop I took and what else?

250
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,120
There was rice in there.

251
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
Who puts rice in a taco?

252
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,880
I don't know. I'm asking what's in there.

253
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,640
Oh, it was just it was Greek yogurt.

254
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,680
Pandemic is Greek yogurt, lime hot sauce.

255
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,320
Very old chicken.

256
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,400
Nothing else.

257
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,800
No. OK.

258
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,000
Chicken's a star.

259
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You should have tasted this chicken four days ago.

260
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,280
Incredible.

261
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,520
It just got bad.

262
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,640
It just spoiled.

263
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,720
It was the texture of the tortilla like

264
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,360
Corny, chewy, delicious, perfectly warm.

265
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,260
I actually heated that up on the oven.

266
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,160
Shit, I should really make a shepherd's pie soon.

267
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,560
Shut up about the shepherd's pie.

268
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,240
You don't know how to make a shepherd's pie.

269
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,160
Fuck you. Fuck you.

270
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,960
That's the one thing.

271
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,300
A shepherd's pie is when an Irish guy takes a-

272
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,300
You don't know how to fucking crack on the ground.

273
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,000
I know how to make a shepherd's pie really good.

274
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,500
And I'm gonna make it for Caleb.

275
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,640
I'm gonna make it for Caleb.

276
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,380
And you wouldn't dare make me a shepherd's pie

277
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,580
and give it to me.

278
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,120
I haven't made a shepherd's pie in like 20 years.

279
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,280
I should, oh, I should make that, right?

280
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,820
I'm going to this is the Shepherds Pie challenge on the show.

281
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm going to make Caleb a Shepherds Pie.

282
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,720
He's going to eat it and he's going to tell me if it's good.

283
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
Why not?

284
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Because I don't eat things.

285
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,220
I don't eat square stuff.

286
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,260
You eat square stuff.

287
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,420
I never eat anything that can be served in a square.

288
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,120
You know what I don't put?

289
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,780
You know what I don't do?

290
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,020
I don't put cheese on the mashed potatoes.

291
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:38,980
Why?

292
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,820
Because that's not traditional Shepherds Pie.

293
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,020
You should be killed.

294
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,380
I shouldn't.

295
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:43,180
You should be fucking killed.

296
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,360
I shouldn't be killed.

297
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:47,980
You're trying to make it like the tradition of the worst cuisine in the world.

298
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:50,320
It's Gordon Ramsay's recipe.

299
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,820
You don't make Gordon Ramsay's recipe.

300
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,320
I don't.

301
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:52,820
I make Patrick's recipe.

302
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,920
You take a British man's word for shepherd's pie, dude?

303
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,520
Yeah.

304
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,220
That's fucked.

305
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,220
Who am I supposed to be trusting?

306
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,320
That's very fucked up.

307
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Irish guy.

308
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,220
Oh, an Irish guy?

309
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,020
Yeah, what are you talking about?

310
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,620
You're taking a fucking-

311
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,420
He's Scottish!

312
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,320
No, he's not.

313
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,220
Yeah, he's Scottish.

314
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,820
He's a monkey from Mars.

315
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,520
Look at his face.

316
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,020
Yeah.

317
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,520
It's true.

318
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,520
What are you talking about, dude?

319
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,620
He literally like-

320
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,120
Gordon Ramsay is Scottish.

321
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,820
No, dude.

322
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,720
He was fucking-

323
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,520
He was grown like Little Shop of Horrors and then he fucking popped out.

324
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,220
What?

325
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,720
Yeah.

326
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,120
He was grown?

327
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
He's not Scottish.

328
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,320
He was born in Johnstone, Scotland.

329
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Oh, raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, England.

330
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,240
Oh, fuck.

331
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,740
Okay.

332
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:26,820
That's right, dude.

333
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,820
And you're trusting that, man?

334
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,320
That's the guy, yeah.

335
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:28,920
That's the guy who's...

336
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,360
Maybe you are Italian, dude.

337
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
Recipe, you're not Irish now.

338
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,820
No way.

339
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
No, shut up.

340
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,080
You just lost your Irish card.

341
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:35,580
I just got it.

342
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,400
No, this is my...

343
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,900
I got this for...

344
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,320
Christ.

345
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,900
Well, I got a missed call from my mom.

346
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,280
She's calling you to tell you that you're really not Irish.

347
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,040
She just found out.

348
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,980
She's got the results back.

349
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:48,620
No.

350
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:53,420
Yep. She just felt the hairs raise up on the back of her neck when you said that you you follow

351
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:57,980
Gordon Ramsay's recipe for shepherd's pie and she's like I have to call him right now. Well I'm like

352
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:04,380
I'm I looked at my 23andMe results I'm like British enough. You're adopted. So okay if you're I mean

353
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,500
I'm okay you can say you're British enough that's fine but now that you you're a you're an

354
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,260
you're an Irish LARPer dude. You either claim it or you reject it. Okay.

355
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:21,980
there's more Irish than there is British. You think that it's good to be both Irish?

356
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:25,500
You think that Irish people should also be British is what you're saying right now, I think.

357
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,700
That's pretty much the argument you're making to me. I'll say this, British and Irish people are

358
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,540
the same. They're the same. They're not the same. They're the same. I've also been thinking about

359
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:42,140
this. So if I was a president, I would probably nuke every other country in the world immediately

360
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,180
Because then I could just like watch TV.

361
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's yeah, not a bad plan.

362
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,900
I feel like that's an amazing plan, right?

363
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,980
I mean, you're going to be the one who survives, right?

364
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,780
Like that much this fucking week of people been talking about, like,

365
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:03,660
oh, Cuba this and there's and there's a ship at China and there's and there's soccer in Europe.

366
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,780
And it's like, shut up, dude.

367
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,940
Can I just fucking watch TV?

368
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,660
That's right.

369
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,100
Fucking annoying me, dude.

370
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,580
Yeah, it's like I'm just done with it.

371
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,220
Like I don't I'm done caring about any other country.

372
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,780
Yeah.

373
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,780
Like I'm just I live here and I'm like,

374
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,020
when that when that Cuba shit's happening.

375
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,780
I'm not going to care.

376
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:25,900
I don't I don't care when when that did or when it on.

377
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,260
Yeah, the mixing up when it when it happens.

378
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:29,820
Yep.

379
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,460
Because we did.

380
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,380
We're not backlogging this.

381
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:32,700
Yeah.

382
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,140
Or when that happened.

383
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:34,640
Today is.

384
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,940
It's October.

385
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,860
When when when?

386
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:39,580
How are you guys?

387
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,340
What's your plan to dodge the draft when we invade Cuba?

388
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,580
Um, I won't. Probably.

389
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,500
You won't? I'm gonna be in there.

390
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,860
I'm gonna be cracking skulls, dude. Really?

391
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,780
Yep. The thing is, I- Are you kidding me?

392
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,420
Vacation in Havana? No, you don't vacation.

393
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,820
You have to kill kids. Oh, not if you just tell them you don't want to.

394
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,100
Yeah. Not if you don't.

395
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,260
You say, "Oh, I just wanted to join so I could get, like, the sun and the beach or whatever."

396
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm here to tan. I'm in the tanning force.

397
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,420
I'm here with my big reflective piece of metal.

398
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,780
Oh no, I know. I'm one of the guys they sent over just to put more brands into the grocery

399
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,860
store. I don't do the killing stuff.

400
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:27,180
There's a talking jiff in the Cuban grocery store. Ah, much better. All right, we're done.

401
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:33,780
Yeah. Dude, I will join the military if I could join the eSports team, I think. Because

402
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,820
they got to have a serious lack of talent.

403
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,820
Oh yeah.

404
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,820
And I would be...

405
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,900
Oh dude, I don't know, they have drone operators.

406
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,660
Those guys are like...

407
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,580
That's not impressive to me.

408
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,660
Those things are heat seeking.

409
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:49,020
Nobody in the Navy or Air Force has the aim that I have.

410
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,180
We should buy a drone to see how...

411
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,460
We should buy a drone to see inside the girls locker room.

412
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,180
It's so loud.

413
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:06,180
it's

414
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,340
And you're like, "Oh, that's a fly."

415
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,180
It's a weapon's drone too, like it's a military.

416
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,180
Yeah.

417
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,180
Yeah.

418
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,180
Well, yeah, what's that noise in the air vent above?

419
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,180
Yeah, it just keeps, you said this heat's heating.

420
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:23,180
It's just Obama's voice.

421
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,660
It just keeps targeting, it just keeps targeting your hot penis.

422
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,900
Oh my God, wait, my recording just stopped.

423
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,260
Oh, are you kidding me?

424
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,260
I'm not kidding you.

425
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,260
You mother fucker.

426
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm starting again right now.

427
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,260
It doesn't matter what you say right now or not.

428
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,260
Can we do a clap or something?

429
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,260
No, don't do a clap.

430
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
13.59

431
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,260
13.59, let me write that down.

432
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
Alright, and I'm not cutting this part out either.

433
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,260
Really? Fuck em.

434
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,260
I was at McDonald's last night.

435
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
I was getting McChicken.

436
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,260
Ooooo.

437
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Yeah, and a guy, there were two guys waiting for their orders in front of me.

438
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:09,020
in front of me. One of them was an Uber Eats driver. And they started having this conversation.

439
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:14,620
And this one guy was clearly very fucked up on something. And he asked the Uber Eats driver,

440
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:22,140
"So what are you doing here?" And the guy was like, "Oh, I'm Uber Eats." And then the guy was like,

441
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:30,140
"I'm Uber Eats?" Uber Eats driver was like, "What?" And then there's a long pause. The guy was like,

442
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,500
No, man, I'm sorry. I just know a guy named Uber.

443
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:40,060
How do you think honestly, how do you think that's spelled?

444
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,940
He's telling the truth.

445
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,900
Their kid Uber Eats.

446
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:46,700
I know it might be like Uber Eats or something.

447
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,300
Yeah, my guess is like O-B-E-R-I-Z-E.

448
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,420
Yeah, it's got to be something like that, but it was making me laugh so hard, dude.

449
00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:00,140
I'm so glad I was wearing a mask because, yeah, because it was immediately laughing.

450
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:07,500
with this crazy virus. As soon as he said, "I'm Upris." That was already, that already hit me,

451
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,140
Guy. I realized today that I've become one of those people who's just like talking all the

452
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,180
time on the street to like anybody who walks by them. Like it shifted like today. Yeah, I did,

453
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:22,060
like, it's just like, I used to be my like, when you, when, like, when you walk past them,

454
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,260
you can see them kind of like talking to themselves. No, no, it's not even that. It's

455
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,580
like, I will just address everything that happens on the street as I walk by it out loud.

456
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,740
Hey, that's pretty crazy, huh?

457
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,620
Yeah, I got around. Yeah, exactly.

458
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,940
It was like he's like ever since I moved to New York, I've just always been

459
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,640
just like, look at my shoes, like walk around, be quiet.

460
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,980
But today I walked by like two ladies who had their dog

461
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,680
they had their dog leash all spun up.

462
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,520
I did not. I.

463
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:52,640
Now they did not do giant T-bones covered in barbecue sauce.

464
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,420
But I did. I was I saw that they had their dog leashes all mixed up

465
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,080
between the two dogs.

466
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,840
And I said, Oh, no, they all tangled up now.

467
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,180
And they just looked at me as they're like struggling

468
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:06,080
to like make their dogs out, bite each other.

469
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,340
Like, what?

470
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:10,280
They all tangled up now.

471
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,880
You know, they tangled now.

472
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,480
Imagine that the people.

473
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,320
Wow. Well, that's strange.

474
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,380
Hey, everybody, come look at this.

475
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,620
Hey, open up your window.

476
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:22,740
Look down. There's two dogs tangled up.

477
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,280
I was trying to be friendly, man.

478
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,320
And they just fucking they just give me the icy eyes.

479
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,920
You were being rude.

480
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,200
Man, y'all stupid as hell tangling your dogs up.

481
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,520
[laughs]

482
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,960
You do that voice too?

483
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Yeah, I did.

484
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,400
I hope you were doing that voice.

485
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,960
I was trying to be loud, you know?

486
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,960
That's as soon as I get above a certain kind of decibel level.

487
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,920
Right, let's do a test.

488
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,120
Okay, just start quiet.

489
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,320
Start saying something.

490
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,200
Oh man, they are all tangled up now.

491
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay, get a little louder.

492
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,440
They're all tangled up now.

493
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,920
Okay, a little louder.

494
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,600
They all tangled up now!

495
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,560
[laughs]

496
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,080
Okay, what happens if you go,

497
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,920
Oh, what happens if you go loud in that?

498
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:02,620
Oh, no, they all got tangled up now.

499
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,220
They got tangled now.

500
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,800
If you don't just tangle.

501
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,760
Yeah, my GPS does that, too.

502
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,260
If you turn it up.

503
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:14,140
Oh, no, you miss.

504
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,260
Oh, you miss.

505
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,640
Oh, come on.

506
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,880
Oh, oh, just does that before every instruction.

507
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,980
Oh, no, no, you got to take a left here, man.

508
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,100
Oh, nah, man.

509
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,260
Man, I've been really stressed out lately

510
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,140
and just kind of like going through situations in my head.

511
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:36,820
Studied for the SIT.

512
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,220
Yeah, oh man, I can't wait.

513
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,300
PSAT.

514
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,100
I can't wait to go to college again.

515
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,940
But I realized the other day,

516
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,380
I was like just like trying to like figure something out

517
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,100
and realized I was like just like thinking with my hands

518
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,780
and like looked up and saw somebody

519
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,180
And I was just like doing like, just like, okay.

520
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,020
Just like.

521
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,580
- Just going Sherlock Holmes, mind telling.

522
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,420
- Yeah, exactly.

523
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:02,260
- Like moving equations with your fear.

524
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,100
- As I'm walking, as I'm walking.

525
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,620
So I just look like insanely great.

526
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,740
Like I look insane.

527
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,580
Like I'm like just.

528
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,780
- You kinda look cool, man.

529
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,940
- Just the guy, just like, like you saw me yesterday.

530
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:15,340
I was wearing like a fucking, like a button down shirt

531
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,580
and like my chain is like hanging out.

532
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,780
And I was like, I just looked so Italian.

533
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,380
- People probably thought I was crazy too.

534
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:25,420
I was blasting heavy metal music on my headphones to get this.

535
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,620
I wasn't looking where I was walking.

536
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,380
I was playing crosswords on my phone.

537
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,900
Wow.

538
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,580
They probably thought I was like homeless or something.

539
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,780
I was dressed up like a one man band.

540
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,420
Yeah.

541
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,700
Walking around like it was like Dick Van Dyke and I was, yeah, I was in my monster

542
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,420
costume and I was chasing people.

543
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,260
They probably thought I was crazy as hell.

544
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,660
I was walking up to people like, hello, Mary Poppins.

545
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:52,220
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

546
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,580
I does what I like.

547
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,780
It's so fucking funny that he was supposed to be British.

548
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,140
I've talked to me. I just thought he was me, man.

549
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,500
I just thought he was mentally impaired.

550
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,060
I didn't think that was supposed to be a British man in that movie.

551
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,700
And then what they had Lin-Manuel Miranda in the in the remake.

552
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,180
Yeah, made that movie.

553
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,580
Because now it was a remake.

554
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,300
I think my mom watched that movie.

555
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,300
Was it like a remake?

556
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,740
Or was it like a making like what was that?

557
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:24,500
Oh, it was a sequel. It was a sequel of something. It was something weird.

558
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,100
It was like a sequel that was like in the real world or something. I don't remember.

559
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,420
Mary Poppins Returns. What's it called? Mary Poppins Returns? Yeah. Dick Van Dyke was in it.

560
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,220
Really? But Lin-Manuel played that same role?

561
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,820
Lin-Manuel played Jack, a cockney lamplighter. Oh no.

562
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,860
Oh, Jesus Christ. An apprentice of Bert.

563
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,500
I've got the soot on my face, governor.

564
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,220
I've got soot on my face. I love this place.

565
00:20:49,220 --> 00:21:03,100
is

566
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:05,380
That's right. Yeah. Yeah

567
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:09,060
Just give me an upskirt scene

568
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:14,440
Cuz she got that long-ass dress. What you see? Yeah, she floats down on the umbrella - like she comes

569
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,620
Yeah, like it's like be so fucking easy

570
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,820
You know just make him look up once just once. Oh, I'm saying did you show me your thingy?

571
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,300
You know, I don't what I don't want to see Mary Poppins thing. Sorry. Never mind. You're not Italian. I

572
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,740
I changed my mind. You don't want to go up her chimney?

573
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,780
I don't want to see her chimney. You don't want to go chim-chim-ree in her

574
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,420
fucking... I don't want to lift up her... You don't want to do what you like?

575
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,140
I don't want her skirt to lift up and a bunch of soot to come out of the chimney.

576
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:47,580
I think you do. Just that actually. That's a fucking crazy image.

577
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,540
Just like a bunch of soot hitting somebody's face. Like somebody trying to uproot somebody.

578
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,820
A bunch of shit soot. It just flies out.

579
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,500
Blasting off like a rocket, black smoke all over you.

580
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,900
Oh, yeah.

581
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,360
Oh, man.

582
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,700
It's a it's how you prevent it.

583
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,560
It's like when they put the that like red dye all over the money when you steal it.

584
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,800
You know? Oh, yeah.

585
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,360
Yeah. Or or on on like T-shirts at like department stores.

586
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,500
They'll put that like little ink bomb.

587
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,960
Oh, yeah. On the shirt.

588
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,660
You know how to get those off like the the tags is

589
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,820
because I have a bunch of that's just so much clothes.

590
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,560
They're the ones like the circular ones.

591
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,000
You just have to burn the top and the pin comes out.

592
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,060
Yeah. I heard.

593
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,900
And also if you kill the store manager.

594
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,060
Yeah. And I'll put him in the back and then wear his clothes.

595
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,300
Oh, yeah. Kind of magic.

596
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,460
Well, that's the trick. Yeah.

597
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,260
None of the clothes that the that the store workers are wearing

598
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,060
have any have that stuff on them. Yeah.

599
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,500
She thinks they just have to close it to them.

600
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,620
That's the exactly the employees security device. Yeah.

601
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,820
But they're pretty they're easy to remove.

602
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,160
Yeah. Yeah. You just tickle them and they'll leave.

603
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,560
Yeah, then they get they get normal.

604
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,740
They get normal.

605
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,500
They get normal.

606
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,240
I don't know what I'm going to go to a mall recently.

607
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,740
Oh, do you guys want to take a trip to the mall?

608
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,140
Let's go to the mall.

609
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,740
Like, can we just go to the mall?

610
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:11,080
We got to know I've been saving all this money eating fucking old tacos.

611
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,640
We should go.

612
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,940
I've earned myself a little shopping spree at the mall.

613
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:17,520
And we go to that mall near the where the Nets play.

614
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,420
The Brooklyn Mall.

615
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,480
Is that what it's called?

616
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,580
I don't know.

617
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,260
The Berkeley Center, the Berkeley.

618
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,580
You guys want to go to the mall and just go to all the kiosks and those stores?

619
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,900
I went to... So I was going to the mall.

620
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,620
Phone cases?

621
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:37,260
It was my brother's wedding four months ago. And I think, I don't fucking know.

622
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,500
Yeah.

623
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,140
My brother's wedding.

624
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,980
Yeah, this will come out in January.

625
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:46,060
Okay. So it was my brother's wedding six years ago. And I was trying to... I was like buying shoes.

626
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,220
I was just kind of like walking around because my mom was like shopping. And I got...

627
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:55,660
there's like a group of kids sitting on a kiosk, like where like a kiosk was.

628
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,220
Yeah.

629
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:59,500
Like where like a bigger kiosk should have been, but they were all sitting on it.

630
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:03,500
And I thought they were just hanging out, but like one of them came up to me and was like,

631
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,500
"Yo, yo, yo, yo, what's your name?" I'm like, "Patrick, why?"

632
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,020
They was like, "Yo, I got something for your phasos, dude. Come over here."

633
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:17,260
And I was like, "No, I'm all set." And I left, then walked back the other way.

634
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:20,060
And the guy came up to me, same kid comes up to me, he's like,

635
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:25,740
"Hey man, real quick, let me talk to you." And I was like, "You already fucking tried this."

636
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,220
He was there, it was like these kids. He was chasing you?

637
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:33,740
He didn't recognize me. He didn't recognize me because he just really, I think I was wearing a

638
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:39,580
hat actually, you know what? So I did buy a Red Sox fitted at Lids. Why the fuck would he recognize

639
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:44,460
you? Why would he know who you were? I mean, come on. He's a million people a day, works at a mall,

640
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,300
the most popular place in the world.

641
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,620
It wasn't pop, it wasn't, it wasn't popping then.

642
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,980
It was also sad now, man, you walk through a mall and it's like,

643
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,980
there's, it's like an elephant graveyard.

644
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,860
There's just like, like elephant skeletons everywhere.

645
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,860
There's big bones everywhere.

646
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:01,020
Hyenas constantly laughing at you.

647
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,180

There's a toucan.

651
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,780
Yeah, that kid.

[Laughter]

661
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,300
It's just like a

662
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:47,300
the buckle on the Air Force one

663
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,300
is like an actual, you know, like that little like metal thing

664
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
Like Santa's buckle.

665
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,300
It's like a big brass buckle.

666
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,300
I want to go to the mall and I want to go to one of those

667
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
toy kiosks where they have like

668
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,300
they have you know something set up where all the toys

669
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,300
are jumping around and they're like

670
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,300

671
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300

672
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,300
thing. I want to buy

677
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:25,420
So I'll be returning all but one later today. Yeah, dude.

678
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,860
I'll up the samples, man. Every time I go, dude, I'm getting full on samples.

679
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,660
I'm not even ordering anything from Chick-fil-A.

680
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,500
We had some Kung Pao chicken.

681
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,500
They don't have samples at the mall now because of COVID.

682
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
I don't care.

683
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
I'm going to...

684
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
They're coming back.

685
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
If you...

686
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Maybe you could request.

687
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Oh, maybe you have to...

688
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Yeah, you have to sign a sheet of paper before you get a sample.

689
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
Yeah.

690
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Yeah.

691
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,500
It'd still be worth it, dude.

692
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
That's a free food.

693
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
Proof of vaccination.

694
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
I'm trying to save money, dude.

695
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
I'm in money saving mode, man.

696
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,500
Yeah.

697
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
If you just go to a bunch of different malls...

698
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm not even washing my clothes anymore.

699
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,500
...and just get samples every day.

700
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
I'm not showering.

701
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
You don't have to...

702
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,220
anymore ever again. And you can save up for that guitar at Guitar Center in the mall.

703
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:14,460
And you can walk in, you could be like, "Can I get a sample of like maybe two eggs

704
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:19,420
raw? And could I get a sample of some salt and some pepper?"

705
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,860
Yeah, and a fry pan.

706
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,780
"Can I get a sample of a little tiny bit of milk?"

707
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,220
And...

708
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:29,980
"Can I get a sample of Big Mac sauce? And can I get a sample of hamburger meat?"

709
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,340
Is he doing your grocery shopping?

710
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,420
If you guys want a money move, try going to the bank and asking for a sample.

711
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:35,980
Yeah.

712
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,100
They have to give it to you.

713
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,140
Oh my god.

714
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,900
Can I get a sample of $1,000?

715
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,100
Like a sample of the millionaire package?

716
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,740
Yeah, like I'm gonna buy a million dollars pretty soon, but I'd like to get a sample of a thousand.

717
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,940
Can I test it out?

718
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,620
Just to test it out, make sure that it's good.

719
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,740
Yeah.

720
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,620
And they'd go, "Yeah, sure."

721
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,140
They handed you a thousand dollars on a toothpick.

722
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:58,460
I'd love a sample of a cashier's check from that guy's account over there,

723
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,820
wearing the nice suit.

724
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,020
Come on, it's just a sample.

725
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Like I'm gonna...

726
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,520
Yeah.

727
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,020
I'm gonna actually...

728
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,520
I just want to look at the check.

729
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,020
I'm not gonna deposit it.

730
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,320
I just want to make sure that it's a good looking check.

731
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,420
I'm gonna get one myself.

732
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,820
Okay, I'm just gonna go look at this outside for a minute.

733
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,020
Good evening!

734
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,520
I'd like to...

735
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
*laughter*

736
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,020
Hello!

737
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,020
Hello!

738
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,520
A bank?

739
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,520
I had no idea there was one here.

740
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,820
Do you have samples, perchance?

741
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:35,060
I'd like to cash this cashier's check I just found.

742
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,060
Oh my god.

743
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,060
All right, we have two lists today.

744
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Yeah, we might not get through them.

745
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,060
We might not get through them, but hey, we're taking it.

746
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,060
I mean, whatever the wind takes us today, man.

747
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
That's right.

748
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,060
You and Cameron are the wind beneath my wings.

749
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,060
You're a fart.

750
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,060
You're a sweetie.

751
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,060
I'm a fart.

752
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,060
I'm a fart.

753
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,060
I'm a fart.

754
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,060
I'm a fart.

755
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
I'm a fart.

756
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,060
I'm a fart.

757
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,060
I'm a fart.

758
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,060
I'm a fart.

759
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
I'm a fart.

760
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
I'm a fart.

761
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,060
I'm a fart.

762
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,060
I'm a fart.

763
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,060
I'm a fart.

764
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,060
I'm a fart.

765
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,060
that's wind so I guess

766
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,060
you're saying you're saying you're not really in the forest

767
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,060
ok

768
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,060
yo!

769
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,060
this is the most

770
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:22,060
yeah

771
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:26,060
look out for these people

772
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:40,580
to

773
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,740
It's been laughed out of every scientific community.

774
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,500
- Basically, what is the UN, what's your theory?

775
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,680
- You can make ice at home

776
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,460
by putting a cup of water in the freezer.

777
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:56,060
- Yeah, I actually have a few formulas

778
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:00,180
that people haven't really been accepting of.

779
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,020
(coughing)

780
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,300
I had this one formula that was--

781
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,540
- I'm so sick, 'cause you guys aren't laughing at me.

782
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:13,020
It's this formula called 1 McChicken 219, 2 McChicken 3.

783
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,020
It's equals.

784
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,020
Sounds pretty good.

785
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:18,220
Yeah, there's equals signs in there too, but I didn't want to give the whole thing away.

786
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,940
I've had this theory that you can age taco chicken like beer, and it will slowly get

787
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:27,180
better and alcoholic, but it actually just gives you a stomachache and diarrhea when

788
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,180
you're trying to work.

789
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,860
I got to get a glass of water.

790
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,980
That Jool hit really took me out.

791
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,300
You just swallowed a chicken bone.

792
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,300
I think I might have.

793
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:41,340
I think something's going wrong with me. Maybe I got the Delta variant. Maybe that's why.

794
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,340
That's serious. Yeah.

795
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,260
Do you guys know the Delta variant? You can't even get it if you're vaccinated.

796
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,900
You know that the COVID has been fake this entire time?

797
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:56,140
It's fucking, it's so stupid dude. Every website is being like, the Delta variant is going

798
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,940
to kill us all. It's like, no, it's just going to kill a ton of people.

799
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,780
I've been faking being vaccinated.

800
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:06,100
I do like that it now stuff is open

801
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,560
enough in New York that if you weren't

802
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,120
vaccinated, it just doesn't matter.

803
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,520
Like the people at the bar will be like,

804
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,240
hey, are you vaccinated?

805
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,840
You're like, oh, you should have seen

806
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,500
me the day after my shot.

807
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,880
Oh my goodness.

808
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,560
I was, uh, I had, uh, uh, uh, oh my God.

809
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,700
I got a special, the special bed.

810
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,780
They made me lie on to get vaccinated.

811
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,260
Right?

812
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:27,740
Yeah.

813
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:29,740
I think they put your beer on the...

814
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,540
It was so sticky.

815
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:32,040
Watching their reaction to fishing.

816
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,040
I mean the special chair,

817
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
the special nurse thing.

818
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
They put your drink on the bar

819
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,740
and you try to pick it up.

820
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,740
You're like, "Oh, I can't even pick it up with my arm.

821
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,740
It's so sore still from that damn shot.

822
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,940
I'll have to use my left arm.

823
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,740
Oh, wait, that's where I got the second shot.

824
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,240
Oh my God."

825
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,740
You have a huge straw.

826
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,240
Yeah, man.

827
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,740
My blood was so green the next day.

828
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,740
I just, you know,

829
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:56,940
right now I just need to sit down at the bar

830
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,740
And the only cure for my COVID vaccine withdrawal is one.

831
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,680
I'm having a withdrawal.

832
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,340
That's how much I got the vaccine.

833
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,140
I mean, I just I need I need two shots, one shot of Jameson

834
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,180
and a third shot, my damn arm.

835
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,820
That's right. Right.

836
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,840
Yeah, I got the vaccine 600 times.

837
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:20,380
Yeah, I didn't. I didn't just say that you're someone else.

838
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:25,180
I did my name the first time, and then I said my name was Ricardo Gomez.

839
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:31,300
599 times. I'm just walking in. Yeah, no, I'm a different Ricardo Gomez from the guy that

840
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:38,300
you had yesterday. It sucks that I changed my name the week after I got my first shot.

841
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,900
Yeah. Number one, doctor I know what's best. We all know a doctor like that. I would say

842
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,580
most doctors probably think that they know what's best as compared to someone like me

843
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,700
who has never done anything doctor like. It's true. Right. I mean, I'm sick of doctors trying

844
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:56,300
to tell me what to do. Yeah, stop putting your hand on the stove.

845
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,500
Yeah, I came in here. I came in here to check how hot it gets.

846
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:04,140
I came in here to draw on the paper that's on the seat. I don't I don't really care about

847
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,980
what you have to say to me. Just shut up. Just shut up and give me my

848
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,020
fucking ibuprofen, you asshole. Yeah, I hand. I touch the stove again. I need

849
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:16,140
ibuprofen. Just give me the ibuprofen, dude. Yeah, I

850
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,980
know. I want it through my insurance. It's $100 a bottle. Please just fucking give it

851
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,980
to me. They don't sell 200 milligram ibuprofen at the store. You're lying.

852
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:30,380
They don't sell that there. I asked. Doctors are so bossy.

853
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,740
Yeah. It's like if you, if you put that,

854
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:35,060
that thermometer thing in my ear one more time,

855
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,340
I'm literally going to kill you. Yeah, I'm going to kill you.

856
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,140
I have a gun in my car. I'm going to kill you.

857
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,380
It would be a fun prank is a, put it like a big piece of like a,

858
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,540
like red wax or something in your ear while the doc,

859
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,100
before the doctor puts that

860
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,540
that little thing in your ear.

861
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,100
Dude, I had the I had the best prank ever.

862
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:53,840
I said gum.

863
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
I swallowed a big a big tumor

864
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,620
and I went and I went,

865
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,440
oh, I think I have stomach cancer.

866
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,420
They totally fell for it.

867
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,620
They're so stupid.

868
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,220
Yeah, so fucking stupid.

869
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,060
I fucking I hate doctors, man.

870
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,680
I dude, I was I was standing.

871
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,780
I was standing.

872
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,260
I was standing right in front

873
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,420
of the microwave dick level.

874
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:12,460
I went and I said, I think I'm sterile.

875
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,200
They fell for it.

876
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,660
Dude, hook, line and sinker.

877
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,940
Yeah, I mean, I can't have kids now,

878
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,040
But what's that fucking what's that?

879
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,580
What's that little thing around their their their neck?

880
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:24,940
Are they trying to rob a bank over here?

881
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,640
Why? Yeah, you look like you're about to rob a bank.

882
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,980
Yeah. Hey, your iPod's just a little circle.

883
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,280
Don't think. Yeah, that's got to be the worst iPod ever.

884
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,320
Maybe. Yeah.

885
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,480
It's not going to play any music.

886
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,020
You let me sing into it.

887
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,940
Let me flick it twice, please.

888
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,940
Come on.

889
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,080
I got a miracle.

890
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,680
You know, when you see a doctor on the train on the way to work

891
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,600
and he's humming into his stethoscope

892
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,480
as he forgot his iPod at home.

893
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,080
He's going to do do do do do do do do do.

894
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,520
I got I can tell.

895
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,080
Yeah, this the fidelity of this stethoscope.

896
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,880
Wow. Wow.

897
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,880
The the mids in this are amazing.

898
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,000
Yeah, this really sounds amazing.

899
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,640
Yeah. They always use Tom's Diner by Suzanne Fagan.

900
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,960
Yeah, that is. It's a good benchmark.

901
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,560
Well, it's I would say Tom's Diner is a perfect song

902
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,680
for a human to try to sing by themselves.

903
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,360
That's without any instruments.

904
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,260
It's the only actual acapella song.

905
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,400
Yeah, that's the one that they tested.

906
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,060
That's how they made MP3 was that song.

907
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,640
That's how I made MP3. Yeah.

908
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,100
Yeah. It's fun fact.

909
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,400
I don't know what that means.

910
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,100
I knew I knew Cameron got it.

911
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,740
I knew Cameron got the joke, but I didn't get the joke.

912
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,040
I was just saying that because I didn't know what you're talking about.

913
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,180
I was repeating what you said.

914
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,940
What do you mean they made MP3 with that song?

915
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:42,780
That song, they couldn't get vocals for MP3 files like they had everything

916
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,880
pretty much set. And then that song is the one that they use to test whether or not the

917
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,620
vocals would work for MP3. Is that true? Yeah, I watched a Vox video about this. Oh, yeah,

918
00:35:54,620 --> 00:36:01,200
I don't watch Vox. I wouldn't know that. That's I watched that one. And then the one it's nice.

919
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:06,320
Something that's nice about like about like, tick tock and like and like, and like just

920
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:10,020
all these like YouTube explainer stuff taking off is there some facts that people can tell

921
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,980
you that you instantly know you never have to listen to anything else they say.

922
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,980
Yeah.

923
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,980
Because you know that it's a fact that it's only on TikTok or something.

924
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Yeah, exactly.

925
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
Right.

926
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,980
I mean, not that that one's one of the pet.

927
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
This is an unrelated thing.

928
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,460
Yeah, like, dude, the people are like, "You know we're running out of helium?"

929
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,460
It's like, "Fuck you, dude.

930
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,620
Go home and watch fucking Veritasium, you fucking loser."

931
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,300
Why are you bothering me?

932
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,300
Why are you bothering me?

933
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:36,020
Did you know that we're running out of helium?

934
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
No, I had no idea.

935
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
Okay, go to the store and get some more, bitch.

936
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,020
What's up?

937
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,020
*laughter*

938
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,020
*laughter*

939
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
I fucking love this stuff!

940
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
*laughter*

941
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,020
I'm addicted to helium!

942
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,020
Yeah, that's probably just a misinformation campaign.

943
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,020
I don't know what you're talking about.

944
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,020
Yeah, that's probably-

945
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
Homeless guy on the street who comes up to you and he's like,

946
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,020
"Hey man, can I have five dollars?"

947
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,020
And your dad's like, "Don't give it to him. He's just gonna use it for fucking helium."

948
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,020
He's gonna go to the grocery store and buy balloons.

949
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,020
He's gonna buy some damn balloons, junkie.

950
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,020
Yeah.

951
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:11,500
lips are like bright purple getting mugged for your iron man balloon that

952
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,120
you're bringing your kids all right sucker

953
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:31,060
I do love doing that though yeah oh man the high voice on a balloon yeah you

954
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,860
have to like pay back a friend and they're like all right like where's the

955
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,860
I swear, I just, I needed to pay rent.

956
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,860
It's like an intervention.

957
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,860
See, I wish it like, like...

958
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Donald, we know you've been using again.

959
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,860
Shut the f*** up, b***h! What are you talking about?

960
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:50,860
Yeah, you come home late at night, your dad's like, "Where have you been?"

961
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,860
Nowhere! I haven't been!

962
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,860
I was in the library, I was studying!

963
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,860
Yeah!

964
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,860
Did you go to another damn birthday party?

965
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,860
No!

966
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,860
Somehow have a high burp

967
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:11,940
Donald yeah, or like I knew you had a problem. I knew you had a problem when you went to my mother's my mother's birthday

00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:15,820
Getting you in the garage and you were sucking down

969
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:19,120
the the middle part of a spider-man

970
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:22,020

She's not eight!

974
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:36,860
Getting sold, getting sold your first uh, your first like helium by, by your slacker friend in high school

975
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:39,260
and like, and like doing it in front of him being like,

976
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:43,340
"Yeah man, I feel it's totally working. I can feel it. Oh my god."

977
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,100
"My eye is hella right now."

978
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:49,180
"My eye is hella up there. Damn, I can totally tell it's affecting my voice."

979
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,900
Have you seen that spider man, that like, that spider man balloon where it's like him like

980
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:57,180
doing like a web crawl and then there's like in the middle it looks like his penis.

981
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,380
He has his wiener out? Yeah.

982
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,540
Yeah, I was trying to talk about that spider-man balloon. I'm so

983
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:05,600
Times I'm so tired today. I'm ruining the episode. I'm sorry

984
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:15,180
I'm straight up gonna kill you. I'm ruining. I'm ruining it. I'm ruining all the stuff

985
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,580
Dude, you look so cute when you ruin the episode. Oh god

986
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:26,300
Did you fucking to keep I'm gonna I'm gonna go throw up now. I'm gonna go don't throw up for no reason

987
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,860
Oh my God, I think I'm gonna puke.

988
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,180
Oh no, God.

989
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:34,540
Number two type of people in the scientific community.

990
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,340
Number two is Professor Awkward.

991
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:41,180
Now we didn't read the comment on the Positron Wildhog

992
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,700
writes long blurbs about these ones.

993
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:47,180
I want to just at least read the first sentence here about Professor Awkward.

994
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:47,500
Okay.

995
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,380
Which is, "Now here's a character who was photoshopped into our world by a drunk ape."

996
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,540
Facts.

997
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,340
That's true, yeah.

998
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:02,340
Yeah, so true. I hate Professor Awkward dude. I'm not a fan of Professor Awkward. Yeah.

999
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:08,600
Professor Awkward. Don't you hate it when Professor Awkward leans over and he farts

1000
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:17,600
in front of the whole friggin' scientific community. And he gets up and he goes "Umm,

1001
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:21,440
up and he goes, Oh, it wasn't me.

1002
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,120
Yeah.

1003
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:22,880
And then, yeah.

1004
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,100
And the guy next to you turns and says, didn't you used to do

1005
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,480
experiments with that guy?

1006
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,400
And you say, no, I swear.

1007
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,840
No, I don't know who that is.

1008
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,280
No, no, I promise.

1009
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,440
Um, number three is those excited by boring things.

1010
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,180
Yup.

1011
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,460
Yup.

1012
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:42,040
That's a lot of those scientific can tell you a science.

1013
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,240
If you're excited by science, you're probably one of these people.

1014
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,360
Cause that's boring.

1015
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,520
Here's a comment and I think we can maybe, you know, we can talk about this comment,

1016
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,420
but my grade seven Polish science teacher.

1017
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,020
The way she jumps up and down because she's excited by science.

1018
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:57,920
She's great.

1019
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,920
Polish science.

1020
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,820
Polish lady.

1021
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,620
So she's not jumping up and down because she's excited by science.

1022
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,020
She's trying to change the light bulb.

1023
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:11,220
And a reason like jumping up and down because the light bulb finally got

1024
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:11,920
turned on.

1025
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,020
Yeah, pull it.

1026
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:13,420
Yeah,

1027
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,960
The Polish science class and all the kids are just trying to make a potato battery to power

1028
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,360
one light bulb.

1029
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,160
Yeah, they're making a potato battery to power the other potato battery.

1030
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,160
The top.

1031
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:34,400
Dude, yeah, they have they have like a they have a science lab.

1032
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,040
They all put on on like safety goggles and like lab coats and like protective gear, gloves

1033
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,040
and stuff.

1034
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,440
just trying to pour a glass of water out of a pitcher and it just keeps dribbling down

1035
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,440
the side every time.

1036
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,640
Put on a full hazmat suit to like take a test.

1037
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
Yeah.

1038
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,800
Alright, today we're going to be installing a screen door on a boat.

1039
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
Yeah.

1040
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,640
Dude, everyone, everyone failed the first two questions on the Polish science test, name

1041
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
and date.

1042
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,640
It was a tough one.

1043
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:09,200
Oh boy.

1044
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,200
before the clutts

1045
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,740
Oh, the klutzy scientist, the klutz.

1046
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,900
That has to have been some like 90s SNL sketch, right?

1047
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,880
That's the nutty professor.

1048
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,100
Yeah, I guess it was the nutty professor, huh?

1049
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,780
But he wasn't clumsy, was he?

1050
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,540
He's just goofy.

1051
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,800
I he he was definitely nutty.

1052
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,280
I mean, he'll a beaker, though.

1053
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,180
He took that cool potion.

1054
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:33,480
And that professor.

1055
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:33,940
Yeah.

1056
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,700
Well, isn't it funny that that's like a whole like plot point and family matters?

1057
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:50,240
Yeah, it is. It's you know, it's kind of funny that they always that they're always like on TV and movies and stuff. Scientists are always making potions. The potions are magic. They should be making chemicals.

1058
00:42:50,240 --> 00:43:03,400
It's true. I agree. Yeah, it's I mean, if you want to make a cool potion, you should have a wizard character in your movie. That's making a yeah, some formula some some just because a potion is in a beaker doesn't make it not a potion.

1059
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,400
as far as I can.

1060
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Exactly, yeah.

1061
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,800
It should be an equation or maybe a model.

1062
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,200
Yeah, maybe an equation that makes you fall in love.

1063
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,560
Yeah, or a computer program.

1064
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,040
Yeah, that would work too.

1065
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,960
That would be much more scientific than a potion.

1066
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:16,960
Maybe like a laser?

1067
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:20,880
A laser might work too.

1068
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,400
I mean yeah, Flubber would just be a lot better if they were robots instead of Flubbers.

1069
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,200
They could call the movie iRobot too.

1070
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,200
That would have been cool.

1071
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,200
That would be a cool name for a robot.

1072
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,080
Yeah, that is a cool name for a robot.

1073
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:38,940
Number five is the idiot, which is, I guess like, yeah, if you had a scientist who was

1074
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:45,440
just like a village idiot style, like eyes going the wrong way, like tongue sticking

1075
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,440
out all the time.

1076
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,720
Maybe kind of a nutty professor type.

1077
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:52,600
Stop trying to make everything about the fucking nutty professor, dude.

1078
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,200
Yeah, he wasn't even that nutty, too.

1079
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,200
He's barely nutty.

1080
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,200
Are you kidding me?

1081
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,200
He was barely even nutty.

1082
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
Did you see him?

1083
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,200
He was going, "Lady!"

1084
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:07,100
it's not very nutty. The nutty professor? He was a lady! I thought that what Eddie

1085
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:12,220
Murphy didn't say that shit. No Jerry Lewis. I'm thinking of Eddie Murphy man.

1086
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:19,880
Eddie Murphy's funny as hell though. I know, hey. Eddie Murphy's funny as fuck. There's a different, that

1087
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,200
nutty professor he was just fat. Yeah that's true.

1088
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,920
They should have called him the buddy professor because his butt was too big.

1089
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,120
I mean, honestly, the fatty fucking shit professor.

1090
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:34,120
The fat, stupid, fat-ass, fucking, overweight, fatty.

1091
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:37,120
He's too fat, he can't do science.

1092
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:42,800
Um, honestly, this list I think we just skip ahead here to number 9.

1093
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,520
This is just the, this is.

1094
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,040
Number 9 is Dr. Horny.

1095
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:47,040
Oh.

1096
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,040
Whoa.

1097
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:49,440
Okay, Dr. Horny.

1098
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,440
That's right.

1099
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,680
What makes them, what makes them differ from other horny individuals is that they think

1100
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,820
they have coined the perfect algorithm for meeting and talking to the opposite sex, often

1101
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:02,720
by outlining that they have fancy-sounding degrees in obscure-sounding areas of research

1102
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,680
and often with cheesy lines that relate to such. It just ends with more and more injuries

1103
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,680
to the face for them."

1104
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
"Injuries."

1105
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:15,480
"They're getting hit in the face with a beaker. Because you go over to a lady and you say,

1106
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,480
you know, 'I want to get a...'"

1107
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:24,640
"I'm a heliomologist. I'm studying... Did you know that we're rapidly losing helium?"

1108
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:30,240
limited resource. Did you know that I'm rapidly we're rapidly

1109
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,040
losing helium?

1110
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,580
Yeah. Yeah. And then you like do you work at a grocery store or

1111
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,820
a party? So did you know that there have been a series of

1112
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,900
break-ins to science labs recently to steal helium? You

1113
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,260
should be careful and she's like completely spin for you and

1114
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,540
then you get back to to her place. Yeah. It's actually like

1115
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,500
yeah. Oh, this is great. Thank you so much for having me over.

1116
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,660
Yeah, what the fuck you're lying you're you said you were

1117
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:04,200
Number 10 is a comedian. I think a funny doctor would be funny to me. Yeah, no funny doc

1118
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,200
the thing about funny doctors is they're

1119
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:10,040
They're always they're the funny doctors are always just weird

1120
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:13,200
They're not you know, I feel like every every doctor

1121
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,080
I've had every comedian doctor I've had is very like I went to the urgent care for a

1122
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:24,180
for a sinus infection and they gave me they gave me Sudafed and the you know

1123
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:28,080
the the lady there was like you know that's that's the stuff that they make

1124
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:35,160
meth with and it's like that's not hmm you should have gone loudly hmm it feels

1125
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:38,580
like that's the that feels like a trap cuz that's like the that's just what

1126
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:43,100
they're setting you up I think I actually have 15 sinus infections all my

1127
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:47,420
friends at home have sinus infections - it's spread around everybody in my

1128
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,820
My family has a sinus infection actually.

1129
00:46:49,820 --> 00:46:53,580
Yeah, I think I'm going to need that.

1130
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,580
I'm going to need that.

1131
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,420
15 of my family members, but that is, I mean, that feels like to me.

1132
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:01,980
That's what the funny doctor is always just the doctor who's like, you're not going to

1133
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,780
sell this to your friends, are you?

1134
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:04,780
Yeah, it's like their job.

1135
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,980
The only actual funny doctor shut up.

1136
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:11,540
The only actual funny doctors are like really, really old doctors who are like refusing to

1137
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:12,540
stop working.

1138
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,100
And they're like 90 years old.

1139
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:22,420
I had one and he was like my grandma's friend and he was my family doctor growing up and

1140
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,700
he was like completely blind and he did like a physical on me for football.

1141
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:26,020
Yeah.

1142
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,260
And he was like, listen, I know your parents.

1143
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:32,500
I don't want to have to touch your balls, but we're going to have to do it.

1144
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:32,660
Yeah.

1145
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,300
I think, hey, at least you weren't like excited about it.

1146
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:35,780
Right.

1147
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:36,740
That's kind of funny.

1148
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,780
I went to the same.

1149
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,660
I think you have demonic humors in your veins.

1150
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,380
I'm going to have to bloodlet you.

1151
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:47,380
I went to the same pediatrician until I was like 20 years old.

1152
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:48,380
You went to a pediatrician?

1153
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:51,140
Yeah, I went to the same doctor until I was 20.

1154
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,940
And I was like, I can't keep going to a pediatrician.

1155
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,420
I'll just never go to the doctor again.

1156
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,940
Yeah, I haven't been to the doctor in so long.

1157
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,940
Yeah, me neither.

1158
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:00,940
There's no reason to.

1159
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:06,380
I don't think I've been to the doctor since that guy quit because he got too blind.

1160
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:09,980
Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's like, what am I going to do?

1161
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,540
I'll go if I have a broken leg, maybe.

1162
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,100
No, I will go to the hospital.

1163
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,140
I don't care, I don't need to go to the doctor.

1164
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:20,460
As somebody who's like as much of a hypochondriac as I am, I'm glad I don't know a doctor right

1165
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,460
now.

1166
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,460
Exactly dude, that's the thing.

1167
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,700
I'd be blowing up their line all the time.

1168
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,180
I'd be like, "Yeah, hey I think my brain just exploded."

1169
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:39,020
I think I swallowed a balloon.

1170
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,180
I think I'm too high.

1171
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:44,140
I need to I don't know what I did, but I think I'm way too high.

1172
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,180
It's a mystery.

1173
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,780
Go in there like, yeah, do you smoke?

1174
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,300
Do you drink any helium usage?

1175
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:51,740
No.

1176
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:56,740
Yeah, that was always the worst is like until you turn 18,

1177
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,300
like your parent is in the room and they'll be like,

1178
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,880
so have you ever done anything naughty?

1179
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:05,140
Yeah. You're like, no, never.

1180
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:09,100
No. Good, good, because we actually have a naughty detector here.

1181
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,140
Yeah, yeah.

1182
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,820
If if it says you did something

1183
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:14,140
naughty, it will give you cancer.

1184
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:16,320
Yeah. And you just you walk through it

1185
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,380
like a metal detector and it lights up

1186
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:20,420
and it says like still pokeybomb cards

1187
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,420
at age 50.

1188
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,100
Yeah. Any any cigarettes, alcohol use

1189
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:25,460
you ever masturbate?

1190
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:28,700
Well, you're probably in the

1191
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,340
kitchen. Have you ever masturbated in

1192
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:31,340
their bedroom?

1193
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:32,620
You ever forget to clean it up?

1194
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,020
You ever watch Skinamax at night

1195
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,020
after your parents go to bed?

1196
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,740
On Mr. Skin dot com.

1197
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,580

00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,280

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,480
...give me a quick check mark next to them, if you've ever...

1203
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:49,380
Just let me know if you've seen them or not.

1204
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,180
...thought about looking at them, um...

1205
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:54,580
And I'll put a star if you use your parents' computer.

1206
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:57,880
You ever watch Family Guy porn on your parents' computer?

1207
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,080
We just need to know.

1208
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:01,680
Yeah. You watched South Park before you were 13?

1209
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,780
Yeah.

1210
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:06,380
Uh, have you ever seen an R-rated movie? Um...

1211
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:11,100
Have you ever put your mouth on the water bubbler?

1212
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,020
Don't call it a bubbler, dude.

1213
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:16,220
It's what it's called, not called a bubble.

1214
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,420
It's called the bubbler.

1215
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,940
You know, you can't call it the bubbler, dude.

1216
00:50:19,940 --> 00:50:21,780
You you didn't fucking grow up here.

1217
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:22,860
The rest of the world.

00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:25,180
Everyone in me, I grew up.

00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,820
No, you didn't want to New Hampshire.

1220
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:30,460
Yeah. Everyone called it the bubbler there.

1221
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,540
Yeah. Because there are a bunch of fakers, dude.

1222
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,180
Yeah, exactly.

1223
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:34,540
Oh, with the bubbler.

1224
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,660
Yeah, everyone did.

1225
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:39,180
They are you guys are all just fucking wish you were here dude so bad.

Top 10 silliest things I have a crush on.

1240
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,700
I mean, this is like the complete opposite.

00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,700

1245
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:22,700
Fuck them!

1246
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:24,700
That's true, you are, you're our pigs.

1247
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,700
Fuck you and shut up.

1248
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,700
Yeah, if you sent this, we're gonna ban you.

1249
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:30,700
If you sent this to us, I'm gonna kick you out of the Discord.

1250
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,700
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1251
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:47,700
a

1252
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:52,980
who says I don't care obviously you'd have a crush on a boy or a girl for

00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:07,620

00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:32,340
house in Ridgewood. That's me. Uh Positron Wild Hawk is on this

1260
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:34,740
list too. Oh there he is. While he's in the middle, while he's

1261
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:38,500
in his lab, he's on uh this computer. He says, I cherish my

1262
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,020
crush with all of my hearth. I promise to cushion her falls and

1263
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,620
wouldn't give her up for the world.

1264
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:45,300
It's a magical IKEA.

1265
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:48,820
What are you doing a bit of a

1266
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,220
come there positron you?

1267
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:52,660
You're not only a scientist with science,

1268
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,060
you're also a word scientist.

1269
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:56,340
It seems number two number

1270
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,620
two a glass of milk.

1271
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:58,820
When I was a toddler,

1272
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,420
I loved my bottles low key.

1273
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:03,180
When I was a toddler,

1274
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,060
I fucked with milk.

1275
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,740
Yo, yo, y'all remember?

1276
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,900
Y'all remember as a kid?

1277
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,140
Y'all remember playtime and mill?

1278
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,420
Real no no.

1279
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,460
I didn't have none of that shit, I just had milk.

1280
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:15,960
Uh, number three, a rock.

1281
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,260
Why would you do this?

1282
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:24,060
Misfire says, "I have a crush on my pet rock named We Will Rock You."

1283
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:26,960
Hmm, maybe I should name him Rocky Raccoon instead.

1284
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:27,960
What do you think?

1285
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,860
I think you should totally change that name.

1286
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,660
Yeah, I think you should stop having a crush on your pet.

1287
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:34,160
Just make it lose like a handsome anime guy.

1288
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,660
Just 'cause a pet is a rock doesn't mean you're allowed to have a crush on it.

1289
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,160
You can't have a crush on a pet.

1290
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,460
That's not, that's no bueno.

1291
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:54,340
is

1292
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,340
demologically.

1293
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:57,260
Maybe.

1294
00:53:57,260 --> 00:53:58,900
Number four, a book.

1295
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,660
Yeah, what if it's a pop

1296
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,660
up, though?

1297
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,700
Yeah, that doesn't count.

1298
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,060
Yeah, that's also like, I mean,

1299
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,820
there's like sports illustrated

1300
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:11,000
fucking swimsuit edition.

1301
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,220
That's a book. I have a crush on a

1302
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,220
book. It's a magazine.

1303
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,540
That's a book.

1304
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,740
It's a magazine.

1305
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:17,580
Some pages.

1306
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:18,740
No, there's no pages.

1307
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,260
There's pages on the book.

1308
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,260
There's no girls all.

1309
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,300
OK, but it has no you

1310
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,300
You can't keep it on the shelf though.

1311
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,300
So how about this Cameron?

1312
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,300
A dictionary of hot swimsuit girls.

1313
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,300
That might be a book.

1314
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:35,300
That might be more than a book to me.

1315
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,300
That might be a lifestyle.

1316
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,300
Let me tell you about the B section.

1317
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,300

1318
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,300

*laughs*

1320
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,300
It's not like names or anything?

1321
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,300
No, it's different parts of the girl.

1322
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,300
There's bras too.

1323
00:54:51,300 --> 00:55:09,260

creepy zone

1351
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,580
the D and the T section are very similar

1352
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:22,380
cause the D section

1353
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,580

Oh man, yeah, I mean that dictionary.

It's only 50 pages.

1364
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:51,860
Yeah, they sell it at the, I got it at this Scholastic book fair.

00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:54,900
It cost 500 tickets.

1367
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:07,820

1368
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,820

00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,820
*laughter*

1371
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:15,820
Very good point.

1372
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:17,820
Yeah, you like walk up to a glory hole and you put your dick in

1373
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,820
and you get a sug, and you're like, "This fucking wall

1374
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:21,820
is so amazing!"

1375
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,820
"I want to marry this wall!"

1376
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:25,820
"What kind of wall is this?"

1377
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,820
Also, putting a glory hole

1378
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,820
on a door and then somebody just opens it

1379
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,820
and just slams you into the wall.

1380
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,820
*laughter*

1381
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,820
Shouldn't be on a door.

1382
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:41,820
You're flattened on the wall adjacent to the door and your dick is hanging out of the door.

1383
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,820
They'll think your dick is the doorknob.

1384
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,820
Yeah, that's true.

1385
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,820
They'll yank it right off.

1386
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,820
Twist it around.

1387
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,820
They'll try to put a key in your thing hole.

1388
00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:53,820
Number six, a bar of soap.

1389
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,820
I've had a fair amount of soap on my penis.

1390
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:58,820
You put a hole in a bar of soap and put your thing through it, huh?

1391
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:03,820
I mean, I wouldn't be like opposed to that, I guess.

1392
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:10,980
I mean, yeah, I feel like that's like a probably feel pretty good, right?

1393
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:11,980
I don't know.

1394
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:13,860
Plus, you can clean your penis with it.

1395
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,860
That's true.

1396
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:15,860
They do.

1397
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:16,900
They do have at Spencer's gifts.

1398
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,300
They have the weenie cleaning, which is a ring of soap.

1399
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,300
Oh, yeah.

1400
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,300
Yeah.

1401
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,300
Yeah.

1402
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:24,300
Yeah.

1403
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:29,940
Do you guys what would you guys do if you if if you worked at like Dunkin Donuts or

1404
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:34,300
something a really creepy guy came in and said, "Can I get the warmest, slipperiest donut

1405
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,300
that you have?"

1406
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,300
And what's the bathroom code?

1407
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,300
Yeah.

1408
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:42,620
Can I get a Boston cream?

1409
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:44,940
Only put a little bit of cream.

1410
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:45,940
And microwave the cream.

1411
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,940
Yeah, and microwave the dough.

1412
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:51,820
Could you pour orange juice on a croissant and then heat it up for a little bit and then

1413
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:52,820
give it to me?

1414
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:53,980
No, I don't need a bag.

1415
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,300
I'll just put it in my hands.

1416
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,300
Thanks.

1417
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,300
Yeah.

1418
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:02,220
donut where there's a hole and there's a special part above the hole that's really extra special

1419
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:08,180
and like a big sprinkle on the top of the donut and but make it a little hard to find and I'm

1420

1422
00:59:24,980 --> 00:59:31,100
if they're not me anything box can actually mean quite a few things yeah

1423
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:46,660
the comment is the sexy box number eight a fictional character yeah so here's a

1424
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:49,940
comment from Patrick but I've pretty much only ever liked fictional

1425
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,020
characters since I was three years old right now I have a crush on Luke

1426
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:57,820
Skywalker if that's so silly I must be quirky. Wow, Patrick, that's a great comment.

1427
00:59:57,820 --> 01:00:01,260
You're really good at typing you're getting a lot better. Here's another comment.

1428
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:07,100
Here's another one for Patrick. That's both bestiality and pedophilia because Elmo is a

1429
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:15,500
three-year-old monster. Not replying to anything. No one said anything about Elmo. Here's a comment

1430
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:19,980
here from Caden Young that just says what? I had a thought about Elmo today. I was thinking about

1431
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:23,980
I was thinking about calling him because I'm like best friends with that guy.

1432
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:24,980
You're not best friends with Elmo.

1433
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,980
But if you are, can you ask him what he looks like if you shave all his hair off?

1434
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:28,980
Yeah, I want to know.

1435
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:29,980
I could ask him.

1436
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,980
What does he look like?

1437
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,980
Does he look like a dog?

1438
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:35,980
Probably like, probably red, but with no hair.

1439
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:36,980
He might look like a bird under there.

1440
01:00:36,980 --> 01:00:37,980
Yeah, that's true.

1441
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:38,980
I don't think so.

1442
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:40,980
I mean, if you shave off Elmo, you'll see his bones.

1443
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,980
True, yeah.

1444
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,980
He might just be bones underneath.

1445
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:45,980
He's got bones and fur, yeah.

1446
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,980
Skeleton, those guys.

1447
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,980
He's all bones under the fur.

1448
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,980
(laughter)

1449
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,980
Number 9 is DIRT

1450
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,980
DIRT?

1451
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:56,980
Minecrafter1212

1452
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:58,980
says "haha I don't know why this is

1453
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,980

1454
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:02,980

Picture of Justin Bieber

1459
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:12,980
Mud. Loaf of bread. Yourself.

1460
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:14,980
An ironing board. A celebrity's butt

1461
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:16,980
Here we go. Top comment

1462
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:19,980
Anaconda don't want none.

1463
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:23,920
Your reflection, a skeleton, a toy, broken condom.

1464
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,020
A parody music artist, a gorilla.

1465
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:30,560
Probably should have just done this list.

1466
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,520
Now, a broken condom.

1467
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,460
You already said that one.

1468
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,220
There's number 47 here.

1469
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,020
Number 47 is a baby.

1470
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:39,860
And the comment is only pedophiles would have a crush on a baby.

1471
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:43,480
Number 67 is a dictator.

1472
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,580
And it's a picture of Hitler.

1473
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,900
Oh my God, my friend literally has a crush on Joseph Stalin.

1474
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,660
Not kidding.

1475
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,660
A cat number 72 a video game.

1476
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:57,140
I have a crush on Mario Kart 8 because it's so amazing and I

1477
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:57,660
love it.

1478
01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:03,260
A smartphone one of your comments posted online is over

1479
01:02:03,260 --> 01:02:07,860
73 year but oh that's that's not right.

1480
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,100
Bye bye.
