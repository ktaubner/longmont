1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:15,000
guys, New York City is no longer safe. There was a complete like there was a

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,300
brawl in front of the studio crazy situation. There was a male brawl by the

4
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:26,100
way, well, male and the whole situation is genuinely completely very sad, seems

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,800
pretty evil. You don't know the details. Maybe there's a fight over candy. I

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,160
I could hear, no, because I was the only one that went.

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,560
It seemed like there was a candy dealer.

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,960
I could hear everything through the other door.

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,960
Okay.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,600
And yeah, it's really fucked up.

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,200
But somebody has been arrested.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,200
Big hugs to the NYPD.

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Thank you, NYPD.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,100
Our boys in blue, you did it again.

15
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,360
Another sicko off the street.

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,360
Are they still fighting?

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Yeah.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,360
Well, that's good news.

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,680
The guy looked exactly like Matthew Golden.

20
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,240
The guy looked like Matthew Golden.

21
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,480
It looked like Matthew Golden was getting arrested.

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,080
had a woman got her face completely busted and then they started attacking

23
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,160
a motorcycle for no reason. They were doing a street fighter bonus stage to a

24
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,920
motorcycle.

25
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,380
Four innocent motorcycle. Firstly, knocked it over and then the guy walked

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:11,340
over and he started stomping on it. Just stomped the fuck out of it. Yeah. So

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,860
somebody

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:15,660
had their motorcycle with no engine completely destroyed for the motor.

29
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,400
That's the weirdest part is the motorcycle has no engine. It doesn't have

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,380
an engine. Maybe somebody already stole the engine. I think we slipped into a

31
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:25,440
backwards world. I think we did. This is like, it feels like... Motorcycles have no

32
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,220
engines like it feels like Twin Peaks season three. Wow. It's

33
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,460
genuinely and it feels like we just saw. No, it's like that

34
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,100
fucking scene where the lady he walks up to the car and the

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,660
lady is just screaming. I've never been. That's how that

36
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:44,900
I've never seen that's how it felt. I haven't seen the fight.

37
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,060
I only watch. I watched the first episode probably five

38
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,740
times. The first episode is so good. It's so long good dude.

39
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,100
It's a movie basically. I know and I'm like I can't do this

40
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,200
four times. I watched Twin Peaks a while ago and me and me and the fiance just

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,480
start restarted it like the other day and the pilot blew my mind. I couldn't,

42
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,740
I thought I was, I was gonna be like, well, it'd be nice to go, it'll be

43
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,400
nostalgic to watch this again, but I couldn't believe how much I like the

44
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,220
pilot. It's still very good. It's crazy, man. But anyway, that felt to me like

45
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,120
Grand Theft Auto.

46
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,260
David Lynch, I don't know. It was much closer to Grand Theft Auto, the video

47
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,020
game. Am I the only leftist that loves Twin Peaks? You might be. I like the

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,280
restaurant to when they put the guy into the car, he started like smashing the

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,120
door from the inside. I thought we're going to see a full escape. He looked

50
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,920
like he was halfway through, like Zazz make up from like Batman Arkham Knight.

51
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,200
Yeah, yeah, he looked like he had like a bunch of markings all over the back of

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,760
his head and very sad scenario. I'm going to say yeah, well, the saddest part is

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,280
it scared. I think it was so sad. He's peering through the front door. I was

54
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,560
trying to make I was making. I thought that someone was going to die, but you

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,760
you're going to stop it. I thought somebody was a tragedy. Hey, Mr. Cop

56
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,000
leave the guy alone, Mr. leave that guy alone. Okay, he didn't do it. All he did

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,920
was break a woman's face in half. Oh yeah, and then stop a motorcycle. What

58
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,520
made me what that's illegal. I thought that this was like a you thought it was

59
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,720
a cat fight. You thought it was hot, but then I didn't think it was hot. I just

60
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,280
yeah. When a man punches a woman, it's immediately a dog, a cat thing, dog

61
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,380
fighting. That's not fun. No, that's scary. That's not fun. A dog chasing a

62
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,660
cat around there's no cartoons. We all we all became three became the three

63
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,220
little Karen's in here looking out the window like oh my God, it was

64
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:30,320
only of course happening. What are you?

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,300
My life is so boring. That's literally all I do twenty four seven is look at

66
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:38,860
my window. Yeah, oh my God, I hope so. This is to be an old. That's literally

67
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,540
I look out the wind. I do exactly what we just did, but for when someone is

68
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,800
talking on the phone, I go yeah. What are you talking about guy? What's

69
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,120
and on and the maybe the one or two times a year when someone gets into a

70
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,360
traffic fight. Oh, my God, this is what we live for. Come here look yeah, well,

71
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,100
that's what they're arguing. We we live like the our neighborhood is pretty

72
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,160
quiet, but when I was living at that that place in Bushwick, where like the

73
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:07,500
ceiling was constantly like falling apart and there's black mold, there was

74
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,800
on Thanksgiving night

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,640
or the night before Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving Eve, I saw this this whole

76
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,280
family brawl. They were only speaking Spanish, so I couldn't understand what was happening,

77
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,640
but I saw one dude coming down the street with a cinder block, and I was like, "Oh,

78
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:33,880
shit. Oh, no." But the worst part was the windows in my room. It was an illegal, like

79
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,680
Alex's room should not have been built. It was not built on top of the code. It was just

80
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,160
on top. So my window, I wasn't able to see everything, so I had to go up to Alex's room

81
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,660
room because he went home. Alex, I went in your room when you weren't home to

82
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:48,360
watch a fight.

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,260
But yeah, it was just this family just with cinder blocks and beer bottles

84
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,660
being tossed at each other, and that street was so fucking crazy. You gotta

85
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,460
see one thing like that a year. Yeah. It's always like around this time. Last

86
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,860
year we saw in Portland the guy telling us he was gonna kill the guy with a

87
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,060
machete. Did we talk about that on the show? I don't think so. Yeah, I saw a

88
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:13,960
guy dragging a chain. Yeah, the chain dragger, the scary Resident Evil zombie

89
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,260
a laser gun. I saw a laser gun guy who there was a homeless guy with a laser

90
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:21,720
gun. I don't remember that I remember it was it in the future or now it was

91
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,140
must have been it was in the past for us. You're kidding. It was when we were

92
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,180
there a laser gun in the past. Yeah, that's even scarier. Yeah, it was

93
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,920
important because he brought that technology from another time. Yeah,

94
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,540
dimension I do. I did realize the other day, like when I lived on that street

95
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:41,420
where there was like constantly like a fighter, like somebody like throwing

96
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,800
like glass around or like somebody a couple of guys, someone collecting cans.

97
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Someone's got no. There's a couple of guys who decided to have some fun one

98
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,960
night and slashed the bike tires on my folding bike. That's right. You remember

99
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,480
that the one that I ever tell you about that I won't. I gave you that one. Yeah,

100
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,920
I woke up at five in the morning. I heard a bunch of guys going. No, don't do

101
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,360
that. Oh, no. That could have been heard. Then the next day, both of my tires

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,100
slashed completely. It was a fun like that would say yes. Do that. I had a

103
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,880
group. There's a group of teenage just pieces of crap walking by me the other

104
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,840
day and I was walking Phil and they said, look at that dog stupid ass dog.

105
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,880
Fuck that dog and I was and I just literally I mean it was eight people. So

106
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,460
I just looked down and just ignored it. Yeah, the other day my neighbor rang the

107
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,120
doorbell. She's like I forgot my keys.

108
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,960
That's not crazy. Get out of my house. You crazy bitch. I like you crazy.

109
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,120
I was walking with my girlfriend somewhere and I cut through that big, that park where

110
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,520
we shot the Underworld's Biggest Mummy thing. We were taking a short cut through there and

111
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:55,960
this group of teenagers pointed at me and said, "Yo, don't he look like Mario?"

112
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,520
Way! You got cooked, man.

113
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,840
The worst part was I was wearing the poop hat.

114
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,320
You were wearing the pee hat.

115
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,240
there in the be and you guys,

116
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,200
if that happens to you, your girlfriend is not gonna look at you the same that

117
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,080
no, no, no, no, no, you have to you. I honestly I should have just broke off

118
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,960
and went into just like a bodega and just hid there and I don't I think a

119
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,440
lot of a lot of these teenagers are very well aware of the fact that they can

120
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,640
ruin any relationship. If there's three or more of them, they can ruin every

121
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,240
relationship. Yeah, it's like fucking

122
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,520
nocturnal animals that that movie with Jake Gyllenhaal.

123
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,920
It's like utopia, utopia. Are you talking about zootopia? No bit of a

124
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:48,000
documentary. It's a movie that I saw probably ten years ago. That is about

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,640
Jake Gyllenhaal being such a loser that his wife and daughter get murdered.

126
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:58,200
So, but it's the same kind of scenario. He's getting roasted yeah where he's

127
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,800
like just going along with stuff. The bartender roasted me last night. You're

128
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,560
kidding. What happened? You were there. He called me mustache. Oh, dude, this guy

129
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,800
was on one. He was on one. I tried to hand him a drink ticket and he was, I

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,840
was like, 'Hey, does this cover a June shine?' Okay, and before you say gay,

131
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,120
be honest, that's my stomach. Oh, the bartender, the bartender at the

132
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,600
bell house. Yeah. Oh, that guy likes me. He, I think he likes, he likes

133
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,880
everybody. He like, he must like like me and Cameron because he was bullying

134
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,800
us. Yeah. But I handed him a shot. Well, I said, 'Can I have a June

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,560
shot? Can, can this get a June shine?' And he said, 'I don't know. Can it?'

136
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,960
and I just said, Please tell me if I can buy

137
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:37,440
and he realized that he called me mustache. I said, What yeah, and they

138
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,000
started laughing and I said, Did you roast me man? Did you roast me? He said,

139
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No, I said, Did you really just roast me must? Well, the other thing, the thing

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,640
that we're leaving out is that all three of us were in elf costumes, which I

141
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,040
wasn't in an elf. Not at this point. At this point, okay, well, I was in my

142
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,520
elf costume. He was normal. He said that he gave me a shot and said, Bro,

143
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,600
you better than will ferrell. He said that ask your ask your wife. She can

144
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,280
confirm she defended will ferrell. He said you better than she defended will

145
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,720
ferrell. His wife defended will ferrell. Why did you let her do that? Because

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,400
he's not better than will ferrell.

147
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,040
You kidding me? You don't have to you don't have to get into a debate about

148
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,680
it in front of the bartender. The bartender said that's a crazy ass thing

149
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,120
to say. Yeah, you're better than will ferrell. The bartender said that and

150
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,560
that you're smarter than albert einstein. She said, I don't think that's

151
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:30,200
She's right. You're not better than Will Ferrell. I don't know. You're good. You're a nice guy.

152
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,040
You're my friend. According to the bartender. You're better than Will Ferrell. You think

153
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,560
he's better than Will Ferrell? Maybe as an elf. Talladega nights. As an elf, maybe. I

154
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,720
don't like Talladega nights. Oh, that's what he was referring. Oh, I thought he was saying

155
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,440
your whole body of work was better than... I forgot you were dressed like an elf. No,

156
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:48,040
no, I'm dressed like an elf. He's not saying I'm better than Will Ferrell in all walks

157
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,320
of life. He's saying I'm probably a better elf. Okay, well, you're definitely not better

158
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,200
than Will Ferrell as an elf. I don't know. We can't talk too much about Will Ferrell as

159
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,720
an elf because that's part of my presentation. Okay. So we have to move on from this topic.

160
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:07,920
We'll move on. Well, I did. You know what? I would like to come clean and admit to a,

161
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:17,340
I guess a party foul. One that was an honest mistake. No. You guys, I accidentally stole

162
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,640
the spotlight of a karaoke song.

163
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:24,740
It was the one. You didn't steal spotlight. You accidentally stole somebody's spot

164
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,440
in line. You cut in line. Well, it's disputed because we both picked the same

165
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,340
song. But they clearly picked it before you. We don't know. The jury's still

166
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,140
out. Well, then you didn't do anything. But they looked upset and I want to

167
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:41,340
apologize formally. I didn't realize until after. Even if you did, you sniped

168
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,140
their song. I didn't realize until after when the song came up later in the

169
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,940
you you have to assume anybody at karaoke. If they pick one song, you have to assume

170
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,940
that's the only song they know how to sing. Yeah, so wouldn't the priority

171
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:54,540
saying, do they have a person you're handing the request to? Yeah, you tell it

172
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,540
to them or is it like you have a right to sound you're writing down the

173
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,340
question. Okay, and those are you writing down and then you go to the cop

174
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,940
car. That's over girl. That's sad. That's the saddest part. It's over. I

175
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,040
hope they're doing a raid right now in that building. Me too. So far, they're

176
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,440
doing the movie. The rate building right now, rappelling down the sides of

177
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,940
to the building, but I would like clearing out every floor hitting every

178
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:19,620
corner like this. I've never seen the raid. That movie is sick, bro. I

179
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,100
think we have you seen the raid? No, but I can imagine what you guys gotta

180
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,560
watch. I think every single time we would go to

181
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,080
not Gus's apartment, but anywhere with Gus in college, he would try to get us

182
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,640
to watch the raid. It's a good movie. Is it beast? It's beast. Is it a

183
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,240
Boston movie? No, it's like a

184
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,040
or something like that. That's only like Boston movies. It's

185
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,580
some time really just watches like the town black mass and the departed.

186
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,620
That's all he watches and movies that are like that. He

187
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,060
I hate hanging out with Gus. He always puts on fucking mystic river. I need to

188
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,700
get the I need to bring this book, but he gave me a book when I was in

189
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,100
L.A. that he has this detective series that he's been reading since he was

190
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,140
like ten years old that he still reads and there's like two hundred of these

191
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,180
books and it's about like a fat old detective and it's the picture of the

192
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,160
tech of the detective is a picture of the author and it's called like

193
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:22,720
mcbarney or some shit and he just solves mysteries every single time. It's the

194
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,200
only book he reads yeah and he gave me one and he was like yeah. You should

195
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,100
read this book. It'll like change your life. It's like a worse version of the

196
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,980
john grisham novel and it takes place in boss and that's why you like oh yeah

197
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,660
that makes sense. This one's completely in asia

198
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:42,380
The Raid, yeah. It's not an American movie. I don't remember what country it is. I said

199
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,540
Thai, could be Thai, Thai, could be Thailand. Don't know, so I'm not going to make a strong...

200
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,740
Is there an outland? Might be Indonesian, actually, now that I think about it. Oh, they

201
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,900
have the curvy letters. Thai has curvy letters. You know, I learned why they have the curvy

202
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,500
letters. The guys from The Raid, they put them in every action movie now. Okay. So if

203
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,200
if you ever see a guy or the guys don't need them, they usually are bad guys.

204
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,060
They were in some of the Star Wars movies. I think they were good guys

205
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,300
first. Well, they're in real life. They're actors, okay, and

206
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,940
athletes, yeah, martial artists. I wouldn't say athlete. I would say artist.

207
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,940
I think I would say, you know what that is? Artists is in the name of the

208
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,000
thing I was going to say. I would say that they are athletes, but then you

209
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,660
bring up the point that they are called art to add the acting is the art

210
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:37,640
art, but the the the Marshall, I would say the Marshall is the art part. No,

211
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,440
this is a beautiful dance between the wind and the man. Yeah, I will say an

212
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,440
escape artist is not an artist. You don't think so? No. Houdini, that is a

213
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,240
stunt. That is a stunt man or what's a stunt artist stunt. Yeah, I think it's a

214
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,000
martial artist is an athlete. One hundred percent. I guess they have

215
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,540
tournaments bro. There's no art your turn. There are

216
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,520
that's what are you talking about? That's

217
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:07,800
that's not a beautiful art. They play using art after they're done. There's

218
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,560
an art like a back to Paul and it's the game and former

219
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,320
art of the month. There's that that's an art tournament. What are you saying

220
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,320
the game and former art of the month? I don't know where they have the things

221
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,320
in the game and former. I have to do that's an art contest. There's that's

222
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,900
there's one example. I didn't say contest as a tournament, but that has nothing.

223
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,180
Of course, those people are artists yeah, but it's a that's they're not

224
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:36,160
martial. I think I'm I think I think I've lost the plot mate. I think you

225
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,580
honestly you bloody have I you feel completely you feel death for what you've

226
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,380
done bollocks. I've got gone bloody. I've been driven mad by this horrible

227
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,420
world that you saw just a sliver of I know recently

228
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:51,420
this violence is driving you out of your mind. You would not let one second.

229
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,540
I love the junction. I've I've completely gone around the band. You're around the

230
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:58,060
bend. You're over the hill mate.

231
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,060
You hit the wall. You hit the wall. I've hit a wall.

232
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,460
I've hit the wall. You've hit the wall. I've hit the wall. Yeah, I'm completely

233
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,800
washed. I'm mid now. You're not mad. Which Liberty women you should be a

234
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,460
baddie, but now I'm mid Susan Sarandon. Susan Sarandon hit the wall.

235
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,860
Helen Mirren Helen Mirren hit the wall

236
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,960
be Arthur.

237
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:22,620
Uma B. Thurman,

238
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,880
P. Arthur hit the wall,

239
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,600
Betty White, your way, Betty White, a long and passed away because you hit it

240
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,240
so hard yeah. Oh, the cops are still here. What the hell now they're going to

241
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,440
come get it. We're going to have to give a fucking statement. I'm going to go

242
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,040
statement on

243
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,680
dude. We'll just we'll just hand them the first thirty minutes of that. I will

244
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,040
give a statement. I'm willing to give a statement if it is on recorded yeah

245
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,000
yeah, because for my own protection, we have that's what we say to

246
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I think that's a good idea. I will not talk to them. Pound that out. Yeah, that's a good

247
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,180
ass. I'm leftist as hell today. I'm talking about twin peaks, not talking to cops. What's

248
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:07,240
next for you, man? What's next for me? Right wing. I'm going to completely turn. I'm going

249
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,680
to become post left. I'm going to go talk to those cops. Go talk to him, man. I'm going

250
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,080
to go out there. I'm going to ask for an application. The thing is, cops are so different in New

251
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,820
New York versus North Carolina. Yeah in North Carolina, every cop is a super

252
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:24,020
soldier. There's bread from birth to be a police. Same with my home. Well, my

253
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:27,580
hometown, we have the SWAT team in New York. They're just like normal, like

254
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:32,120
five, four, they go to the store here. Yeah, they go to the store. They walk

255
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,660
around down in North Carolina. They go, they have, they do, they walk as an army.

256
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:42,320
It is a literal army. People always say the NYPD is militarized. This is not

257
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,140
none of these people could be in the military. No, no, they could be they

258
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:49,380
could. I mean they could be drone operators for sure. They could be drones

259
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:52,420
like yeah, like it could maybe be part of the BTS army,

260
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:59,060
perhaps a BTS army, maybe the BTS army, the only cops that the US army, the

261
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,460
only no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

262
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:00,980
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

263
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,520
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

264
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:01,840
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

265
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,140
no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

266
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,020
white people of the white people are in the I thought that they were called the

267
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,340
BTS Army, because I thought that you thought they were called Army, because

268
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:14,020
they were a group. No, I thought the group was called BTS Army called BTS.

269
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,300
What I thought BTS was short for BTS Army and then BTS was short for

270
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,260
something else. BTS is short for something, but I don't remember behind

271
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,380
behind the scenes. Oh yeah, boys, the singers, boys, the singers, boys, the

272
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,660
singer, but BTS has to go into the Army. They broke up because they got pressed

273
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:37,940
the military service. This keeps happening to guys. Korean pop stars, they have to go

274
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,620
fight in the army. That's insane. You have to do one year of mandatory service. Whenever

275
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:49,560
a country has a mandatory army, that's fucked up. They have to do it. This has been taking

276
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,440
down a lot of eSports athletes. Speaking of athletes. Yeah. Which those are the only real

277
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,100
athletes nowadays. PRX Jing just had to take a year off because he got put into the army.

278
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,000
me. Oh my God. Yeah, and then he came back and he was even better at using his gun

279
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,200
in the games. Yeah, because now he knows how to reload it and now he has the

280
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,700
the thrill of the kill means nothing to him anymore. He's doing this is my

281
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,200
rifle. This is my gun exactly. It's completely been brainwashed and so this

282
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,700
makes you better. I don't know how it would make you better at music and

283
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:22,000
dancing and rap which BTS involves himself in rap, but I couldn't believe

284
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,300
when they wrapped. They also involve themselves in McDonald's. They involve

285
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,600
themselves in a new meal.

286
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,000
We're being distracted by the car is beeping at the cops. Yeah, yeah. So this

287
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,320
is another that's a classic of the work moment. Yeah, helping conflict. Yeah,

288
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,440
that you I feel like you'd only get that in New York where like they like if you

289
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:46,600
honked at a cop that for blocking the road at all, they would draw their

290
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:50,080
weapons immediately and switch. She's your car in North Carolina. Yeah, yeah,

291
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,240
yeah. You'd be you can't do that kind of thing. No, here to be respectful and

292
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:58,280
you have to cry or else you dead. Yeah, here you pc. I mean, there's so many

293
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,980
videos of people fist fighting police in New York City.

294
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Oh yeah.

295
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
And the cops are just doing it.

296
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
Yeah, they go for it.

297
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,120
Yeah, the cops are handsome but literally like that video where the guy is fighting the dude

298
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,400
in the park and he like slips out the gun and hands it to his friend.

299
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,080
It's exactly like that with all the cops.

300
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,400
They take off all their shit and they're like, "Let's box.

301
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Let's do this shit."

302
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,400
Yeah.

303
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,400
I like that.

304
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
That's a thing.

305
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,400
That's a respect thing.

306
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,400
Yeah, that's fucking honor.

307
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,480
Could you imagine somebody coming, like moving to New York to become a New York police officer?

308
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,560
it's got to be the most psychotic person in the world. Can they do that? Can you

309
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,600
do that? Do you have to be a resident of the place that you lived? No, because

310
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,760
all the all the traffic cops in my neighbourhood are all from India, like

311
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
every single one of them. Do they ever do the thing that they do in movies

312
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,680
where they're like, "Listen, buddy, you're too crazy. We're forcing you to

313
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,720
move to a village. You can't be-" Like Hot Fuzz? Like Hot Fuzz, exactly. Yeah,

314
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,760
they do that. Is that real? Do they do that? If somebody gets in a police

315
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:58,840
involved shooting and gets whatever you have to the sticks yeah, but you have

316
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,540
to that's funny yeah, yeah, is that it's it's your cops and the sticks are

317
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,920
evil or I know well, that's because they're all from yeah, they're all

318
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,320
because they all shot somebody yeah, they all got sent away yeah, I got sent

319
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,200
to boarding school by their bosses. Imagine the reverse, though, like a cop

320
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,240
that's like too shitty. So they send them to New York yeah, they should do

321
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,360
that. We need to toughen you up well, it's cop here. I heard there's a cop

322
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,640
here who shot a couple people. They sent him to Christmas City in the North

323
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,720
hole. Really? Yeah. Doing what? Cop? Being a police officer. Being a police officer? Yeah.

324
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:34,020
Imagine the police there. In PPD? Yeah. Wow. They don't have guns. They have a candy cane

325
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,360
in their holster. They have slingshots. They have slingshots that shoot bullets. Yeah. That

326
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:43,560
shoots bubbles. A slingshot that shoots bubbles. That's a good invention. That's actually an

327
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:46,280
amazing invention, man. Yeah. I like that. You might be back. You might have gained the

328
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,180
plot back. They might have jelly marbles kind of bubbles. Kind of bubble like that. Jelly

329
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,480
Marbles kind of marbles. Look at this or be yeah, you lost it again or be you're

330
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:01,400
back to being completely when I was just a bubble. Yep, a slay that with an alarm

331
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,440
system or a siren. That's pretty good. Yeah, I don't mind that at all. I mean

332
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:13,320
wait, what other vehicles are there in the North Pole is the only one with a

333
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,440
country car cross country skis. No, you have to like walk everywhere or ski

334
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,900
everywhere. They definitely got snowmobiles, man. Snow shoes, snowmobiles. I mean, that's

335
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:29,860
walking. Remember snow shoes? S-N-E-A-U-X? No. Oh, that was like Steve-O's shoe company.

336
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:33,260
You ever see snow shoes when you were a kid on movies and TV and say, "I want to walk

337
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:37,980
on those, man." Have you ever been snowshoeing? So it spreads out your weight so you don't

338
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,060
sink into the snow as much. Oh, that makes sense. But they're just tennis rackets, right?

339
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,540
Yeah. Well, I mean, a cartoon one is. I've jumped tennis rackets to my feet when I was

340
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,980
like it probably does about the same thing. My mom, I used to go snowshoeing

341
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,640
with my mom. They're like metal and like I mean they're kind of like, like yeah,

342
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,620
they're like metal and they're your feet lock in like skis. Have there been

343
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,720
advance? Yeah, I was gonna ask, has there been advancements in snowshoe

344
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,380
technology? Yeah, probably. Do you think they have a snowshoe that looks like a

345
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:09,780
Jordan four? No, well, so you could, you wear your shoes. Oh, okay. Still, so you

346
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,260
could wear, you could just wear your, but that would be fire, dude. Yeah, you

347
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,520
just wear your shoes and you strap into the snowshoes, but it's fun. It's a, it's

348
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,920
the fun thing. Imagine the Balenciaga snowshoe.

349
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Pulling up at your Inuit village with the Balenciaga snowshoe. Free idea,

350
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,380
Valenciaga, if you're listening. People losing their fucking mind. The fun part

351
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:30,580
is when you get the poles, like the cross country ski type poles. You don't

352
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:35,180
really need them at all. I've been watching this woman on the phone who

353
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:39,660
is from... Oh, ambulance. Ambulance. Oh my God. Oh, dude, it just keeps...

354
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,380
What, what, what, the fucking mailman's gonna show up next? What the hell?

355
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,980
come on. The mailman did show up in the middle of it. The mailman, the pizza

356
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,320
guy, everybody just

357
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,860
when I was

358
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,860
the other door. When I was in the other doorway, the mailman poked his head

359
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:59,280
over and then threw a package in and then started walking. That sucks if

360
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,920
you're a mailman and something happens like that and it happens like at the

361
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,820
place you have to deliver. It's illegal for you to not deliver that mail. You

362
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,600
have to deliver it. You have a literal honors bound system. Yeah, you have a

363
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,640
code that you must have mailman's code is one that is punishable by death. I've

364
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,020
trying to get a break it I'm trying to get car insurance and every single time

365
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,620
I go for a quote it always asks is anybody in your family in the military

366
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:28,100
the police officer or a postal officer so apparently you get all the same

367
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,980
benefits yeah you get crazy crazy but from just being a fucking man yeah my

368
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,040
uncle's a man or was a mailman this is an amazing surgery anybody should do

369
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,180
this job so it takes a long time to get to where it's really good like that's

370
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:44,980
very heavy seniority based. Yeah, that's what my uncle said. You have to like work for a

371
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:48,900
long time before you get all the... He's like the samurai. I think it's one of those things

372
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,660
where they kind of initiate you. They kind of fuck with you a little bit. You get hazed.

373
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:57,220
Well, you get hazed in getting the worst hours. Well, you definitely get... The new kid, the

374
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,820
new guy definitely gets the Santa letters. And they're like, "Go ahead, bring him to

375
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:06,620
the North Pole, you dickhead." I used to give my uncle my letters to Santa. They have a

376
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:13,260
training academy. My buddy's a mailman. Shout out to Emmett. He's telling me that he has

377
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,140
to go to like a full academy. You go to like for like two weeks or whatever and you go

378
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,220
take different classes about different types of mailman things. Isn't that awesome? Do

379
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,180
you spin the bag like the gun? You have to learn how to spin the bag. There's reading

380
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:34,460
bad handwriting on letters, on the addresses. Oh my God. Oh, I thought that was true. There

381
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,460
There is a whole section of there's like a I thought you actually think you're

382
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,500
telling the truth. Well, the academy is real, but that's not a real class.

383
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,000
There's a big

384
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:49,300
like center where all the mail where they can't read the hand writing goes and

385
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,420
they all they use some computer to try to put it and then some of those letters

386
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,000
have just been there and they can't throw them away. So some of those

387
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,500
letters have just been sitting there for like forty years. It's crazy. I just

388
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,640
have no idea where it's supposed to go. Have you ever thrown mail away that

389
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:07,660
wasn't yours. My wife threw away a giant box of mail that was sitting in our

390
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,600
apartment for a while this week and I said that's illegal you're gonna go to

391
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,960
jail. You just admitted to your wife's crimes. Yeah well like double jeopardy

392
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,900
can't be held responsible. Okay. I always I always throw it cry I always return

393
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:24,740
them. Yeah. You return every last piece? So if it's a former tenant and it

394
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,320
doesn't say or current resident, I cross out the barcode and say not at this

395
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,100
address I sent to put it back. Is that what you're supposed to do? Yeah but it

396
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,260
it doesn't work. I just put you're supposed you're supposed to do that and

397
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,280
then supposedly the mail carrying service is supposed to take like the

398
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,140
post office to take it and like well, they take it, but they're supposed to

399
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,100
take it and be like oh, we won't deliver this to me to this person anymore here

400
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,180
because they're really not some, but they still send them, but I take it away.

401
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,120
I get like every single apartment that I've lived in

402
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,420
now my first apartment, every apartment, but after my first apartment, I've

403
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,440
in three places, they have never ever once given me a mail key.

404
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
Really? So you have no access?

405
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,760
My last apartment, before I moved out, I talked to my mail lady and I said, "Is there any

406
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:18,960
way that you can open this up for me? I have not been given a mail key. Do I go to your

407
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,520
office to get a mail key or what? That looks awesome. Wait, talk into it?"

408
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,020
Cam put a Santa hat on his microphone.

409
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,280
I think it's dampening it too much.

410
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,680
I don't think it's dampening it at all.

411
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
You do sound cool though.

412
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,680
I don't think it's dampening it enough.

413
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,680
You sound like Santa.

414
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

415
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,680
Whoa.

416
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Wait, you really do.

417
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

418
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,400
I was a little Dracula now.

419
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
Yeah.

420
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,080
But yeah, she said, "Oh shit, that makes so much sense," and then opened it up and there

421
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,360
was just crammed mail, like the slot, like just had so much shit in there.

422
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,880
It looked like a real thinly cut turkey sandwich.

423
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
Yeah.

424
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,880
And they folded it over a million times.

425
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,880
That's what it looked like.

426
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,880
And she was like, "Yeah, I just thought nobody lived here."

427
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
Wow.

428
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
I thought you were nobody, man.

429
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,380
Yeah. I thought you were a complete ghost.

430
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,880
I thought you just didn't matter at all.

431
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
Yeah.

432
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,880
Well, Cameron...

433
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,880
We're not a stack of mail that tall.

434
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,880
You putting that hat on your microphone...

435
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
Reminded me of Christmas.

436
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,880
...got me well into the Christmas spirit.

437
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,880
Yeah.

438
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,880
Guys, it's week two of the... or is it?

439
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,880
Four weeks of Christmas.

440
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,880
I guess. I think so.

441
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,880
It's week two of the four weeks of Christmas.

442
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,880
On the second week of Christmas...

443
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,880
I wish we had a sleigh bells on there.

444
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,880
Watch this. I think you're going to be surprised in one second.

445
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,880
That's the bell shaking.

446
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
It's if you hit them really hard.

447
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
That's a different, they changed the bell.

448
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
That's a Jaws harp.

449
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,880
It's not a Jaws harp.

450
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
It's a Jews harp.

451
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
Why do you say Jaws harp?

452
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Because it goes in your jaws.

453
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
Are you afraid to say Jews harp?

454
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
It goes in between the jaws.

455
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
That's closer to a jingle bell.

456
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,880
That's Christmassy.

457
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,600
Chimes. Chimes. Hmm. No, it's chimes. It's fully chimes. It has been declared chimes

458
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:05,120
by the sound association. Open up the power points and go. And we're off on

459
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:10,840
another amazing journey to guys. Mystic investigation. We're back on mystic

460
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,240
investigations y'all. I think untitled presentation is mine. Yeah. And mine is

461
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,840
Kaki webby Baba Kaki.

462
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,720
All right, who's going who wants to go first? I can go first. Let Mr. Patrick

463
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,840
go first. All right. So we are back talking about mystic investigations.

464
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,920
You guys, you're back talking me, but no, I'm talking about you're doing it

465
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,640
right now. You bitch. I'm not back talking. You're not a bitch. You're

466
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:42,320
not. I'm not sassy. You start. Can you give it like an applause? Because it's

467
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
Mystic Investigations. This is one that the fans love.

468
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,760
Why doesn't it get an applause?

469
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,120
I love Mystic Investigations. I got lost looking through all this stuff today.

470
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,440
We were investigating a mystical event over there, of a fight, that I feel like we did

471
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,000
not give Mystic Investigations a big enough applause when we mentioned it.

472
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,400
All right, well, if you're going to be such a... Again, back-talking me, but...

473
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,200
Mystic Investigations, yo!

474
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,160
All right, you get a couple of claps from me.

475
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,660
I was concerned that we weren't going to talk about what Christmas is really

476
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,740
about, which obviously, as you know...

477
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Presents.

478
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,740
No, that's exactly what I was going to talk against.

479
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
No, that's exactly what I was going to talk against.

480
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
I thought it was commercialism.

481
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,740
Yeah.

482
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,740
I think that maybe you're forgetting the true meaning of Christmas.

483
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,740
No, it's about...

484
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
What's the true meaning, Pat?

485
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Well, the true meaning...

486
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,740
It's about corporations having...

487
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
No, it is about...

488
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,740
Green and red.

489
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
It is about...

490
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
And their logos.

491
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,480
respecting the birthday of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.

492
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,900
Now, Julio, click next on the slide.

493
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:48,540
Did Santa Claus ever meet Jesus? Oh my, okay, here's my theory. Posted December

494
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:52,420
7th, 2023. My theory based on this picture is yes. By the Christmas spirit.

495
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:56,900
Wait, the Christmas spirit wrote this? My theory is no, because Santa came,

496
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,860
Santa had no reason to be Santa until Jesus had passed away. Well, let's

497
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:05,340
You're going to love this, what you're about to hear.

498
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,340
You're sure?

499
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,740
From the Christmas spirit.

500
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,740
More back talk.

501

And as an Amazon associate, we earn from qualifying purchases.

502
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:20,940
Yes, Santa Claus has indeed met Jesus Christ, the first son of the Omniverse God, on several

503
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,940
occasions.

504
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:26,740
This includes the one time Santa was in heaven upon his death at the hands of the anti-claws

505
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,780
on December 6, 343 A.D.

506
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:33,780
While in heaven, he was able to witness Christ in his complete, magnificent, metaphysical

507
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:40,980
form, although that wasn't the first time he met the most famous demigod and vice lord

508
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,380
of the omniverse.

509
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:48,940
Despite being born almost 235 years after the death of Christ, Santa was able to meet Jesus

510
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,540
via time travel.

511
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:56,420
As a demi-angel, Santa, or Nicholas at the time, accidentally stumbled upon his developing

512
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:03,420
Chrono kinetic powers at age 16. Wow. He spontaneously traveled 15 minutes back in time to meet himself.

513
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,660
Naturally 15 minutes before that happened. He was shocked to meet his future self. After

514
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:13,140
that Santa began practicing time travel, but he found the further back he traveled, the

515
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,840
more energy was drained from him. He also found himself greatly weakened and need and

516
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,460
in need of ever longer, ever longer recovery times at age 19. He finally traveled back

517
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,600
to the year one AD to meet baby Jesus Santa at age. Nineteen, I bet you I

518
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,780
wish they had a photo rippling muscle bulging through a red pinstripe suit

519
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,980
because he had the suit because he had this, you know, he has a suit, no

520
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,780
beard. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Of young Santa Claus. That is an amazing

521
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,500
make the movie. Got to make that movie adventures of young Santa like young

522
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,940
Indiana Jones. Yeah, he could fight a piece of young Sheldon, young,

523
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,340
whatever young, any young. Yeah, people love when old stuff is young.

524
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,540
and adventures of young little Wayne. We can make that to young Scooby Doo.

525
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,540
They made that at age nineteen. He finally traveled back to the year one

526
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:06,620
eighty to meet baby Jesus and officially became part of the first Christmas. The

527
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:10,780
three wise men magi sensed his holy nature and he was allowed to approach the

528
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,500
Christ child. He technically gave Jesus the first Christmas gift when he

529
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,500
presented a rattle that he made, although it was actually the fourth gift after

530
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:25,700
the three wise men's presence. When Santa was twenty four, he visited Jesus in his

531
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,340
thirtieth year of life. Jesus had complete knowledge of Saint Nicholas's

532
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:33,600
importance in the future. They discussed the state of reality and the destiny of

533
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,300
humankind. I do feel like that's a little bit of a flop gift for the son of God.

534
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:43,940
Yeah, that's a rattle. A rattle. After gold, gold, frankincense, myrrh, myrrh. I

535
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:49,100
love myrrh. Frankincense, I do. While we're speaking about movie ideas,

536
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,440
is a kind of a my dinner with Andre, Santa and Jesus sitting down to chop it up

537
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,460
about the state of reality and the destiny of humankind. Isn't that an

538
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,880
incredible idea? My dinner with Santa and Jesus.

539
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,900
Santa's dinner with Jesus. Santa's dinner with Jesus,

540
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,440
coming 2025. 'Cause the thing is, Jesus has... He's not ascended yet,

541
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,520
but he has some knowledge that Santa will be

542
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,100
an important figure. Of course. Santa will be one of the most important figures

543
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,740
of Christmas. Yeah, which I think it's hard to argue that Santa's not maybe

544
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,100
the most important. Imagine, imagine meeting somebody like somebody who is

545
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,080
like I have time traveled to meet you.

546
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,980
Please, please

547
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,340
let me be the God of your birthday. Let me be the God. I want to be in control

548
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,300
of your birthday after your death. Once you die, once you die, I want to keep

549
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,700
it going. I'm from the future and I am in charge of your birthday. I'm from

550
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,740
your future, you're gonna die in three years. Here's a rattle. Do you remember

551
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,740
What is a rattle I gave you? I think that I just would be I'd be a little skeptical

552
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,240
of him being the son of God. If as a baby, he was playing with a rattle. Yeah,

553
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,380
it's a bad gift. It's a bad, bad, the frankincense. He's going to smell that

554
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,720
the murder and that stuff is going to use that that stuff has spiritual

555
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,060
significance. It's in the Bible. Yeah. Well, I guess rattles kind of

556
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:08,140
have a spiritual significance. How so it maybe the sound of maybe it's a sound

557
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:13,220
you could if you're dead, if you're dead, you could get your death. Oh my God,

558
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,660
Santa delivered his death rattle back with the sarcasm. Holy crap, the sarcasm.

559
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,760
He's being sarcastic. No, I'm not being sarcastic. Tell based on the way you're

560
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,560
talking. No, no, no. Okay. Well, speaking of death rattles, Santa Claus witnesses

561
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:29,260
the death of Jesus Christ and I need you to see this photo of Santa kneeling at

562
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,360
Christ's cross. Holy shit. The unmistakable silhouettes of Santa. One of

563
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,960
the most artistic photos I've ever seen in my life. It is so beautiful. This

564
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,560
photo of Santa and Christ. Well, it's Christ isn't there. It's just the cross.

565
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Well, it's the cross of Christ.

566
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,560
This is the cross.

567
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,560
Is it your cross to wear or cross to bear?

568
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Cross to bear. But he wears it.

569
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
He bears it. It's on his body, he wears it.

570
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
He bears it, man.

571
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Finally, at age 32, Santa went back to witness

572
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
the crucifixion of the Lord's Son.

573
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,560
When speaking of this, he begins to weep

574
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,560
and says it's the most horrific thing he ever saw.

575
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
Santa openly admits he went back a bit earlier

576
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
in an effort to save Jesus from the Romans.

577
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:16,060
However, Jesus himself implored Santa to let history take its place at its predestined course.

578
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:22,060
In reality, Christ knew the Romans weren't the real threat, but a mysterious force from beyond the omniverse

579
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:24,060
who had a vendetta with his father.

580
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,060
They are the ones who weakened Jesus so that the Romans could murder him.

581
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:34,060
Had Santa tried to intervene, he might have been wiped from the very face of the earth before Christmas ever truly got started.

582
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,060
This can't be the worst thing Santa's ever seen.

583
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,560
No.

584
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,560
How many times has Santa gone down a chimney and it's that one episode from

585
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,560
Breaking Bad with the ATM? Yeah. You know, it's like a little dirty kid who's

586
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,200
like in shackles, but he's been really good. He's got a

587
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,320
how many child slaves has Santa not saved? Probably a million. I think like

588
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,200
60% of the children on earth are slaves. Yeah, and he's and they're what,

589
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,960
so they're naughty because they're slaves? Yeah, no, they're nice. Yeah,

590
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,600
they're nice. Go give them a present and while you're there, slip them a

591
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:04,880
key. Yeah. Give them a birthday. All they want for Christmas is a skeleton

592
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,920
Yeah, just get out of that.

593
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:12,280
Alright, this next one is just a photo, but it was, I picked it because I liked that it

594
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
was a paid ad.

595
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
Wow.

596
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,400
And it's a photo of Santa feeding baby Jesus.

597
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
Breastfeeding.

598
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Breastfeeding him.

599
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Yeah.

600
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
And it says, "Paid Ad" at the bottom.

601
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,400
I wonder who paid for this figurine.

602
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,560
Well, I think it's some kind of auto.

603
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,560
It must be.

604
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:34,640
way, the coolest thing about Santa and Jesus's relationship is that Santa's

605
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,800
prayers are directly answered by Jesus.

606
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,360
Wow.

607
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,360
Santa Claus is one of the few people on earth who can pray to Jesus Christ and

608
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,720
actually get a spoken reply. That's unbelievable. Although he keeps the

609
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,960
direct prayers to Jesus minimal so as not to annoy him. Plausibly, the vice lord

610
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,120
Christ gets trillions of prayers from parallel universes and multiverses within

611
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,920
the greater omniverse. Most of Saint Nicholas's prayers are the equivalent

612
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,160
of a rhetorical question, so no direct reply is required. Santa also gets the

613
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,600
treat of Jesus being his Santa on Christmas.

614
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,240
Whoa!

615
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,360
The Holy Christ leaves a gift for Santa underneath his Christmas tree in Claus

616
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,080
Manor. Santa's perpetually young kids, Nicholas and Mary, always try to wait up

617
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,040
to see Jesus coming down the tree. Unfortunately, they always mysteriously

618
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,840
fall asleep.

619
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,560
I bet he gives him a rattle.

620
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:32,740
I have got to be some so I had a mention of his perpetually young kids and mine

621
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,040
to and I was like what who are they? What's their story? I googled them. I

622
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,680
googled like site, mystic investigations, Nicholas, Jr, which is the kid's name,

623
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,980
and I never explained they just always there's a bunch of different things

624
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:46,080
where he is and Santa and his perpetually young

625
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,080
Mary

626
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:53,760
Santa eagerly awaits the return of Jesus Christ at the conclusion of Armageddon,

627
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:58,040
Although he makes a point of inviting him to Christmas and Easter dinners every so

628
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,000
often in the hopes of him taking biological form, in his eyes it would be

629
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,080
the highest honor and most beloved guest to have, second only to God himself. It

630
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:11,800
is rumored Jesus Christ will appear at Santa's Christmas dinner in a spiritual

631
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,680
forum not long before the final battle of Armageddon.

632
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,200
OMG, that's unbelievable.

633
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,520
Before all shit turns south, Santa's gonna, Jesus will be like, "All right,

634
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,060
why you know you've been inviting me for a while. I can now finally show in

635
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,760
spiritual form, though I'm busy, so I'll show up and show up. I'll have a

636
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,920
we'll see me at the end of the table in a force ghost and I'll just wave,

637
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,560
but that's all I have to say about Santa and Jesus, but I did find one

638
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,860
more interesting thing that I think we need to we need to learn. Okay, we need

639
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,480
to discuss what is it

640
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,520
even Santa poops not

641
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,500
Unlike the imposter in the video, the real Santa Claus does not poop, nor does he produce

642
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,200
noxious gases.

643
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,180
As a demi-angel/angel-human hybrid, Saint Nicholas does not require food to survive,

644
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,620
although his human half does crave it.

645
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,740
His digestive system is supernatural and 100% perfect.

646
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:11,380
Everything he ingests is utilized by the human half of his body or transferred into angelic

647
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:16,980
energy, the same angelic energy that allows his human components to survive without sustenance.

648
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,120
more or less he could theoretically eat anything without any negative side

649
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:25,140
effects. This is includes insane things such as a chunk of steel, some uranium

650
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,140
or even a cup of hot lava. If you're one of the unfortunate beings on this

651
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:34,060
planet that must endure the indignity of defecation, then you probably need the

652
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:38,780
product in the video above to mask the hell of your smell. L. O. L. Poopery

653
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:42,420
before you go. Toilet spray is the perfect stocking stucco suffer for

654
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,920
humans for most humans, a K animal God hybrids on your Christmas list. So why

655
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,740
is he as fat as a fucking melon? Because he doesn't poop. He's all in there.

656
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:55,460
Yeah, every time he eats, he doesn't need to eat. He's right, but he craves

657
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,220
it because he's like

658
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:03,060
anyway. He has two thousand years of shit. Yeah, that's why he's very much,

659
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:07,900
but okay, this is all kind of surprise that even makes him jolly. It would

660
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,980
make me fucking if I was that impacted. I didn't add as far. Oh yeah, I would

661
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:17,220
become the anti clause. Yeah, that's that's all my slides. All right, I'll go

662
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:22,060
next here. I haven't this is more. This is a story time. Okay, I have for you

663
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,360
guys,

664
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:28,940
and this is this is apparently true. The movie Elf with Will Ferrell we were

665
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,700
talking about earlier is based on a true story. Guys,

666
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,380
Mg, so I'm going to tell you guys about what actually happened. Tell me the true

667
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:40,780
story of Elf, because it's become so commercialized. Yeah, it's been basically

668
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:44,380
interrupted and the real story is as you know. I'm just all I'm going to say

669
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:49,300
reality is sometimes stranger than fiction. That's my reference to this.

670
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,900
That's an amazing saying. Thank you. I never heard that the movie elf starring

671
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,980
will ferrell is the story of an orphaned human baby who was raised as one of

672
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:59,900
Santa's elves at the magical North Pole, capital of Christmas and unnamed

673
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:03,180
celebrity in the paranormal community, who was a regular guest of North Pole

674
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:06,660
City, learned of the true elf story and then gave the idea to elf screenplay

675
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:10,820
writer, David Barenbaum. David then built his own buddy, the human elf story

676
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,760
around the real one, because the rights to the original story are held by Santa

677
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,260
Claus and the human elf. However, Santa does give people permission to create

678
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:21,980
similar stories around the true ones. To some extent, the supernatural secrecy

679
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,740
pact could be in play, but realistically, nobody would believe such stories are

680
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:29,220
real anyway. So, Santa is the copyright holder of this story, and he said, "You

681
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:33,020
can't use this story, but you can do one that's almost exactly the same." So,

682
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,700
David Barenbaum has a direct line to Santa.

683
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:36,700
Yeah, he had to talk.

684
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,700
Through an unnamed celebrity.

685
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,700
Who do you think it is?

686
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,700
Who do you think it is?

687
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,700
That's North Pole, yeah.

688
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,700
Is it like Burrow Eyes?

689
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,700
In the paranormal community.

690
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:43,700
Yeah, it's got to be.

691
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,700
It's got to be.

692
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,700
Okay, who is a celebrity that is also involved with paranormal community?

693
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,700
Zach Bagans.

694
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,940
No, that's too involved.

695
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,460
I feel like it's got to be someone who maybe knows Will Ferrell or rolled with Will Ferrell.

696
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,180
It's probably, it's definitely not Zach Bagan.

697
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,180
Rob Schneider.

698
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,180
Could be Sacha Baron Cohen.

699
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,180
Could be.

700
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
Could be Sacha Baron Cohen.

701
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,180
I wouldn't be surprised.

702
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,180
It's definitely not Zach Bagan.

703
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:07,180
It's like that video of the guy standing outside of ice Poseidon's bus. I don't

704
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,980
know that don't know it off. Okay, Mrs. Claus come along for the Christmas Eve

705
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,480
flying sleigh ride in truth. The real elf was technically Santa and Mrs.

706
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,080
Claus first child, although be it an adopted one on Christmas Eve of 1888. So

707
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,580
this is an old story. Mrs. Holly Claus wanted to come along during Santa's

708
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:27,680
present deliveries that included the usual three sleigh managing elves who

709
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,080
assist Santa. There are certain dangers with her coming along as she was merely

710
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:36,280
human at the time who had to be magically protected against the stresses of flying a light-speed

711
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:41,720
teleportation sleigh. There are also potential attacks from various dark supernatural beings.

712
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Even in her current status as an immortal human, these supernatural stresses would still

713
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,260
be an issue. The magical protections required things to be slowed down, which can also make

714
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,300
Santa more vulnerable to the Anticlaws, Krampus, or other destroyers of Christmas. Since most

715
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,800
of these dark Christmas entities were beaten back sufficiently in 1888, it was somewhat

716
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,460
it's safe for Mrs. Claus to have that year. Yeah, okay, Mrs. Claus only came

717
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:08,020
down the chimneys of select places with Santa. That included a religious

718
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,500
orphanage in New York City. Sounds familiar, right? I'm sure you remember

719
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,540
sounds like where she greeted some of the babies in their cribs as Santa

720
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:18,100
delivered gifts. The priest who ran it actually knew Saint Nicholas, so there

721
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,040
was no violation of the supernatural secrecy pact. Mrs. Claus took an

722
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,640
automatic liking to one baby in particular, and she rocked him gently in

723
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:29,000
her arms. When it was time to go, she asked Santa if they could take the child

724
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:31,560
back to the North Pole to raise as their own. This was before the

725
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,620
angelic heavenly hierarchy intervened to grant them children of their own

726
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,420
immortals, such as Santa can't have children naturally, despite an angel

727
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,280
being able to have one immortal child with a human. It's nature's way of

728
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,160
preventing the earth from being overrun with the mortals, thereby overshadowing

729
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:51,760
the predestined story of humanity. Wow, the priest had no objection to the

730
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,240
adoption, but Santa regretfully said he was forbidden from bringing a human to

731
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,880
North Pole City, who did not find their way there on their own. This was

732
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:02,620
another amendment of the supernatural secrecy pact. She was quite melancholy

733
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:05,900
over leaving the child behind in his crib. Her sobbing in the back of the

734
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:09,820
sleigh made the rest of the delivery schedule a real downer. Santa and the

735
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:12,740
elves tried to console her, but she just couldn't forget the adorable little

736
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:16,780
baby boy. However, she eventually kept a stiff upper lip and fell silent so as

737
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:20,940
not to hinder Christmas in any way. So Santa ruined Mrs Claus Christmas hard

738
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:25,320
well where they had to have gotten the kid at some point, but then a little

739
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:30,280
Isabella invades North Pole City later on during Christmas morning. Santa was

740
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,520
enjoying his first post delivery meal. So here we see that he doesn't need to be

741
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,400
he does eat a behemoth of a breakfast fit only for a powerful human angel

742
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,120
hybrid like Saint Nicholas. Mrs Claus barely touched her hot cakes laden and

743
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,160
peppermint syrup and butter made from reindeer milk. Yeah, actually it's

744
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,520
probably fine nearby. A plethora of elves shattered and chowed down with

745
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,520
glee. Suddenly everyone fell silent and stopped inhaling their sugary food as

746
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,120
subtle sounds of a baby cooing could be heard. Santa uttered, "What in the seventh heaven

747
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:01,440
is that?" Everyone walked over to Santa's giant red velvet sack that should have been

748
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,320
empty after being drained of all Christmas toys. The bag was moving and suddenly a baby

749
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:11,800
came crawling out, smiling at everyone. It was Mrs. Claus' baby boy from the orphanage.

750
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,480
The child had somehow miraculously left his crib and entered the bag in the short span

751
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:19,360
of a minute. He managed to stay hidden in the bag throughout the rest of Santa's deliveries

752
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:23,560
due to it being a four dimensional bag. It had virtually unlimited space within,

753
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:28,280
so the child was probably crawling about what appeared to be warmly lit corridors

754
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,380
for hours before finding his way. Imagine it didn't find it. Maybe it was

755
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,880
in the back in there yeah

756
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:39,440
inside of the back rooms man. He could have been in there. They could have

757
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,880
never found him yeah. He could have died. He could have died of starvation

758
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,760
and water lack. Men of Candid Santa killed the baby on Christmas. I know

759
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,440
Mother Christmas scooped the cute baby up in her warm loving arms as she cried

760
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,720
tears of joy. She looked at Santa and asked, he found his way here on his own.

761
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,480
Can we keep him dear? He grinned widely and told her, yes, my dear.

762
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,760
From that moment onward,

763
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,720
she raised him as their own child and named him Sandy in honor of Santa's

764
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,760
father, the archangel Sarandio.

765
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,360
Although he spent a great deal of time with Santa's elves,

766
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,640
normally people age extremely slow at North pole city, including Mrs. Claus.

767
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,400
However, no human baby had ever lived there for any long length of time.

768
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,920
something caused him to rapidly age physically to adulthood. By the time he

769
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,060
was twelve years old in the year one thousand and one hundred, although he

770
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:26,600
was still mentally a child, since his friends were all childlike elves, it was

771
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:30,300
later revealed that his constant inhaling of elf dust acted as a

772
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,660
supernatural stimuli to accelerate his elf does come off of an elf. So here's

773
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:38,760
a little sidebar on what is elf does this is I pulled up this article just to

774
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,920
so we know here

775
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,160
more off. Most often elf dust is a byproduct of their respiration process.

776
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,720
when exhaled, it's invisible most of the time. However, it accumulates in the

777
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:51,780
surrounding environment at North Pole City. Much of the glitter in the snow is

778
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:55,580
actually elf dust. The majority of elves, including Santa Claus, enchanted elves,

779
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,760
only breathe the helium in our atmosphere. This partly explains their

780
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:03,680
comical low pitched voices, but I think they mean high pen. Helium composes a

781
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,040
mere point O O O five to four percent of our air, as opposed to the oxygen we

782
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:11,940
breathe, which makes up twenty point nine four six percent. Elfin cells

783
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,100
paranormal process the helium and Mac manufacture an argon neon compound of

784
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:20,100
a r2 any three that is exhaled from their lungs scientifically such a compound

785
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,600
could never exist, but this is the world of the supernatural we're talking about

786
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:26,900
here that being said the second this rare gas hits the air and immediately

787
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:30,400
breaks down to argon and neon these gases famous for causing the glow of

788
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,600
neon lamps emit a brief glow from the elves nose and mouth if viewed in

789
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:38,800
complete darkness in addition the exhaled elf dust will visibly shimmer in

790
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:39,600
that moment as well.

791
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,800
I'm always so fucking amazing how in depth all this is, but beware. Oh my

792
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:48,440
God, that some glittering and glowing substances can in fact be radioactive

793
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,280
rather than supernatural, although in some cases supernatural substances are

794
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:55,880
radioactive. Thankfully, true elf dust is harmless to humans, so if you see

795
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,920
something glittering and sparking sparkling, it's either don't touch it

796
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,360
because it could be radioactive. Well, it could be else us could be which

797
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:06,960
could make you your body get bigger. That's true, so I could make you age

798
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,640
kind of a gamble. So back to the story here, Sandy confronted his adoptive

799
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,720
father, Santa. He and Mrs. Claus sat down with Sandy to give him the news he

800
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:18,400
was adopted and was originally a human. Despite that Santa made it clear he was

801
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,400
their real son brought to them by the spirit of Christmas, he had also grown

802
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:26,420
into a true elf and should no longer consider himself human. Sandy was content

803
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,420
for a time until 1909 when Santa and Holy Claus saw the birth of their first

804
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,200
biological son, Nicholas Jr. The archangels allowed them to have kids after

805
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,180
understanding how positive it was for the clauses to raise Sandy. Sandy

806
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,020
became somewhat disenchanted and jealous of the arrival of the new child. He

807
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:44,020
decided to return to the human world in one thousand nine hundred and eleven to

808
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:47,860
find his real parents as a demi angel. Santa could look into anyone's mind and

809
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,460
see who their parents were. So now we're getting to the movie plot here. Okay,

810
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,380
Sandy's mother, Ellen Hemingsworth, was part of an affluent New York City

811
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:58,780
family who arranged a marriage to for her to another wealthy clan. Her husband,

812
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,180
Percy Hemingsworth, was a horrible cad. No cheated on her and was only in the

813
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,120
marriage to increase his family's power and position in life. Sandy's

814
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:11,600
heartbroken father, Patrick Forrester, was disowned by his own working class

815
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,080
family and run out of town so they wouldn't be blacklisted from working at

816
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,360
local faster factories. He headed out west and became a cowboy who never

817
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,900
married because he was still hopelessly in love with Sandy's mother. Sandy was

818
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:26,800
given a mystical snow globe by Santa that allowed him to open various portals

819
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:31,320
in a flash. He was out west in a small Colorado town called Woodland Springs,

820
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:35,680
current home of mystic investigation, the creators of this website. He found

821
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,560
his father on a cattle ranch. That's almost amazing, yeah, and now we'll see

822
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:43,860
more similarities with the movie here. Without blood and DNA tests, it took

823
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:47,420
some time to convince Pat Forrester he was his son. Thankfully, his mystical

824
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,680
elf powers aided him and they bonded for some years. Sandy didn't reveal where

825
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,500
he had been raised, as per the supernatural secrecy pact, along with

826
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:57,960
being told by Santa he would be branded a nut burger without proof he wasn't

827
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,920
allowed to produce. Although in defense of life, one can reveal their paranormal

828
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,720
powers. This happened when a violent gang of psychopathic cattle rustlers

829
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,080
attacked the ranch in the winter of one thousand and thirteen. Everyone would

830
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,320
have surely died if Sandy had not single handedly repelled them, mostly via dense,

831
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:17,660
high speed snowball throwing happens in the movie happens in the movie being

832
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:21,240
beamed with a one hundred mile per hour wet packed snowball can mess a person up

833
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,800
real good. Sandy was also forced to display other elephant abilities, such as

834
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,100
super strength when he talked a few rustlers around this caused the

835
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:31,340
formation of glittering elf dust to emanate from him. He finally told his

836
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:35,420
dad he was an elf, knowing such magic existed, inspired him to take a son back

837
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,620
east to reclaim his true love. They traveled there instantly via Santa's

838
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:43,300
paranormal portal activated by the magical snow globe. Then, in New York

839
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:46,380
City, Christmas, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen was approaching

840
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,780
that's Christmas one thousand nine hundred and thirteen. It's a different

841
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,340
holiday as Sandy finally convinced his mother he was her son. She demanded a

842
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:56,680
divorce from Percy Hemingsworth as she fell in love with Pat Forrester all

843
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:02,860
over again. However, the abusive cat of a husband sent thugs not dogs after

844
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,200
father and Elfin son, the thugs that were then dispatched Christmas style by

845
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,300
Sandy. A divorce was denied by everyone as his mother Ellen was whisked away to

846
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,380
England in the dead of night. Father and son managed to find out where she was,

847
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,580
but the magical snow globe portal was only programmed to go to Woodland

848
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,220
Springs, Colorado, New York City and back to North Pole City. Sandy was going to

849
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,960
return to the North Pole with his father to ask Santa for help, but it was

850
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,820
Christmas Eve and they spotted him in the skies above bellowing. Ho, ho, ho,

851
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,880
Merry Christmas, Santa sensed Sandy's presence below and landed in some woods

852
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,060
nearby. That happens in the movie to landing in woods. After hearing what

853
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,320
happened, Santa told Sandy and his father to hop in the sainted red sleigh. They

854
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:44,700
immediately flew away to England in a flash. Sandy kicked in the door and his

855
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,060
father got into an epic fist fight with the abusive CAD Percy Hemingsworth. I

856
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:53,600
with this cad as how do you I'm sorry how did they get to England so quick?

857
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:58,160
It's a it's a slay you ass. No, no, no, no, no, not I know how Santa got there.

858
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:02,240
How the hell they'd Percy Hemingsworth and his wife man in the rich abusive

859
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:04,780
cad yeah, but when they have been on it would have made more sense if they got

860
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,180
on a boat. Yeah, I got a private boat. All right, all right, he's rich.

861
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,820
His father got an epic fist fight with abusive cad Percy Hemingsworth as Sandy

862
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:17,920
hugged his mother. He said, let me floor dad. I don't it's weird after healing

863
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,840
the other two guards and putting them into a deep sleep. Old Saint Nick

864
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:25,680
strolled in with an uneasy smile. He then easily pulled the two brawling men

865
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,520
apart with his titanic angel strength. The supernatural voice bellowed loudly

866
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,160
enough of this insane violence. This is Christmas Eve for the love of God.

867
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:36,620
Sandy pleaded with Santa that his parents should be together as the wealthy

868
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,220
cad said he had every right to keep his wife and demand everyone leave his

869
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:44,660
property. Now this is an insane power of Santa that I never knew he had here.

870
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,820
listen to this. Sandra reluctantly agreed, but then recited some important

871
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,540
words. I say Nicholas in my holy capacity of heavenly ambassador hereby

872
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:58,360
make this unholy marriage null and void in the eyes of the Holy Lord and savior

873
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:03,240
of the universe. Amen, he can dissolve marriages. I would piss me off. I

874
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:03,680
would

875
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:06,200
like you. There's legal stuff. We have to do

876
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,080
walks in is like you're not married anymore. What if you're yeah? What if

877
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,680
that what if that's what your wife wanted for Christmas and you and

878
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,880
talking that's how you get a limone thing you're just done. Percy Hemingsworth

879
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,800
angrily attempted to punch Santa and the kisser as he exclaimed. Those words

880
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,120
meant nothing because he had marriage papers. Santa restrain him and said all

881
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:28,740
papers and records of this marriage have been supernaturally disintegrated. You

882
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,500
are no longer married and you will continue to be on my naughty list for

883
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:37,820
the rest of your life. No doubt, Santa placed the pathetic Percy into a deep

884
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:41,380
sleep as Sandy's parents embraced and kissed the joyous family, use the

885
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:45,840
Blue Globe to travel to North Pole City with Santa's blessing. That is amazing.

886
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,760
This is something they don't show in the movie. See Sandy's parents,

887
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,360
consummate the marriage, finally get married.

888
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:55,960
Well, because I think his mom's dead. Yeah, right. So yeah, they didn't want

889
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,080
to deal with Percy Hemingsworth. Yeah, the movie, they don't want to put a cat.

890
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:03,400
Yeah, the cat is a scary. Who would have been the perfect cat in that movie?

891
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,320
John Favreau himself, the director. Yeah, Sandy's parents finally get married.

892
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:10,840
Santa finishes Christmas deliveries and had Mrs Claus make plans with Sandy's

893
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,180
biological mom for a wedding. While doing so, the women bonded as Ellen showed

894
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,880
great gratitude toward Holly Claus for raising her son. All the elves approached

895
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,880
Sandy and welcomed him back with open little arms. They officially declared he

896
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:27,180
was a real elf. Sandy also made an effort to bond with his little brother, Nick Jr.

897
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:31,720
At about 7 p.m. on Christmas Day, everyone gathered at St. Nicholas Church. In the

898
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,680
witness of several elves, Sandy's parents were married by St. Nicholas himself.

899
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:39,720
Naturally, Sandy was the best man, while Mrs. Claus was the maid of honour. To this

900
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:43,760
very day. Sandy and his parents still reside in North Pole City. Often the

901
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,620
clauses and the foresters get together for dinner and other activities. Sandy's

902
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,160
full name is Sandy Claus Forrester,

903
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,640
still just called Sand last name's l. Now this is the most insane part, but

904
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,960
so this is like a move. It's like milk. That's the movie. It's his last name.

905
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,980
Yeah, yeah, wow. Now this is the craziest part. This part they'd need to

906
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:03,760
have put this in the movie, and I think that they should release a version with

907
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,820
this alternate ending. Okay, on Christmas, one thousand and fourteen,

908
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,000
Santa gave the Forrester family a unique gift. Sandy and his parents opened a

909
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,980
gift box and were transported into a mystical realm drenched in the spirit of

910
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:19,100
Christmas. Sandy was made into a baby again and his parents got to raise him

911
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,680
until eighteen with it a dream world. They simultaneously believe it was real

912
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,920
while knowing it wasn't a supernatural state that is hard to explain at the end

913
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,320
of what seemed to be eighteen years. Their bubble reality ended and they

914
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:35,000
exited to find only one month had passed. Sandy and his parents now had the

915
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,800
a memory of a happy childhood together. Sandy got the gift of two childhoods,

916
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,380
both of which he remembers. What did he have a say in being turned? No, no, my

917
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,240
guy is a fucking twilight zone episode and then here's the epilogue. If they

918
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:51,480
also didn't cover this in the in the movie epilogue, way more cops after the

919
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:54,940
orphanage priest died, he spiritually visited Saint Nicholas from the great

920
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:59,220
beyond. He confessed to secretly placing the baby Sandy in his toy sack. After

921
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,820
seeing how much Mrs Claus loved the child, Santa forgave him and both agreed

922
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:06,220
and never tell a soul for fear of the repercussions of a super natural

923
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:10,180
secrecy pact violation, angels, demons or any other entities who signed off on

924
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,940
the ssp could possibly go back in time to prevent the event. The sandy would

925
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:18,340
never become an elf, nor would his parents ever find you don't want that

926
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:23,660
shit yeah, and that's the story on like I said reality. It's stranger than

927
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:27,020
fiction. Sometimes it really is. They have so many different magical things.

928
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:30,540
I got turned into a baby for almost no reason at the end of it. Wow, that's

929
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:37,060
amazing. Okay, I have I was looking so I know it's a Christmas episode. We're

930
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:41,260
supposed to do all Christmas stuff, but I did get I just found something that I

931
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,860
liked a lot that it was not it's holiday related, but not so much Christmas. So I

932
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:48,380
have to apologise for that. That's okay, but

933
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:52,720
I do want to really quickly look at the have you ever looked at the disclaimer

934
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:56,580
for this website? I don't think so. We might have it. It has a no. I don't

935
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,140
think so. I mean maybe we looked at it for a second, but at first you think

936
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,300
it's just like a normal like copyright policy or something, but it says this

937
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:08,660
the following text below may be required under the supernatural secrecy pact of

938
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:12,740
thirty three AD. The characters places organizations at events on this site

939
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,020
mystic investigations dot com are completely fictitious. Wait. I know what

940
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,380
happened in thirty three AD. Yeah, whoa yeah, that's crazy. Any similarity to

941
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:24,300
any person living or dead is merely coincidental. Any similarity to any

942
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,780
place organization event or anything else for that matter is also purely

943
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:32,100
coincidental. Despite this site being a total work of fiction, we have no way of

944
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:35,340
knowing for sure if the various supernatural beings and folklore mentioned

945
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,340
actually exist on this planet, another planet, or a parallel universe. In fact,

946
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:43,260
they very might well- they might very well exist. If you believe the religion

947
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:47,100
of Godhoodism, which states that everyone who's good eventually ascends to Godhood

948
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:50,780
and creates their own universes, which we should do a deep dive on Godhoodism at

949
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:55,100
some point. Godhoodism might be the most important part of this entire thing. The

950
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:58,480
guy who made missing investigations has his own religion called Godhood ism,

951
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,240
which he takes very seriously as an entire blog about it, but basically you

952
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,180
become a God at the end of your life. Okay, next slide.

953
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:09,860
Who knows if we're required to say all of this under the alleged supernatural

954
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,580
secrecy pact of 33 A. D.

955
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:16,660
Blah, blah, blah. The information on this site is not intended to or implied to

956
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,500
be a substitute for professional medical advice and then this big medical

957
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:25,640
disclaimer, but you you might see this and say, Oh man, it's all fake, but

958
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,340
they seeded these little things about the the supernatural secrecy pact of

959
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,860
thirty three AD, and if you go to the next slide, there's a photo of this

960
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:37,880
thing. Look at that. Oh my God, that's the pact. It's a golden tablet with a

961
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:42,340
bunch of crazy writing on it, and so this was signed. I'm guessing that

962
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:47,620
these are all signatures of different gods, God, angels, all that sort of

963
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:52,340
and this is a very, very important pact. Okay, I want to move on from this though. But I just

964
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,780
like that they have this disclaimer, but then they tell us the truth in the disclaimer.

965
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:01,500
Okay, so the story I'm covering is what are the digital demonic dangers of Cyber Monday?

966
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:07,780
This is by Xavier Remington. Here you have a photo if well, yeah, so you have a photo

967
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:13,180
of some kind of hacker hacking into a MacBook, something that says 60%. And that's in Mordor.

968
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:16,700
It's like door and then there's a bunch of stairs up to heaven. It looks like heaven and

969
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:21,780
hell almost. All right, next slide. So maybe you skipped the frightening shopping frenzy

970
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:27,060
of Black Friday to avoid the dangers of being injured by hordes of human shoppers, zombies,

971
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:32,940
vampires, and the demon god of greed, Mammon. A lot of bad things can happen in a chaotic

972
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:37,140
crowd. There's also the potential for demon possession when it comes to those with weak

973
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:41,000
minds. Those suffering from the unfortunate and mental condition of greed and a lust for

974
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:46,160
material items they don't really need. These misguided individuals with monetary malevolence

975
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,520
in their hearts are compelled to injure innocent people who get in the way of their supposedly

976
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,520
sweet shopping deals." There's a lot of alliteration on this website.

977
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:01,920
It seems sitting in the safety of your home and shopping the dynamic deals of Cyber Monday

978
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,680
-- that's an ad, it's a built-in ad -- on the Internet is the way to go. Sure, it's a lot

979
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,360
safer, but there are still risks as you furiously click away, adding items to your virtual shopping

980
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:15,960
cards while whipping out your credit card. And there's a photo of a melted

981
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:22,440
computer guys and a scary set of yellow beady eyes behind a black. Oh shit. I

982
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:25,360
didn't even notice the eyes. Yeah. So this can get scared. I thought that that

983
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:29,320
was just a modem. Next slide. You may think that cyber monday safe. The risk

984
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,940
of cyber monday includes the aforementioned demonic possession for

985
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:35,880
the simple minded overwhelmed by a lust of luxury items. There are indeed cyber

986
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:40,240
demons within cyber space. Those dark spirits who can't quite make it into our

987
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,860
reality completely end up as paranormal binary data forms on the internet. This

988
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,520
makes sense when you consider that everything in our physical reality is

989
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:52,280
ultimately composed of non-corporeal energy, which is in essence a dynamic

990
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,240
form of data. Often they become trapped in the unfamiliar reality. They are bound

991
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,280
by the limits of the World Wide Web, hardware, and various software platforms.

992
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:05,040
However, they can still be diabolically dangerous. Even more alarming is a new

993
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,840
form of magic, which dark practitioners of magic or even demons themselves are

994
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,760
writing intricate AI code that they can breathe life into. In essence, creating

995
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,160
new cyber demonic life, their own private minions ready to dominate and corrupt

996
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:26,160
the future virtual reality holographic internet. Oh my god. So and this is a

997
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:30,800
Monday problem. This is a big problem on Cyber Monday. Jesus. Next slide.

998
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,720
Demons who merely haunt the web while still existing in the metaphysical world will simply

999
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:40,080
use their cyber form to brainwash your mind. Once weakened enough, they will perform a

1000
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:44,660
standard direct possession. True cyberdemons will sometimes have the assistance of a real

1001
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:49,840
world demon to pass the possession off to." So they will possess somebody through their

1002
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,360
computer and then say, "Hey, Beagleborg, come get this bitch."

1003
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,360
Yeah.

1004
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,360
Scary.

1005
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,360
The Beagleborgs?

1006
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,360
Beagle.

1007
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,360
Beelzebub.

1008
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:05,860
It's considered a living sacrifice and the cyberdemon is rewarded with power and a promise to be released from the computerized prison someday.

1009
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:13,860
If it is merely a lone virtual demon, then on-screen hypnosis and Wi-Fi connections are their entry into your mind, body, and soul.

1010
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:20,860
The high-frequency electromagnetic waves of Wi-Fi act as a conduit for higher-dimensional cyber entities to enter your subconscious.

1011
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:23,860
That is where perplexing possession begins.

1012
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:29,140
not perplexing. I do not fuck with perplexing per person. The demonic

1013
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:33,180
possession is particularly high while sleeping as your subconscious manages

1014
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,580
your greedy material possessed thoughts of the day. Be sure to sleep far away

1015
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:42,220
from the wifi or turn it off. Listen closely. Ethernet connections are best.

1016
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:46,980
We already knew that shit. Certainly use of mobile devices is a risk on this

1017
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:51,180
malevolent monday. Oh just on cyber just on cyber money. Cyber monday is

1018
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:59,100
probably the highest demonic attack day. Next slide. How to repel cyber demons of darkness.

1019
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,780
And this is a pair of green eyes shoot in a green hoodie, shouting out ones and zeros.

1020
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:10,220
So Jawa Cyber Monday is the number one day for calamitous cyber entities to rear their

1021
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:14,740
blasphemous binary heads forth to plague people with their hellish horror. If you want to

1022
01:03:14,740 --> 01:03:19,500
avoid the hazards that range from computer issues to being eaten alive, then be extra

1023
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:23,500
cautious on Cyber Monday. Just think happy thoughts or realize there's plenty of trinkets

1024
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,780
for everyone on the Internet. So don't obsess over your trinkets, guys.

1025
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:27,780
Yeah. There's plenty to go around.

1026
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:32,020
You'll get your shopping deal, another ad, but even if you do, even if you don't, it's

1027
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:36,780
no big deal. Don't obsess over material items and keep a cool head along with a calm heart.

1028
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,540
If you see your computer starting to wig out, then immediately shut it down and leave the

1029
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:46,100
room because it could be a demon entering your domain. Blessing the computer with holy

1030
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:47,100
holy water

1031
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:53,940
to put water on your computer or merely cleaning the screen off with it can

1032
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,680
help placing religious artifacts around your computer can also help using a

1033
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,700
Bible as a mouse pad is a major moral measure of security as you serve

1034
01:04:01,700 --> 01:04:05,080
through perilous virtual waves. I never considered that use the Bible as a

1035
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:09,220
mouth mouse bed. Have you as you serve the perilous virtual waves of cyber

1036
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:13,280
monday's ocean swimming thick with sinister shopping sharks. If all else

1037
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:18,940
deals, try praying to the Holy Cyber God, Cyber God, yeah, Cyber God man, Amen.

1038
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,560
Next slide.

1039
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,980
Cyber Monday, at Mystic Investigation. So they're taking measures at Mystic

1040
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:28,020
Investigation, and there's an ad on either side of those ones for an LG OLED

1041
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:32,140
Evo that says it's time to upgrade your television. Our employees are given

1042
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:36,100
fifteen minutes every two hours to personally pursue the Internet for Cyber

1043
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:40,140
Monday deals. All our computers are cyber vaccinated with the latest magical

1044
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:43,520
anti-demonic software, along with being blessed by a priest.

1045
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,840
There are also protection spells in place.

1046
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:48,600
Employees may also take turns on cyber patrol duty

1047
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,680
and shop on websites as they officially look

1048
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,240
for signs of trouble.

1049
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,800
Some are also assigned to our cyber phone center

1050
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,220
on this dangerous day.

1051
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,840
While waiting for calls, they are allowed to shop as well.

1052
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:01,200
Generally, we get information on the type of entity

1053
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,400
inhabiting one's computer,

1054
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:04,960
and then we design an antiviral-type program

1055
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,000
to deal with the supernatural scourge.

1056
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,560
tougher cases require us or our partners and other communities to make a house

1057
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:17,720
call to exercise the cyber demon, which could be a reboot of the exorcist.

1058
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:22,480
Yeah, is that your computer or your phone is completely has a demon in it,

1059
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,000
man? Get that thing out of here. The computer cyst interesting note. This to

1060
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,680
me is the most interesting part of this whole thing. I persist because we've

1061
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:35,120
been talking about so cyst the exorcite exorcist. Oh my God, it was right under

1062
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,860
the exorcist, the webser site or like the web source, the webs or site

1063
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:45,360
interesting. Now, cyber genies are usually far less nefarious and think

1064
01:05:45,360 --> 01:05:46,960
akinator,

1065
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,460
akinator, akinator far less nefarious than their real life genie in a bottle

1066
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:55,960
counterpart. Their mind is oddly altered in a positive manner by becoming

1067
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,660
digital me too man. Then there's the awesome freedom. They feel not being

1068
01:05:59,660 --> 01:06:02,860
confined to a bottle or lamp, nor are they bound by the three wishes rule.

1069
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:05,360
however, it's best to exercise caution. If you come across one,

1070
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:08,740
they can still get quite vindictive if you offend them. So cyber genies are

1071
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,860
nothing like real genies at all. They don't grant wishes. They just live in

1072
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:16,220
the computer. They just guess to see what, oh, you're talking about Hassan

1073
01:06:16,220 --> 01:06:20,780
Abhi, right? So that's interesting. I think maybe there's another slide, but

1074
01:06:20,780 --> 01:06:21,400
that might be it.

1075
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:27,500
Now, that's it. That is it. So that's the I know that Cyber Monday is already

1076
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:31,500
over. I want to know what cyber God. I'm really yeah. Me too. I forgot to

1077
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,680
include something about cyber God, but maybe we can look at it real quick.

1078
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:38,380
Just search cyber God, mystic investigations. I'm sure it'll come up

1079
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:44,140
because I do. I am interested to see I want to see a photo cyber gods. This

1080
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:45,680
has got to be him right? Yeah.

1081
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:52,880

Maybe a marriage destroying mistake.

01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,760
Oh no. Yeah, last night.

1115
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,760
Me and my wife have decided to start doing a budget.

1116
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:56,640
doing a budget, right? To do, take care of our money.

1117
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,720
It's that season, man. I've been on the budget too, and it's been ruining my life.

1118
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:01,720
Not good, dude. It's not good.

1119
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,720
What happened?

01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:03,720
It's not good to look...

1121
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,240
Dude, the moment you realize how much money you actually have...

1122
01:09:07,240 --> 01:09:11,160
And your wife makes double the amount of money and it's still not that much money.

1123
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:14,160
Exactly the same experience.

1124
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:19,080
And then she's like, "Is this really how much money you make?" And I go, "Yeah, bitch. We

1125
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:20,080
have an office."

1126
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:25,420
I'm seeing the exact number of money I'm putting into savings every month.

1127
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:25,960
Yes.

1128
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:29,460
