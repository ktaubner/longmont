[moaning]

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,000
Original recipe, baby.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Original recipe.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
But speaking of original recipe, I did just go to Popeyes and get a big chicken sandwich.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Did you ask for the original recipe?

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,520
No, I asked for the one with the spicy goo that all the people online like.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,320
Yeah, the oobleck.

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,120
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, I asked for it.

13
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:35,960
And then they just gave me a sandwich.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,880
Yeah, they said we don't know what oobleck is.

15
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,760
Yeah.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,960
It's fucked up.

17
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,840
And I spit on them.

18
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,680
Happy birthday, man.

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,960
Thanks. Yeah, the day this comes out is my birthday and Patrick's not on this one

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,640
because he hates birthdays and me.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,920
Yeah, he mostly is. He hates Cameron the most.

22
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,760
Yeah, he heard how much I was complaining about his squeaky chair and so he decided

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,400
at his birthday present was to take the chair out of the equation.

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,360
I don't really care about the chair, it's just fun to make fun of it.

25
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,800
The chair doesn't bother me at all.

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,480
Yeah, I just worry that the fans will get mad.

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,800
Because it's a really loud chair.

28
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,440
The fans hate a squeaky chair.

29
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,600
It sounds like a thousand year old rocking horse.

30
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,480
Look at this, he just texted us.

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,480
He made that, he made that.

32
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,480
I bet he's, he said.

33
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,480
What did he say?

34
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,600
I said I was docking his pay for not appearing and he says that's fine.

35
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,720
This is how rich he is, ladies and gentlemen.

36
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,720
He doesn't give a fuck.

37
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,320
he can afford it and the loudest antique chair in the world

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,760
yeah it's specifically allowed chair i think it's very funny to this he made a

52
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,600
there's no way that's the real chair that's his baby that's that's him crying

53
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,120
yeah that's him crying because he didn't get it he didn't get a monster energy in

54
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:44,880
a baby bottle yeah with a nipple oh with two nipples with two it has to be with

55
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,720
two nipples that's what he has to have because it's got to be the real thing

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:57,820
yeah it's just a life like life like human tits and just a tiny bottle

57
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:03,560
attached kind of a perfect woman when you think about it just two big fake tits and a bottle behind them

58
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,440
just feeding in them, it's kind of genius. Filled with chemicals yeah and a green

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,760
decepticon chemicals. It's like like here's a scientist does a mock-up of what

60
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,440
women will look like in a hundred years.

61
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,920
Just two big, fake, beautiful brown breasts with big brown nipples and a baby bottle full

62
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
of soy milk.

63
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,320
Yeah, and a cool green three claw mark thing right on there.

64
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,720
Yeah, and the head from a Funko Pop Mario just sat on top.

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,400
Yeah, and the legs of a transformer.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,560
Yeah, and finally, finally.

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,440
I want my girl to have the legs of a transformer.

68
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,040
And finally no pussy.

69
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Finally.

70
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,320
Yeah, she has the transformer legs so when she transforms she's a car just from the ass

71
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,320
down.

72
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,720
That's what I want.

73
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,920
And she has legs that go all the way to being a car.

74
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,160
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

75
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,880
I just, I want a speech I want to make about how the FBI caught Ghislaine, I don't care

76
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,920
how it's actually pronounced. Never gonna look it up. They cut just lame Maxwell.

77
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,160
And I just wanted to say that when when they killed Jeffrey Epstein I was over

78
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,280
the moon because I was just so happy and proud that the Clintons were able to

79
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,960
like skip over you know the burden of the legal system and legal proceedings and

80
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,840
were able to just deliver swift justice to this awful man and end his reign of

81
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,120
terror over the world, much like they did, much like Hillary did in Benghazi.

82
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,700
They were able to get rid of some really bad people, you know, without worrying about courts

83
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,700
and judges.

84
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,920
And then I found out that Jeffrey had actually a normal adult girlfriend who was also evil.

85
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,780
And I got really upset again because I knew this wasn't over.

86
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,480
This wouldn't be over until, you know, they caught and brought to justice everyone involved

87
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,300
with this child trafficking.

88
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:02,700
And now they've caught Ghislaine and it's finally over, you know.

89
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:09,020
I'm just really happy that they finally got, you know, the final person who is in charge

90
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,060
of this child trafficking and I hope that the Clintons will be able to, you know, circumvent

91
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:19,740
the law and deliver swift vigilante justice to Ghislaine and, you know, end her life to

92
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,260
kind of just put the final nail in the coffin of pedophilia and end it once and for all.

93
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,580
I just want to say that because I'm really excited.

94
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,580
I'm over the moon.

95
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,020
So, I hope you guys are as excited as I am.

96
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,020
This is the best birthday present I could have had.

97
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:40,460
That's what I think is it's like yeah, why are people so mad at the Clintons for killing these people?

98
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,420
They're like have you not seen the movie hard candy isn't it good to kill pedophiles isn't that like?

99
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,500
Exactly thing yeah, have you ever seen nightmare on Elm Street? Oh?

100
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,100
Wait it's Jeffrey Epstein's gonna come back in the dreams of the Clintons and

101
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,820
Give them nightmares. No. This is all you think is

102
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:07,420
Do you think Epstein met Gislaine because of pedophilia or do you think they were already

103
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:10,020
dating and at some point one of them had to bring it up?

104
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,500
Hey babe, do you want to start a child trafficking ring?

105
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,460
I mean yeah, because who do you, I mean it's definitely Epstein brought it up first.

106
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,460
They just ran out of things to-

107
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,660
Or no, maybe it was, maybe that was Epstein's whole defense where he's like, "My crazy wife

108
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,420
made me do it all.

109
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,920
You know how women are, they're always hanging stuff over your head.

110
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,920
She comes up to me, I'm mowing the lawn outside, she comes up to me and says

111
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,920
"I want a divorce" and I say "Well, you know, that complicates stuff with the money"

112
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,920
and she's like "Alright, well we're gonna start fucking kids then"

113
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Yeah, what could I do?

114
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,920
Yeah, my hands are tied, you know, these women, I mean, what are you gonna do?

115
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,920
You can't live with them, you know?

116
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:53,920
You can't live without them, but you can fuck like a million little kids with them, I guess.

117
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,840
They just ran out of things to do together.

118
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,560
You know, they're watching TV all the time.

119
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,880
They watched The Office two times through.

120
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,000
And then one day, they were like, you know what?

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,320
What about kids?

122
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,640
What about fucking children?

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,720
What if we just did that instead of Netflix?

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,840
That's called Michael Scott's law.

125
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,920
That is, if any couple watches The Office

126
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,720
more than two times, they turn into sex traffickers.

127
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,840
Yeah, the thing is, you get seven years into a relationship

128
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,120
and you gotta do something to keep it fresh.

129
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,200
You know what I mean?

130
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,880
Some people renew their vows,

131
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,760
and then some people start raping children

132
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,160
in the ass and in the mouth, you know,

133
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,360
and then selling them to rich people to eat.

134
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,200
- Yeah.

135
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,900
- You know, it's just a, you know.

136
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,480
They're like Bonnie and Clyde when you think about it.

137
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,320
- Yeah.

138
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,400
- People love to romanticize Bonnie and Clyde.

139
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,820
- So why aren't we romanticizing them?

140
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,660
- Yeah.

141
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,780
- That's what I wanna know.

142
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:51,360
- Yeah, the 2019 Bonnie and Clyde.

143
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,200
- Yeah.

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,040
- Fuck.

145
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,900
- You doing anything fun for your birthday?

146
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,440
- I'm going to a sculpture garden,

147
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,060
and I'm also gonna hang out with my dad.

148
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:05,420
That's pretty much it.

149
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,260
- Nice.

150
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,080
- Yeah.

151
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,540
- Is it your dad's sculpture garden?

152
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,220
- No, those are two separate activities.

153
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,380
I'm gonna go to a sculpture garden with my mom,

154
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,140
and then I'm gonna go to my dad's house.

155
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,540
- That's the comp, even as an adult,

156
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:20,500
it's still, on birthday,

157
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,260
you still got divorced parents, you know?

158
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,580
- Yeah, yeah, you gotta have two, you get two birthdays.

159
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,740
- Yeah, you still get a weekend with both on a birthday.

160
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,560
- Yeah, yeah, you have to split the time.

161
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,340
You have to go to my dad's house in the morning,

162
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,480
and I have to come back and go to the sculpture garden.

163
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,700
- Every hour, you have to go to your mom's

164
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,660
and then to your dad's.

165
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,580
- It's like a wacky sitcom.

166
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,820
You know, you have to-- - Yeah, just every--

167
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,660
- You have to pretend you're not spending time

168
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,500
with the other one. - That's what the judge said.

169
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,780
- That's what the judge said, you have to do it

170
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:54,100
like a way I said yeah yeah the thing is your dad walks in the room and you have

171
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,920
to be like oh hey dad holding a pillow over your lap where your mom is sucking

172
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:13,900
your penis yeah just like all those sitcoms I watch yeah and then then your

173
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:18,340
dad notices your mom goes no no no that's not how you do it at all

174
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,340
Let me teach you.

175
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
Oh, fuck.

176
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:25,340
Are you turning 22 or 23?

177
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,340
22.

178
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,340
Damn, you're a young one.

179
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,340
I'm a little baby.

180
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,340
I'm the youngest in the podcasting game.

181
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,340
You are.

182
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,340
That's true.

183
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,340
You are.

184
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,340
You're very young.

185
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,340
I'm old as shit, dude.

186
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,340
You're 35.

187
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,340
I'm 35 years old.

188
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:48,300
My brain is just a flat pancake because yesterday I got, I was going to make brownies with the,

189
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:54,540
my my weed cart pin broke and I was trying to like save the oil so I put it

190
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,940
in a cup so that it would like drip down yeah and like I put a cup upside down

191
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,460
and then put like a piece of saran wrap at the bottom so all the oil would just

192
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,460
like drip into the into the saran wrap but then it was too sticky to get there

193
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:14,340
so I just decided like I was getting so frustrated with this with like trying to

194
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:18,780
make this into like an oil that I could use in like a brownie or something that I

195
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,740
just texted my brother I was like is there any way and get this out and he

196
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,540
was like oh you can just eat that stuff like you don't even have to put it in

197
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,140
something because it's been it has been heated enough or whatever and I was like

198
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:35,700
okay so I just like ate a spoonful of it yeah and yeah and I just it just ruined

199
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,080
my brain was just gone for eight hours I just went up to the roof you texted me

200
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:45,920
and Patrick just the words feeling doomed and then didn't respond to any messages after that.

201
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,800
I went up to my roof and just have you seen the the videos where it's like

202
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,900
accent expert breaks down accents from different movies so I just went up to my roof and

203
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,360
just by myself was like staring off from my roof going like Spongebob the

204
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,080
Spongebob Squarepants movie. In this movie Spongebob's bikini-bottom accent really

205
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:08,560
comes out when he says words like I'm ready whereas with my accent I would say

206
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,680
more of I'm ready and I just did that by myself for like an hour I was good I

207
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,440
went completely insane yeah and then I just came back and I played video games

208
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,880
all night yeah I think um once the I think that like the for me the best

209
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,680
feeling from an edible is when from too much of an edible is afterwards when you

210
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,000
just can't think anymore yeah I was like about an hour and a half ago yeah like

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,420
my brain was just completely just gone.

212
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,620
Yeah, I know I told you about this before and I'm not sure if I said it on the pod before

213
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:47,300
but like there was one summer where me and my friend made like brownies and then we were

214
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,600
gonna like eat them with people but then just like nobody was around like everyone was on

215
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,500
vacation we're just like fuck I guess we have to eat these all ourself and we ate them over

216
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,900
the we ate them all over the course of one movie logic.

217
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,700
Yes we have all these wheat brownies we gotta eat every single one.

218
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,200
the thing is though her her parents were like away when we made them and they're

219
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,860
coming home so it's like oh yeah the clock was ticking that no it was like

220
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,660
completely a Judd Apatow plot line yeah so it just over the course of a week we

221
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,580
ate them all and just for like I think at least a month like my brain was not

222
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:29,780
running at full capacity not just completely for like a man that's great I

223
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,100
mean we definitely it undoubtedly makes you stupider yeah I have seen so many

224
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,980
people start smoking weed and become just the biggest idiots of all time.

225
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,940
Yeah, just completely go crazy.

226
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:46,140
Like I mean that also may have something to do with like where like my hometown like nobody's

227
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:51,920
smoking like real weed like everybody's smoking like the worst weed in the world cut with

228
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,260
like terrible fake synthetic stuff and just losing their mind.

229
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,580
And also everybody there does like fake LSD too.

230
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:09,180
You know, like they'll do like 2-5-I and like research chemicals and then just work at Wendy's

231
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,740
right now and have like two kids.

232
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:12,180
It's so sick, dude.

233
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,180
That's the lifestyle.

234
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,180
It is.

235
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
That is truly...

236
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:21,260
I was thinking today, like I think the cure for the...

237
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
Just the...

238
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:28,740
I don't know, the affect that everybody our age has is lobotomy.

239
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,400
Like I think we really messed up

240
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,140
when we got rid of Lobotomy.

241
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,980
Yeah.

242
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,140
'Cause I think like I could go for one.

243
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,100
Yeah, you gotta get a nice pick up in there.

244
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,500
Yeah, I don't know if it's,

245
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,300
can you still, can you like go to,

246
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,220
are Lobotomy's like cheaper in Cuba now?

247
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,400
Like is that a thing?

248
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,660
I mean you can just give yourself one.

249
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,940
I don't trust myself with that.

250
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,780
No, you just--

251
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,260
I guess it's like fine 'cause if you miss,

252
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
you just kill yourself.

253
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,180
Yeah.

254
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,540
Yeah.

255
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,540
It's either way, it accomplishes the goal.

256
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:59,540
You kind of get there no matter what.

257
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:04,540
Either you can finally enjoy Bojack Horseman or you're dead.

258
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Like whatever.

259
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:12,140
You try to give yourself a lobotomy and you miss and you accidentally remove the part

260
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,540
of your brain that's holding you back from becoming the smartest person on earth.

261
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
No!

262
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,540
Fuck.

263
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,540
Yeah, now I'm ten times as miserable.

264
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
Yeah, the booger that's stuck in your brain.

265
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,260
I can calculate every single the trajectory of every single molecule I know the future

266
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:33,340
I know exactly how everyone I love is gonna die I become Rick Sanchez from Rick of Morty.

267
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,420
Yeah well that's the thing you lobotomize yourself can't watch Rick and Morty anywhere

268
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,380
anymore you can't even know you can't enjoy it.

269
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,700
Exactly you can't you can understand you some of the stuff you know some of the stuff you get like

270
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,140
you can understand like this guy burps a lot that's funny but some of the you're some of

271
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,820
Some of the jokes like when Morty is raped in the bathroom by a weird alien.

272
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
By a jelly bean.

273
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,820
Yeah.

274
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,820
That's true.

275
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,020
That you won't be able to understand the hilarity of that moment.

276
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,500
That's going to go right over your head.

277
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Exactly.

278
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,820
That's kind of a smart comedy moment.

279
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,180
Didn't they have like a release like an apology in that and be like that jelly bean alien

280
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,700
is actually completely asexual and while it resembles anal rape it's actually like just

281
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
his method of feeding or something.

282
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Like they just tried to like explain it away.

283
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:20,740
there something like that maybe I just saw someone think so one second I think

284
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,020
called jelly Rick and seen I don't think he actually gets raped I think he almost

285
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,020
gets raped and then he kills the guy that's the scene oh no I think that it's

286
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:36,380
a put I think I'm thinking of a post from the Rick and Morty subreddit oh but

287
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,740
it's this post is by a Rick and Morty writer

288
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,740
is this like this is after they made everyone is doing it everyone assumes

289
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,940
that King Jellybean was attempting to sexually assault Morty by penetrating him

290
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,920
with his genitalia which explains why the reactions to it have been so strong

291
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,140
however King Jellybean has no genitalia.

292
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,820
That's so funny just like like you clearly

293
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,520
wrote it as a rape joke. Like he says right before it he's like just let

294
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:11,900
this happen. Yeah. No yeah. You can't just afterwards be like well it's actually aliens and they don't even know what rape is.

295
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:19,940
is it's there he's a jellybean guys come on and to post it on a toilet and says

296
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:26,660
just let this happen yeah man that's sick dude it's awesome

297
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:30,620
see that's how that's how smart these Rick and Morty writers exactly they're

298
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,020
smart enough to get out of any bind any social justice issue they're kind of a

299
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,620
Rick by themselves you know yeah exactly that's that is a show created by Ricks

300
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:51,620
let me tell you. That's true. Yeah, but Mortys are the viewers. Exactly. Yeah, that's my problem with Rick and Morty is that yeah, the creators are total ricks, but it feels like the fanbase is just a bunch of Mortys.

301
00:16:51,620 --> 00:17:06,620
Fuck, man. Sorry about it. It is. Worst coffee of my life. I just went to a thrift store and got an espresso machine for $15. Nice. And I opened it up and there was a chunk of coffee still in it that somebody had made.

302
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:13,180
And they, and then I turned it on and it just made my entire apartment smell like diarrhea.

303
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,860
And I don't know whether, I don't know if it's possible to clean it.

304
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
I don't know.

305
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
Yeah.

306
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,740
That might not, if it made your apartment smell like diarrhea, it might not be coffee in there.

307
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,740
It might be diarrhea.

308
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,740
You know, that's a really good point.

309
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,140
It might have been a diarrhea cube.

310
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,740
Yeah, someone might have been making a diarrhea latte.

311
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,340
That's a really good point.

312
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,340
Yeah.

313
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,480
Yeah, I used to, when I was a kid,

314
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,020
I had like sand in my backyard,

315
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,200
'cause we couldn't turf it,

316
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,340
'cause we didn't have any money,

317
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,820
or we couldn't sod it,

318
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,700
and I would just make,

319
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,980
I would pretend, play pretend that I was a barista,

320
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,580
and I would make drinks out of mud,

321
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,140
and then I would make my brother drink them.

322
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,980
Nice.

323
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,420
(laughing)

324
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,940
Yeah, dude, making food out of sand,

325
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,060
great childhood pastime. Genius.

326
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,480
I did that whenever I went to the beach,

327
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,980
that's what I would do like I'm gonna make a cookie right now yeah yeah I'm gonna

328
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:09,240
make a birthday cake with the sand this is gonna be awesome it's gonna look

329
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,360

334
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,140
He would lick it up Scooby-Doo style.

335
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,640
He would, yeah.

336
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,080
We got one big lick and like a "fwk" sound.

337
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
And my dad was completely chocked full of sand.

338
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,080
And then he would look into the camera and go "hehehehehehehe"

339
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,580
God, that Scooby-Doo impression is too good.

340
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,580
That's, I think that's only the laugh I can do.

341
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,080
"Raggy!"

342
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,080
Yeah, that's, I can't do that. I just discovered I can't do the voice.

343
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,680
That's not what a dog's voice would sound like, first of all.

344
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Alright, a dog's voice would sound like...

345
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,880
"Raggy!"

346
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,780
Okay?

347
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:58,780
'Cause that's what a dog sounds like.

348
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,620
I'm a dog.

349
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:00,860
(laughing)

350
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,300
I'm a chihuahua.

351
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,140
You sound like that.

352
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,420
- Dude, you could strike YouTube gold with that.

353
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,420
Take an old episode of Scooby-Doo.

354
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,140
Dubbing it over with that voice.

355
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,980
- That would be awesome, yeah.

356
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
- That would be the biggest--

357
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,060
- What's up, Shaggy?

358
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,100
- If you could travel back in time to 2011 and do that,

359
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100

360
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,060

361
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,900

That's what I would be making.

363
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,580

399
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
That, uh, we were playing when we were playing Valorant.

400
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,040
I cannot stop thinking about that guy we played Valorant with.

401
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,760
The southern guy.

402
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,720
Oh, Rob?

403
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,960
Yeah, we played Valorant with this guy named Rob.

404
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,600
like we just got matched up with him randomly and he's had a super strong

405
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:26,040
southern accent and we were he was really bad at the game we were telling I

406
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:30,000
was telling him like Oh Rob like try like if you're gonna shoot at someone you

407
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,080
should stop walking you should crouch down because it makes you more accurate

408
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,640
and he's like man what the hell kind of game is this thing yeah and he kept

409
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,160
saying stuff like that and just be like man I man this shooting in this game is

410
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:49,280
so weird man I'm just kidding around man yeah man I'm just playing he was we were

411
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,840

412
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,100
wouldn't throw and then so Caleb was yelling at him and being like we're

413
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:00,600

414
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:06,080

You just it's never it's never about helping your team win. Yeah, it's just

450
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,020
It's just about having complete anonymity

451
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,900
Yeah, and just saying whatever you want through a microphone exactly. Yeah

452
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:27,240
I remember ordering a headset when I was like 14 and my mom was like

453
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,480
Why do you want to order a headset and the truth was so that I could do like Jeff Dunham

454
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,180
I kill you voice exactly

455
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:38,540
I told my mom I was just like just to talk be able to talk to my friends. I need to communicate with my friends

456
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,340
Yeah

457
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:44,660
It's sick, dude. And now I'm getting now I'm getting my younger brother my nine-year-old brother into games

458
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:49,100
I've got a strike with him and yes, just immediately he has it in him, dude

459
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:55,460
Yeah, he dies. Yes immediately. He just whispers just like like he'll get shot and then I'll hear just silence on discord and then I just

460
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
like

461
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:04,760
It's like he's got it dude, yeah, that's it every every kid born after 2000 has the gamer in them

462
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,600
The gamer gene. I think there was something about 9/11 that just spread like computer dust across the world

463
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:17,640
That's what it made every every kid every just like went into every kid's DNA that now they know how to cause explosions

464
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:22,280
Tech a small pieces of metal are called microchips exactly when the planes

465
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:29,320
Vaporized all the metal in the towers it basically spread microchips all over the world and everybody kind of got chipped

466
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:33,040
Yeah, you know in the left hand, which is that look at the beast? Yeah

467
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:38,320
That shit freaked me out dude. Have you seen that video that bitch gets a she gets like a key installed in her hand

468
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:45,900
We're in the network. Yeah, dude. I I found I was learning about this. Um, this theory called project blue beam

469
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:50,120
Have you heard of project blue beam? No, but I'm excited for it getting really into it

470
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:56,820
I think it's probably the most like believe not believable. It depends who you are. I think it's pretty believable. But like

471
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,600
It's this idea that like NASA and the New World Order or NASA's trying to create a new world order, right?

472
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,360
And they're doing that by ramping up just events in the world to just be completely insane and and batshit

473
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,260
And then it's gonna culminate they're gonna fake alien alien invasion using like okay

474
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:20,520
projectors and and like light shows and shit, and then they're going to

475
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,880
They're gonna

476
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,000
Also, they've they've been covering up

477
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,920
ancient religious sites that prove that all religions are actually one religion and they've just been split up

478
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,360
but and all this that but

479
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,000
so there and then they're gonna fake the second coming right and

480
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,320
They're gonna and they're gonna make it look like like the Messiah is saving us from the aliens

481
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,360
And they're gonna use that to make us, you know, I'll come together and unite under a new world order

482
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,800
Okay. Oh

483
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,720
- Oh yeah, all right, yeah, no, I have, yeah, that's fine.

484
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,800
- That's, yeah, doesn't that seem like that's like,

485
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,800
like there's enough crazy stuff going on

486
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,640
and it just keeps happening.

487
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,640
- Well when you say it, I guess my,

488
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,960
I don't know what New World Order really means.

489
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,080
- It's like the New World Order.

490
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,680
- Oh, that's helpful.

491
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,600
Yeah, but is that like they want to install

492
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,240
like a new government that is--

493
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,400
- Yeah, no, it's gonna be awful and oppressive.

494
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,920
It's not a good thing.

495
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,720
- Oh, 'cause it sounds pretty cool.

496
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,560
- Yeah, no, when you read it, it's like,

497
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,560
we're all gonna be one or whatever it's like it's basically just

498
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,560
Evangelion is the thing is this theory is basically just the third impact from

499
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:32,040
Evangelion can you explain it like I'm not a fucking nerd no sorry okay it's

500
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,120
you're just not smart enough to understand let's go to here so here's

501
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,360
this website right called educate yourself org that I've been kind of

502
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:44,240
reading through yeah and they have some information on the New World Order here

503
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,480
this is really long one second the war on drugs is a cruel joke that's part of it

504
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,400
got me so far mind control is part of it nice like FEMA is part of it FEMA is

505
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,040
always such a funny thing to include it's like the one the like most

506
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,080
underfunded fucking thing that we have in America and just being like yeah

507
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,200
they're they're actually new world order yeah basically I think people just don't

508
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,400
They don't want everyone to be in the same,

509
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,520
they want a global whatever.

510
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,440
They don't like globalism.

511
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,320
Globalism?

512
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,160
Yeah.

513
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:20,980
Oh, okay.

514
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,820
I think that's my take.

515
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,120
I think that's good, dude.

516
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:23,960
Yeah.

517
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,280
I think we should all live in a Google home.

518
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,000
I think we should all live in one giant body

519
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
and meld together like a giant homunculus.

520
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,640
Here's what I want, yeah.

521
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,040
I wanna wake up every day inside of a Google home.

522
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,200
I wanna go downstairs, make a Nescafe, right?

523
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,040
Yeah.

524
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:44,720
a crawler and just fucking start jacking off in my in my battery pack so I

525
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,200
can fuel whatever giant light bulb that's keeping us alive. Exactly. That'll

526
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,240
be it'll be like the Matrix like everybody's a battery but you get to you

527
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:59,560
get to like play games and stuff. That's the thing the thing about the Matrix the

528
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:07,240
fatal flaw of the Matrix is that if you if if my job was to be a battery you

529
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,940
could just let me know that. Yeah. You don't have to pretend that I'm like some

530
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:17,040
that I'm having some horrible life. My ideal life is just being a battery.

531
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,280
Absolutely. Sitting in a pod playing a video game and moving my feet all day.

532
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,680
Yeah. You know what I mean? Like like sitting on like a stationary bike

533
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:29,560
pedaling it so that all the computers can have their computer kibble and just

534
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:33,960
playing Mario Sunshine trying to beat like the the speedrun. Yeah the best

535
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,200
Mario Sunshine of all time just a photo realistic real-life simulation I mean it

536
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,600
is true that like you just keep if you just keep making new Mario Sunshine

537
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,240
games yeah just what yeah I'll be made the thing of the matrix is really just a

538
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,040
movie about some real of some terrorists trying to destroy the coolest video game

539
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,520
of all time yeah exactly I just wanted they don't want anyone to have fun

540
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:02,480
anymore instead of instead of getting to play this awesome VR game we want you to

541
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,440
all live in this post-apocalyptic robot slime world this will be so much better

542
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,520
yeah you got to wake up like a baby and put a spike in your neck

543
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:15,240
fuck that dude yeah I want I want to go inside the matrix you're gonna have a

544
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,080
thousand guns and learn karate would you rather have would you rather be playing

545
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,960
half-life Alex on easy difficulty with the greatest HTC vive ever known yeah or

546
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,400
would you rather be a fucking little a little baby who has to wake up and and

547
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:35,080
kiss a girl with short hair. Yeah. To me the answer is clear. Yeah, look, let's look at

548
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,560
women in the inside the matrix. Uh-huh. Okay. Pamela Anderson. Yeah. Megan Fox. That bitch

549
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:48,000
from G4. Now let's look at women outside of the matrix. Bald. What's her name? Bald. Bald.

550
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,920
Hole in the back of the head. Covered in slime. Inside a pod. Yeah, so what? Yeah, okay, you

551
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:56,640
get an extra hole. There's a fucking point in your column. Yeah, but if you try to put

552
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,560
- You put your thingy in there, it electrocutes you.

553
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,400
- Short hair.

554
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,460
- So it's not even a usable.

555
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,400
- And no, let's be honest, basically no tits.

556
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,320
- Pretty much. - On this girl.

557
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,160
- Yeah.

558
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,040
- Trinity.

559
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,880
- Trinidad.

560
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,600
- I mean, just, yeah, Trinidad James.

561
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,440
- Yeah.

562
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,760
- See, in the Matrix you have Trinidad James.

563
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,160
In the real life you have Trinity, your bitch wife.

564
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
- Trinity Games.

565
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,800
- Who can't stop wearing boy clothes and shooting guns.

566
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,480
- I would never let my woman have a gun.

567
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,180
That's the truth of the matter.

568
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,980
Yeah, 'cause what if one day, you know,

569
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,240
she's on her you know what, and then she flips on me,

570
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,240
you know?

571
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,080
Yeah.

572
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,000
I've been playing games too long,

573
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,840
and she just--

574
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:37,680
She just goes nuts.

575
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,500
She just unloads a clip.

576
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,080
Yeah, women don't, and the thing is,

577
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,360
you can't hold it against her.

578
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,820
She doesn't have the wherewithal

579
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:47,680
to even know what she's doing, you know?

580
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,040
So, she's gonna get off scot-free, I'm gonna be dead.

581
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,920
Yeah, and she can just be like,

582
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,240
I didn't know what this thing did.

583
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,380
I didn't know this was a gun.

584
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,380
I thought this was a blow dryer.

585
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,380
I just pressed a button.

586
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,380
I thought this was a blow dryer.

587
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,380
Wear a push up bra.

588
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:02,380
Yeah, women have it so easy getting off of murder.

589
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,380
Yeah.

590
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:08,860
Wear a push up bra, high heels, get a female lawyer who is slightly less hot than you.

591
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,660
Yeah, suck the judge's dick.

592
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:18,580
Suck the judge's penis, suck every single one of the jury or his penises, use your pussy

593
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,580
like a puppet and talk with it when you're in court, right?

594
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,580
And then just say, "I'm not guilty."

595
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,340
- Yeah, those two separate witnesses.

596
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:27,180
- Yeah.

597
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,580
(laughing)

598
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,900
Yeah, yeah, first--

599
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,740
- Yeah, now I'd like--

600
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,060
- One witness is your pussy, one is your butthole.

601
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,200
You make both of them talk with googly eyes on top

602
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,140
like you're Ubu.

603
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,400
- Yeah, thank you Trinity for your testimony.

604
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,420
Now I'd like to call to the stand Trinity's pussy.

605
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,700
Please turn upside down and stand on your hands.

606
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,540
- Please turn up.

607
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,980
(laughing)

608
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,220
Trinity's pussy, please turn up for us real quick.

609
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,260
(laughing)

610
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,140
Please turn out.

611
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:53,480
- Yeah.

612
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,780
- No, we're gonna do a new matrix though, basically.

613
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,620
- Yeah.

614
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,520
- Once we get enough money on the Patreon to build it.

615
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,860
Once we get a million dollars,

616
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,080
we're gonna do a new matrix. - That is, yeah.

617
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,240
I wanna make a better New World Order.

618
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,900
I looked up the New World Order,

619
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,600
and I guess it is less about all being one with each other

620
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,780
and more about, oh, we're gonna make

621
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,320
a totalitarian government that takes over the entire world,

622
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,020
Illuminati style.

623
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,440
- See, the Illuminati, they've really been

624
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,520
waiting for their eggs to hatch here.

625
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,760
They've been really just laying low for so long.

626
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:21,600
- Yeah.

627
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,860
- When are they gonna pull the trigger on this shit?

628
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,500
Everybody, I mean, it's just every two years,

629
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,680
somebody's like, "It's coming."

630
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,320
- Yeah, it'd be so funny if the Illuminati,

631
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,460
you know, they're just used to just,

632
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,040
so used to operating behind the scenes,

633
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,500
nobody knows who they are.

634
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,800
They're gonna try and take over the world.

635
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,960
They're gonna come to the forefront and be like,

636
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,640
"We're gonna take over all these governments."

637
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,960
And they're just gonna be a bunch of ugly old people.

638
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:40,800
And everyone's gonna be like,

639
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,800
"Oh no, these guys are too ugly.

640
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,120
"We're not gonna listen to them."

641
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,200
- Exactly, yeah.

642
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,600
- Totally, it's not gonna work.

643
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,200
They can only, like, they already have control

644
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,400
of everything behind the scenes.

645
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,320
Why ruin it by coming forward and--

646
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,000
Do you know anybody who's a Freemason?

647
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,120
No, but I, no, I don't.

648
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,680
I know a guy who's a Freemason.

649
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,680
I did a play in a Masonic Lodge in high school.

650
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,000
Masonic Lodges are pretty,

651
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,480
there's a lot of theater and comedy that happens

652
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,320
in Masonic Lodges.

653
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,440
I mean, it's a nice space.

654
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,520
It's beautiful, you did a great work.

655
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,360
Yeah.

656
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,320
They're Masons, by the way, you know,

657
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,360
so of course they have beautiful buildings.

658
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,080
Yeah, exactly, they build them all themselves.

659
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,920
I know a guy who's like my dad's friend

660
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,880
when I was growing up, who was a Mason.

661
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,220
And he's just like five feet tall

662
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,960
and he puts carpet down for a living.

663
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,400
And he's like a very high level Freemason.

664
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,500
That's so awesome.

665
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,680
He makes like $60,000 a year.

666
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,520
Dude, fuck yeah.

667
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,840
And when you ask him about it, he's just like,

668
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,080
I mean, yeah man, we basically just like

669
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,240
watch movies and stuff.

670
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,320
He just goes like every week, he's like in charge

671
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:51,240
And he just shows up, he dresses up like a Muslim and starts fucking, puts on the transporter.

672
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,240
Sick, dude.

673
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
That's so cool.

674
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,240
I want to join.

675
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,640
I feel like it can't be that hard to join, right?

676
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,720
No, I don't think it is.

677
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,440
I mean, I think you have to be Christian.

678
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,000
Is it a Christian thing?

679
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,120
I know that they believe in God.

680
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Because the G.

681
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,400
He's like, he's Christian, yeah.

682
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,720
The G in the Freemasons logo stands for God.

683
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:12,720
That's cool.

684
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,320
Yeah, because God was the first Mason.

685
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,800
That's a little fun fact for you, it'll blow your mind.

686
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,640
Yeah, Jesus was the first mason.

687
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,440
Yeah, that's what they think.

688
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,440
Yeah.

689
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,080
Yeah, and they are like of the lineage of God.

690
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,960
Are freemasons Christian?

691
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,800
Yeah, pretty much.

692
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
What's his name?

693
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,200
The director, he's like a 33rd degree mason, right?

694
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,200
Which director?

695
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,960
The sixth sense guy.

696
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,960
Oh, Shyamalan?

697
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:41,960
Yeah.

698
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,520
I didn't know that.

699
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:48,300
Yeah, that's why he loves twists so much because he's a part of the twist of reality

700
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,620
Yeah, which is that the Masons are running everything. Yeah

701
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:58,520
That's what freaking signs is about is signs that our government is under control by yeah greater power. Yeah

702
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,160
Am I right? Yeah, and the sixth sense is

703
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,200
is

704
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,680
Being is being cool, which is a big part of the Masons

705
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,160
You have to be cool since 2018 transgender men are allowed to apply to become Freemasons

706
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:22,200
it's awesome the way you said that like oh dude awesome that's cool good for it

707
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,680
good for them yeah good for the Masons I don't think that women can join Freemason

708
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,880
though yeah the attitude of most regular Anglo-American grand lodges remains that

709
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,640
women Freemasons are not legitimate Masons so you can get led into like your

710
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,560
local lodge but then like the Grand Lodge would be like nope sorry this is your

711
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:51,440
hand Mason fuck imagine devoting your life but then it's like it's in 2018

712
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,680
guidance was released by the United Grand Lodge of England stating that in

713
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,080
regard to transgender women or a trend train regard to transgender women I'm

714
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,320
Freemason who after initiation ceases to be a man does not cease to be a Freemason

715
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,320
the guidance also states that transgender men are allowed to apply to

716
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,800
become Freemasons. So if you're trans don't come out until after you've gotten

717
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,680
that Mason card. Exactly. Because otherwise you can't get it. Yeah. If you're

718
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,640
gonna transition always become a Mason beforehand just in case you ever want to be a Mason.

719
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,880
Yeah you won't be able, they won't let you back in. So it's just a good idea

720
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,320
everybody should just get registered even if you've never thought about it just

721
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,180
get registered just in case you never know you never know when you might just

722
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,540
transition or become a Mason so you might as well damn dude the Freemasons

723
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,640
were persecuted during the Holocaust there's no are you serious the

724
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,700
preserved records of the Reich search site this is the longest word ever right

725
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,660
I feel like if I was like security show the persecution of Freemasons during the

726
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:04,740
Holocaust if I was a conspiracy guy that was between 80,000 and 200,000

727
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,740
Freemasons were killed under the Nazi regime.

728
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,740
Oh my god.

729
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,740
Fuck dude.

730
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,740
It's so funny to kill somebody just for being in a club.

731
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,740
Yeah.

732
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,740
You know? Just like, cause it's not

733
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,740
it's not like it's ethnic genocide.

734
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:20,740
It's just like, yeah, uh, sorry.

735
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,740
We have to put you in a camp cause you're

736
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,740
subscribed to Game Informer.

737
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
So, we have to kill you and your whole

738
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,740
family now. Yeah, you guys have a

739
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,740
treehouse so you're gone. Yeah.

740
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,740
You're done for.

741
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:37,840
you're part of the Scholastic book club so we're gonna we have to destroy you with

742
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:43,600
a fuck with an oven yeah sorry it's just the rules that's I'm crazy I'm the only

743
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,420
club you're allowed to be in right now if you haven't noticed I feel like I

744
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:52,300
would have heard more Freemasons complaining about that about like

745
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:57,740
persecution dude if if fucking Italians had been I know right there you I would

746
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,080
I would have the sickest life right now.

747
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,120
(laughing)

748
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:05,720
I would be able to say anything I wanted to anybody, dude.

749
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,760
It'd be so awesome.

750
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,040
'Cause the thing is, Italians would also

751
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,980
make a way bigger deal out of it than Jews do.

752
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,820
Yeah.

753
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,600
You know, Italians would just bring it up

754
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,360
at every single point.

755
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,840
'Cause they almost try to.

756
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:21,500
Like, Italians are like, every once in a while,

757
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,940
they will get close to saying like,

758
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,160
doing the Irish like we were slaves thing.

759
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah.

760
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,960
It's just not true.

761
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,800
Yeah.

762
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,640
They just pretend they're persecuted.

763
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,480
You know?

764
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,320
They'll just be like,

765
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,680
"You don't know how hard it is for us."

766
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,520
Yeah.

767
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
And if they finally had something to back it up,

768
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,680
oh my God.

769
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
We would've had an Italian president by now.

770
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,520
Yeah.

771
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,480
Yeah, they think they're persecuted

772
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,320
'cause they had to eat a Domino's pizza

773
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,440
at their friend's house one time.

774
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,280
Yeah.

775
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,360
Yeah, they felt like they had to eat it.

776
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,820
What am I gonna do, not eat?

777
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,660
Yeah.

778
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,560
This is a family.

779
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,560
They are family here, I respect family.

780
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:58,920
Exactly.

781
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,420
Yeah.

782
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,800
It's the, it's the Italian catch-22 between

783
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,120
disrespecting another fam, another family

784
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,760
or eating American Italian food.

785
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,120
Much, eh, much, eh, much respect to the Domino family

786
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:16,000
but I'm not sure I can abide by this stuffed crust.

787
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,760
Domino.

788
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,260
Eh, much, much respect to the...

789
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Eh, much respect to Mr. Domino

790
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:28,740
But I'm not sure that a garlic crusty parmesan is exactly my kind of buffalo wing.

791
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,360
I don't know.

792
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:36,640
With all due respect, boss Domino, the lava cake is just...

793
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,500
This lava cake is to die for, honestly.

794
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,900
It's beautiful.

795
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,640
Domino's honestly is fucking amazing pizza.

796
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,640
I like it a lot.

797
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,640
I love Domino's.

798
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,140
It makes me feel so sick.

799
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
New York pizza is shit, dude. I've just been here.

800
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:53,940
Yeah.

801
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,740
Every pizza place they put broccoli on pizza.

802
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,740
It's fucked up.

803
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,240
Mm-mm.

804
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,240
What the fuck is wrong with you?

805
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,440
What is that? A parent's pizza?

806
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:00,940
No, thank you.

807
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,440
Also, there's nothing- people say the-

808
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,140
Exactly, yeah.

809
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,440
What, are you trying to sneak vegetables into my pizza?

810
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,940
Yeah.

811
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,240
Yeah, here's a chicken tender with a carrot on top.

812
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:09,740
[laughs]

813
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,740
Fuck you!

814
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,940
[laughs]

815
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,240
Go fuck yourself.

816
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:13,740
Yeah.

817
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,740
Here's a spinach cake.

818
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,440
Kill yourself.

819
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,140
Seriously.

820
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,940
Kill yourself!

821
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,840
Yeah.

822
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:19,740
Yeah.

823
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,860
Yeah, here's a jawbreaker, but in the middle of it, gravy.

824
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,760
Yeah.

825
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:26,600
Fuck you.

826
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,220
Come on.

827
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:28,060
Now that...

828
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:28,980
You know better.

829
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,520
Who do you think I am?

830
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,520
That honestly does sound kind of cool.

831
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,520
Not good, but interesting.

832
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,940
You know, that's, I think, innovative enough, I would try it.

833
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,360
I'm fucking sick of...

834
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,860
I'm sick of savory candy and flavored beers.

835
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,660
That is truly... That is parent shit.

836
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,700
Absolutely.

837
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,200
Yeah.

838
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,580
Instead of... Hey, instead of having a chocolate bar,

839
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,180
How about you have a chocolate beer?

840
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,180
- Yeah.

841
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,020
- Hey, how about, yeah, how about--

842
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,860
- You fucking bitch.

843
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,420
- Here's an artisanal chocolate bar

844
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:59,260
that has flecks of kale and spinach and broccoli in it.

845
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,420
- Here's why they're doing that.

846
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,580
They're trying to make chocolate beer

847
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:05,020
so that they can eliminate the need for chocolate bars.

848
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:05,860
- Oh my God.

849
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,100
- So that then kids can't have chocolate

850
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,900
until they turn 21.

851
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,860
- Dude, this is fucked up.

852
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,260
- Talk about a new world order.

853
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,660
Talk about Project Blue Bean.

854
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,420
Project Chocolate, Chocolate Team.

855
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,620
- Chocolate team.

856
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,460
- How about that?

857
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,620
- Exactly.

858
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,160
- Yeah.

859
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,900
- That's a--

860
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,420
- It's serious. - That's what's gonna get us.

861
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,660
- That's the new world order.

862
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,980
- Yeah, they're gonna simulate,

863
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,340
they're gonna simulate,

864
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:32,860
they're gonna use projectors and light shows

865
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,020
and psychotronic control to simulate

866
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,700
a world shattering event where chocolate bars

867
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,660
start to kill everyone.

868
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,740
- Yeah, exactly. - And they're gonna use that

869
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,940
to unite us against chocolate bars.

870
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,380
- Well, that's what 9/11 was,

871
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,900
was because those were the two buildings

872
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,900
that looked the most like chocolate bars.

873
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,580
And so they were trying to sort of like

874
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,140
in like a psychoanalytical way,

875
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,180
in trying to embed in every kid's head,

876
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:58,740
hey, chocolate bad.

877
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,980
Chocolate explode. - Yeah, exactly.

878
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,420
Chocolate explode.

879
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,540
- And the planes looked like fingers.

880
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,940
- And it backfired because now every kid

881
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,780
thinks it's the funniest thing in the world

882
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,360
that that happened. - Exactly, yeah.

883
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,140
And there's actually many Photoshops online

884
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,140
of chocolate bars as the tower.

885
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:17,700
- Yeah, what if a Cheez-It hit the tower

886
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:23,380
instead. Mmm yeah that's a really good point. Cheese and chocolate. Yeah. Ween.

887
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:29,620
Actually every mass casualty event of the past 20 years has been an

888
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:35,700
anti-candy psy-op. Absolutely. 100% undeniably. I'm trying to think right now.

889
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,700
Well first I mean you know Sandy Hook pretty obvious. Yeah.

890
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:46,980
Every single one that happened in a school that's covered. That's

891
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:50,780
pretty out you know although yeah Columbine Sandy Hook all that shit's

892
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:56,580
pretty you know Virginia Tech was that's that's on the border yeah cuz that is

893
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:01,700
technically a school technically but but it's a little you know yeah maybe a

894
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,700
little old yeah and then what are other what are other times people have died

895
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:12,140
well Stephen Paddock Stephen Paddock. You gotta get a mention of him in there in the episode or else it's not an

896
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:18,580
episode. That's true. Yeah, what is with us recently? We just can't stop thinking about

897
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,900
that guy. I think it's because I face-apped him to look like a girl. Yeah. Was that a,

898
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,540
there was a concert, right? Yeah, it was a James L. Dean concert. And I, you know people

899
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:33,460
were doing some adult candy, some drugs. That's right. You know what I mean? That's right,

900
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:43,780
dude yeah and also oh the music was sweet yeah exactly okay if you rearrange the

901
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:49,860
letters in steven paddock you get super parent oh my god I just did it yeah and

902
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:55,380
if you and if you rearrange the letters in James Aldean you get chocolate bar

903
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:01,140
it's fucked up dude if you're country music if you rearrange the letters by if

904
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,680
If you write down all the letters and then you crumple it up and you throw it away and

905
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:09,260
you grab a chocolate bar, then you have a chocolate bar in your hand.

906
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,060
Oh my god, that's so true.

907
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,060
Yeah, fuck.

908
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,980
And then the Ariana Grande concert, she was-

909
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,980
She was-

910
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:18,980
The classic photo of her eating a lollipop.

911
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,740
She was eating that big lollipop.

912
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,140
When they created that classic joke that we always love to make with each other, big dick

913
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,140
energy.

914
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:27,140
Yes.

915
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:35,340
yeah it originally it was it was it was big and how does Patrick eat a big dick

916
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:40,780
like a candy bar that's right that's the miss Patrick is the missing link in that

917
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,380
one I did Patrick is the missing link for sure yeah between between cavemen

918
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:51,100
and cavemen between cavemen and cavewomen he's directly in the middle

919
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:58,540
He's the missing link between those two. We finally got him. Yeah. Is the missing link a

920
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:02,580
real thing or is that just they just broke that up? Yeah, that's a it's a real thing but it's not it's

921
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:07,140
probably not as interesting as or I mean I mean it's not like not as interesting as you do is it

922
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,460
like it's not like the missing link in Monsters vs. Aliens. I mean it sounds so interesting. Well I mean it's

923
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:15,620
not it's probably not a monster from the Black Lagoon type situation. Oh. It's probably just

924
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:20,740
like looks like a half monkey guy you know what I mean? There is because I mean there's just like

925
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:23,460
They just want to know how everything evolved into everything else.

926
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,660
Because you know, it's just...

927
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,020
Because they're nosy.

928
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:27,260
They would just want to know everything.

929
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:28,700
It's honestly exhausting.

930
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,020
Such know-it-alls.

931
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:30,540
Yeah.

932
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,220
Can we just relax for one second?

933
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:37,740
Can we just take it for granted that monkeys and fish are the same thing or whatever the fuck you guys are trying to say?

934
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:43,940
It's honestly annoying that science documentaries and stuff have just become so, like, ubiquitous.

935
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,060
Because just everybody has...

936
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:51,880
I feel like starting in 2011, everybody started talking about like string theory and shit

937
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,940
if you ever talked to them for more than 30 minutes.

938
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,820
And it's just like, "Shut the fuck up, dude.

939
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:57,420
I want to play Minecraft."

940
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:02,300
The thing is, nobody actually knows anything about it because I mean, it's documented.

941
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:04,420
Interstellar ruined America.

942
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,980
It really did.

943
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:12,700
It started giving existential crises to like 29-year-olds.

944
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,700
You know what I mean?

945
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,900
until that point, like, just cared about space.

946
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,900
Yeah, they just cared about, like, Ron Paul.

947
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,780
And now they have to care about, like, black holes and shit.

948
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:22,280
Yeah.

949
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,140
And so now they start making experimental video games

950
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,620
where you walk around and do nothing.

951
00:48:27,620 --> 00:48:30,100
And at the end it's like, "Isn't life so lonely?"

952
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,380
Fuck you, dude.

953
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:34,100
I want to play-- make a Knights of the Old Republic 3.

954
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:34,420
Yeah.

955
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:37,300
I don't need another fucking gone-home, bullshit-ass,

956
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,820
I'm a lesbian simulator.

957
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:41,620
I want to play Postal 2, Animal Crossing crossover.

958
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,620
I want to play Postal 5.

959
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:44,620
Yeah.

960
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,580
I want to play Postal 5 and I want it to be VR.

961
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,860
And you can plug in your real gun.

962
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:50,860
Yeah.

963
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:54,620
And you don't have to use your computer and you can just go around your town and play.

964
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,620
Yeah, exactly.

965
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:57,940
You should be able to play Postal in real life.

966
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:03,580
What about one of those Minecraft in real life videos by Freddie Wong, but it's Postal

967
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,140
in real life.

968
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:11,260
You know that old thing that was like, "Tomorrow we're all going to go to McDonald's and ask

969
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,220
for the Fortnite burger, but it's like,

970
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,820
tomorrow we're all gonna go to McDonald's

971
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,060
and kill everyone there.

972
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,900
The look on their faces will be epic.

973
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,980
- Tomorrow we're all gonna go postal.

974
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,940
- Yeah, on postal day.

975
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,140
- When Barack Obama tweets this code word,

976
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,700
we're all gonna go postal on postal day.

977
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:27,900
- When we go one, we go all.

978
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:28,740
- That's right.

979
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,580
- Yeah.

980
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,660
- Yeah, I do, it does suck that,

981
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,060
I feel like starting this week,

982
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,580
movies, video games, TV, probably ruin forever.

983
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,900
- What do you mean?

984
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:43,580
probably i think i think there are i think everywhere is coming the fact that

985
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,780
they're like censoring the like

986
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:49,400
domes always sunny oh yeah so it's a sub i feel like it's all just gonna be the

987
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,440
same show which is fine

988
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,900
yeah whenever about it and and were forced so far away from like the air of

989
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,620
like the postal games

990
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,700
and it is just like we will take it as a we will never get that again they did

991
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,860
well they did recently just make that game was a cold hatred

992
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,360
uh... that's like a mass shooter game

993
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,420
on never mind i take it back america's so that was a twenty fifteen now but they

994
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,080
just ordered it to switch which is so funny

995
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,980
that's sick to player character is a misanthropic mass killer who begins a

996
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,440
quote genocide crusade to kill as many human beings as possible

997
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,380
mhm

998
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:28,600
uh... isometric shoot 'em up video it's rated a l

999
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,000
uh... okay

1000
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
the game was surely removed from valve steam green light service due to its

1001
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,780
extremely violent content but was later brought back with a personal apology

1002
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:43,920
from Gabe Newell. Oh my god. Whoa dude he got bullied by the mass shooter fans. Yeah.

1003
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,840
That's sick dude. I think it's it is so funny that that game is coming to Switch.

1004
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,880
I think that's probably the funniest game you can put on Switch. That is hilarious. Yeah. Yeah.

1005
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:56,780
Yeah we put we put. It's like what how do you think that there is any that that is

1006
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,520
like those are the furthest the Venn diagram where the circles are furthest

1007
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:06,120
from each other is owners of Nintendo Switches and people who want to commit genocide on

1008
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,120
the human race.

1009
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:10,360
Yeah, we put a copy of a Serbian film on a Tamagotchi.

1010
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,360
Yeah, exactly.

1011
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:14,000
We finally released it on Tamagotchi.

1012
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Yeah.

1013
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
Whoa, this is huge.

1014
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,920
We're going to make so much more money.

1015
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:23,080
Yeah, but they also, there will never be a Serbian film level movie again.

1016
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,760
It's like making an Evangelion condom.

1017
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,440
Yeah.

1018
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,440
you watch as Evangelion Love Sex.

1019
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,440
Exactly. It's a very good point.

1020
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,440
Yeah, but I don't know, man.

1021
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,440
I'm...

1022
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:39,440
We're never gonna get...

1023
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,440
Uh...

1024
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,440
We're never gonna get another jazz singer remake.

1025
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,440
I mean, the good thing about it is that

1026
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,440
the thing to remember about it is that

1027
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,440
corporations and people never learn.

1028
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,440
I mean, they'll just be back...

1029
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:53,440
As soon as the spotlight

1030
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:55,440
is off them, they'll just go back to doing fucked up

1031
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,440
shit again. Like, so...

1032
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:02,120
it's just gonna go back just to have like a bunch of people like protesting

1033
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,760
because a guy got fucking killed to death with a knee and being like you know we're

warning at the front like this it doesn't reflect so funny this doesn't

1037
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,880
reflect as if people were watching that being like this is what the hell this is

1038
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,120

- Yeah, and like really reckoning with it

1063
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,200
in a really real and traumatic way.

1064
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,040
- What happened, dude?

1065
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:55,060
SJWs they took over they took over cartoons. Yeah, I just want to watch teletypes. Ren and Stimpy?

1066
00:53:55,060 --> 00:53:58,840
Ren and Stimpy you're gonna deal with deal with two disabled people?

1067
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:03,380
We have two disabled, two horribly disabled dog people?

1068
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,080
That's really the kind of cartoon we have to watch now? Are you serious?

1069
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:15,500
Pinky and the Brain? Yeah. A really smart guy? Are you fucking kidding me?

1070
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:23,080
They're gonna have to cancel Pinky and the Brain because they're not gonna be able to find someone smart enough to realistically voice the brain

1071
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:28,660
Yeah, we had to cancel two Angry Beavers because we couldn't we found one Angry Beaver

1072
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:34,260
But we couldn't find two. And then he cheered up. Yeah, he got happy

1073
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:41,100
We and we thought it was we thought it was animal cruelty to just constantly have him be angry. Yeah, so it's

1074
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,460
Yeah, it's kind of sorry one of those

1075
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:52,540
Who is it Allison Brie voiced an Asian character in Bojack Horseman and then yeah, you're being like no, don't worry guys

1076
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:56,420
I had tape on my eyes the whole time. I was doing it. I was giving it I was

1077
00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:02,900
I was giving it an old college try. Yes do it as realistic as possible. Listen. I know I'm not I'm not Asian

1078
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:08,780
But that one's funny cuz Bojack did this thing. We're like all of their so they have like these

1079
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,660
identity

1080
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,060
These characters who have these identities that don't serve any purpose

1081
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,100
yeah because they thought they were like this will give us free brownie points

1082
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,900
but then people started calling them out for like why is why is like a sexual for

1083
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,700
no reason at all like it never comes up in the story yeah like one episode and

1084
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:32,580
then why do you have this like I don't know yeah yeah you have a pedophile

1085
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:38,100
voicing them yeah exactly every Hollywood actor is a pedophile whoa you

1088
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:45,700
Yeah.

1089
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,700
Um.

1090
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,700
What was I gonna say?

1091
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,060
Smurfed up on a Tuesday, baby.

1092
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:51,060
I'm smurfed up on a freaking Friday.

1093
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,260
I'm smurfed up on Freaky Friday.

1094
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:54,940
I switch with a smurf.

1095
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:57,420
What's the first thing you would do if you switch bodies with a smurf?

1096
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,660
Let's talk about this in the last four minutes.

1097
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,660
I'm gonna, I'm, huh.

1098
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,660
That's a really good question.

1099
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,220
And which smurf would you switch with?

1100
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:09,100
I think I would switch with the girl smurf, because she's the only girl.

1101
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:10,540
Because you want to be a girl?

1102
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:11,540
No.

1103
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,540
Yeah.

1104
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,300
that girl cuz also we don't we don't even know if she's like a girl like she just

1105
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:22,980
has long hair maybe she has a name is just smurf it maybe she has no no holes

1106
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:28,900
yeah I would I would switch with Gargamel and I would get rid of those

1107
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:33,980
smurfs once and for all yeah you would switch with Gargamel no I would switch

1108
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:38,580
with um you look I'm looking up list of some you would switch with baby smurf I

1109
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:42,580
I wouldn't. You would. I would say... Hey baby Smurf, grow the fuck up.

1110
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,580
It looks like there's a lot of girl Smurfs actually.

1111
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,580
Yeah, there's Cameron for example.

1112
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:51,580
Who the fuck, there's a guy named Hackis who's a white Smurf.

1113
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:56,580

00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,200
(Zachary laughs)

1147
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:55,740
Yo, he's on Squidward, bro.

1153
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:03,680
Yes.

1154
