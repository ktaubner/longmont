32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,920
Turn off this movie.

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,240
Please turn this movie off.

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,480
Turn the fucking movie off.

35
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Turn the movie off or I'm going to turn you off. I know where your button is.

36
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,480
Yeah, only Caleb knows where Patrick's button is.

37
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,480
I do know where his button is and I could push it.

38
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,480
Turn off the TV, Patrick.

39
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,480
I might flick your button if you're not careful.

40
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,480
Do not touch my button.

41
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,480
I might do it, too.

42
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,480
I might rub your button up and down until you turn off halfway.

43
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,480
He made it into a weird thing.

44
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
That's what you do to a computer.

45
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,480
You don't rub a computer's button.

46
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
Yeah, you do.

47
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,480
I've never rubbed a computer.

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:57,580
No, yeah, he did there's a girl computer you find the button and you fucking you you're right here. Yeah, fuck that button

49
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,120
Cuz it's okay. It's a girl

50
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,960
Yeah

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,280
Not okay for Patrick. There is a reason he's not weighing in on this one. That's true Patrick the idea of

52
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,200
Fucking a girl computer is just a step to our metric

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,840
That's beyond the pale a girl computer. Oh my god, it would never exist

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:22,200
Why yeah cuz it's sexism they won't make one. Mm-hmm. Yeah

55
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,860
When Siri scared of how power Siri came out a bit. Well Siri is a computer, but it's your phone

56
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,340
It's a computer. It's a girl. It's a guy computer, but they put a girl voice on it. Yeah, it's true

57
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,340
It's actually just a guy. It's like it's a

58
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,740
Kestrel, you know, it's so it's so messed up that

59
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:42,720
Girls don't even get full computers. They just get smaller phones. I

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,240
Know yeah

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:53,240
Yeah, it's seriously fucked up that when boys get to go on every website girls can only go on BuzzFeed and Netflix

62
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,560
I've literally never seen a girl use a tower PC in my life

63
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,760
Really? Yeah, they don't do it. I've seen girls use tower PCs. Yeah on the websites you look at it's pictures

64
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:12,840
Calm yeah, I bet you on the dark web computer. Calm the closest I've seen is I saw a girl accidentally use an alienware laptop

65
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,360
one time

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,520
Yeah, she thought that it was a big makeup palette and she opened it up, but it was a

67
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,360
computer and she started screaming because there was video games on it.

68
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,040
Because she saw the letters on the keyboard.

69
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,600
She saw the alien and she thought she was getting abducted.

70
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:36,680
She still thought it was a makeup palette, she thought it was a mirror, saw the alien

71
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,440
and said, "Oh my God, I'm an alien."

72
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,440
At first she thought she was watching that movie Paul. She thought that was on the screen.

73
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:50,400
And then she when she got she got more confused when she realized that it was

74
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,080
some sort of big phone. What was that movie Paul about? It's about an alien that

75
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:02,600
smokes weed? It's basically Ted with Paul. It's Ted with Paul. Okay. And he's British.

76
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:07,000
Just I'm imagining that. Or he's not British. No he's Seth Rogen. Simon Pegg is British in the movie.

77
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,400
I'm just imagining the pitch for that movie is just a guy going in.

78
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,520
It's like Ted but Paul.

79
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,720
It's Ted but Paul.

80
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,280
But he's Paul.

81
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,240
We're in.

82
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,080
Say no more.

83
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,160
Ted was huge for us.

84
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,800
And Paul came out before Ted.

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Well then Paul was Ted.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,160
Paul is Ted but with a guy.

87
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,960
Ted was Paul.

88
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,680
Which came out?

89
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,800
Paul is Ted with a guy.

90
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,440
Ted is Paul.

91
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,640
Hey Dougal, which came out first, Ted or Paul?

92
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,240
You put Dougal in your bedroom?

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,600
Yeah, and needed an alarm.

99
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:01,400
like a mouse that wakes up you stupid running the fat mouse from Cinderella

100
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,600
yeah he knocks over he knocks over a bunch of marbles and then my marbles

101
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,960
slowly some of the marbles go into different places and fall onto the

102
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
ground but one marble falls into another cup which falls over into like a banana

103
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,960
cream pie for some reason and then slaps you in the face. Sorry I was late for work this morning.

104
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,960
And then you wake up with my alarm clock back together.

Covered in pie. You have pie all over your face.

Pie all over your face and a huge boner.

107
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Sorry my alarm clock was acting up.

108
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,960
The Viagra pie got in my mouth.

109
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Paul came out one year before Ted.

110
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Whoa.

111
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
That's what the guy.

112
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,800
Mark Walker walked into Paul and he said "One year from now"

113
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,800
Holy crap! I'm gonna make this my movie!

114
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,300
Oh my god!

115
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300
I'm gonna make this a movie about a bear!

116
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,300
Ted is good.

117
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Ted, yeah. I haven't seen Ted.

118
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
I liked it when I was like a younger.

119
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,300
When you were a younger.

120
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Did you know that it was filmed around here?

121
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
Did you know they used an actual bear to film it?

122
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
And then they used CGI to turn it into a toy?

123
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
They actually killed the first Ted.

124
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
And then used a second Ted.

125
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
Yeah, and because they killed the first Ted

126
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:27,980
first

127
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:33,320
get married at I said I haven't seen Ted yeah I think so yeah there's like the

128
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:39,180
church in Cambridge giant old churches and yeah yeah I don't know if it's the

129
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,300
one in Cambridge or if it's the one like Arlington the one like in the

130
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:49,580
Arlington stop the church at the end of Ted well yeah I know that I know that

131
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,380
real-life church I don't I've never seen Ted well I said the third time I'm saying

132
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,640
I've seen Ted over. I know that you know that you know that church. No. I'm gonna

133
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,400
look up Ted's church. Near Copley. Oh it's that one. Oh yeah I know that. Yeah. Is it that one?

134
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,000
It might be that one. I don't know. I haven't seen Ted. That's the one next to the Arlington stop. Don't make me say it again.

135
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,040
Wait the one on the corner that's like the garden is right across. Yeah I think so.

136
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,800
That's the one. That's the one I'm thinking. That's the one next to the Arlington stop.

137
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,260
That might be the one from Ted. Whoa that's insane. So the church that we're thinking

138
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,440
about might be the one from Ted. Yeah. If you go there and you say show me Ted's church too.

139
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,880
If you say show me the Ted, they legally have to show it to you.

140
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,320
All right, I looked up Ted's church.

141
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,640
Nice. They're going to find some church in like Nashville.

142
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,160
I heard that Paul actually used the same church for the scene where Paul gets married to Ted.

143
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
In space, on a space church. But really, they didn't even use a real space church.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
They just cropped it out.

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,480
Yeah, they used Ted's church.

146
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,040
They used Ted Paul.

147
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,760
Oh, there's like film location tours of Boston.

148
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,480

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:40,560
But just so anybody was listening I had two microphones in my mouth and if

158
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,760
anybody's listening and it was really cool. Patrick always has to go fight his

159
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,400
cats in the middle of every episode and now he's walking towards me with his

160
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:56,920
with his cat's balls. Oh fuck I hate him dude. Why do you, you wonder why I hate him?

161
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,760
It's because you stick his nuts in his balls. That's not his fault, that's mine. He's a good guy.

162
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh I hate you, that's what it is. Yeah but you're the, you know. Why do you hate Yoda? I don't

163
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,600
know who that is. He's a kind soul. Is that the one whose balls were just in my face? Yeah. I

164
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,800
should have slapped him out of your ass. If he was like one iota less human

165
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,440
looking I would have slapped the shit out of him. He's back in the trash. Oh my god he's in the recycling.

166
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,520
Just let him eat it. Why would you think he would? No! You didn't let him eat the recycling. It's funny. You didn't close it. Why would you think he would

167
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,240
he would just not go in? He was going to recycling because it was full of cans. Triple microphone.

168
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,760
I used Cameron's that time too.

169
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:45,520
Okay. Did you close it this time? He's gonna get in. It's closed. He's gonna get in. He's not gonna get in.

170
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,560
Let's start the list.

171
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,920
Three, two, no.

172
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,600
Let's talk more about Ted and Paul.

173
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,080
Yeah.

174
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,720
Ted and Paul.

175
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,680
What if they made a movie where Ted and Paul meet?

176
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,640
Like Alien.

177
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:54,880
Yeah.

178
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
Whoever wins.

179
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
Whoever wins wins.

180
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,040
And they become best friends because they both love smoking weed.

181
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,480
They both love smoking weed.

182
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,400
And then Mark Wahlberg and Simon Pegg have to also fight.

183
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,560
Yeah, but then that's like a daddy's home situation.

184
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:10,960
Yeah.

185
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,320
Yeah, but instead of Will Ferrell, Simon Pegg.

186
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,920
And instead of Mark-- no, he isn't.

187
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,600
Yeah, instead of Mark Wahlberg, Mark Wahlberg.

188
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,200
Yeah.

189
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,280
Instead of Mark Wahlberg, Mark L. Wahlberg from Antiques Roadshow.

190
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,720
Mark L. Wahlberg.

191
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
That's the host of Antiques Roadshow.

192
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,800
His name is Mark Wahlberg?

193
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,160
His name is Mark L. Wahlberg.

194
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,760
He's the Spanish version of Mark Wahlberg.

195
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,560
Mark the Wahlberg.

196
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,880
Yeah.

197
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,880
It'd be pretty funny if they recast for-- they made Ted 3 and they recast.

198
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,760
They're like, "Oh, Mark Wahlberg doesn't want to do Ted 3. We're gonna get Mark L. Wahlberg."

199
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,320
Yeah.

200
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
Now, that would be a laugh to me.

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,840
I don't think I've ever seen Antiques Roadshow.

202
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,840
Really?

203
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,840
Yeah.

204
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
It's pretty fun to watch.

205
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,840
Do they just look at old stuff?

206
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,840
It's really bright.

207
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,840
Oh, it's the church.

208
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,840
It's the church by the Prudential Center.

209
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,840
Okay.

210
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Nice.

211
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,840
Yeah.

212
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,840
It's cool, man.

213
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,360
They just like, you know, they talk about like, "Oh, you can see in this painting.

214
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,120
Here's where you can tell how it's real."

215
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
It's pretty.

216
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,840
It's good just like spacing out TV.

217
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,240
I'm going to bring you on that.

218
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Okay.

219
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,760
Yeah, and they're going to be like, "You can tell this is a girl because of the penis."

220
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,760
This is worth $3 million.

221
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
This is worth $3 gazillion.

222
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
They play Ted.

223
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,760
They play, uh...

224
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,760
They play mini-golf at the Route 1 mini-golf place with the big dinosaur.

225
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Oh my god, no way!

226
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Did you know in Patrick's life-

227
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,760
They go to the landmark mini-golf place?

228
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
The place with the dinosaur?

229
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
You've seen it.

230
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Yeah, I know. That's why I-

231
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,760
I'm gonna fuck you up, man.

232
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,760
Why?

233
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,760
I just wanted to let you guys know about the filming location.

234
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
I haven't seen Ted!

235
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,760
Well, no, now once you watch it-

236
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:47,800
I would have recognized you can keep an eye out. Okay. Did you know they go to Pizza Planet and Toy Story?

237
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,680
Mm-hmm. I'm serious. Have you heard in the Spongebob movie? They open the Krusty Krab 2?

238
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,800
Fuck yeah, I do remember that. That doesn't happen. They do man. That's literally the opening scene.

239
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,800
Do you recognize? They go to the ocean in the Spongebob movie.

240
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,040
(laughter)

241
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,680
- Yeah, that's right.

242
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,280
They go to the bottom of the ocean.

243
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,520
You might recognize it.

244
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,360
We're doing a Spongebob tour.

245
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,560
- Dude, in Star Wars, they go to outer space.

246
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,600
- Yeah, it's fucked up.

247
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,200
- We're going on a Star Wars tour.

248
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,840
- Star Wars and Spongebob tour.

249
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,680
- Yeah.

250
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,500
- Yeah.

251
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,340
- Ground to air.

252
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,760
- You go up in a rocket that goes up in his base

253
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,440
and just falls into the ocean.

254
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,280
- Get to the ocean.

255
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,120
- Well, in the middle.

256
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,440
- They actually, they filmed Spongebob here.

257
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,480
They also filmed Finding Nemo here.

258
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,320
- Yeah, it's a Spongebob.

259
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,140
- And Jaws.

260
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,980
- It's a Spongebob, Jaws.

261
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,020
only filmed half of Jaws. Yeah, it's true. And most of Finding Nemo. In Jaws they go to the beach.

262
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:42,700
The beach. So the way that this tour works is you start at the beach, you go

263
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,220
into the water, then you go up into the sky where Airplane was filmed, and

264
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:55,340
then you go to space. And planes. And Top Gun. This is where Top Gun was filmed.

265
00:12:55,340 --> 00:13:01,500
and guardians of gahool part of this is where they film guardians of gahool

266
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:07,820
you know it's a sky I mean prove me wrong it'll be a hundred dollars and then well

267
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,420
they also filmed it in a tree yeah you go to the tree where the elves live and

268
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,060
then they go to the beach this is actually also the tree that bugs bunny

269
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,660
climbed in that one episode yeah I'm guessing there's an episode he climbed the tree

270
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,340
and then they go to the gym and the guys like yeah this is where I film my

271
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:29,220

It's true.

284
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,700
Nowadays they wouldn't let you do it.

285
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,020
This is actually the chair that they filmed.

286
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,020
Rip Torn's.

287
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
I don't know, just a chair.

288
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:31,020
What's the movie with a chair in it?

289
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,020
Men in Black.

290
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:35,260
This is the chair where they filmed Men in Black.

291
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,260
That one scene.

292
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,260
The white egg chair?

293
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,260
What?

294
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:39,980
The big white egg chair from Men in Black?

295
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,980
That thing's cool.

296
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,980
Yeah.

297
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,980
That's where Rip Torn sits.

298
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,980
I like those little...

299
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
A lot of sitting down.

300
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,980
I like the bug guy.

301
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,980
Yeah.

302
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:59,940
of the little guys yeah like a like Liz Warren posture yeah yeah yeah yeah

303
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,060
she's one of them she is she's tall alien oh fuck she's been lying about her

304
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,620
race and her species yeah what is he's an alien she's an alien mm-hmm yeah what

305
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:15,780
are those things called what the little bug aliens bug aliens men in black they

306
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,560
try to have sex with Rosario Dawson in Men in Black 2. Which would have been one of

307
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:27,060
the most all-time win. All-time best scenes. Yeah. This is my bedroom. What's weird about that scene is that

308
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:32,000
Will Smith makes Rosario Dawson stay at the apartment. They're called Neebles.

309
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,680
The Neebles apartment. He makes them stay there. Don't they look like Elizabeth Warren?

310
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,980
He makes them stay there and she like, and the whole time Will Smith is like, "Stay away from them."

311
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,540
This is from the Men in Black Wiki. "Neeble is a male worm and one of the four main

312
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:52,660
worms in the Men in Black series. Like the other worms, he is addicted to coffee and

313
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,140
is semi-perverted." Yeah, he said watch out for Neeble. So they're not Neebles,

314
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,580
they're just called worms. Oh, Neeble is one of the worms. Neeble is a worm.

315
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:06,940
Mm-hmm. Huh. There's an ad for online poker here. No need to hide your poker face. "The worms seem to love

316
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:12,540
coffee and are very energetic and even perverted." That's kind of a logical...

317
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,540
yeah coffee makes you perverted the worms are ruled by an emperor who is slightly

318
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,060
taller than the average one but is rather heavy set did they show that if

319
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,820
most if not all worms no I don't think so most if not all worms cannot drink any

320
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:32,420
coffee as it is considered a movie which is believed to be coffee cannot be grown

321
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,940
on their homeworld or coffee prices are extraordinarily high or exports of their

322
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,700
coffee are not that good worms tend to panic in times of crisis and are likely

323
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
to cry out rather than fight.

324
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,700
It's all that coffee. Makes you anxious.

325
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,700
The worms are not very good dressers, as when disguised as humans,

326
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,700
they show parts of their worm anatomy like toes or antennae

327
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,700
and can be a major issue

328
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,700
when on Earth and a headache for the men in black.

329
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
I feel like they do a pretty good job

330
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,700
if all you notice is the antennae

331
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,700
popping out of it.

332
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I wouldn't be like, "There's a worm in you."

333
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,700
They get their...

334
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,700
The worms are fleshed out in Men in Black,

335
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,700
the animated series.

336
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,700
That's where they see their emperor and stuff.

337
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,540
they do that when they do an animated series and just pick like like the group

338
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:15,260
of four things that are the same guy yeah just make the entire series about that

339
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,740
like whoa look at the emperor worm damn this is just a guy from Futurama I know

340
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,820

341
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:33,940
whatever Chris grob gris-grob gris-grob gris-grob Chris cross Chris cross

Chris Graub will make you jump, jump. Yeah. Daddy Mac will make you...

343
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:40,660
Junk. Junk, junk.

344
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,180
Junk, junk. What's the thing?

345
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,060
What if Futurama was live action? They could never.

346
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,860
I bet Leela would be even hotter in real life.

347
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,100
Okay. Who would you choose to play Leela?

348
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,580
I know who I would choose. Probably Leela.

349
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,500
I'd choose Leela. Probably choose Leela.

350
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,140
That's right.

351
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:04,420
How could I not find the name of this guy? And I got to his planet or whatever this is.

352
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,940
I got to this guy's planet and I couldn't even figure out his name.

353
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,940
It was Lurr. I hate when I get to a guy's planet and can't figure out the name of the guy.

354
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,440
Alright, let's do the list.

355
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,840
Wait, there's...

356
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:17,840
Let's read more about the Emperor Worm.

357
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,940
The Emperor Worm is the leader of the worms. Unlike the other worms, the Emperor is large and in charge.

358
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,940
It's so clear that this is written by like a middle school like this whole

359
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,740
wiki is written by a middle schooler. God damn it.

360
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,540
He is hugely fat and almost double the height of the worms.

361
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,540
Hugely fat.

362
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:36,040
He usually shows up unannounced to the men in black.

363
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:40,240
Here he usually brings two big cases which the agents always carry in.

364
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,640
The Emperor is careless and defenseless so the other worms must watch him.

365
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:47,740
He is also disappointed in the worms as coffee is only reserved for royalty.

366
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,840
He appears in the episode "The Big Bad Bug Syndrome" and "The Mine Mine Mine Syndrome".

367
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,440
he's a scenario like syndrome yeah i don't know

368
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,360
that'd be really if all of the

369
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,200
yeah it looks like it is every episode is something syndrome

370
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,740
let's look

371
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,700
because i just saw one second

372
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,000
because i clicked on this look

373
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,380
the doggy dog syndrome the jack-o-lantern syndrome

374
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,880
what the hell

375
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,900
that's smart you gotta add here for the goo goo dolls on tour

376
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,880
whoa we should go yeah we should go why is every because you're a baby

377
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,920

378
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:32,240
that no i like the songs i like the song iris no you don't every single episode is how many

379
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,680
fucking episodes i think that was only on for like one like 50 something what if it's not looks like

380
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,240
it was on for three seasons so if it's not called syndrome it's just whatever like little kid who's

381
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,080
like he's like editing the men in black wiki who has a syndrome they had an episode called the end

382
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,400
Game Syndrome and it was two parts. Looks like Avengers copied somebody.

383
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,520
Avengers, they were gonna call it End Game Syndrome. They were gonna call it Infinity Syndrome and End Game

384
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,160
Syndrome. But then they found out about the real Infinity Syndrome and thought it would be

385
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:05,480
insensitive. Yeah. So they took out, they took out all the syndrome. Yeah. So they

386
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,960
just called it Infinity. Oh my god. They were like, that's not, there's nothing to it like that. No, Syndrome from Incredibles.

387
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,840
He was gonna be in it. He was gonna be in it. He was gonna be in it. That's Thanos. Holy crap.

388
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,520
- Yeah, and he was gonna get, yeah,

389
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,440
and he was gonna fight Mr. Incredible.

390
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,000
- And the Emperor Worm was gonna be fat in the movie.

391
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,240
- The Emperor Worm was gonna be fat,

392
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,080
and he was gonna be twice the size.

393
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,080
- Oh my God, he was gonna be the Hulk.

394
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,920
- Yeah.

395
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,080
- SpongeBob was gonna be the Emperor Worm.

396
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
SpongeBob was gonna play Robert Downey Jr.

397
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
in Sherlock Holmes' Game of Shadows,

398
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,200
but Rocco, from Modern Life,

399
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,240
he ended up in Rocco's Modern Life instead.

400
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,480
- Yeah, it's super annoying whenever they do recasts.

401
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,840
I hate when they do reshoots of all my favorite movies

402
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,960
right before they come out and you see all the cool yeah cuz I was absolutely

403
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:49,920
certain that Sullivan the frog would have been in Avengers endgame I thought

404
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,520
apparently they cut out all the scenes right before it came out they cut I was

405
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,480
convinced you would have literally major story there is literally a part of a

406
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,080
majors in game where they went to planet hamster and they cut out food in your

407
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,160
jacket they cut out the entire thing no and what the hell's going on over there

408
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,680
Just leave him alone. Just think about something else.

409
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:17,400
He's eating a bag. He's holding on... oh it's because Dom's lunch box is in there.

410
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:27,920
These things have cat-like reflexes. They're cats. Oh now you're all shy.

411
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,720
Whenever I see a plot hole in a movie I'm like oh this is clear evidence

412
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
evidence they cut Planet Hamster out of this one too.

413
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
They cut out Planet Hamster.

414
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,440
One of the actors looked into the camera and tried to tell the public the truth about the

415
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,160
incoming hamster asteroid and Evil Hollywood cuts it out.

416
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,840
Evil Anti-Hamster Hollywood creates propaganda.

417
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah.

418
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:56,760
There was a whole scene, or a whole arc of the love story between Mary the marsupial

419
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,600
and the Hungry Hamster and they trashed it because they thought it wouldn't do well in China with the

420
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:08,520
whole Hong Kong protest going on. Yeah. They thought it wouldn't sell because Marcy the Marsupial is

421
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:16,840
Chinese. Yeah. And Taiwanese. And Hungry Hamster is Taiwanese, she's Chinese,

422
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,160
mainland Chinese and they thought that... They have a love story. Yeah, and they thought that

423
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,160
that it would just bomb overseas.

424
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,160
They thought it would end the conflict and they have a stake in chaos.

425
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,160
Yeah, exactly.

426
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,160
They thought that this scene would be so pure that the protest would end.

427
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:36,160
But they needed that because they're part of the prison industrial complex.

428
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,880
Which, yeah, it was strange because then the hungry hamster did become like a symbol of

429
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,660
revolution in the Hong Kong protests.

430
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,660
Exactly.

431
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:49,500
wearing hungry hamster masks and and throwing acorns at the cops.

432
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:13,860
Just big acorns. You may kill one of us but you will never defeat all of us. Yeah. We are

433
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:26,000
hamster, we are hungry. We are the hamsters. We are hungry. So the list today is the top

- Whoa, yeah. - Today, no, I do eat candy.

490
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:22,660
- You're on probation.

491
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,740
- I was thinking today, it's,

492
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,660
my teeth have been hurting a bunch recently,

493
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,860
and I realized that that is actually--

494
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,540
- That's 'cause you haven't been eating enough candy.

495
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,540
- Exactly, it's a sign that you need to eat,

496
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:37,020
that you have been eating not enough candy.

497
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,860

551
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:34,140
lost their lives today. If only the World Trade Center had gone down into its

552
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:46,220
shell and then popped back up and bit off the plane's nose. Man that's

553
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,220
That's a crazy scene.

557
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,220
Oh yeah, he's dressed as shit.

558
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:03,220
When I was a kid, I watched that scene and I was like, "You had to dig so far down to

559
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:05,220
pretend to be a pile of shit on the ground."

560
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,220
The ultimate disguise.

561
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Yeah.

562
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,220
I like the one where he's like, "You got a tiny wiener and some little nuts?"

563
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,220
Yeah.

564
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,260
you got a tiny wiener and some little nuts.

565
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Yeah.

566
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
And then he does the back flips.

567
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,260
Yeah.

568
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260

569
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,260
Oh my God.

570
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Let's just remember this movie.

571
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,260
It's so funny, dude.

572
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:28,940
So, the first scene in the movie is when James Brolin is disguised as--

573
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
His brother.

574
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,940
Yeah, he's-- no, it's his father.

575
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,940

Yeah, and he's disguised as Bo Derek.

577
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,460

590
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,080
He would have just made it up. We could have just let him just keep going and then just like

591

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:53,440
Like a Kurt Russell from Hateful Alien. Yeah. Spits in a spittoon.

665
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,760
We don't have a spittoon. Where did that sound come from? He spits onto your nephew.

Well, he'll do just fine. He'll do just fine.

718
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,500

00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,780
You're totally bacteria-ing that thing right now.

806
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,780
You're a serious dodo, man.

807
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,780
Hey, man, you just grew some legs.

808
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:11,900
serious fish with your fish with legs that's how old I am you ever heard of

809
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:16,940
the Big Bang that's what I did the number eight the veiny that's not a shape

810
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,060
that's an attribute it could be a shape if it's veiny enough my penis is I'm

811
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:26,340
thinking the scene in scanners when they fight oh yeah the veins like explode out

812
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:29,420
of them yeah and they're that's what I'm yeah yeah that's what I'm imagining for

813
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:32,260
veiny do you know what I'm talking about can I've never seen so let me pull the

814
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,980
picture. Scanners is so good. Scanners is awesome. I prefer. I saw scanners. I had to see scanners

815
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,340
for uh. You had to? Yeah. You had to? I had to see it for film one. I had to go see it

816
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:46,660
on 35 millimeter. God I hate school. I hate film. I hate Emerson. So glad I'm done with

817
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,460
that shit. Yeah I don't think I'm going back. I'm working as a personal chef now. Look they

818
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:55,920
get their veins like this. Yeah. See this? That's what happens to their veins. That's

819
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,140
what the veiny shape would look like. I've seen some veiny penises man. I feel like there's

820
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:05,520
a there's a pretty direct like the bigger your penis is the more veiny it is.

821
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,940
And your penis's eyes go white.

822
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:10,240
And you have big white eyes on your penis.

823
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:14,320
I do think honestly it sucks.

824
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:21,620
I think if anything if you the thing that makes me laugh the most is seeing balls with googly

825
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:23,700
eyes on them.

826
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:29,000
Like that's funnier to me than like any written piece of comedy that anybody can ever produce

827
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
is if like a guy walks in

828
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:31,500
I don't even need to know him

829
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,500
a guy walks in

830
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,500
walks into your house

831
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,000
balls through his zipper

832
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
tears down the door

833
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
yeah, yeah, kicks it down like Hagrid

834
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
you're scared, you're sitting there fucking scared

835
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
cause you're like what the fuck is going on

836
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
actually now that I think about it, it is Hagrid from Harry Potter

837
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
it is Hagrid

838
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
it's Hagrid and he has two

839
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
he kicks it down, these are my balls Harry

840
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
and he shows you the balls with googly eyes

841
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:54,000
I put these googly eyes on with a spell Harry

842
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
yeah, cause I'm big

843
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
I glued them to my penis with a spell

844
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
These are my balls, Harry.

845
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Is that what he sounds like?

846
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,000
No, I don't remember what he sounds like.

847
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,000
You're a wizard, Harry.

848
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,000
You're a wizard!

849
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
These are my balls, Harry. You're a wizard.

850
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
You're a wizard, Harry.

851
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
Excuse me, Harry Potter.

852
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
But Hagrid, I don't want to go to school.

853
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Shut up!

854
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,000
These are my balls!

855
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,000

856
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Get on my motorcycle!

864
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:32,020
Number 10, the one that requires a magnifying glass. Not a shape. There's a lot of...

865
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:36,100
Talk about, that sounds like a Harry Potter book. There's a... Harry Potter and the one

866
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,820
that requires a magnifying glass. Harry Potter and... My penis is small, Harry. This is a

867
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:46,620
comment right here. Coming from a tall Chinese boy, I am sad to say that I am one of those

868
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:52,540
few people whose height is not proportional to their length. I am following my idol's footsteps"

869
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:53,500
- oh, this is -

870
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,140
Yeah.

871
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,060
Yeah, why didn't you read ahead before you read that?

872
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:56,300
Yeah.

873
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:56,860
What does he say?

874
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:01,900
"Following in my idol's footsteps, Caitlyn Jenner, by coming out to the world,

875
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,220
telling everyone my biggest insecurity in life."

876
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,100
Pat can't read ahead of -

877
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:05,980
He can't read one word.

878
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:06,700
No, I can't.

879
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,940
He sees one word at a time. It's like -

880
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,380
Well, now I got to finish the comment.

881
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,580
Now you do. Go for it.

882
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:11,740
Yeah.

883
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:11,740
Ugh.

884
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:18,260
This is also definitely by the same person who said earlier that they're Filipino.

885
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:19,260
Make up your mind, kid.

886
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:22,780
Are you Chinese or are you Chinese?

887
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:27,580
I am hoping that I receive the same recognition in terms of bravery just like her.

888
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,620
Kendall Wu, New Zealand.

889
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,020

Oh my god.

904
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,540
To get into like internet memes and I feel like I wonder what this guy's other music

905
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:38,540
sounds like.

906
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:39,540
Yeah.

907
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,540
This is great.

908
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:41,540
The hits are great.

909
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,540
Let me check out his other work.

910
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:43,540
Yeah.

911
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:44,540
God you're weird.

912
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:47,620
There was one it sounds like he's saying buy Banilu Pork and I guess there's a brand called

913
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,620
Banilu Pork.

914
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:51,900
And they used it in their commercials I heard.

915
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:52,900
Yeah.

916
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:53,900
And now that guy's a millionaire.

917
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:54,900
He's dead.

918
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:55,900
He's dead.

919
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:56,900
Yeah he died in 2013.

920
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,900
Wow.

921
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:58,900
I don't care.

00:52:58,900 --> 00:52:59,900
I don't even know that.

923
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,900
I don't know that.

924
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:01,900
I don't know.

925
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:02,900
Come on.

926
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:03,900
Dude, you're funny.

You never learned like math but you know this shit.

928
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:10,780
No, I don't know math but I can tell you like stupid shit like that.

929
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,660
Number 11 is the we dot.

930
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,740
We have another comment from that same guy.

931
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:18,060
Coming from a tender Filipino boy.

932
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,580
I'm not reading the rest of it.

933
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,060
Why did you read the first?

934
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,820
Why did you read the beginning of it?

935
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:23,820
I don't know.

936
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:24,820
Then, I don't know.

937
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,820
Read the rest of it.

938
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:26,820
You have to read the rest of it.

939
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:27,820
You have to read the rest of it.

940
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:29,820
You literally, I said it was from the same guy.

941
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:34,680
still every time you start one you have to finish it's a podcast about this rule

942
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:40,920
coming from a dad well I can veto it if it no you can't we have we veto we can

943
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,240
be to your coming from a tender Filipino boy who has had many a good time

944
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:52,880
exploring various penis shapes I give my endorsement to the weed dot as that the

945
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,840
weed dot has a distinctly more fragrant and mellow flavor than the rest similar

946
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:03,600
to that of old underwear. That was pretty good. That was pretty funny. That one's funny. The

947
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,680
last one wasn't. Kendall Wu. Fuck you, Kendall Wu. You make me look like an asshole. Yeah,

948
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,080
Juge is our friend. Yeah, Juge. Juge, we'll take you to Jollibee. Juge, you're the cool guy of the

951
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,560
I'll get you the sir bucket.

952
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,560
I usually will give you a tuna pie and you can fuck it.

953
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:34,640
Wait, I earlier, I want to find the list earlier, before we started recording I did find a list

954
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,920
called the worst things that a Filipino can say to you.

955
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,920
Oh my god.

956
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:40,920
There was one.

957
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:41,920
There's one that I want to read.

958
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,480
Number three is "ha, hot dog."

959
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:47,280
The rest of them are just Filipino words.

960
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,280
And the last one is "bobo."

961
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,920
I just want to share that real quick.

962
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,640
Top ten annoying and most worst things Filipinos can say to you.

963
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,560
All right, back to the list. Number 12 is the inverted.

964
00:54:57,560 --> 00:54:58,520
That's a vagina.

965
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:00,120
Yeah, that's called a vagina.

966
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,760
One comment.

967
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,960
I thought it was called a vagina when I was little. I thought it started with a B.

968
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:07,320
One comment with eight votes and it says, "Okay, that's it. I'm done."

969
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:12,040
Yeah, this is where I draw the line. Talk about Tic-Tac-Dicks and Eiffel Towers all you want,

970
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:16,040
but think about an invisible, invert-a-dible penis.

971
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,200
No.

972
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,600
Number 13. Well, you can't skip the classics.

973
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,840
Okay, go ahead. Read them.

974
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:30,280
the chode. Da chode. And the only comment says fat penis. Wow. Yeah. No, keep going. Read. You can't

975
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,120
skip the classics. I have a big one. That's it. Okay, keep going until I get to the one I wanted

976
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:38,680
to say. Well, there's only one classic. I wanted to say 16. So you say. Okay, say 16. How was he

977
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:42,760
supposed to know which one you wanted to say? Yeah. I sent it to him with my mind. No, you didn't.

978
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:49,960
Yeah, I did. You have no. Number 16 is the circular. And the comment says, whoever mad this

979
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:55,160
was probably high. Yeah. The circular is just a chode though. No. No, it's like a flat,

980
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:59,000
a two-dimensional chalk zone penis. It's not, it's yeah. I would rather have that. You'd

981
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:04,160
have a chalk zone penis? Because you can fold it up like an umbrella. No, no, it's like

982
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,160
Ken doll with a circle drawn on. Well, that's not, that's cheating. That's not cheating.

983
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,440
What do you mean that's cheating? I don't know. Are you guys not cheating? I don't know,

984
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:17,360
it just feels like cheating because I had a good solution and then you guys changed it.

985
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,200
- And then you guys changed it.

986
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,280
- He saw the really small penis and he said,

987
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,120
that's cheating.

988
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:20,960
- That's seriously cheating.

989
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:23,600
- Hey, you're not allowed to have one that looks like that.

990
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,120
- You don't get to have sex, that's cheating.

991
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:28,680
- No, I think I would take a circular chode

992
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:31,800
that I could bring up, bring into an umbrella shape.

993
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:32,640
- Number 18.

994
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,520
- And then fuck a guy with it.

995
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:35,360
- Number 18, I--

996
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,200
- No, I mean a girl.

997
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,920
- Whoa, wait a second.

998
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,680
- We got two good clips of Caleb in this episode.

999
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,880
- I would fuck a girl with her penis.

1000
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:44,240
Fuck a guy in his vagina.

1001
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,720
- I would fuck a girl's circle.

1002
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,160
- I would have sex on a--

1003
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,160
I would touch my circle to whatever.

1004
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,160
I would put a magnet on my circle.

1005
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,160
Honestly dude, I'd put my thingy anywhere that the fucking cows roam.

1006
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,160
I'll just throw it anywhere.

1007
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:00,160
Number 18 is the slinky coil.

1008
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:04,160
But I first misread it as the stinky coil.

1009
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,160
Now that's a terrifying thought.

1010
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:11,160
The idea of a coiled pig tail penis that smells like sulfur.

1011
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:14,160
Like a pig's ass.

1012
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,520
smells like a pig's ass. It smells like a pig's ass and also it has a little sort of curly...

1013
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,000
It smells like a pig's ass and it's covered in pig's shit.

1014
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,480
Yeah. And it's a pig's penis. And who knows where it's been.

1015
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,280
What does a pig's penis look like? It's like corkscrew.

1016
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,400
Why don't you look down? Fatass.

1017
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,560
AHHHHH! Gotcha you fucking...

1018
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,880
GOD! You piggy, piggy oink oink.

1019
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,960
You are the piggy oink oink. No you are.

1020
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,400
What do we got on Patreon? I'm trying to pull it up.

1021
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,480

00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:49,680

1026
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:11,240

1027
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:18,280
skateboarder named Gilbert Crockett. I just kept saying "Gilbertoo Crockaka".

1028
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:23,760
I don't remember where we left off. Yeah. Was this the last one we did? I remember I'm smart. Maybe?

Ten dollar patron. He edited his patron to five dollars. We should say we are like

1038
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:21,420
we're gonna do the Master Chief calls that we have to do. Yeah so we're gonna change the

1039
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,200
ten dollar tier because it's just we're all very busy and we do not get to do the

1040
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,960
Master Chief calls. If you're currently in the ten dollar tier you can you'll get

1041
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,720
your Master Chief call, well... But we're gonna change it to something better. We're gonna

1042
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:36,520
change it to something better soon. We just have busy lives. It's hard to get all three of us in a room.

1043
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:42,960
And also you. Yeah. I mean we could theoretically do them after episodes. And Master Chief too. Master Chief is also...

1044
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:49,880
Master Chief is incredibly good. The thing is that what people didn't realize is that there's been a new wave of

1045
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:55,520
Covenant that have been fighting the Galaxy. That's why we have to change it. So we have to

1046
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:02,920
change it yeah and then mr. 911 yeah we hope it's not one you know mr. 911

Do it, please. It's easy.

1064
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,040
I know it's easy, but I have to get my laptop out. I have to find my DVD burner.

1065
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:33,760
I have to get the disc.

1066
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,160
I have to open my eyes. I have to take the way insecutive press in my hands.

1067
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,760
I'm unemployed. I have to get out of bed.

1068
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:43,680
First of all, I wake up at lunchtime. I got to eat lunch.

1069
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:45,040
You do. Because you wake up at lunchtime.

1070
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,120
And then you have to throw up because you ate one extra bite of a sandwich that you didn't mean to.

1071
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:49,520
Exactly.

1072
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:51,760
That happened because I was sick.

1073
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:57,280
I told you that in confidence, motherfucker.

1074
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,560
I wasn't referring to that.

1075
01:01:58,560 --> 01:01:59,280
Oh.

1076
01:01:59,280 --> 01:01:59,680
You just--

1077
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:01,360
I told you about that though.

1078
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:03,280
Yeah, I couldn't eat lunch.

1079
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,320
I tried to eat.

1080
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,520
I think it might have just been the bread.

1081
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,240
That was God's curse on you for talking ass about breakfast, dude.

1082
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,040
Dude, I got--

1083
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:14,160
The ham and egg God just fucking struck you down with fervor.

1084
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:16,240
No, I got real good cold cuts and ham.

1085
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,760
Sam from Green Eggs and Ham.

1086
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,280
I got good cold cuts.

1087
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,280
I got pancetta, I got salami, I got prosciutto.

1088
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,280
I got provolone in there.

1089
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,280
I made like a real good sandwich.

1090
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,280
Real good cold cut combo.

1091
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,280
And I just like...

1092
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:34,280
Dude, I'm gonna go cold cut combo on your nuts right now.

1093
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:36,280

01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,280
Yeah, we're trying to finish that.

1095
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,280
