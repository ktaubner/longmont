27
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,640
Guys, and as your host, I would like to, at the top,

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,640
Caleb is gonna regale us with an awesome apology

29
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,640
to his friend Rex.

30
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,640
For what?

31
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,140
Why?

32
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,140
Why would I apologize to Rex?

33
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,940
You tortured him by telling him the wrong time and he ran and he's so tired.

34
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,940
Look, he's still wearing his jacket.

35
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:06,940
He just-

36
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,940
I did literally run directly from outside.

37
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,440
I didn't torture anybody.

38
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
You told him to run.

39
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,940
You told me 6 o'clock on the dot.

40
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,440
I think I said right around 6 o'clock I said.

41
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,440
I think those are the exact words.

42
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:21,940
Rux ran-

43
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,940
Which is 2 or 3 minutes on either end.

44
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,440
You didn't have to run.

45
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:29,840
You did not have to run. Let's see, let's pull up the record because we actually have these.

46
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,240
Okay, I did say right at six. So yes, I would like to issue an apology.

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,040
I would like to issue a full apology to my friend Rex. Rex, tell me before you get into your mirror,

48
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:49,200
tell me what is this huge man looming in the background of your life?

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,720
Take a look here. It's Chinese Patrick.

50
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,840
Is a friend of yours?

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,240
This is a, it's a TikTok screenshot I found when I was looking for a new background.

52
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,240
Cause my room is messy and I didn't like the background.

53
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,840
It really kinda does look like Patrick, man.

54
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,840
That is Patrick's face.

55
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,240
Pat owns that beanie?

56
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
Yeah.

57
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,240
Wow.

58
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,240
That's Chinese Patrick.

59
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,240
Well, that's pretty impressive.

60
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,240
Well, that's pretty impressive.

61
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Chinese Patrick.

62
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Is that his username on TikTok?

63
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,160
I don't think so.

64
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,280
Let's go beer.

65
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Let's get into beer.

66
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,080
I um, I have a really bad beer this week.

67
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,720
I honestly guys I did not I did not want any alcohol

68
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,720
I had alcohol last couple nights, and I've been eating my against zero time. Oh another Heineken zero guys

69
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:52,000
As well he can't drink any beer guys come on I'm running out of laundry

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,320
I'm having a bad day. Okay, I already told

71
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,880
Rex my dog is vomiting up yellow

72
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:05,440
Yellow disgusting the same time a almost to the minute two days in a row like 4 55 p.m

73
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,440
He has vomited up two yellow puddles and the first time dogs vomit a lot

74
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,320
So or not a lot, but every once in a while, there's vomit randomly

75
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,840
And so I didn't worry about it too much and then this time same exact time

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,640
So now I gotta take him to the vet tomorrow. Do are you feeding him poop?

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,880
That was also my question.

78
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,880
That's exactly what Rex asked.

79
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,880
Again, no.

80
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Again, no.

81
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,120
He's not eating poop.

82
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,760
He's not eating anything yellow even.

83
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,840
He did, two days ago, get about a teaspoon of bolognese off the ground, which really

84
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,720
pissed me off because I spent a long time working on that for people, human people,

85
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
not a dog.

86
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
No, it was on the ground.

87
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,560
I don't think you can serve bolognese to people from the ground

88
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,480
Here's the thing Rex you would never know I

89
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,640
Would if you come over to my house and I make bolognese and I put in one

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,240
Teaspoon falls on the ground and I and your portion is one teaspoon short

91
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:05,320
You're giving me first of all

92
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,640
You are a fucking ground bolognese. I spent the whole time making the food. I'm at your house. How is that my fault?

93
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,360
You're serving me literal ground food. It's not your fault. You're not paying for anything

94
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:22,280
I paid for all the ingredients. I will if there's a dog hair on one of the bowls, you are getting the dog hair

95
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,520
I'm picking up a bottle of wine on the way

96
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
This is ridiculous. I already got bottles of wine.

97
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,520
You're treating me like shit. You're treating me like your fucking dog.

98
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,040
You want to come over next week? Sure, I'd love to.

99
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,360
Okay, I have a follow-up question. Maybe he hasn't been eating poop or anything yellow. Has he been been eating anything

100
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,640
red and green combination type shit two different things

101
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
things.

102
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,240
Oh yes, he's been eating cherries and uh...

103
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,240
Lettuce.

104
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,240
Lettuce.

105
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,240
Right.

106
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,920
And, so I guess that would make yellow.

107
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,240
No bitch, he eats fucking brown pebbles.

108
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:04,680
That's all he eats is pebbles that are this big.

109
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,520
Rachel Ray makes these pebbles.

110
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:11,040
Well when brown is in a dog's stomach it turns yellow.

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
This is true.

112
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,040
Wait, what's that?

113
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,840
What's that? Can you explain this for me please?

114
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,320
When brown is in a dog's stomach...

115
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,080
I want to learn about this process.

116
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,360
I want to learn about this process.

117
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,680
When a chestnut of a dog burns brown into yellow...

118
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
Can we get to your beers?

119
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
I don't want...

120
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,840
This is all I've had to think about all day is if my dog is dying and what colors he ate

121
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,920
and what colors are coming back out of him.

122
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,000
So I need to hear from you two what colors you are drinking right now.

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,400
Well I have elected as the best beer in the world

124
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Beer?

125
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Beer.

126
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
I have a-

127
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Woah!

128
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,120
You scared me man.

129
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
Turn that background off.

130
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,120
I don't care.

131
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,160
I feel like there's going to be a bad reveal once we take this head away.

132
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,720
Some sort of insane mess.

133
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
I saw his mess.

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,160
Oh, it's just a pile of clothes.

135
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Okay.

136
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Yeah.

137
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,160
I have a-

138
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
White elephant.

139
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,160
The Belgian Tremends.

140
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Okay.

141
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,160
And it says it's...

142
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Can you see this? Elected as the best beer in the world.

143
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Whoa!

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Democratically elected? I don't remember being involved.

145
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,160
I didn't vote.

146
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,160
So we're gonna see.

147
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,160
We're gonna see if this is the best beer in the world.

148
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,160
Yep, that's beer.

149
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
It's okay.

150
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:44,480
a 5 out of 10 beer. Is it the best in the world? I have a new idea, okay? Okay. So give it a

151
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:52,360
number rating first of all. Go ahead. Yeah, that's like a 5, 5 and a half out of 10. Okay,

152
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:59,160
so now we are going to skip over basketball. Because this beer was supposedly elected, give

153
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:07,100
me an elected official that this beer most resembles in flavor.

154
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,040
It's Joe Biden because I can barely remember what it tastes like after I drink it.

155
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,920
Damn. So that's a turd sandwich I would call that.

156
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:23,440
Yeah. It's a completely average, just, you know it's beer, it tastes like beer, you can't

157
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,160
remember a single thing that's happened about the beer or any features about it.

158
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,160
the

159
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,160
the

160
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,200
I can't vote for a sober man. Well, you're sober so you wouldn't vote for yourself. Do not sober

161
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:57,600
That's a sober beer. That's sober because I want to have something for the show. So you are sober here

162
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,600
I'm sober at the moment

163
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,780
Okay, I won't be in

164
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,240
eight hours

165
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
So

166
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,440
hours I don't know but I can feel it I probably wake up and go get a beer okay

167
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,040
at 2 in the morning all right well I'm gonna go next and I'm gonna I actually

168
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,640
brought a beer that I've been talking about for a while on the stream and I

169
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:31,320
think on the show which is a a carta blanca a carp blanch this is it has a

170
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,800
bit of a red stripe look to it it's a it's a regional beer it's one of the

171
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,200
oldest most popular beers in the region here. This is a Acaiwamita which Acaiwam is like

172
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,200
a like a like a 40 ounce 40 but this is the the small version of that so this is a

173
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:56,040
less than that. 12 ounce? Maybe I don't know I'm not sure. Anyways this is a cute little beer it's

174
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:03,960
beer that all the poor people drank until it got gentrified so now you can get it at expensive

175
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:17,480
the

176
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:31,160
and

177
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:38,160
right

178
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:48,080
means

179
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:58,000
now

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I have a reason. I was just at the supermarket. I did the buy on your phone and pick it up at the parking lot thing.

181
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I was on my phone and I was looking at Twitter. Apparently he can't remember anything. He can't remember his name anymore.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That is not a problem to me.

183
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Okay.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
He is like the prevent defense of presidents.

185
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,480
I mean, yeah, what is a president goes...

186
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,800
The president, the only reason the president exists is for us to have the battle every couple

187
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,480
years and so the kind of the crazier somebody is, the funnier the battle is.

188
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,880
So I'm looking forward to the battle of 2024 very much so.

189
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:50,440
Yeah, but what I'm saying as a person on the outside is, why not, why just being two old,

190
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:53,760
the oldest white guys in the world, why not the two youngest babies in the world?

191
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,200
to bring race into this, huh? Yeah. The two youngest babies in the world. Okay, and do

192
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,800
you care if they're white or not? You seem obsessed with the fact that it's white, old

193
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:10,000
white guys? It's more the age thing. Okay, reverse racism. We should see whose balls are

194
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,200
saggier. That's who should get to be the president. With the babies? That is really strange. You

195
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,560
think they should take the babies? Why are you saying that? Because it's very odd, man.

196
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,560
the old white man on the dot.

197
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,920
Well you said that after he said the baby thing.

198
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
I said the baby thing.

199
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,920
We should see who has balls that are staggered.

200
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,040
We were discussing the baby thing and you were like I want to look at them.

201
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,040
The balls.

202
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,040
Alright.

203
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
And oh I should be the judge.

204
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,040
Yeah I'm right.

205
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
I should be the judge.

206
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,400
I should see which ones look better and taste better.

207
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
No no no no no.

208
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Why?

209
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,600
You're nasty man.

210
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,480
Ok so what's going on this week guys?

211
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Let's get into it.

212
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,240
What's happened since, first of all I miss you guys.

213
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,260
I miss you too. I feel like you know, it'll explain thing in rope on having you

214
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,800
Can we talk about that?

215
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,600
Damn we just broke up the news like that. Yep

216
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:09,960
And I'm playing a I it was originally for persona now I'm playing a much much worse game

217
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,840
Which actually okay

218
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,040
so I played the first one right and I was like this is really like stupid and clearly is made for like

219
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,200
14 year olds, but it's kind of funny. So I like it and I like the mystery stuff

220
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,340
Even though it's all really predictable I get to the second one now all of a sudden this is a game for pedophiles. I'm completely

221
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:36,160
Like I am not going to listen I got to solve the mystery though, so I

222
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:43,540
All the whole mystery and then I am out of there after the third one

223
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,440
And then I will really be out and I'm not playing any of the spin-offs. Okay, maybe I'll watch some

224
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,400
Let's plays on YouTube just this make sure the mysteries get solved. So it seems

225
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:57,940
It seems we were in the chat are in the know it seems that Rex is really in the know

226
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:04,620
I have never heard anything past the name for this game. So you really have to explain what you mean with those two statements

227
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,200
okay, the first one is just kind of

228
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,820
very the kind of convoluted writing that you expect from like

229
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:21,540
a lot of like Japanese stuff like like TV shows and shit where if you get past

230
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,820
like the first season or second season or whatever it just kind of gets really

231
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:28,700
crazy and has a million twists and all this shit and it's kind of fun

232
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,540
I kind of like that aspect of that shit but then the second one is like

233
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,800
every single it's divided into chapters and there's one character they're all

234
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,360
high schoolers there's one character that every single chapter like falls on the

235
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:50,840
ground it has her and it has her full ass exposed and that is it always factors

236
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:57,800
into the mystery somehow wait is that true yeah in the first in the first

237
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:04,560
thing there's a there's a there's a part where like the lights go out and then

238
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,000
this this fucking one character like falls over and her ass and her ass and pussy is

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:15,280
like out and then they're like where were you during the during the murder and one guy's

240
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:18,620
like oh I was in the room and they're like okay so what happened he's like well nothing

241
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,840
happened and they say you have to have been the murderer because you would have said that

242
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:29,300
you liked seeing her asshole and that's like how the murder gets solved. Wait, wait. It's

243
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
Bizarre man

244
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,820
Yeah, so I don't really know how I'm feeling about this one, right?

245
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:40,620
And again, this is Rex's recommendation and he said specifically he gets to be a text. I played the first one

246
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,420
He said do the first one's good, but the second and third one are the best

247
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:52,260
Yeah

248
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,100
so

249
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,100
Yeah, I don't know. I'm just gonna

250
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:02,480
All right, I'm gonna finish it out I guess I have a follow-up question which Japanese shows have you swatched

251
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:12,720
Naruto okay, I guess that makes sense. That is a Japanese show avatar

252
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,020
That's not different rats

253
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,460
What else King of the Hill?

254
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,620
Okay

255
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:24,700
They're all kind of the my favorite shows. So I'm into Japan. All right, but yeah, I think

256
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,840
I don't know. I do I think I'm going to probably quit playing these games after this one for real and play ace

257
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,300
Attorney because it was free on game pass and it looks like the same kind of thing without

258
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,420
sex

259
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:44,460
Yeah, but you need it. It needs to be more Japanese. It needs to be funny. Ace Attorney isn't funny enough

260
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,300
What?

261
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:53,220
How have we like skirted around Rex just fully recommending you to play yakuza for so long?

262
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,660
uh... that's another one of those that those there's too many of those games

263
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:00,420
so

264
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:06,920
and i was a little bit more than a does the one with the zero next to it

265
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,740
that's a a a a a a small

266
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,780
yet but

267
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:16,100
they also don't look all that fun to me they look too much like grant that dot

268
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,740
o

269
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,660
the

270
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,060
it like rent that's not a that is

271
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,580
i'd i don't dislike rent that's not a bad tried playing

272
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:27,260
replaying g_t_a_ five

273
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:31,580
and uh... it was a really really boring me

274
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,460
you know what i had a little over the budget you can afford those are really

275
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,700
good one

276
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,820
i've never played any of the city to five and i really like you should have

277
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,900
played it

278
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:44,380
i think you can force like maybe the political

279
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,100
you know that's a lot where your cousin is calling you all the time

280
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,860
but you have another country yet what does that sound awesome as fuck

281
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,300
you know you're in new york

282
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,300
running around.

283
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
"Rico my cousin."

284
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,300
Yeah.

285
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,340
Uh, that's the type of things he says.

286
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,800
You would like Yakuza, especially because you like the...

287
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,060
I think if you get into Japanese stuff, there's like a part of your brain that enjoys how

288
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,060
retarded Japanese storytelling is.

289
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,740
Sorry, one Heineken zeroed down.

290
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,740
Done and dusted.

291
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,740
Thank you.

292
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:15,740
On to the next.

293
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,740
Oh, what's the second beer?

294
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,740
Heineken one.

295
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
Heineken zero.

296
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
Um, fuck you.

297
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
Why are you even asking?

298
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
you

299
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,740
why even ask that

300
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:23,740
because you're setting

301
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,740
sorry

302
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,820
so you like japanese people because you think that they have a disability

303
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
is that what you say?

304
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,900
well they just like love to ham fist like a twist

305
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,900
every 30 seconds

306
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,080
towards the end of a story

307
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,920
that's like japanese storytelling style

308
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,480
that is what i've experienced

309
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,620
yeah playing the persona games

310
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,020
and then

311
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,900
playing uh

312
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900
this other game

313
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,780
I thought that that was just like a quirk of the Persona series, but it is so awesome for there to be

314
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:59,060
so many twists, no real like, and then always a pretty disappointing ending.

315
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:06,100
Yes, that is literally it. Amazing twists in like the middle towards the late part of a story,

316
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,660
and then just an impossibility to wrap it up well.

317
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,500
Yeah, kind of lost type of thing.

318
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,500
That is 100% every good Japanese story is like that.

319
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Even the best ones, they always fail at the end.

320
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Yakuza, on the other hand, blows it.

321
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Actually finishes strong.

322
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
- Sticks the landing. - Sticks the landing.

323
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,700
- Okay, so maybe I will check out this game.

324
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,500
- Yeah, because it actually...

325
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,300
It's like, emotional and good

326
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,780
in a way that like contrasts with how stupid the actual game is.

327
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:54,860
Do you know what I mean? I think the feeling that I, listen I like Japan fine. Yeah. And I,

328
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,660
but I keep playing these games and wishing that there was one that took place in America

329
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:05,180
at like Hollywood high. Yeah. And I could, there was some kind of awesome murder going on there

330
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:09,660
and then I realized that that's kind of just LA noir. Yeah. Yeah, Sidney Sweeney's in it. It's a

331
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:18,140
full uh what do they call that FMV yeah yeah FMV Sydney Sweeney is just a picture or a video

332
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:25,100
and she's talking to you and uh you can see under her skirt Japanese style yeah again why are you

333
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:32,460
making no no no no no no this is American style okay she gets hit by a car and then you get to see

334
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,860
The blasts explode. You see them for one second and the car explodes.

335
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
Yeah.

336
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,860
Yeah.

337
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
Yeah.

338
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,860
Awesome.

339
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,860
How long until I can try to push you into playing the MGS games do you think?

340
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,860
I don't like doing emulation because I feel...

341
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,860
I don't like being involved in black hat hacking.

342
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:59,860
Which I consider emulation to be black hat hacking.

343
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I only participate in white hat stuff.

344
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,020
Well the fifth one is on the computer.

345
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,980
Well then I might be able to play that.

346
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,460
I might be able to play that one.

347
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,660
I do think that MGS5 is probably one of the best games ever made.

348
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,180
Yeah it's really good.

349
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:28,660
You know I've been playing Danganronpa, which again bad name, doesn't feel like a Japanese

350
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
word to me.

351
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,660
What does it mean?

352
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,660
I don't think it means anything.

353
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,660
No, it means something. It means like bullet theft or some shit.

354
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:38,660
I looked it up because I was like, "This doesn't make any sense."

355
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
Okay.

356
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,660
Or bullet identity or something. I don't know. Some shit like that.

357
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,660
I'm sure we're about to learn right now from Rex.

358
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,660
I couldn't tell you because I don't know what's in there.

359
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:51,660
Can I do a little aside? Doesn't Rex look like he's wearing a suit right now?

360
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,660
Yeah, I thought he was.

361
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:56,660
I thought you were going full Green Day.

362
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,660
No.

363
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,500
I'm just wearing a hoodie and a jacket.

364
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,420
It's a suit-esque kind of jacket.

365
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
Yeah.

366
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,420
Well, all jackets are suit-esque.

367
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:13,060
I found an amazing video today because the other game I've been playing is Vampire Survivors.

368
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,380
I play this game a lot when I'm just like, when the wife goes to sleep and I have to

369
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,980
stay up with the dog because he's like really energetic.

370
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,660
I sit there and I throw a ball and I play Vampire Survivors because I can just play it

371
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:25,500
with one thumb stick on the Xbox.

372
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:33,860
and I have been like listening to uh audio books while I play it so I started listening

373
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,820
to Killers of the Flower Moon but I don't want to watch the movie but I the story I don't

374
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,580
want to watch it yet but the story I didn't know it was a real story when I found out it

375
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:49,820
was I got this audio book and then um I got a little bored with that one after I listened

376
00:21:49,820 --> 00:22:05,260
to

377
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:12,060
that it was some kind of new translation of of meditations where he says like uh

378
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:19,740
he's like it's first couple minutes feels normal and then he's like and then i met uh epidaeus

379
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,020
and i thought he was the real mvp and i loved his vibe and it's some kind of like

380
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,940
fucking it's some kind of like zoomer translated

381
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,020
that like is i'll have to send it to you it's fucking crazy it's um but it's still i think

382
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,700
it still has like an old british guy narrating it right and i've just been imagining all day

383
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,300
just that guy getting the job to be a narrator for a marcus aurelius audiobook and then he gets

384
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:56,300
into the booth and starts reading it and it's also mark that's a that's a not a long book but it's

385
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,980
it's not a super short book and the the whole thing is like an hour long which means they took

386
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,100
out everything and just made it about like not talking to girls or something.

387
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,020
So I'm gonna listen to the whole thing and I'm gonna report back.

388
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:14,020
What's funny about Marcus Aurelius, and this has been going around on Twitter and Reddit,

389
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,320
is that his wife cheated on him with like a gladiator.

390
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,260
So it like, recontextualized, he's like, you know, don't talk to girls, don't enjoy anything.

391
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,380
Meanwhile, he's married and his wife is cheating on him with like a retarded jock.

392
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,100
That's the funniest shit in the world!

393
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,660
it is like

394
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,520
such a book for losers

395
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,660
yeah but

396
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,760
yeah i mean once you get past a lot of the basic stuff it is a lot of like

397
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,840
fine detail advice

398
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,980
that really can only apply to your life if you're the biggest nerd in the world

399
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,180
yeah which is what it is

400
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,620
like he's writing that meanwhile his wife is just

401
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:59,840
and here's the thing you could kill your wife back then for doing that

402
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,540
but he probably wasn't strong enough

403
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,140
yeah

404
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,540
she was risking death to get dick

405
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,540
now cheating means nothing now

406
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,160
you know

407
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,100
you can't kill your wife for cheating

408
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,840
but back then you could fuckin

409
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:14,460
you could ground up like five guys and just go kill her

410
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,700
that's true

411
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,660
i think it's very admirable

412
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,740
of him to write that stuff

413
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:23,700
and then not pretend not to care

414
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,900
yeah i

415
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,060
i don't know anybody who's ever recommended me that book who i thought

416
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:35,440
was really cool. Right. For sure. But that's kind of true of any philosophy book I think.

417
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:41,280
Anybody who is like, "read this book, it'll change your life" means, "read this book, this

418
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,460
is how I got to be like this." Yeah, well I think if your life is changed by a philosophy

419
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,780
book, you have like a mental deficiency. Yeah, if you have one, if anybody has one book where

420
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:57,540
they're like, "this is the book, man," you need to, they got something wrong with them

421
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:03,860
man except for the infallible word of God. Right. Well right, obviously. If you read a

422
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,540
book like that and you and you don't you actually think just a guy wrote it like

423
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:12,060
the Bible makes sense you think God wrote it if that changes your life that's fine

424
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:18,340
if you read a book that just a guy wrote a guy like 2000 years ago or even even

425
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:24,180
worse if you read fucking some Mark Fisher book and you're like this changed

426
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:30,800
my entire life. He killed himself. He killed himself with his car man. Or something. That's

427
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:36,320
not who gives a fuck about. I just you can like the book but it can't be like oh this

428
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,540
changed my life so much. That's just whack. It's not admirable to think so much you kill

429
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:48,060
yourself. Which is exactly. That's the biggest loser thing you can do. That's fucking gay.

430
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,820
thinking what are you retarded he thought oh the key to life was to kill yourself

431
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,340
shit i'm not reading your damn book i'm gonna catch this oh god don't you write a book about

432
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,140
a sword fucking idiot yeah right book about movies a behind if marcus aurelius had written a behind

433
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:12,940
the scenes about all the plays that were happening and who was having sex with who like an oral

434
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:17,740
history of Saturday Night Live. God dang it. That would have been fucking... I would have

435
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:24,020
loved that book. I would love that book, man. But instead he wrote this dumbass book. This

436
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,620
dumbass book that says, "Hey, don't wear the same clothes outside as you wear in your house."

437
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:36,780
Suck my dick, man. Fuck you. Fuck you, Marcus Aurelius. Fucking dumbass. Go get Cheeto on

438
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:42,960
your wife some more. Yeah, I'm done with all this kind of shit. I'm only reading

439
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:49,000
historical nonfiction from now on. Nah, you can't do that. That's a

440
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,700
dark road. No man, I want to read about... I want to get into... I've never been in one

441
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,800
of these men who is very so obsessed with war, so I want to read war books from

442
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,480
now on because they will make me... they'll prepare me for what is to come in

443
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:14,480
this

444
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,560
possible version of this when I was a kid when I was a kid I read basically every

445
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,640
thing at my reading level of like 10 or 11 years old that had ever been written

446
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:31,920
about the Holocaust I read pretty much all of it yeah I read pretty much all of it I

447
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:37,320
read the big one I read was that book milkweed and all that kind of stuff I

448
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:42,640
I read Maus and all this shit, and then I, uh...

449
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,000
I don't know, I never got interested in any of like Civil War stuff or anything like that.

450
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,860
What inspired this?

451
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,520
What inspired my desire to read about war?

452
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,380
Yeah.

453
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:03,840
Because I think that I'm going to be thrown on the front line of some war very, very soon.

454
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
I can feel it.

455
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:05,840
I can feel that I have...

456
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
His head is so reflective of the behind the enemy.

457
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:15,280
I think I have about a 28 month, 28 more months as a civilian I would say.

458
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,720
Do you think the US Army would use Caleb as a Rudolph?

459
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
And now I never...

460
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:31,560
Yes or no question, it's really simple.

461
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,160
You know, maybe.

462
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,240
They maybe would.

463
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,240
That really stunned me.

464
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,560
That really is funny.

465
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,520
I would be open to that.

466
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,760
I'd serve my country, but I'm not even sure that I will be fighting for the United States.

467
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,440
But I know that I will be drafted into some kind of war.

468
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:52,400
It could be a gang war.

469
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,400
It could be another...

470
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,340
It's gang war right on the side of...

471
00:28:56,340 --> 00:29:00,280
I'm fully a Hoover Street Crip.

472
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,960
I see.

473
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,680
See I do I think we're going up in a in a Brooklyn I

474
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,460
think I've had a for too long the hipsters and the

475
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:21,320
Yeah, see that's a tough one for me I've seen that one act out it happens

476
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,960
Yeah, this is the most common war

477
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,680
In the entirety of the world

478
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,520
The gangsters will be like you should go back where you came from

479
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,460
And it'll be like a Chinese girl in big glasses and they'll be like I moved here three years ago. I live

480
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,400
This is the hipster verse gangsta

481
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:53,280
Okay, so you're clearly on the side of the hipsters just based off of the impressions you're doing

482
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,280
I do think we have a perfect-

483
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm pulling on the side of the gangstas!

484
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,280
No, we have a perfect hipsta vs gangsta thing going on right here.

485
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
I would say.

486
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
What, is I'm gangsta?

487
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
Yeah.

488
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
See, that's what I was gonna say.

489
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:11,280
Yeah, look at me.

490
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
Wait, hold on.

491
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,280
There he goes.

492
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,280
He's gonna button the top button and then unbutton the rest of them?

493
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,280
He's not sure.

494
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,280
to do that, yep.

495
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,280
I'm fine.

496
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,400
But I'll do it anyway.

497
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,540
Hipstas vs gangstas is tough for me because I lived the life of a hipsta, but I was born

498
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
and bred a gangsta.

499
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,540
Right.

500
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,900
I'm a G straight from the 9-1-0.

501
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:41,020
I'm from Drillmington, Kilmington, North Carolina, about an hour north of Myrta Beach.

502
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,520
So this is a tough one for me.

503
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,940
And also I like the gangsta outfits more, clearly.

504
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:51,300
they look better on me than any kind of hipster BS

505
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,900
you know

506
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,780
uh...

507
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,260
uh...

508
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,940
what are you laughing at?

509
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,020
you need a skull tattoo

510
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:02,800
this is going to take you to the next level

511
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,000
no i'm saying on your skull

512
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,740
i have gang tattoos tons of gang tattoos from all the games i've been in

513
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,780
you know i don't play yakuza because i live that shit

514
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,780
it's a bit of a

515
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:19,500
this is my back

516
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,980
the doctor said this is where my back started it's a condition i have

517
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,300
long-term leader raters tattoo on your forehead

518
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,580
is what i'm saying

519
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:30,700
i would get that

520
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:34,540
you know brooklyn that's that i think i'm for i think i'm pretty much talking

521
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,340
to my wife about this the other night

522
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,900
i think i'm pretty much done with tattoos i'd think that not that i fully regret

523
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,220
getting tattoos

524
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,420
but they hurt very badly they're expensive

525
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:49,260
And I just don't, I think I got enough of these fucking things.

526
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,860
I don't need any more of them.

527
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,260
They're a little bit disgusting, you know, if you get a bunch of them.

528
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,940
Yeah.

529
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,900
I do think in general they're usually pretty embarrassing.

530
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,460
Yeah.

531
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
So I think I'm dumb.

532
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:09,780
When I was growing up it was like everybody had tattoos and, you know, I just wanted to

533
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,980
be like my brother.

534
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,780
And then now I'm more into kind of Japanese video games.

535
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:19,660
So I don't really care that much about this kind of thing.

536
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:24,260
So you don't think that if you play too much Yakuza you'll be like, "Oh, I'll just get a

537
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,740
dragon tattoo on my back."

538
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:29,780
It would be cool to get a dragon tattoo on your back.

539
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,880
Well, yeah, because also you have no worry about somebody taking it the wrong way if

540
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,920
you live in America.

541
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,060
You can get all sorts of...

542
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,060
Hasn't that always kind of also been kind of a just a not...

543
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,060
I mean, Pat got a tattoo and people took it the wrong way.

544
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,060
I feel like you can get a tattoo the wrong way.

545
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:49,060
But maybe not a Yakuza tattoo.

546
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,060
Yeah, he would look like a...

547
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,060
There might not be that many people who know what that is.

548
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:56,060
Also, my brother has a dragon tattoo on his back.

549
00:32:56,060 --> 00:33:00,060
Hey, that goddamn girl from that movie had a dragon tattoo.

550
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,060
Rooney Mara had got that. Nobody thought she was Yakuza.

551
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,060
Well, maybe I didn't see the movie.

552
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,060
Yeah, I didn't see the movie. I can't prove you wrong on that.

553
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:15,820
It was a really long movie about a lady detective who was really special because she's got tattoos

554
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:24,860
all over and the mystery is she got kidnapped by a rapist.

555
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:28,860
Yeah, typically a woman detective creating more crime.

556
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:32,860
Creating it by being victimized?

557
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:36,860
Yeah. Get out of there! I'll let you

558
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,860
investigate dinner.

559
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,860
It's not even funny. It's like the worst joke

560
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,860
ever.

561
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,860
You look like Ben Franklin right now.

562
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
He looks like a mariachi bro.

563
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,860
I'm laughing too much man.

564
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Oh god.

565
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Whatever.

566
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,860
I'm trying to move this show.

567
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,860
Guys we gotta break this show out into the mainstream.

568
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,860
We can't be saying shit like this.

569
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:14,860
Yeah.

570
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,860
I don't know.

571
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,860
I don't know how to reach across the aisle to the new audiences.

572
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:28,140
Dude, I, uh, oh someone said Rick's talking about Vosch right now.

573
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:30,260
I saw that picture!

574
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
What happened?

575
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,980
I did see the clip.

576
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,980
It was very funny.

577
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,820
Vosch, one of the fattest people who's ever lived.

578
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:39,820
Drama alert.

579
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:40,820
Drama alert.

580
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:46,420
Vosch, wait, people are reminding me in the chat of so many things we have to talk about.

581
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,320
number one

582
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,780
vosh uh...

583
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,300
saw or had a bunch of pictures disgusting drawn pornography on

584
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,780
and actually that was

585
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,140
that was uh...

586
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,540
another thing that made me think i don't want to play this danganronpa game

587
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,640
because i was like i think that this

588
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,500
is why this guy's probably like this he probably played this game when he was

589
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,660
like fifteen

590
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,380
yeah

591
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,800
uh...

592
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,700
so that was a disgusting thing but in other sort of perverted news

593
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,060
drake

594
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,900
had his schmeat

595
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:19,100
flopping in the wind on a bed.

596
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,340
- What? - His shit is like

597
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,300
- Oh yeah, I saw that. - A wiggling.

598
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,420
- He had a wiggling worm that he showed a woman

599
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,780
through the web.

600
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,460
- Okay, so first things first,

601
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,980
he did not show that to a woman.

602
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,400
He posted that himself.

603
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,660
- He leaked that post?

604
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,500
No, he did not.

605
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,900
- He leaked that himself.

606
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,740
- Why would he choose now?

607
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,420
Do you think maybe he just got the like

608
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,980
dick lengthening surgery and got home

609
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,820
and just started wiggling his new wiener on the bed

610
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,220
and recorded it and sent it to his publicist

611
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,220
and was like, "Send this to somebody over 18

612
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,300
"and let's get this online."

613
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,340
- I can't fathom the mind of Drake,

614
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,620
but I know for a fact that he wants that attention.

615
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:02,220
'Cause there's no attention on Drake right now.

616
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:05,020
No one gave a fuck about Drake before this happened.

617
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,860
- I don't think that's true.

618
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,320
- Everything was about Taylor Swift.

619
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,260
Everything was about fucking Megan Thee Stallion

620
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,260
and Ice Spice and whatever other women.

621
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,980
It's time for the men to come back.

622
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,660
And he brought it back by showing

623
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,360
his huge dangly floppy penis.

624
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:24,460
- So he did this for us, is what you're saying.

625
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,300
- Okay.

626
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,260
- He took attention off this was for the guys.

627
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,640
- So I have a counterpoint.

628
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,780
You know how everyone before this was like,

629
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,580
oh, why is Drake doing all this corny shit?

630
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,580
Why is he acting so gay and talking like a girl on stream?

631
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:43,880
I think and then people then this comes out and people are like oh we got to respect Drake because he's got a penis

632
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,000
And I'm I'm thinking why is he got that and why is he acting like this?

633
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,640
X norm on what you mean player

634
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,740
He's so embarrassing

635
00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:01,260
He's so I would yeah, cuz he has a huge penis. Was he gonna feel embarrassed? He gets to just open his pants and see I

636
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:06,540
Would like to say one thing. Okay. Hmm cuz you brought a good thing up. He's been acting gay

637
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,980
I spent probably 45 minutes looking at this video

638
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:15,700
Frame by frame play by play. I'm not kidding. I was in the bathroom

639
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,100
It was taking a little longer than normal and I thought I'd dedicate some time put in some hours, right?

640
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:23,300
Did you happen to have any stitching?

641
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:29,220
Didn't see any stitching but I will say this man. I've seen a lot of cocks in my life

642
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:35,160
That is very clearly a gay man's penis. I love right now

643
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:56,600
know. It's too big. It's too big. First of all, yeah. No woman needs. They don't want

644
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,600
that is genetically affirmed to me.

645
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:03,120
It's too gay for a woman that only could go in a guy.

646
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,600
Only a big guy could use that.

647
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,600
Okay.

648
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,360
So that's it.

649
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,040
Number two, it was, it's too wiggly.

650
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,360
It's way too wiggly.

651
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,360
Okay.

652
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:20,800
It doesn't, and the number three, it did not have a lightning bolt Harry Potter vein that

653
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,000
all straight men's penises have.

654
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,620
If you don't have that vein, then the guy you're having sex with and you are the same.

655
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,620
That's my rhyme.

656
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:37,940
The vein, if you don't have the vein, the sex is the same.

657
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:42,520
And if you do, the girl you screw.

658
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,200
A girl you screw.

659
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,920
A girl you screw.

660
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,760
But the biggest thing is, it's way too big.

661
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
The biggest thing is penis.

662
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,760
And the smaller your dick is, the straighter you are.

663
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,760
And, uh...

664
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,760
Yeah, that's all I have to say on that.

665
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,760
The micropenis guys are also gay.

666
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,760
No, that's the straightest thing ever.

667
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
I think there's a range.

668
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
It's 50/50.

669
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Okay.

670
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,760
There's 50/50? What?

671
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's like...

672
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,760
'Cause there's straight guys with really tiny, like, micropenises.

673
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,640
like to be like humiliated for it and there's gay guys with micro penises that

674
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,840
are just like I need my ass to be destroyed and it's kind of the same

675
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:32,960
impulse but yeah okay I think you're saying there's a sweet spot in the

676
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,480
middle if it's too small or too big right then you're your odds of being gay

677
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,560
are and you're heterosexual if it's in the middle right so you might be right

678
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,560
chance that your sweet penis is making you gay. My sweet penis? My sweet penis. Is that

679
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,160
what you just said? My sweet penis is making me gay? That's what you just said. Nuh uh.

680
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,480
You said there's a 50% chance my sweet penis is making me gay? What are you saying? Odd

681
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:08,120
choice of words, Jubio. My sweet penis. But, wait, what was the thing that we came out with?

682
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,880
Well, we didn't come out with it. We invented it. Well, we didn't invent it. We thought of

683
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:26,880
of

684
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,520
people listen to this podcast they talk to us all the time we can't tell you they

685
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,360
are obviously don't wanna compromise their identities and a lot of them would

686
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:39,320
probably get flamed in public for this project also to be honest we don't want

687
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,000
the heat

688
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,880
ok you know we don't want to be we're doing fine without it

689
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:49,320
so uh... maybe that is going around and this is the first week off of the

690
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:56,320
celebrity only p real that has now just dribbled down into our open mouths

691
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,160
Here's what I'll say.

692
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:07,120
The sheer joy that Drake's penis brought to every man in the world that day proves that

693
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,360
peen real is a public good.

694
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,960
The world is enriched by peen real.

695
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,260
I think I agree.

696
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:21,140
I think that this could be... and also, this is giving an amazing lesson to men all around

697
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,140
the world.

698
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,480
As Drake often has.

699
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,480
does take care he does Marvin's room what's the lesson off of that oh you it's

700
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:34,240
good to cry you can cry and still be an awesome badass boss who wears sweaters

701
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,880
yeah right and then the newer albums come out what's the lesson from these you can

702
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,160
have much younger friends yeah you can have much much younger friends who were

703
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,000
in elementary school when you were in college that's the lesson of all these

704
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,000
is

705
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,500
Yeah.

706
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,000
Okay.

707
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,640
Because you're Drake and you're fucking gay.

708
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:05,100
It's delightful to see a man's penis for the first time.

709
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:07,800
God, oh, that feeling?

710
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,400
When you unzip it and you see it for the first time?

711
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,200
That is the best feeling ever.

712
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,800
I don't need to see it again.

713
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,800
You can put it away right after.

714
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,900
Let me see it.

715
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,200
Let me see it.

716
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,800
I want to see that shit.

717
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,400
I need to know.

718
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:21,400
I do have-

719
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,800
Put it added to the Rolodex.

720
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:23,600
I have a-

721
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:32,000
Small but ever-growing desire to see all of my friends penises the more I get to know them the longer that I go

722
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,580
Being friends with a man without ever seeing their penis

723
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:40,720
The weirder it is to me the more I feel like they have something to hide if I've been friends with somebody for 10 years

724
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,640
And I've never once seen their penis not even a trunk. Yeah, that's

725
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,180
Something is wrong there a man's penis is like 30% of his person

726
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,900
It's 30% of his body. Yeah, well, it's 30% of his mind

727
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,780
You know, this is some Marcus Aurelius shit. I'm sure that I will get to this very soon in the book

728
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:08,220
Absolutely, I mean a man bases his entire identity off of his penis

729
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:15,640
The penis is a smaller medium. There's a reason why you look down and and and you see it

730
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:19,640
It's because it's the same as it's a reflection pond you look down and you yourself

731
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:25,840
You see all your hopes and all your dreams your future your potential is all what he acts good that

732
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,620
Disgusting pink piece of meat, right?

733
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:31,340
Or in some cases brown like poop. Oh

734
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:38,780
I want to talk about the color of it - it looked purple. I

735
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,940
Don't know

736
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,480
It looked like he may have a plump purple penis

737
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,660
He's a purple penis eater.

738
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,660
Just wanna say that.

739
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,660
Yeah.

740
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:56,660
I think he may have just seen an eggplant emoji.

741
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,660
Covering it.

742
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,660
Maybe. Well it also could have been, you know what it is?

743
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:04,660
Maybe he was jelking it so hard to get it like so full of blood.

744
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:08,660
That it was like, it looked like a suffocated person.

745
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:12,660
Yeah, he was laying there for like 10 hours that day.

746
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,660
Just like, "I gotta get this right."

747
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,660
Just adding rubber bands on the bottom.

748
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,660
Yeah, so long getting ready to

749
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:25,820
Wiggly it's no wiggling that and what girl is watching that video that he sent this to what?

750
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:30,220
Scene so many penises that he's trying to fuck. Oh

751
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:35,440
Is I can do the one thing it's supposed to get hard

752
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,300
By the way, it wasn't enough that it was a big dick

753
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,020
I need to see that shit wiggle something that I don't know

754
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,100
I don't know if you notice kill but someone in my chat noticed immediately after the video came out

755
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:49,660
They came into the chat and they're like Drake has no balls

756
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:55,060
Let me let me say something okay. Mm-hmm. I

757
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,820
Have a similar affliction

758
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,340
Okay, my Pete gets

759
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,820
Wiggle we gets

760
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,800
And I won't say it gets as large as Drake's that would be completely crazy for me to say that when it gets purple

761
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,180
when it gets

762
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,860
When my dick gets purple

763
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:21,300
My balls shoot up to protect themselves for my razor-sharp dick

764
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:25,400
Okay, and if you put your hand at the base of your penis

765
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,860
It's possible that it looks like you have no balls and instead you have a hand there. Yeah

766
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,780
so

767
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,100
That I don't I don't fault him for having

768
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,460
It should basically look like a spoon.

769
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:43,700
It should be just a shaft and then a small teardrop where your ball skin is.

770
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,260
Exactly, yes.

771
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,420
If your balls hang- oh here's another thing.

772
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,660
If your balls hang low, you're gay.

773
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:50,660
Yeah.

774
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,100
What's the rhyme?

775
00:45:54,100 --> 00:46:00,140
If your balls hang low, you're on the down low- no.

776
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:01,140
You're um.

777
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,980
You like bunghole.

778
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,940
If your balls hang, men you do bang.

779
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:20,100
the

780
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:22,100
So it's really that simple.

781
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:28,140
So that's pretty much any conclusions on Drake's thing?

782
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:31,460
I liked looking at it, I think I'll look at it again right now.

783
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,660
I just want to get one other...

784
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,540
Let me see if I can look at this video.

785
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,540
Drake penis video.

786
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,540
It's kind of hard to find, right?

787
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:42,180
Is Kyle Penis Problems still a public subredditor?

788
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,660
There's probably one, there's probably a post top of the market where it's like "I can't

789
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:48,340
fucking believe this Drake shit."

790
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,340
Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.

791
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:55,580
Where can I find a video of Drake's meat?

792
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,020
Drake 11 inch penis reveal.

793
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,580
Oh, I got, alright.

794
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,380
Wait, I'd like for you guys to hear this.

795
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:04,300
This is, uh, I just pulled up this.

796
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:10,580
It's not coming through on Discord.

797
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:13,580
Can you hear this?

798
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,580
No.

799
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,580
*Drake singing*

800
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,580
You got Rickrolled?

801
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,580
I got fuckin' Rickrolled, guys.

802
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,580
You thought I- you thought I-

803
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,580
*Drake laughing*

804
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:26,580
You thought Drake's penis was gonna be on YouTube?

805
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,580
I did some kind of black hat hacking and changed the link to say

806
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,580
xhamster.com/drake11inchpenisreveal

807
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:37,580
Um, so that has happened to me...

808
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,580
Uh, fuck, man. Alright, oh, I found it.

809
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,580
He meant to troll the world?

810
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:48,420
Wait, ok I'm looking at this video.

811
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,260
Looks like he's in a tour bus I would guess.

812
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,260
Or a plane.

813
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:55,420
Someone said he was in his mansion.

814
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,620
Yeah I think he's in bed.

815
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:00,420
Cause he's filming in a mirror and it's a pretty decent sized way.

816
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,680
Yeah but there's a lot of wiggling.

817
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,940
Maybe that's why it's wiggling is cause he's in a plane or a bumpy...

818
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:07,940
Oh there's altitude.

819
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:08,940
Yes.

820
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:21,460
all

821
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,460
Wiggly your penis gets on an airplane

822
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:29,040
and I feel like that would be talked about on this porn website the

823
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,160
Most recent comment is like I'm not gay and I got turned on

824
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,840
So everybody kind of has

825
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:41,980
The same reaction to this as we do I think they like it. I

826
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:46,000
See you made any public appearances since this happened. I

827
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:53,080
Don't think so. I try I am a immediately went to go to his Instagram story to see what he was posting on there

828
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:58,260
But he was just posting pictures of his friends and that's again. I like that. It's nonchalant. This is not a big deal

829
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:05,660
Okay to have your wiggling worm broadcast to the entire world. It shouldn't be something where you go into hiding

830
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:10,180
Oh, I'm not gonna really say like imagine he did like a full Kendrick Lamar

831
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:15,980
He's gone out of the public eye for like five years and then he makes a an album about how much this hurt him

832
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:22,980
right? I don't want to see that out of Drake. Maybe one, one fucking single where he addresses

833
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:30,840
this, right? Money longer than my dick, kind of, some kind of question, answer kind of

834
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:37,240
thing there where he explains why he took this, this video. Right. And then I want him

835
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:44,240
to move on, okay? It's that fucking simple. Okay. Uh, and next up to bat I would say, you

836
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:48,640
And next up to bat, I would say Julio needs a drop of it similar to this.

837
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,640
Yep.

838
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,640
I think I'm good.

839
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,640
Let me see it wiggle.

840
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,640
I think I'm good at that.

841
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,480
We are getting, I've known you for years at this point, never even been close to seeing

842
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,480
your penis.

843
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,640
How long have we been friends?

844
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,000
Never even seen you in underwear.

845
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,240
Never even seen you in underwear.

846
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
That is true.

847
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,880
What do you mean that is true?

848
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,240
I'm starting to think that you have a giant fucking long one.

849
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,200
Do you want me to strip in front of you?

850
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,120
Not strip, but, oh, oh, spur of the moment.

851
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:17,480
We're walking through Central Park, let's skinny dip in the fountain.

852
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,480
Something like that.

853
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:24,400
Or, oh, Caleb, let's go get changed together at the JCPenney.

854
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,240
Let's try on different jeans, husky jeans.

855
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,240
Stuff like that.

856
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,240
Okay?

857
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,160
I think the first ever time I went to New York, I was staying at your apartment, and

858
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,200
I think the second or third night, you were fully, in your other words, just jumping around.

859
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:47,960
Because I knew that this was the first time that we had hung out in person and we had

860
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,120
something we had to get over.

861
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,120
You know?

862
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,120
So here's what you do.

863
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:56,440
When I walk around in my underwear and it's your first time ever seeing me, you head straight

864
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:02,080
to the bathroom, you come out in your underwear, and you and me, we sit in the kitchen, we

865
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,780
smoke some weed and we talk about movies for a little bit.

866
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:08,800
And if we, you know, we try not to break eye contact because who knows about these wandering

867
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:09,800
eyes.

868
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,800
Yeah.

869
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,120
Um, I don't think I'm ever going back to New York City.

870
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,120
Why?

871
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:17,120
Whatever man.

872
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,120
I think I'm banned.

873
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,740
You're afraid of penises?

874
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:23,680
I'm afraid of the government trying to kill me.

875
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:26,480
Oh, because they don't like you anymore?

876
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,920
Yeah, they don't fuck with me no more.

877
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:32,000
So you miss your chance.

878
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,560
I think that I will have another chance.

879
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:40,200
You have to come get it.

880
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,400
i think i will come get it

881
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:48,320
that's when i think i'm going to have a i'm going to have a jason board

882
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,860
to come see you

883
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,260
you all know anything about it i'll be very

884
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,660
very stuffed with his own money what way

885
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:58,780
jason brown that the other military different language in the a fake

886
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,200
passport

887
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,760
and i'm gonna cross the border with uh... where they call them

888
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,600
a wolf

889
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,860
you can just cross the border it's fine

890
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:12,060
now it's so hard to do that kind of thing it's not so because i have to get a real

891
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,260
passport easier you to fake one

892
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:17,180
right and all i've talked to somebody recently

893
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,300
who's uh...

894
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:23,620
whose dad was like a missionary and he's telling me he came back from a one of

895
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:25,860
his like missionary trips

896
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:31,620
and he he noticed that his dad had a fake passport with a fake name

897
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,380
uh... well

898
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:36,460
like he may be as a spy

899
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:39,340
or he was kidnapped by the cartel and they were making

900
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,860
smuggled shit in

901
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,540
or maybe he was a

902
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,020
a clone

903
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,480
or a doppelganger

904
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,820
okay maybe that happened yeah

905
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,540
what would you guys do if you saw

906
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:55,040
if you saw what happen? I saw a clone at the airport when I was

907
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,860
when i was detained by the officers

908
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:00,380
where they only keep the clone

909
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,820
uh... just someone from china

910
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:06,540
What do you mean you saw a clone? You can't explain this.

911
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:07,040
Okay, so...

912
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,700
You saw a clone of somebody from China.

913
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,620
I will tell the story once again.

914
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,820
I was at the...

915
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,320
Uh...

916
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,160
At the airport. I got there.

917
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,540
They didn't fuck with my...

918
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,540
How many trips I took to the U.S.

919
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:23,000
And they sent me to the room where they sent all the Chinese people that come to the airport.

920
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,880
LGA... No, not LGA.

921
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:29,680
JFK, if you're from China or anywhere around there, don't go to JFK.

922
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,020
They will arrest you.

923
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,020
Uh...

924
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:36,580
But one of them, one of them, they were reprimanding him.

925
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,020
It was like, this is not your name or your face or you.

926
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:40,620
You are the clone.

927
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:42,660
And he was like, oh, yeah, yeah.

928
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,500
And you saw a real life clone accusation by TSA JFK Airport.

929
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,380
Yep. And he went, yeah, OK, I'm sorry.

930
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:50,900
And then he just got.

931
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,700
He said, I'm sorry for being a clone.

932
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:53,740
And he left.

933
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:55,020
Yeah, basically.

934
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,060
Dude, I fully fucking believe this.

935
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,660
What the fuck?

936
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,300
You're joking right now.

937
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:01,900
you're making up a fib.

938
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,780
This is like less than half of a joke.

939
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:12,220
The clone is completely true. All the details. It was a different airport.

940
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:16,180
All that kind of thing. Yeah. I'm scared of clones, man.

941
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,540
Have you ever seen anybody on the street and been like, that looks just like me?

942
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,100
No.

943
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:26,380
I'm sure this happens every single day to you. Nope. No,

944
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,220
I'm kidding.

945
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:33,020
Do you have that because of your, like, head?

946
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,020
Yes man.

947
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:40,340
I go to a gym that has a lot of bald guys, and there are times when I think I'm looking

948
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,340
at the mirror.

949
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:42,340
You see yourself?

950
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,340
No, when I'm literally looking at the mirror.

951
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,340
That's me!

952
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:50,460
And, like, it's those, you know how rooms in gyms are like all mirror, all mirror all

953
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,460
the time?

954
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,460
It's all mirrors on the walls?

955
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,740
For some gym, my gym is like this.

956
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:00,980
And so sometimes I'll be in one of those corners where there's like two mirrors that are right

957
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,980
next to each other.

958
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,160
So they cast a reflection that where I can't, I can't see the front of my head if I'm like

959
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,360
sitting there, but I can see the back of my head or something.

960
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,160
And so I'm used to this angle.

961
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,760
And a couple of times now I've seen myself get up off of something and walk away and realize

962
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,760
it wasn't me.

963
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,800
It was just another bald white guy in a t-shirt, white t-shirt.

964
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,280
you start freaking out that maybe you lost consciousness?

965
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,280
Well it does...

966
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,520
Maybe, ooh, maybe I'm astral projecting or something.

967
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:35,680
Haven't gotten to that yet, but every single time it does give me a little bit of a startle.

968
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,680
Alright.

969
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:37,680
Well.

970
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,680
Yeah.

971
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:43,040
Yeah, I've never had that happen.

972
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,040
I've seen...

973
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,040
No?

974
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,080
The thing that happens to me though is I'll just see any other Jewish guy and I'm like,

975
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:51,440
"Yeah, that guy probably looks exactly like me."

976
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,760
And it could be like a fat old guy or it could be Timothee Chalamet.

977
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,760
I've never met...

978
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:57,760
Okay.

979
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,160
Is Timothee Chalamet Jewish?

980
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,160
Is he chosen?

981
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,160
He...

982
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,160
No.

983
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,160
Is he?

984
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:04,160
Dude, that's awesome.

985
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:07,160
I thought he was just small and skinny.

986
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,040
Basically anyone that's ever been in a movie is...

987
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:13,000
No, I think he's just French, bro.

988
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,760
His last name is Chalamet.

989
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,080
That doesn't strike me as that much of a Jewish name.

990
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,640
Timothee Chalamet, Jewish.

991
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:23,000
He's half Russian, Jewish, and Austrian Jewish descent.

992
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,800
Wait, Nicole, well, Nicole Flander.

993
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:28,800
He's a Flander?

994
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:31,760
I knew I liked something about him.

995
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,760
Yeah, something like that.

996
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,440
Yeah, I don't know.

997
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,440
He's Flanders.

998
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,120
People love to be surprised when people are Jewish.

999
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:44,120
I'm not surprised.

1000
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:45,120
I don't love it.

1001
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,400
Like, why would I fucking lie about Timothy's childhood?

1002
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,400
I don't think you're lying, I just didn't know.

1003
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,400
I didn't know.

1004
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,400
Yeah, I thought you were just a little French kid.

1005
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:54,400
You can't spot it.

1006
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,400
I just don't have that kind of detector, I guess.

1007
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,400
But I can tell when people are bald.

1008
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,400
Even if they have a hat on.

1009
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,400
That is true, you can't do that.

1010
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:09,400
It's a kind of demure, kind of shyness.

1011
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,400
It's a way you carry yourself.

1012
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,400
Yeah, if you walk around and you're scared,

1013
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,400
you're a little easily startled,

1014
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,400
and you're like grabbing your hat,

1015
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:22,640
your hat as you like that that guy's bald right now I don't think I agree with

1016
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:30,720
you no being bald is like having a small penis in the sense that it

1017
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,720
Half of them are gay.

1018
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,720
Oh, that's an interesting...

1019
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,720
Oh, interesting.

1020
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,720
Like having a small penis.

1021
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,720
Okay!

1022
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:44,720
Fuck you.

1023
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,720
I think it changes the way you carry yourself.

1024
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,720
I think it's just...

1025
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,720
Well, oh, actually that is a good point because some people,

1026
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,720
like me, you go bald and you

1027
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,720
start becoming even more powerful.

1028
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,720
Right. And I think some people realize

1029
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:04,620
a small penis and then you become Hitler like you become Jeffrey Epstein or right

1030
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:17,080
now I can't think of any good Harvey Weinstein yeah has it ever been a single

1031
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,080

plankton is bald no hair on plankton

00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,080
kingpin is mostly fat

1042
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:41,080
and bald

1043
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:43,080
you would leave it fat though

1044
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,080
big fat guy

1045
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:59,200
a

1046
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:11,640
like

1047
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,680
a six-pack even though he's fat.

1048
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,800
That is not true.

1049
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,800
He has a six-pack.

1050
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:20,500
Look up kingpin six-pack right now, man.

He has abs.

1052
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:26,200
He has one of those iron bellies that football coaches have when you're growing up.

1053
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,200
Yeah.

1054
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,200
No, he has a fully fat belly.

1055
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:30,200
Nope.

1056
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:33,080
You looked up something different.

1057
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,840
Not in the drawings I have.

1058
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,400
These are all different drawings of him naked and he's all fat and belly-some.

1059
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:54,400
the

1060
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,600
I really respect that about you, that you don't see it that way.

1061
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:00,480
Because that would be a real problem.

1062
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,480
I don't see hair.

1063
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,480
You don't?

1064
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,480
I simply don't.

1065
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:05,480
You don't think my hair?

1066
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:06,480
No.

1067
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:13,760
I just look at your pink face and I go, "Oh, that's my friend right there."
