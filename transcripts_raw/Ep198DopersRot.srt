1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
come back and make a bet

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,120
and we see a black

3
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:12,680
you're a scrap monster

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,080
okay low-key thought that this was a drink yes that's what i have a good

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,000
really i was doing my laundry here yesterday

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,800
and you decided to put the bleach bottle there's a drink sized right next to all

7
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,040
the drinks on the table

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,120
genius dude

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:29,520
that's a serious fucking hippo violation that is a rank

10
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,320
OSHA violation. Most OSHA and HIPAA violations are just awesome pranks when you think about

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,400
it. I don't think so. I don't think it's true. That's true. That's not a prank. Making your

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,920
friend drink bleach is not a prank. That's an assassination attempt. You can do that

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,920
in Hitman. You can do that in Hitman. You won't laugh about it. You'll laugh like this.

14
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,720
Mwahahahaha. Exactly. You'll laugh like Dracula or a villain. You would not laugh like a friend

15
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,160
in a friendly way. A friend wouldn't laugh. A friend would not laugh about hurting or

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,600
killing your own friend. Okay, what if that bleach bottle was filled with soda?

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,600
That's closer to a prank. Yeah, but that's also not a prank because they wouldn't

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,280
drink it. Yeah, but also like if your friend is drinking it that means that

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,320
they're trying to maybe kill themselves. What if your friend is trying to kill

20
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,520
themself? That's not a prank. And then they drink it and ask Dr. Pepper. But there's still

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,680
traces that you didn't wash it fully and they still die. How do you know I didn't wash it

22
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,160
fully? Well, no. I bleached it out. I bleached out all the chemicals. No, I'm talking about an

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,540
imaginary situation here.

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,920
- Yeah, and in this imaginary situation,

25
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,240
I wiped out all the chemicals with bleach.

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,520
All the bleach chemicals, I used more bleach.

27
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,440
- You didn't do that, he didn't do it.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,080
- What if you accidentally put just a car--

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,080
- What if you ate a bug?

30
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,240
- That's not a prank either.

31
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
- What if you ate two bugs?

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,400
- That actually, that would be a funny ass prank

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,960
if you did that, Pat.

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,800
- Oh yeah, that would be a funny prank.

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,880
- Yeah, that actually, you would get me so good

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,720
if you ate two bugs.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,040
- Yeah, you can eat two bugs in here.

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,440
- I actually, I would hate, don't do it.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,280
I would hate--

40
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,100
- No, I would seriously--

41
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,500
- You might be if you ate two bones.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,620
- Now I wanna do it.

43
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,100
- I'm gonna do it. - It'll be so annoying.

44
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,220
- Okay, I'm gonna do it now.

45
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,940
- Do it then. - Seriously, don't.

46
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,760
- Okay, I'm not gonna do it. - Why are you waving

47
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,740
your hand like that?

48
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,340
You're waving it so much, it's like a horse's tail.

49
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,180
Stop.

50
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:13,900
Stop, it's too, stop.

51
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,300
You have to stop, that's actually cool.

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,220
- You can't do that.

53
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,300
- You can't, okay, get that thing away from your chest.

54
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,820
- That's not near my chest.

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,980
- That was right on your chest.

56
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,820
- It was right on your chest.

57
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,820
- It was touching your chest over and over.

58
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,880
So this weekend, I forgot I didn't tell you about this.

59
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,480
So this weekend, my friend Charlie had a runway show

60
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,400
for his clothing line, capsulecollection.love.

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
Go check it out.

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,120
- This fucker better be paying us money.

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,680
- He's gonna give me a shirt.

64
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,760
- Well, you plugged it on my show,

65
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,360
so I'm gonna need a shirt as well.

66
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
- You can also get a shirt from him.

67
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,200
- I think I'm gonna have to hit up Charlie and get a shirt.

68
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
So Charlie had this runway show where he hired a pit bull impersonator.

69
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,080
Dog or guy?

70
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,320
Guy.

71
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,880
He was really, he was cool.

72
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,080
Dude. He rocked.

73
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,160
Me and me and Joe got there really late. Um,

74
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,680
or like right at the last second. And the only seat left was like, right.

75
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,840
It was like a really small room and the only seat left was like right up at like

76
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
the very front. So we were literally,

77
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,600
we were just sitting like probably like less than a foot away from the pit bull

78
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,640
guy though the whole time. Well, then he started,

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,240
he started walking around and dancing,

80
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,920
- He started walking around dancing.

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,120
- He was throwing a fit.

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,640
That's what we were right next to him for.

83
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,480
He was, though, like,

84
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,360
speakers and microphone and stuff weren't working.

85
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,000
- Yeah, well, so Charlie told me he requested

86
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,600
specifically to use his own MP3 files.

87
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Like, Charlie was like,

88
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,800
"Oh, I can just play the Pitbull songs off of Spotify."

89
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,400
And he said, "No, these are louder."

90
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,240
(laughing)

91
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,520
- Whoa.

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,360
- Was like insistent,

93
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,080
"Hold on, I have his business card somewhere on my wall."

94
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,680
- But yeah, he was throwing a fit.

95
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,960
he was like, can you not make it louder? It was working a second ago. What's

96
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:58,640
going on? And he just like wouldn't get, he wouldn't like relax. Um, and the

97
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,760
pitbull impersonator was a diva. He was a huge diva. And then, and then that he

98
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,320
like, um, he was like, well, if it's not going to work, like he also said he was

99
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,120
a standup comedian at one point. Cool. And he's like, well, if it's not going

100
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,920
to work, I'll just like do my thing. Look at him, dude. That's him. That's

101
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,000
nothing like pitbull. Wow. I think I could do a better. He was like, I think

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,200
think you should he he made a lot of money. He he was like I'm just going to

103
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,320
do my thing and he like started walking around and he's talking. The microphone

104
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:30,400
is not on, but he's talking into the microphone just yelling and he's just

105
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:30,800
going

106
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,360
to Charlie. He started saying he started saying what they won't tell you is that

107
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,600
grains have zero nutritional value. The food pyramid is lying to you. The FDA

108
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,720
they're fools. They're lying to you, doctor Oz. He's not a real doctor.

109
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,480
It's all fake and and it and it makes sense because think about it Oz, the

110
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,880
wizard of Oz, they saw the wizard of Oz and they look behind the curtain. It

111
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,680
was just a little guy pretending faking to be something larger. Doctor Oz

112
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,360
everyone's going crazy and I was in the back. I was in the back waiting to

113
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
walk, but there was like a you know we're trying to figure out the technical

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
difficulty. So he just cooked for like five minutes. He was going for a long

115
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,880
time. He also said that a gave syrup as you should you will give you diabetes.

116
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,180
he said tequila is his favorite liquor, but he said no what

117
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,780
happened what happened was he was like he was like yeah, you

118
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,080
can't eat agave syrup.

119
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:24,280
It'll give you diabetes and then somebody in the audience was

120
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,780
like well, you don't you like do you not like tequila and then

121
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,480
he said he like he like got like in their face and he was like

122
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,680
well, that's a different form of agave syrup.

123
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,680
So like he was like super aggressive to like whenever somebody

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,280
would like quite like a few people like questioned him or

125
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,780
something and he and what I forget what what he said he said something and one

126
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,440
one girl was like said something that was like no that's not true and he like

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,920
he was like what's your name stand up

128
00:05:51,920 --> 00:06:01,840
so cool so at the end of the show name huh do you know the person is Steven

129
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,640
Steven yeah I mean I have a Steven I would just like to put him on a little

130
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,400
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna put on Charlie. We got a Charlie. I think Charlie deserves it

131
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,360
I think Steve. No, I think Stephen is people did a better job

132
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,840
I've gotten more about Stephen from this story than it was

133
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,200
So they're like the show's over and I was like getting a photo with him

134
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,280
I had cam take a picture and then cam said like oh you guys look like brothers

135
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,520
Yeah, and then the guy was like, I'll have what he's having and pointed at Cam

136
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:45,600
I'll have whatever he's on. Yeah, he's a multi person impersonator. Yeah, he can

137
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,000
impersonate anybody from any movie or any musician. Yeah, exactly.

138
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Yeah, and I did the joke of just making like like looking like really confused

139
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,040
and then saying you're being really weird right now man, which I think is I

140
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,080
guess it's a funny thing to do to like your friend but probably very rude to do

141
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,320
to a pitbull impersonator. I think Stephen knows how to roll. He didn't. No I think he

142
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,360
did. If you think he didn't that means he got you. So I was backstage changing out of

143
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:17,320
the clothes and then the pitbull impersonator walks up to me and is like, "Man, what is

144
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:27,240
up with your friend? Does he not smoke?" And I was like, "No, he's straight edge. He's

145
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,120
never done a thing in his life and the pitbull impersonator went blank. He was like, man,

146
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,240
because like I think if he did smoke or drink or something, he probably would have had the

147
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,280
prior experience and probably would have understand because I said I'll have whatever he's on,

148
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:48,280
which I meant like if he's on drugs thinking that we look like brothers, then I want what

149
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:56,120
he has. I want what he has then. But if he does nothing, then like he probably wouldn't

150
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:03,160
get the joke. And then I was back there for like, I was just trying to put my pants back

151
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,620
on. I'm back there for like, like five minutes because he's like trying to explain the joke.

152
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,760
This makes me wish I had gone. Dude, you should have come. Dude, I got my license plate stolen.

153
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,440
Oh shit. Yeah, I couldn't couldn't make it out because I got my license plate stolen.

154
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,640
But what? They just stole it off my car, dude. What are you, what, what's the benefit of

155
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:33,240
doing that. So if you do a crime you switch out the plates with stolen plates. I know

156
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,440
this from GTA 5. I think yeah it's a put on a stolen car. Okay. Yes that it's less easy

157
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,040
to it's untraceable. Yeah. But then they'll trace it back. Yeah to the stolen. They'll

158
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,280
pull this person over in a Lamborghini and be like are you driving is this some kind

159
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:53,760
of body kit for a 2009 Ford Focus. Yeah. Well it's also it's also pretty bad for you because

160
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,800
you've made some threats in your lifetime. Yeah, maybe that that might not show up. Well,

161
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,800
if if the police I think the police aren't going to aren't going to immediately give

162
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,880
you a chance here. Luckily cars not in my name. I am worried about the thing is I have

163
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,040
luckily attached those plates. I probably have eight hundred and fifty dollars in unpaid

164
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:20,320
tolls and tickets to the state of New York. I really I made money by them stealing my

165
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,160
my plates yeah like what like yeah, we I wouldn't they're going to bring it

166
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,920
they're going to bring the plates because I'm going to get I'm going to

167
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,220
order some new plates brand fresh start. You know blank slate blank. Can

168
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:33,040
you is that is it does it work the same as like a debit card?

169
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,380
Yeah, license plate works the same as a like when you get a new card, it

170
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,140
cancels all your other subscriptions. No, not really subscriptions to

171
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:43,680
tickets.

172
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,860
It cancels your netflix yeah, honestly it might have been a fucking like it

173
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,580
might have been a parking cop who fucking just took my plate. They're

174
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,140
just so sick of writing me tickets. It's like easier to just if I look up

175
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,160
that would be so sick if it overwrites your tickets or whatever and you can

176
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,240
and that would be the best way to do fraud. That yeah, oh yeah, my my

177
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,320
plate got my plate got stolen. Do you guys ever get a rent like I don't

227
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,080
been playing this game called tune blast tune blast or no Royal match.

228
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,240
You get tune blast tune blast and Royal match are made by the same company. Oh

229
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,760
and that's maybe you make it's just candy crush in a castle. Oh, okay,

230
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:03,080
instead of the candy what do you have squares all of them are square triangles

231
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:11,920
so shapes shapes shapes okay and I'm on level 73 Wow nice that's pretty good I

232
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,400
was getting a bunch of salt air on my phone solitaire is good what's do you

233
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,040
know what's do you know what the average win rate is for solitaire I'm not sure if

234
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,880
I have a higher low win rate I think I probably have a pretty low hands on it

235
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Do you do a random deck?

236
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,880
I assume so.

237
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,440
I think a random deck is...

238
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,760
It's just a solitaire app.

239
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
I don't know.

240
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,200
Speaking of apps, I got this new app.

241
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay, I'm going to say my win rate is 12.96%.

242
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,640
Think for a random deck, that's about it.

243
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,640
It's about 10%.

244
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
I got this new app.

245
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,840
It's called Supercook and you just put in food in your pantry and then it tells you

246
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,240

260
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,440
Amazon reviews last night it's not letting me read it I was looking at

261
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,600
Amazon reviews for all the all the the sex toys I was looking for a sex toy

262
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:45,560
that was and I found it it was just it's two boobs with a pussy and a butthole on

263
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,440
the bottom of the boots. Yeah. Why are you looking that up? I was just curious and I

264
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:59,120
found a bunch of reviews and they were all it was like 50 reviews in a row just

265
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,560
saying that the holes were too big.

266
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:10,080
Here's another one, milk macaroni. Oh that sounds good. I used to love that. Let me

267
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,280
redo this recipe. There's a oldie goldie from from Yvonne Soane's childhood.

268
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:21,120
Okay. Add your pre-cooked pasta and milk together in a pan as if you were making

269
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,840
soup. Heat until warm, add salt and pepper and a couple pats of butter. Once the

270
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,800
butter is melted, eat and enjoy. I've had that before, that's fine. Really? It's like Alfredo.

271
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,960
Milk macaroni. You're not putting flour or anything in it, it's just milk and macaroni.

272
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,360
That's okay, there's enough starch on the outside of the pasta that it kind of...

273
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,400
think so Tim. It kind of makes a little bit of a of a of a rue. Back when when

274
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,080
Facebook Messenger was was a thing when people still used that yeah I used to

275
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,600
love they had you know they had like little add-ons that nobody ever used that

276
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,600
you would like be able to like add to it yeah they're like there were some really

277
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,480
good ones but the my favorite one that like I that was you they had like a

278
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,120
recipe add-on so you could just send recipes from like some recipe website

279
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,420

own like a sticker like as its own thing and there would be so many recipes where

281

320
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520

381
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:36,580

395
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,460
you can't mix two cereals

396
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,460

397
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460

402
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,460
and make something else for breakfast

403
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,460

A lot of people were getting diarrhea. I get diarrhea. I don't notice if I get diarrhea.

Lucky Charms has been going on for a while. I didn't know it was Honey Nut Cheerios.

Something is happening at the Lucky Charms factory. Yeah, something's going on ever since that freaking shrimp.

409
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,140
I guess that was Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

440
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,460
of marijuana. When you smoke it, you cough the first thing you do is put

441
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:11,860

Listen, I saw some piece of fucking dog shit dope fiend, right? Lighten up, he's

450
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,280
middle of his living room with the windows open, okay? And you know what I

451
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,840
was thinking? I was thinking, you know what I'd really like right now is a red

452
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,240
sniper dot directly on this guy's neck brace through his window and I'd like

453
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,840
for somebody to shoot his trachea.

454
00:26:58,840 --> 00:26:59,720
Absolutely.

455
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,040
So that he can, hey, try smoking dope now, buddy.

456
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
It's gonna fly out of the hole in your neck.

457
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,040
You know what I saw? I saw this bald woman

458
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
Yeah.

459
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Eating an edible.

460
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Yeah, and it's like, listen, first of all

461
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
She's at the hospital and she looked sick.

462
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
And she looked sick probably because of the dope.

463
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Here's what's happening, okay?

464
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
She's bald. She's a lesbo. Okay?

465
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
She's a complete lesbo. Right?

466
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
And she's a dopehead. Right?

467
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
And why is she at the hospital?

468
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
Cause she's done with her dopehead

469
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
fucking starter drug and she's trying to get opiates.

470
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,960
opiates. Yeah, going in there, faking menstrual blood or she can get a

471
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:41,160
prescription for you know. I hear what I hear what dopers will do nowadays is

472
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,600
even before they'll go to the hospital and some of them they're not you know

473
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,760
they're not even they don't even have the courage to upgrade opiates, but

474
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,760
they'll go to the hospital. I think how can I get my hands on more dope? I

475
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,960
don't want to I don't have to get in a car with my my my my dirty dope dealer

476
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,560
no more. I need I need to legitimize this and I hear what they'll do is

477
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:03,160
go into the hospital, they'll complain that they have rot in one of their limbs,

478
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,560
they'll get it amputated, and they'll get a special card that lets the government

479
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,360
throw dope in their mouths like a freaking clown game at the arcade.

480
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,360
It absolutely is.

481
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,600
It's a, yeah, that's what it is.

482
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
It's Nintendon.

483
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,640
I've seen these rectangle dopers, they've got no arms, no legs, they're crawling

484
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,280
around like an inchworm, trying to put their mouth on a drainage pipe just to

485
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,480
suck out some dope additives.

486
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,680
And you know these dispensaries are just giving them more, they're putting more stuff in the

487
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,200
truck so that people can get rot.

488
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
It's true.

489
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,920
They're trying to get more rot in their limbs so that they can be removed by a plastic surgeon

490
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,200
so that they can deal with the quote unquote pain.

491
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,880
I mean this fucking dope.

492
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,960
It feels amazing to lose a limb.

493
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,520
People did these, first of all, when dope started out, people were like we have a nation

494
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,520
of zombies.

495
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,640
You know, but more and more it's looking like we're going to have more of a nation of mummies.

496
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,480
I'd like to bring you--

497
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,920
- 'Cause they are a mummy, right?

498
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,920
- Yup, they're covered in bandages.

499
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,760
- I'd like to bring you guys--

500
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
- Their arms and legs are falling off.

501
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,960
There's sand everywhere, their skin is turning to sand.

502
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,120
- I'd like to bring you guys back

503
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,080
to a different time and place, okay?

504
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,440
- Okay, I hope it's not-- - Ancient Egypt.

505
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
- I hope it's not ancient Egypt, B.C.

506
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,200
'cause that's where all the mummies are.

507
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,240
- It's 1969, right?

508
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,280
We start the Vietnam War, okay?

509
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:24,120
- Awesome.

510
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,460
- Nobody wants to go, right?

511
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,300
until a couple of these--

512
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,620
- Because, why don't they wanna go?

513
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,140
- Until a couple of these hippies get an idea,

514
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,660
somebody says, a war man recruiter says,

515
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,660
"Hey, who wants to go to Vietnam and get PTSD

516
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,620
"and get all your limbs blown off?"

517
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,740
And all these dopers go, "Oh, me, me, me, me, me!"

518
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,260
Because one day there's gonna be a place

519
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,780
called concierge dispensary where I can deal

520
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,260
with my quote-unquote pain and quote-unquote

521
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,020
lost foot and PTSD with a Skittle.

522
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,500
free dope for pillow humans. Yeah, exactly. Right. And now all of a

523
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:01,160
sudden you got these guys, they wear American flag bandanas, they

524
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,220
pretend they're homeless, and then they turn around, they go outside

525
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:09,140
and they actually have a 1994 Ford Focus and parked in the back of

526
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,020
the grocery store. And they're walking into the dope dispensary.

527
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,100
It's like, yeah, give me this. Give me the strongest pen that you

528
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,740
have. Give me a drug. Give me a strain of dope called the Hitler's

529
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:26,740
killer yeah Hitler's pussy it's like so fucked up from the war that oh I have to

530
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:30,400
think about times when I killed people like but you know what awesome and you

531
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,220
know what they were doing in Vietnam they're smoking the weed out of a

532
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,020
shotgun that's right as they wanted I mean they could get more weed yeah these

533
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:42,540
quote-unquote veteran dopers okay there I mean there they're coming back here

534
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,540
they're coming back here to the to you the u.s. to get more free dope there were

535
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,940
there you know they're they're waddling into these to these dispensaries they

536
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,540
They look like Freddy Krueger's finger under these tie-dyed shirts, okay?

537
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,540
These dopers with no arms and no legs are getting pulled into dispensaries, pushed into dispensaries

538
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
on a dolly.

539
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:02,820
They look like, folks, they look like Floops Fuglies.

540
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,540
Yup, and they're being just completely just tossed into dispensaries like bricks through

541
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,540
a window.

542
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:13,540
They're saying, you know what, there's a guy who pulls them, pushes them in on a hand truck

543
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:18,060
and then drops it on the floor and then they're face down on the ground like, "Could I have

544
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:24,860
It's like, okay, they're coming in and they're like, "Alright, my arms and legs were pulled

545
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:30,140
off by a robotic arm at the Ford Focus Factory, but you know what I haven't lost yet?

546
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,140
My mind."

547
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,180
And listen, I know how to fix that.

548
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,020
I'll smoke a freaking pack of dope.

549
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,700
It's going to pull up my brain right out of the top of my head like an Egyptian mummy.

550
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,580
I want to taint it with weed cigarettes and give myself mummy rocks.

551
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:47,060
Some of these grass heads are actually even genius artists, unfortunately, and we've lost

552
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:51,800
some of them. Speaking of, Nirvana's own Kurt Cobain, he stuck a shotgun into his

553
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,860
mouth because he thought it was a slice of pizza because he was so high and

554
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,860
now he's dead like a mummy. Yep. Same with Jimi Hendrix. He threw up because he

555
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:04,460
smoked so much. And he thought that his throw up was pizza. Yeah. And now he's

556
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,600
dead like a mummy. And Jim Morrison was eating pizza in the tub underwater. Yep.

557
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,420
And now he's dead like a mummy. Mm-hmm. You can't eat pizza underwater. Most psychotic

558
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,060
spree killers or dopers.

559
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,260
- Yeah. - Okay, but even beyond that,

560
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,820
the ones who don't go out and rat-a-tat-tat

561
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,540
kill a million humans, you realize what lives

562
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,060
on the dope plant is insects and ants.

563
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,220
- That's the thing. - And they get burned up

564
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,700
and killed when a doper smokes the dope.

565
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,580
- Look at-- - And the bug goes

566
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,420
in their brain and is so mad at the human race.

567
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,820
- They got spider webs in there.

568
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,100
- Yeah. - Take a look, you loo,

569
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:40,980
at the row of mass shooters we've had

570
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,780
in the last 20 years, right?

571
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:47,340
James Holmes and all those guys looks like a fucking fish concert okay that's

572
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,580
what it looks like when you look at these guys all right yeah eyes are blood

573
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:55,140
shocked right they have completely blood shocked eyes yeah and they're looking at

574
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,860
you at that fucking THC Delta 9 stare yeah right yeah and they probably thought

575
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:04,020
that all these kiddies walking around the school were slices of pizza yeah and

576
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,860
they needed to cook them yeah they're big pizza gun yeah cuz that's what dope

577
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,500
does to your brain it makes you who okay the Boston shooters think about it we're

578
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:15,660
getting that strong that strong key Kong from the Middle East yeah right getting

579
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,020
it shipped over to the brothers right the two brothers of the two dope brothers of

580
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,940
Boston I thought you were talking about the middle and you know what you know

581
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:26,020
what they thought you know what they thought they thought that the pressure

582
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,380
cookers that they dropped and the they were cooking a pizza they thought that

583
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,420
they were just cooking as damn pizza in a volcano vape right and all of a sudden

584
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,620
you got and don't get me started five years later Mark Wahlberg's making a

585
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,580
movie with no legs right and guess how that guy treated his no legs in Rome

586
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:45,500
yep smoking smoking goes all the way to the top of the hip all the way to the

587
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,380
bottom of the ground which is where the guy was cuz you know any legs you know

588
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:53,740
and I mean think about Benson listen he's about to think about these um

589
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,700
these these types of these bands that dopers will listen to I mean I seriously

590
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:03,660
a band called the great full dead it's great to be dead no hole also none of

591
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,460

593
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:22,340

594
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,620
about this shit Doug Benson listen super high you yeah I wouldn't even say hi to

Mm-hmm getting dug with high buddy. The name doesn't make it's wrong

598
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,300
This fucking idiot got so completely mistaken that he swapped two words in his own

599
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:55,460
How are you gonna? How is that show gonna look professional? That's like list about podcast

600
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,060
Oh, that doesn't make any sense

601
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,940
That way if we were so high when we named the show that we named it that wouldn't that be some fucking bullshit

602
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:07,480
That would fucking be dog shit Lee bullshit. That'd be the worst thing that's ever happened. I'm sick

603
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:14,420
I'm sick of these I'm sick. No, I'm sick. No, I'm actually fucking sick. You're sick. Yeah, I'm sick

604
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,820
And I guess what the doc you can't go to the doctor. I can't go cuz they're gonna describe you describe me

605
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,020
Yep, they're gonna prescribe you don't prescribe me dope weed

606
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:24,060
You know what kind of I have phantom limb and you know for a bigger penis

607
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,020
penis. You know what else these dope freakers are doing? What? You think about

608
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:33,540
the earth, right? They say that it comes from the middle one. Millions of years

609
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,820
ago, okay? Well, that's a third argument, but sure. The earth, the green. Yeah.

610
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:45,660
Green and blue planet, okay? Nowadays, earth is grey and brown and yellow and

611
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:51,740
golden and silver and red and black and white, but it's much less green. Do you

612
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:55,100
why it's much less green. They're smoking. The dopers, they take the green, they turn

613
00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:00,900
it brown. Yep. And it turns their insides brown, it turns their shoulders red, and

614
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,780
then it turns their arms black and gray. And they're combining

615
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,340
the green and the blue in a bong and just using up all of these resources.

616
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:14,700
Exactly. Yeah, where's the water go? Depleting. Where does the bong water go? They waste it.

617
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:19,180
They don't even use it. Because they're waste. You could filter that bong water and start

618
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,420
making spaghetti for homeless people. You could found a desert city

619
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:28,660
mm-hmm with that water. You could found the city and with the the glass oh my

620
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:35,340
god a futuristic glass city with water and green grass. It would have been

621
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,660
amazing but instead it would have been Babylon and I'm not talking about

622
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,980
the Babylon that Bob Marley that fucking dopehead was talking about. No no no no

623
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:46,140
no. Listen Jamaica listen I don't want to say it but it should be just

624
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,840
completely wiped off the face of the planet. I wouldn't say that. Just completely one giant wave, just a

625
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,440
wrath of God should just wipe it out with one single wave. I think I think that they

626
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,380
should just make weed illegal there. Jamaica should just be nuclearly exploded. Are you kidding me? Wait, no no no.

627
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,240
I do not understand why God hasn't done something about dope. Do you, could you

628
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,760
imagine how how less spicy Jamaican jerk wings would be if they weren't smoking

629
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,660
weed when they did exactly so we got the recipe listen Jamaica you gave us the

630
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:23,520
recipe buddy now get the boot we're sending you to Mars that's happening

631
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,880
red planet not a way not a speck of green to be seen God that that should be a

632
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,920
penal colony that's right oprah's mm-hmm they'll do I mean those dopers they'll

633
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,560
probably I mean some of these some of those over smoking alien and probably

634
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,440
try to smoke a green alien yeah but some of these dopers I mean they they go

635
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,640
without their green for practically one second,

636
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,400
they're throwing up, they're shitting their pants.

637
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,240
- You know who I would have trusted?

638
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,800
- They're clawing at their own face.

639
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,440
- I would have trusted Sir Elon Musk

640
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,840
to send these dope heads to Mars,

641
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,920
but then he actually joined their ranks

642
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,600
by going on Joe Token and actually lighting up

643
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,360
in front of millions. - That was so disappointing.

644
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,240
- I mean, he was honestly a hero of mine, right?

645
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,920
I had always wanted to make a car.

646
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,040
- I mean, what's next, an electrical way to smoke weed?

647
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,360
Is that what Elon Musk is-- - It's fucking disgusting.

648
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,200
That's probably what he's working on.

649
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,720
- A cigarette powered by electricity?

650
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,320
Oh, we're gonna waste the electricity, too. It's not enough to take the green and

651
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,920
the blue out of the earth and the glass. The other day, this is actually true, I'm

652
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,280
not making this up at all, I was at CVS and a lady got started talking to the

653
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,560
they it's like one of the CVS's where they have a cop that stays there because

654
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,280
there's so much so many people like stealing shit, probably dope heads by the

655
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,360
way, but she said something about she's like I bet you light up when you get

656
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,640
home and he said yeah it's legal and she said I used to light up in the 90s and

657
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,720
and then my cousin who is one of the beat cops in my neighborhood used to chase me

658
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,960
down the street with a taser.

659
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,320
So it actually tears families apart. It does tear families apart. Literally their arms and legs are

660
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,640
being torn off.

661
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,880
Torn limb from limb because they'll walk into a wild chimpanzee cage

662
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,800
just so they can get their hands ripped off so they can smoke weed. Listen, Charlotte Nash,

663
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,080
there's a reason why she told the monkey, she said, "Rip

664
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,680
everything off except my mouth so I can still smoke weed."

665
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,000
Yeah. And that's what he did. It weakens your joints and your ligaments.

666
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,780
yeah it does. A doper will try to hold the door open their arm will fall onto the ground

667
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:12,960
the door will pull. Like a leper. The door will pull off the arm

668
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,720
when they open it. It'll look like sponge bob. That's why there aren't any dopers that have

669
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,440
automatic doors in their houses.

670
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,880
Don't even get me started on. See like me I have an automatic door. I have an automatic door too it's so

671
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,960
convenient I love it

672
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,320
the bathroom door an automatic door every time someone walks by it opens I can see

673
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,440
who's what's going on

674
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,560
and it's glass. And you go to downtown. It's a 7-eleven on it

675
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,760
You go to any major city--

676
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,060
I installed it two weeks ago.

677
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:38,560
You go to downtown LA, Skid Row, right?

678
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,560
It's called Skid Row because you smoke so much weed

679
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,560
that you believe Skid Marks in your pants.

680
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,560
It was founded by dopers in the '60s.

681
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,960
And you walk around, these people are zombies.

682
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,460
They're looking at you.

683
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,960
They're going, come watch Fantasia with us.

684
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,160
Come watch Disney's Fantasia.

685
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,660
Yeah.

686
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,960
I'm like, I don't want to watch Fantasia.

687
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,760
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

688
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,160
Do you realize Chernobog is a fucking demon?

689
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,660
You do realize that a broom can't actually walk.

690
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,780
you are literally gaining satanic and change and entertainment. We're gonna

691
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:08,260
watch a Disney property. We're probably gonna watch Mickey Mouse Clubhouse or

692
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,900
we're gonna watch one of the Scrooge McDuck films. Right? I don't want to watch

693
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:17,140
Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers. Mickey go and he's dancing with hippos. Listen, a

694
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,780
hippo's a boy. They got him dressed up in tutus. These dopers too,

695
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:24,620
they'll want to watch a Disney movie like Frozen. Yeah. It's like, don't

696
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:28,540
you realize this movie is so subversive? It's ruining the image of

697
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:32,940
princes to discuss people think princes are evil now because of yep because one

698
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,900
of the donors at Disney are making these dope movies one of the biggest dopers of

699
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,540
all Walt Disney cut off his own head yeah he got he got the right is the right

700
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,900
spread to his body he cut off his own damn head yep I heard rose that thing so

701
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,660
that he could smoke more later I'm a high-ranking frozen uh-huh about his

702
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,540
damn head I heard that high-ranking Disney employees and officials actually

703
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:00,260
get to use Walt Disney's head as a bong because it gets it gets him high to well

704
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:04,340
he's in well he's in their color of the bronze fucking surprise. Well he's in

705
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:10,740
his brain yep. I will be discussing what dopers do to the society now Cheech and

706
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,780
Chong don't even get me started on Cheech Marin and Chong Marin on marine

707
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,420
yeah Tommy Chong. How come they go listen these dopers are so stupid it

708
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:26,300
have been called Marin and Chong or Tommy and Cheech. But they went first name,

709
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:33,220
last name. And who's and? Yeah. Which one of them is and? Probably the

710
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,380
same guy from the and one shirts. Oh that guy's a serious dopehead.

711
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:42,780
Yeah right? He's so rude. And the dope turns people rudely mean. I don't think because if he

712
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,300
if he smoked he wouldn't have been able to do any of that. The sad part is the

713
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:51,060
weed has actually infested our sports culture where you have celebrities NBA

714
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:57,100
players like Lamar Odom who admit to marijuana abuse yeah yeah they don't

715
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:01,660
even start on bill admit it they think it's okay was I think it was weed he had

716
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:08,420
to he had to leave one of the sexy sexy Kardashians to go to rehab rehab really

717
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:12,260
yeah because the weed actually made him a compulsive liar I wish

718
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:17,620
that these dopers instead of going to rehab would head to Dhab and be

719
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,660
completely eliminated from the face of the planet.

720
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,660
Which would go to 8 by whale.

721
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,160
Yep.

722
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:29,040
I think it should be a I think it should be like the dead space eyeball machine.

723
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,380
Yep. I think so.

724
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,380
Yeah and I think it should be called Dhab.

725
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,780
Mm-hmm. I think a drill should be just

726
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
Don't even get me started.

727
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,780
Shoved right through them like Bioshock.

728
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
Don't even get me started on Seth Rogen.

729
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
Seth Rogen, his buddy.

730
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,780
Listen, but the Rogen brothers, they're a couple of fucking potheads, right?

731
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,780
And listen, Snoop Dogg, you're liable too.

732
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Willie Nelson, I want you to get by a train.

733
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,780
All you people are fucking disgusting.

734
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
You need to stop glorifying!

735
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,780
Stop it right now!

736
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,780
Stop glorifying smoking weed to little kids!

737
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:02,780
It's not right. It's not cool.

738
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,780
If you glorify smoking, I will kill you.

739
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:09,780
If you glorify smoking a single joint in front of a child, I will actually fucking strangle you.

740
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
And you know what? Don't even smoke.

741
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,780
Don't even smoke!

742
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,780
And don't you dare!

743
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Don't glorify or even do it!

744
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,780
Don't you dare!

745
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,780
Stop smoking right now!

746
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
Culture! Culture! American culture!

747
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,780
You listen to me! You better stop smoking!

748
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,780
But cigarettes are fine. Smoke cigarettes.

749
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:33,780
Cigarettes actually remove a lot of the harmful THC molecules that actually go into your lungs.

750
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,780
Cigarettes are the anti-weed.

751
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,780
Exactly. Think about it.

752
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:46,540
about it. They use it also, also, listen, we're talking about dope turns you to a mummy, it

753
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:50,620
uses up the green and blue to the earth, turns it sandy like Egypt. A cigarette, what's it

754
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,720
wrapped in? White paper. What's a mummy wrapped in? White paper. The cigarette uses up the

755
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,900
white paper and it prevents mummies from being created.

756
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,580
And I smoke a cigarette, I feel exactly like Napoleon Bonaparte, right? And I'm out there

757
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:07,220
And I'm slaying all of the weedheads.

758
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,220
Yeah.

759
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,220
All of the poor weedheads.

760
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:11,220
You know who smoked cigarettes?

761
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,220
Who?

762
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,220
Clint Eastwood.

763
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,220
That's right.

764
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,220
And you know who else smoked cigarettes?

765
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:16,220
Who?

766
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,220
Cowboy.

767
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,220
Cowboy.

768
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,220
Who's a cowboy?

769
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,220
Yeah, I feel like a cowboy.

770
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:22,660
And I feel just like a cowboy.

771
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,660
And a Napoleon Bonaparte when I smoke a cigarette.

772
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,980
See, weed turns you into a sissy.

773
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,220
Uh-huh.

774
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,060
Cigarettes turn you into a macho man.

775
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,120
- A macho man. - A macho man

776
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:34,220
who's not afraid to tell these chairs what's up.

777
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,160
- Yep. - That's right.

778
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,820
- Exactly, just like Clint Eastwood.

779
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:37,660
- Clint Eastwood. - He goes,

780
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:40,760
"These chairs, this chair represents all the dope heads."

781
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,600
- Yeah. - And you might think

782
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,400
it's okay to mix cigarettes and weed,

783
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,300
but it's not okay.

784
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,260
You know what happens?

785
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,020
You know who did that, who's famous?

786
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,260
- Who? - Lil Nas X.

787
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,220
- That's true.

788
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:50,380
- And it's, you know what they call it?

789
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,620
It's called a split, right?

790
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,180
- 'Cause you split weed and cigarette.

791
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,120
- Yeah, and it splits your reality

792
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:59,300
where half of your brain, your left side,

793
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,100
your more creative side is into nicotine now.

794
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,000
- Yeah. - And your right brain,

795
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,380
your robotic, mathematic brain is so high on weed

796
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:08,740
that it actually loses its ability to count and do--

797
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,580
- It defunctions.

798
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,460
- Just basic division and multiplication.

799
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:14,780
- Scientifically, it's called de-stop.

800
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,620
- It's de-stopping.

801
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,860
- It de-stops. - Yeah.

802
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,740
So basically, weed is actually going to,

803
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,980
and it also closes your third eye, right?

804
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:21,820
- Yeah. - Oh, yeah.

805
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,460
- So what is known to open your third eye?

806
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,540
- Cigarettes. - Nicotine,

807
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,640
fluoride, hamburger meat. - Paper.

808
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,660
- McDonald's. - Paper.

809
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:31,060
Yeah, the paper around a McDonald's burger.

810
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,060
If you eat pretty much any--

811
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:32,900
You know what it is?

812
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,140
It's when you try to eat the cheese,

813
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,580
when you get a hearty stick burger

814
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,180
and the cheese gets stuck to the paper

815
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:38,320
and you eat the cheese off.

816
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,160
That's yester--

817
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,840
And listen, I don't wanna keep harping on this.

818
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,020
I don't wanna keep harping on this,

819
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:44,580
but what color is the McDonald's paper?

820
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,240
Okay, and the cheese, they're yellow.

821
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,900
What color is the sand and pyramids?

822
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,060
Yellow, you're using up the yellow.

823
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,940
Stop.

824
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,380
The dopers are trying to turn this to Egypt.

825
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:55,700
They wanted to be ancient Egypt again.

826
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,380
Listen, buddy, you know who built the pyramid?

827
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,220
Tutankhamun.

828
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,060
Slaves.

829
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,900
- Uh-huh.

830
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,740
- And you know,

831
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,580
- Weed heads want slavery to come back.

832
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,300
- Dopers are slaves to the dope.

833
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,140
- Yeah.

834
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:05,220
- Weed heads want slavery to come back

835
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,700
so that we have slaves out there

836
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,020
picking all their weed plants in the fields.

837
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,860
That's what they want.

838
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,820
- Yep, that's exactly what they want.

839
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:13,220
- That's what weeders want.

840
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:16,900
- Okay, if you play Doug Benson's Super High Me Backwards.

841
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,500
- It says, I want a slave.

842
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:19,340
- I want a weed slave.

843
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,500
- I want a slave to pick my weed.

844
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:22,700
- It's fucking disgusting.

845
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,060
And honestly, he needs to be executed by a military tribunal.

846
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:26,900
- Mm-hmm.

847
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,140
Yeah, and I should probably get his bones.

848
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:32,140
Can't trust the military nowadays.

849
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,140
Yep, also here's the thing, these weed heads

850
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,140
they think it's extraordinary, like Doug Benson.

851
00:46:36,140 --> 00:46:38,140
He thinks that it's worth a podcast

852
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,140
that he loves movies. Listen buddy,

853
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,140
I like movies too.

854
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:44,140
Okay, but I'm not walking around saying

855
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,140
"Caleb love movies."

856
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,140
Oh, Caleb love movies.

857
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,140
Cause I'm not fucking addicted to weed.

858
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,140
That's right. Yeah, dopers,

859
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:54,140
they'll start podcasts just for

860
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:56,140
interest that they have.

861
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:00,100
disgusting instead of for money yeah that's why you actually do a party and

862
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,900
to spread an important message yeah

863
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,500
what's the next list item

864
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:22,020
rap dance songs like with crap like watch me hit the Quan and juju on that

865
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,140
that beat getting popular just proves how bad popular pop and rap music is it

866
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,140
today.

867
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,140
Juju on that beat.

868
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,140
I don't think I've heard that one.

869
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:31,460
There's a comment here that says remove

870
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,800
cancers from the title and replace it with annoying.

871
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,800
Or weed.

872
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,800
Yeah.

873
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,340
All right we're not going to get in there.

874
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,960
Number three is twerking and here's the top comment from top ten ted.

875
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,140
This is supposed to be from tribal Africa, but it was obviously more

876
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,940
tolerable as it was an ancient tribal dance.

877
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:51,940
Now it's for perverted men to gaze upon the buttocks.

878
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:54,340
the Charleston has died in place of this for

879
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,560
the Charleston is God

880
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,520
to these

881
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:07,520
dopers killed the Charles killed the Charleston and bastardized the twerk

882
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:12,320
the ancient warrior dance. The power puff girls are twerking my childhood is

883
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,860

You should be using your butt to wipe. I know your hand to wipe your butt. Yeah or

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,620
he was yelling at her. She was like shut the fuck up, fuck you, fuck you, and

899
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:23,000
much and I crashed my car. You crashed your car. Yeah, I was too busy watching

from I hate school. It's very sexual. If you think about it damn Daniel, that's

903
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,960
what they said. Isn't it about it? It's a Lena Dunham said it's one of the

904
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:45,040
biggest pieces of queer performance art of 2016 damn Daniel is yeah. I mean it

905
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:49,400
I thought it was a guy with no shoes on. No, he has shoes on that are white.

906
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,400
White shoes on. White vans. What's the matter with having white shoes?

907
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,960
It's, I guess it's a Cornelina Dunham, it's queer. Queer? So wait, so the video the

908
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:01,400
guy calls this... There's that MF Doom song where he says why do all you college boys

909
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:09,320
wear those... His name was Daniel. Daniel? Daniel Doomile. Oh. Damn you'll... Oh it's all

910
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:14,520
starting to make sense. Yeah. Yeah. MF Doom. Doom Daniel. You know what I always thought was funny

911
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,980
funny about damn Daniel, you know in the video he was like Dom Daniel. He has

912
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:23,640
like that kind of accent. You know Dom Daniel is a name for hell. Whoa damn wow

913
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,760
yeah, D O M Daniel, a little bit of it's like a circle of hell or something

914
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,720
trying to make a little bit of sense, not a lot of sense, but a little bit yeah

915
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,880
pretty interesting.

916
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:39,320
No meme is worse than oh no my bad. It's a final cavernous hall at the bottom of

917
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:44,500
the ocean where evil magician spirits and gnomes meet Dom Daniel. That's

918
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:48,120
a lot different. It's from it's from Arabian that sounds like actually

919
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:52,300
fucking heaven Arabian nights. What's that? It's a movie Arabian nights. Is

920
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,080
that a song for is a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales compiled in

921
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,100
Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age. So it's like Middle Eastern. It's fairy

922
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:07,940
tales. What you know monkey what about wu kong sun? Oh yeah, monkey, you call

924
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,700
translation is just called monkey yeah, but why that's a stupid name as a way

925
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,820
better name. So what is the way cooler monkey? It's a some book called monkey.

926
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:23,120
It's a good name, but you can't just call it that whatever nobody else would

927
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:27,540
know what it's called. I think people know monkey monkey. So what other book

928
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:30,980
called monkey is there Cameron? I wouldn't know one book called monkey.

929
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:36,220
That's the I know one monkey. It's just funny to say I'm reading monkey. You're

930
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,260
reading monkey. Yes,

931
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,860
I've been reading monkey for a long time.

932
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:44,260
I phase in and out of reading books.

933
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,260
I go in, I'll read 30 pages of a book,

934
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,420
switch to another one.

935
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,480
Yeah. Yeah.

936
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,460
I started reading a book in January

937
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,780
and I have not touched it.

938
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,620
That's nice.

939
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,460
Yeah.

940
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,300
Masters of Atlantis.

941
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:56,380
What's happening in monkey?

942
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,220
What is it?

943
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,700
Masters of Atlantis.

944
00:51:58,700 --> 00:51:59,740
What is it?

945
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:00,580
What's that?

946
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,580
Book.

947
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,920
What's it about?

948
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,700
It's about a guy who starts a cult.

949
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:09,000
Oh, it's not like about like Atlantis.

950
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,320
No, no, I want to read an Atlantis book. I was just read a book about us

951
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:19,080
Port it's about it. It's his name is Portis last name is Portis and he called

952
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:25,960
Whoa the way he's going to Atlantis Charles porpoise. Oh my god, that makes perfect sense. Yeah

953
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:32,080
Yeah, he could have been actually maybe if I reread the book with that lens

954
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:39,900
What's number five number five is Tide Pod Challenge? Oh hell no I actually like this because it actually kind of

955
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:44,080
Thinned the herd yeah, yeah Darwin Awards yep

956
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:52,380
Yep, Darwin Award only drunken people eat Tide Pods. It says Wow Wow okay that must have been written by a doper

957
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:58,780
Yeah, so I guess we're attacking alcohol now. Yeah, this is good for most of your organs

958
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:03,520
This is dangerous whenever I see these I just think wow these people really want to die right now

959
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,780
People that do this challenge are giving themselves a first-class ticket on a ride to their tombstone

960
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,900
tombstone their tombstone

961
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,660
Are actually attacking

962
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,820
Alcohol fans yeah

963
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:20,900
Because alcohol is one of the most like enlightening

964
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:26,180
Psychoactive substances on earth it's it's it's actually within every single molecule

965
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,340
on earth. Because it enhances nicotine. And then when you die, actually a lot of people

966
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:34,180
know this, don't know this, when you die alcohol is secreted by your third eye.

967
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,740
Yeah. So nobody really knows what happens but you might actually enter like an

968
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:43,540
endless kind of blissful state that because of the reality is being warped

969
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:47,060
it feels like eternity to you, just those last couple moments and it's just like

970
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:50,660
that's what heaven is. Yeah. Right, but it's actually just some alcohol. Exactly,

971
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:56,980
Yeah, people with near-death experiences, they often report that in the moment when

972
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,460
their body is dying and it's releasing this alcohol to their third eye, many of

973
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:04,260
them have visions of something horrible they did in fifth grade.

974
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:11,380
Yep, and a lot of times they see geometric shapes like dart boards and...

975
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:16,980
Or like just a big black rectangle that they can just tickle up everything.

976
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:17,980
Yeah.

977
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:25,320
black geometric shape, a black room with nothing in it and no sound at all and

978
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,820
nothing and just nothing. It is nothing which is yeah and that's like the

979
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:33,580
geometric alcohol shape. That's like the spirit of alcohol, the alcohol spirit.

980
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:37,080
Yeah, right. They'll also meet these like some of them. Some people will have a

981
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:40,600
little bit of a longer kind of journey through this hypnagogic realm and

982
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:44,700
they'll they'll meet these supernatural beings called bartenders. Yeah, yeah,

983
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,480
you'll kind of control the bartenders. Yeah, the machine is five of them. Yeah,

984
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,680
and it's a recurring kind of exactly where everybody sees and they'll say

985
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:55,620
they'll say you need to you need to have around. They're still they're also

986
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:59,440
dressed like clowns. Yeah, they are yeah, they're machine bartender clowns.

987
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,680
Yeah, they're jesters. Yeah, the jesters of the alcohol realm yeah, and then

988
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,320
they get thrown out by a bouncer and they come back to life. That's what

989
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:12,820
happens. Yeah, they like pick them up and they throw them back out because

990
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:16,320
alcohol can actually get you laid to which is I guess you hella laid yeah

991
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:21,280
yeah about Tide Pod smart person this is stupid stupid person I should kill

992
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,380
myself doing this garbage true as fuck stupid people also by the way if you

993
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:29,680
have suicidal ideation you're inherently not stupid you're probably really smart

994
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,160
mm-hmm that's probably true yeah probably a spiritual gangster yeah your

995
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,200
spiritual gangster who's clearly experimented with alcohol and you're

996
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:45,200
or yeah yeah number six is bottle flip. Remember this bullshit? Yeah, it's like

997
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,480
listen buddy, you're not supposed to flip the bottle, you're supposed to drink

998
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:53,160
what's in the bottle. Mm-hmm. Maker's mark. Yeah, you're supposed to or you can eat

999
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:56,600
the bottle. You can eat the bottle? You can eat the bottle or if it's like a

1000
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:01,240
wax bottle. I think that every bottle should be wax, should be wax. You can eat

1001
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,600
it or chew on it at the very least. Yeah. Imagine if you got to eat, if you made it

1002
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:09,720
to the bottom of a of a bottle of Don Julio and then you just get to chew on

1003
00:56:09,720 --> 00:56:10,040
it.

1004
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:17,360
If you just get to chew on it yeah, so great that is great great idea. I think

1005
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:21,640
that that could change everything. I think then you drop it doesn't break

1006
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:26,320
yeah. Oh my God, what you're hand about it's bouncy it is so rings on it yeah

1007
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:31,920
yeah or what if what is a wax yeah, it's all made of wax and the floor is all is

1008
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:35,900
all those springs from Sonic and then really ever you drop and listen lower

1009
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,220
as a set of golden rings in here. I would really like to wear golden ring yeah,

1010
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:42,580
but the one thing I would not like to if I get hit drop all my rings. Can I just

1011
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,420
keep here something I like to keep my ring? I'd like to say just one thing

1012
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,460
about Sonic okay.

1013
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:52,780
This fucking game must have been made by doper because where does he keep all

1014
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:57,820
these rings? He has a pouch. He has a pocket and listen. These rings are giant.

1015
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:00,700
He has when I play three hundred of them. He had a high score.

1016
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:09,740
how does he keep these on his body? They shrink. Why? You see the movies. Sonic the Hedgehog

Yeah, and everyone's like, "Oh, wow."

1035
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,220
Yeah, so that's kind of, you can apply that to Sonic, too.

1036
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:15,220
Everyone's like, "Oh, the EPA."

1037
00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:17,420
Everyone says that when he says that.

1038
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:22,740
And then remember, he says, remember when also the president is the Arnold Schwarzenegger

1039
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,640
guy who says, "I pick three."

1040
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,880
when he, remember when they're like on the phone calls and it's like you hang up first,

1041
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,200
no you hang up first and then he's like okay and he hangs up and she goes oh my god he hung

1060
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,540
Disney and Hitler both did this as well as many people who are not important, so

1061
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,580
their names don't matter. I would say no weed smokers ever lived was important,
