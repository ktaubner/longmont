1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
*sips*

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,500
Yeah.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,500
*burps*

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,000
You're listening to Beers We Drank, America's number one beer podcast.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
*record scratch*

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,500
*music*

7
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,000
What's up all my channels?

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm trying to get that burp out there.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
*burps*

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
God, I've never heard it before.

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
*music*

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,060
We drank motherfucker with Juvio Caleb and Rex

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:36,320
Do you think that's the longest theme song in podcasting history live

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:45,680
From beer East I'm Sylvania hop on your barley Davidson. You're late to the hopper. Ah, you've just entered

15
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:51,180
Ever

16
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,520
live

17
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:59,160
Beers we drank guys first of all cheers my friends. Cheers my friends. Shall we cheers?

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,160
All right. Well, you are

19
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,920
Completely showing off already. So I'd like to go ahead and see what you have to drink there. I have a

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,240
Duncan's fight iced tea

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,620
It's a iced tea with lemon

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,380
From Dunkin Donuts. I'm not gonna lie to you dog. That sounds amazing

23
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,200
Not bad. Does it taste like?

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,280
donut

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,280
No, it tastes like iced tea with

26
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,320
Alcohol on it. That sounds amazing. Okay now take a sip

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,920
You know the deal give us a scale one numerical and one basketball player

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,640
Yeah, this is like a 5/8

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,340
Okay, like a like a 5.8 so like

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,640
It's doable, it's serviceable, it'll work.

31
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,640
It tastes like someone left an Arizona iced tea outside for two days and then you found

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,100
it and started drinking it.

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,960
It was cool out, but it was outside for sure.

34
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,960
So it tastes fermented.

35
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,940
It tastes like fermented, probably exactly what it is, fermented tea.

36
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,940
Yeah.

37
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,980
Oh no, it's spiked, sorry.

38
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,980
It's spiked, right.

39
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,220
Does it say what exactly it is spiked with?

40
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,620
Yeah, can you read the whole ingredient list?

41
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,620
Does he have red 40?

42
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,620
Yes or no?

43
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,220
So this is a premium malt beverage

44
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,620
and it doesn't say anything else.

45
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,620
Oh, it's malt.

46
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,220
Slightly sweet with a twist of lemon.

47
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,220
So you're hopping on the barley Davidson.

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,620
Guys, you gave me nothing for the taste tricks re-bloated.

49
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,620
Nobody gave me anything for that.

50
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:43,220
I didn't even see that.

51
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:48,220
I said, I said, you've now entered the Tasterix Rebloaded.

52
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,220
This is a good, this is a good pun.

53
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:57,060
Guys, I had my wife go ahead and pick me up a couple of beers.

54
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,460
This first one I, I am none too happy about.

55
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,820
Guys, this is the Pumpkin Pie Scraper.

56
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,300
This is not my kind of beer.

57
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,380
If you've been following along all these weeks, this is not my kind of beer, man.

58
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,380
This is just not me.

59
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,380
This is a Rex type beer.

60
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:20,100
So, you guys have just gone ahead and done the pumpkin spice, fall, white girl type of

61
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,220
Starbucks type of episode today.

62
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,220
Definitely.

63
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,100
This is a pumpkin ale with vanilla beans, spices, maple syrup, and lactose.

64
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,900
And I'm going to go ahead and give this one a bit of a sip.

65
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:36,380
It's a large beer.

66
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:41,180
Honestly, it's not as sweet as I was anticipating.

67
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:48,620
It's definitely, it's pumpkin-y, it tastes kind of fall-y, you know.

68
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,620
It's decent.

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:58,180
I'm going to give this a 6.4, and we'll call that a league average 6.6 player.

70
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,900
Guys, this is not going to be a star, but this is like a, you know, bottom of the barrel

71
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,540
starting small forward.

72
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:10,540
This is an alright beer.

73
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,540
Well, I guess...

74
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,540
Cubio?

75
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:17,940
Going with the fall vibes, I've gone ahead and picked up a... what appears to be a...

76
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,940
A sunbeard.

77
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
A family beer.

78
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:20,940
Oh, wow.

79
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Because we serve each other...

80
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,380
Wait, that's you and Rex.

81
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,380
Wait, that's completely you and Rex!

82
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,380
Wait!

83
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:29,100
I don't think that's very funny.

84
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,980
You don't think that looks like you two?

85
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:31,980
Are you crazy?

86
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,980
Wait, that's you and Rex.

87
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,300
I'm pretty sure that's a woman, that's why I don't find that to be particularly funny.

88
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,500
I'd be pretty sure that you were a woman if I looked at you and didn't know your body.

89
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,060
It's just the blurring on the camera.

90
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
Hang on, let me fix that for you, Rex.

91
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,020
What do you mean you know my body?

92
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,700
If I didn't know that you had human male genitals, for the most part, then I would say that you

93
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,700
were a girl.

94
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,700
What do you mean for the most part?

95
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,700
I think that kind of looks like me.

96
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,060
Wow, that does look like you too.

97
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,100
Yeah, so it's the me and Rex beer.

98
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,420
Is that why you got it?

99
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,300
No, I got it because I can't read what it's called.

100
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,300
It says...

101
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:12,500
I have no idea what that means.

102
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,420
It's completely in German I assume.

103
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:21,140
And I just thought it was beer, but I wasn't sure at the 7-Eleven until I walked out and

104
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,140
I saw it right there.

105
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,060
Yeah, you woke up.

106
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,060
A full bodied beer.

107
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,340
So basically this is going to put me to sleep as soon as we're done recording.

108
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,980
Or maybe just halfway through, which would be better.

109
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,980
All right review that bitch

110
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:43,900
So I think over the past couple weeks had a really good track record with with beers that I liked

111
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,420
This one is one of those that I don't like

112
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,940
Oh, no, the thing is you have such a simple you have like you have like you like beer that a kid would like

113
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:59,040
Yeah, he has Homer Simpson's beer palette. Yeah, like you like the beer. I've drank you like you're on the show

114
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:03,920
I'm the only job like chicken finger chicken finger french fries kind of thing

115
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
You like pizza.

116
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,040
I think the skills are all fucked because we have never drank the exact same beer on this

117
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,000
exact same episode except for once or maybe twice.

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
So I don't know.

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
We have done that once.

120
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,360
We have done that once.

121
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,280
Yeah, we did a Modelo episode.

122
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,520
Or maybe twice during the office when we were in New York.

123
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,120
No it was when I was in New York.

124
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,560
We did that three times on that episode.

125
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,320
Yeah, well we did it two and a half times.

126
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:35,400
Were we, did we review those or did we just drink them?

127
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
I just drank them.

128
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,600
Also, Bud Light episode, did that ever happen?

129
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,520
I think one of them didn't happen because Killa just kept drinking all the beers.

130
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Wait!

131
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,520
I'm being blamed for being cool?

132
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,160
Oh, boohoo, I'm so good at drinking that I drank the entire six pack before we could

133
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
drink them.

134
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,480
Man, fuck yo bitch ass.

135
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:04,600
well anyways with this is a 5'7" person trying to try out for the

136
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,480
league. So they're not gonna make it. My arm looks crazy right now.

137
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:15,480
This is a very low chance of this person making it. What if he was a 6'6" person but he was very fat because he's full body.

138
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,480
Oh yeah that could work too. I guess we need to do BMI in combination.

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,040
- Yeah, and we also need to say whether they're

140
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,580
athletically gifted, genetically,

141
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:29,920
or perhaps maybe like an old free throw style shooter.

142
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,760
- This is a seven one person with no legs.

143
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,340
- We could say either a dark beer or a light beer.

144
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,400
- Anyway, I don't like this.

145
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,340
- I'm sorry to hear that.

146
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,220
Guys, I have big news.

147
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,580
- What's your big news?

148
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,360
- I have finally been accused of using steroids.

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,780
- Oh, well, okay.

150
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,040
(clapping)

151
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,840
Congrats, man.

152
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,080
- Not so much accused, but I woke up today

153
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,440
to a comedian I know texting me, and he said,

154
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,760
"Caleb, do you take any gear

155
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,060
"or performance enhancing drugs for lifting?"

156
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,160
And I had to-- - Nothing but BCAAs

157
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,080
and cocaine, my brother.

158
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,200
- I had to let him down, man.

159
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:16,800
I said, "No, man, I'm herbal supplements only, my friend."

160
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,960
But then I told this to Noah, and he was like,

161
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,780
Like you really should have given him like an insane fake steroid stack.

162
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,400
But I had a real kind of rubber band of a day where that was the first thing that happened

163
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
to me today and that was amazing.

164
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:36,360
That made me feel like an amazingly huge celebrity.

165
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,240
But then what made me feel like a non-celebrity was I told this to Noah and then he said, "If

166
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,480
you took steroids and you looked like this, that would be really funny."

167
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,480
I was like, "Whoa! What the hell? What is that about, man? That's mean!"

168
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,480
And then I was thinking all day about how to get him back for that meanness.

169
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,480
And then I made up a story about, I said a really pale woman walked by me and the dog earlier,

170
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
and the dog tried to chase her because he thought it was you.

171
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,480
And he believed me.

172
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:17,920
I saw a chart on Twitter that was like, taking steroids and doing nothing.

173
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,400
Just taking steroids will literally double the amount of muscle mass you get from doing

174
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,300
just regular exercise.

175
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,300
Pretty much, yeah.

176
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,740
If you take steroids, you can do, like I think I've told you guys this before, but there's

177
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,460
There's a guy who owns my gym.

178
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:37,060
He is huge.

179
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,420
He's massive.

180
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,420
And the other day, he had 120-pound dumbbells in each hand

181
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,820
going up for an incline bench press, one of these.

182
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,740
And he told this guy next to him,

183
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,580
he had headphones on, he was like,

184
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,140
"Hey, man, can you help me out?"

185
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:53,980
And he's like, "Yeah, sure."

186
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:56,680
He said, "Say that I'm a bitch

187
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,420
"and say that I can't do this."

188
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,300
And the guy was like, "What?"

189
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:04,140
And he's like, "Yeah, say that I'm a stupid fucking pussy and I can't do this shit."

190
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,500
And he was like, "Uh, okay."

191
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:09,340
So he gets down and he goes, "Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo."

192
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,340
And then he says, "Say it."

193
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:15,580
And the guy goes, "You're a fucking stupid bitch and you can't do this shit."

194
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,020
And he's like completely pumped up to the maximum, so ready to go, and he moves the

195
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,900
weight about this much, like, at a time.

196
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,660
Does like this.

197
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:28,100
And I was like, "Oh yeah, if you're on steroids, you can just do that.

198
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,820
You can just go and do like, almost like you're in an improv class making fun of somebody working

199
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,820
out.

200
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,180
Just do the tiniest little range of motion.

201
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,780
As long as you look, as long as you kind of make yourself crazy, I think it works.

202
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,260
Well, this also kind of depends on-

203
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:46,420
Isn't it cool to do that and have a weighted pencil and write essays and then your arm

204
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:49,740
is just like, you know?

205
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:54,060
Did the person that asked you this, did it work out?

206
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Did they just assume that it's-

207
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,780
No, I don't think so.

208
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
I don't think so.

209
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,020
last time I saw him I did I was wearing a shirt that was about a size and a half

210
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,460
too small for me and so maybe it was it maybe he got fooled by an optical

211
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,760
illusion which who could blame him it's happened all of us those stairs don't

212
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:15,540
know how they work yeah I'm really happy for you that's you deserve that it was

213
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:23,500
honestly hard work that was a week yep more than one less than three times a

214
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:28,420
week guys I've been grinding but that was a pretty amazing was the last time you

215
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:38,900
guys got an amazing compliment where you said wow that is good this is the

216
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,980
problem our men are not getting complimented enough in this shit

217
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,900
society here I'll give you both compliments right now Rex you don't look

218
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:50,020
anything like a woman well thank you you look nothing like the person on that

219
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,300
beer. Jubio, you look exactly like the person on that beer. This is a compliment to both

220
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,940
of you. That's a good looking guy. Look at that guy. He looks like a soccer player.

221
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,140
I don't know who they are. I think that's Chris Gethard.

222
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,100
I don't know who that is. His name is Chris Gethard. Has anyone pointed

223
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,540
that out? That his name is Chris Gethard? Probably multiple

224
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:16,300
children throughout his life, I would say. Yeah. I do think certain people's names lead

225
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,820
them to like it forces them on the narrow path of community.

226
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,820
Yeah, Matt Rifle.

227
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,820
Pitts.

228
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,820
Yeah.

229
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:23,820
Funny name.

230
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,260
Well no, you have an adorable name.

231
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,060
You could be like a construction worker.

232
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,060
All right, I'll do that.

233
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,060
I thought I had to be a fucking comedian.

234
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,060
I would so much rather be a construction worker.

235
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,060
You could be a plumber.

236
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
Yeah.

237
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,060
I want to work, I want to be...

238
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
Sanitation.

239
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,060
Some kind of scientist, a good scientist.

240
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
I want to be a good scientist, I want to heal people.

241
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:37,060
What's a good scientist?

242
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
Somebody who can heal people.

243
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I'm not sure what that is.

244
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,060
I'm not sure what that is.

245
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,060
I'm not sure what that is.

246
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:42,060
I'm not sure what that is.

247
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
I'm not sure what that is.

248
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:47,300
a good scientist and want to heal people. What's a good scientist? Somebody who doesn't work

249
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:56,800
for some doofenshmirps type evil guy. I don't want to be in a layer. I want to be doing science,

250
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,980
not in a layer and not in an underground anything. So you want to be in a lab, not in a dungeon?

251
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,460
Lab not layer. This is something that we need to tell our biology 101 students. Day one,

252
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,820
That should be big letters on the whiteboard.

253
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,860
Lab not layer.

254
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,820
- Is it biology?

255
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,300
- I mean.

256
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,020
- We're gonna have evil biologists.

257
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,340
What are they gonna do?

258
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,340
- As an anti-American leftist,

259
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,840
I think that working for a supervillain.

260
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,540
I disgust me.

261
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,860
I think working for a supervillain is probably

262
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:34,820
less ontologically evil than working for the government.

263
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,780
- Hold the phone, wait.

264
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:48,980
the

265
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:55,020
Well, I want to do some kind of amazing giant out of this park

266
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,260
because my friend Rex just said ontological on a Twitch stream,

267
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:58,760
guys.

268
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,860
This is huge.

269
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:04,100
Ontological.

270
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,900
Yep.

271
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,860
And for those who did not go to higher education

272
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,500
and maybe dropped out of high school, ontological--

273
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,220
Yeah, and don't watch Hasan Piker.

274
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,740
And do not watch Hasan Piker, who's live right now.

275
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:26,740
go check them out. Guys, this is a word that means basically stuff. So this is one of the

276
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:30,260
best words to just say whenever you want. I'm serious.

277
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,540
You can say it whenever you want. Say ontology, say ontological, whenever, man.

278
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,380
This just means existing stuff. This is a great, great word.

279
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,580
This is ontological, you hear? Yes, it is. That's the amazing thing about

280
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:47,620
it. This is one of the best words ever. And thank you, Rex, for opening us up to this

281
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:55,860
How is it you think you would have it like infiltrating the debate streaming YouTube circles from 1 to 10?

282
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:00,180
It would probably be very

283
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:06,900
What's your idea? Let me hear your idea because i'll be honest. I don't see a path forward for that. I think it's completely so easy

284
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,660
I think that like who am I gonna get to argue with me? Listen, listen to me destiny

285
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,140
I feel like you and destiny would have one of the most amazing

286
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:22,240
Anyway for our debates and like double-digit like person who just like gets on on the touch stream and just like talks about like yeah

287
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,280
Fucking politics is bullshit fucking Joe Biden is gay

288
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:32,200
They eventually just get into the debate with like like anyone who does like three or four thousand four like four thousand viewers

289
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,840
It's I think you you could do it

290
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,700
this train still do his

291
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:45,580
His his podcast with 15 people where he gets 15 people in a discord call who are all different races and ideologies

292
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:51,660
and then has them just argue about like what about the weather like shit like that?

293
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:56,700
No, but it looks like someone in the chat is saying that he does but now they have sex.

294
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,720
What?

295
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,620
That's alright.

296
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,220
I think that's Adam22.

297
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,140
Yeah, you're thinking of Adam22.

298
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,540
True.

299
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:11,260
Adam22 does a podcast where him and his wife interview somebody and then they have sex with

300
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:11,900
the person.

301
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,100
Ah, gross.

302
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,300
Is that disgusting?

303
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,780
what is it called what is it called that's so gross but what guys it's

304
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:24,940
called plug talk do not look up this it really doesn't they should call it

305
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:36,980
fucking fucking fucking that makes way more sense than plug talk and it's only

306
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,140
- If it's only four minutes long,

307
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,120
this podcast stinks.

308
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,960
- If it was my podcast, it'd be about--

309
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,660
- Wait, it's only four minutes long.

310
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,960
- Four seconds long.

311
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,000
- Oh. - No, I'm kidding.

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,460
Adam22 and Lean to the Plug, if you would have me,

313
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,900
I would love to be the first male guest on Plug Talk.

314
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:53,740
- Shouts out.

315
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,660
- If I have male guests on Plug Talk,

316
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,500
I don't know if I'll follow it back closely.

317
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,460
- I don't think so, because Adam22 is not fucking gay.

318
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,700
- I'm gonna jog my memory real quick.

319
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:14,040
had male guests before. Who you're jogging your memory? I just jogged my memory and they've

320
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:22,480
had wait this one has like a thousand people on this one. Look how many people they have

321
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,680
on this one. Are you streaming pornography? All these people? No it's not porn it's just

322
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:37,960
like the the pre-porn thing. But then somebody's having sexier guys. Yeah

323
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,160
probably all of them probably in a dope-ass Eyes Wide Shut style orgy. Doesn't

324
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,520
it feel like there's so much pornography in this world that probably one in three

325
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,480
people has made some kind of pornographic video before? Well okay are

326
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,760
you like a wide like released on the internet or just in the sanctity of their

327
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,720
own home for private enjoyment. I don't fucking know it's fucking disgusting

328
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,480
either way if you ask me it's the same shit. I don't care if you watch it and I don't

329
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,280
care if a million people watch it you're going to hell. You said one in three? One in

330
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,260
three like somebody who's watching this right now is the star of a

331
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:20,280
pornographic video. So I haven't done anything like that.

332
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:24,000
Rest have you done something like that? He's done look at that face he's done it

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He's done it. He's made a movie before.

334
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I will not do that.

335
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:34,000
What is this liar's twitch that you have? This tick?

336
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I've never... your lying tick is that you rub your vape against your can?

337
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
No, it's just condensating a lot.

338
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So I was having fun with the condensation.

339
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't understand.

340
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Why are you trying to paint me out with some evil put on?

341
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
No, no, you're not...

342
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,880
Heritage you might be the only good pornographer that's ever lived. I could I do feel like I have seen

343
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,200
Your entire body only from like the chest down before I'll say that

344
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,520
Maybe you do

345
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,680
Oh

346
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,560
I bet you're one of these guys who makes these who goes on Oh Megal and has

347
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,920
Like the biggest dick in the world and just jacks off

348
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,560
A lot of people, anytime you go to Omegle, you go through like-

349
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,560
How often do you go to Omegle?

350
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,560
I mean, I gotta get the news somewhere.

351
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,560
So I go on Omegle and I say, "Do you know what's going on today? What's happening in Ukraine?"

352
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:36,560
And this guy's over there, some Indian guy going, "Ahhhhhh!"

353
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
[laughter]

354
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,560
It's like every third guy.

355
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,560
I really, I really didn't think that Omegle was still a thing

356
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,560
until I guess, it just kept getting brought back up.

357
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:54,920
I really haven't thought about that side in the years, but it appears that you're browsing

358
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,920
it every day.

359
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,480
I haven't probably been on in quite some time, but it used to be pretty fun, man.

360
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,960
I've said it before, but you used to go out and show your child asshole to adults.

361
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,960
That was funny.

362
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,960
That was some funny shit.

363
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,560
That never gets old, guys.

364
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
You shave child asshole?

365
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
Yeah.

366
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
Well, you don't shave it.

367
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:22,520
it doesn't have any hair to begin with I'm a child shaved who's shaving my

368
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:30,520
asshole you fucking pervert you are well nowadays yes but when I was a kid didn't

369
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:35,180
have to okay that was one of the biggest luxuries of being a kid summers off no

370
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:41,040
ass hair would you shave your asshole if it made shitting like maybe 5% easier I

371
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,360
do and it does we've talked about this have we yeah I shave my asshole everyone

372
00:20:48,360 --> 00:21:03,040
to

373
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm showering and I'm like, "Oh man, it's hairy down there."

374
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,240
And then I will shave my entire, my asshole.

375
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,920
How do you notice it's hairy down there?

376
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,560
I'm fucking, I'm in the shower.

377
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm fingering my ass.

378
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,160
I mean, can you, how do you even see?

379
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,080
Like, do you get like a mirror in there?

380
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,080
I don't need to see.

381
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Hair has texture.

382
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,640
Yeah, but how, how do you know you're getting it all?

383
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,520
You don't want to have like the Hitler mustache of anal hair.

384
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,640
I just keep feeling.

385
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:38,640
keep

386
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:45,500
I agree. Actually, apparently Manscaped makes basically a taco that you- a taco shell that

387
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,860
you put in your ass and it takes all the hair away. So I might buy that.

388
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,500
I've read- Actually, I don't know if that's true.

389
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,140
I've read really poor reviews. That's a really good idea for a product for

390
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,940
Manscaped. It's like, it's shaped exactly like a taco shell, and then you shove it in your

391
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:07,500
ass and it takes all of the hair away.

392
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,660
I don't think I know, like, I don't think I can imagine that,

393
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,160
why is it shaped like a taco?

394
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,740
- Well, have you ever seen your ass?

395
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,900
- 'Cause your ass is shaped like the shell of a taco shell.

396
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,740
- Yeah.

397
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,580
- Your ass is basically what--

398
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,780
- The whitespace of an asshole is a taco.

399
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,180
- If a taco shell was the taco meat,

400
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,820
your ass would be perfectly shaped

401
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,700
to be the holder of the meat.

402
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,900
- Right.

403
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,580
It's like a book that's opened up,

404
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
the uh...

405
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,320
two thousand page book

406
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,320
open middle

407
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,680
yet that's a kind of beautiful

408
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,000
but like a lot of seagull in the background of a pain yes

409
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,420
you know just kind of a faraway seagull kind of thing

410
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,340
this is the biggest gusty

411
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,660
it's not a good luck it's just a lot of

412
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,520
it is this group is worth way

413
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,280
i knew a guy who on his wedding night

414
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,200
uh...

415
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,240
he's a virgin

416
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,640
on his wedding night

417
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,620
nared his balls

418
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,680
penis

419
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,880
and his asshole

420
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
for the night before his wedding i guess

421
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,360
it was not me

422
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,280
thank you for calling me a virgin though i fucking wish

423
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,160
but no

424
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,820
it was a guy i know

425
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:25,000
i can't guide really don't go to more details but

426
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,400
it may be just a male tell you

427
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,800

428
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,040
can you tell me

429
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,140
yeah who is it

430
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,440
my brother-in-law

431
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,100
but

432
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,660
but it doesn't matter which one i would i've got a lot of brothers-in-law

433
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,040
yet it's levi

434
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,160
that's my brother in the other world life that's my brother in life

435
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,140
your mind brother

436
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,900
while that's a major so that my friend is

437
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:59,300
Guys I'm kind of running through this pumpkin pie scraper. This is not what I was thinking

438
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:07,280
Mmm actually good man. I'm not gonna let you I had a backup beer. I had a Stella Artois

439
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,300
That is that I already drank some of because I was like I was like this is gonna be disgusting

440
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,620
I'm not gonna want to drink any of this but actually good

441
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,820
But now I'm gonna finish this Stella Artois off guys

442
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:20,980
- Guys, this is an amazing beer.

443
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,620
- I can barely get through one of the weird beers

444
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,740
that I buy sometimes.

445
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,880
I don't know how you get through two of them.

446
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,860
I get so-- - He's an alcoholic.

447
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,020
- I get so sleepy.

448
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:38,220
- Yeah, that's-- - He doesn't get giant cans.

449
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:41,020
- Well, this one's, this is like the biggest one

450
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:41,860
in a while.

451
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,860
- I get 16 ouncers, but I also have a high tolerance

452
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,140
for beer.

453
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,020
the other day we were at some week

454
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,780
we like last week i think

455
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,820
i came home to play our valorant league games

456
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,980
from a bar where i had already had like three drinks

457
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,980
and i had

458
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,500
i think i had probably ninety six ounces of beer when i got home

459
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,160
and then i went to bed

460
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,860
and it did not feel very good

461
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,380
but i did it

462
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,820
And that's really what it's about, right?

463
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,860
It's about kind of just ringing the bell.

464
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,620
- What bell?

465
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,500
- One of our house guests threw up last night.

466
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,360
And it was very funny, like laying in bed,

467
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,020
listening to the process of someone coming in

468
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,260
and like throwing up and then like hearing someone be like,

469
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,140
no, don't worry about the shower curtain.

470
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,020
No, no, no, it's fine.

471
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,860
- Oh, your house guest.

472
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,820
How many people are you housing at the moment?

473
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,980
- There was two last night.

474
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,820
- I see.

475
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,660
- And now it's just this one unwanted one.

476
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,160
Yes.

477
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,660
Yeah, Rex is currently housing the dead.

478
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,160
And there's...

479
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,660
...about to be another, apparently.

480
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
How are we gonna get this fool out?

481
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,160
I don't know.

482
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,160
It is so miserable.

483
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,460
Can you get him in here right now?

484
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,460
No.

485
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,460
Yeah, can you call him?

486
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:57,960
Can you...

487
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,160
Can you come grab him and say, "Hey, we're talking about how much everyone hates you."

488
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,460
Yeah, I'm talking about how you fucking suck and I wish you weren't here.

489
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,760
Is it a, uh...

490
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:11,060
Do you dislike him personally, too?

491
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,160
He's not just a bad house guest, he's...

492
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:20,160
See that's the worst man, because then it makes you not like the person, just because they leave the fridge open and shit.

493
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:29,160
Yeah, it's like, uh, he just plays really loud fucking music on the TV from like, till 3am.

494
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,160
I don't think-

495
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,160
What is wrong- just get headphones man, go bring him some headphones really passive aggressively.

496
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Bring him a pair of headphones.

497
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,160
I don't think Rex has the ability to just dislike someone off rip. I think you are too kind of a soul.

498
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:49,160
I'm always willing to see the inherent goodness in autistic, retarded men.

499
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,160
It's because someone did it for you one time.

500
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,160
Exactly. The two men on this call.

501
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Yeah, because we gave you about a hundred tries, and now you have to do this for every guy like you.

502
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,160
Yeah, that's fair.

503
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,160
So paying it forward, you know?

504
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,160
Yeah, that's sweet.

505
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,160
I haven't had an unwanted house guest in a very long time.

506
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,660
I'm trying to think, I mean my mom stayed with me, that was fucking annoying.

507
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
Yeah.

508
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:21,160
I feel like I just naturally just fall into Jerry Seinfeld-esque situations.

509
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,160
I wonder why.

510
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,160
Natural.

511
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:26,160
I wonder why, Julio.

512
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,660
What reason are you thinking?

513
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,160
I don't know, I wonder why.

514
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,660
What do you mean you wonder why? He's fucking, he's Jewish in New York City.

515
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Yeah, yeah.

516
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,660
What kind of last name do you think Rex's...

517
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,660
What kind of job would Rex's last name, do you think, would get him?

518
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,660
That's a weird question to ask.

519
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:46,660
If Caleb's last name is...

520
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,660
My last name wouldn't do anything for me.

521
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,660
I think it's... I was thinking about it for a while, but it was really hard...

522
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,660
Oh, you were?

523
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,660
It was really hard not to just say something like...

524
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
Something really bad.

525
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,660
Like banking?

526
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,660
That's one that I was thinking.

527
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:07,180
Why would it, I mean I guess it does kind of sound like bank.

528
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,180
Like a check.

529
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,180
Mmmmm.

530
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,180
That's smart.

531
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:19,780
What part of, what part of Steinowitz sounds like a bankers name?

532
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:24,020
I don't understand.

533
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,540
That doesn't make any sense to me.

534
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,100
What do you think Caleb?

535
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,700
What do I think Rex would be?

536
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,700
Yeah.

537
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,700
A football player.

538
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
you

539
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:38,940
that's a football players last I could see that on the back of an Eagles jersey guys

540
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:39,940
you

541
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,420
you do you don't know my last name

542
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,660
I completely do actually know all seven of your names and your address

543
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:49,400
pretty true

544
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,600
yeah yours would go on a different kind of football jersey my friend

545
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,220
yep no yours you would be

546
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,740
you would be the guy that works in an auto shop that makes mufflers louder

547
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,240
- Oh yeah, you take the catalytic converters out of cars.

548
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,160
That would be your job.

549
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,920
Yeah, yeah.

550
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:13,920
- I wish I knew anything about cars.

551
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,280
It sucks so bad.

552
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,960
Right before I left to go to Texas,

553
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,760
I got my car serviced and they were like,

554
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,520
yo, there's like an issue with like the,

555
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,600
the support for your engine and for like your suspension.

556
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,260
I was like, oh shit.

557
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,360
and they were like, "But it's not like something urgent,

558
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,380
"you can like wait a little bit,

559
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,580
"we should like really, you should take care of that."

560
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,620
I was like, "Oh, okay."

561
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,860
So I just immediately the next day,

562
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,180
I just like drove like 500 kilometers,

563
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,820
like 400 miles to a different country.

564
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,540
And I didn't die.

565
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,900
So I think cars are just bullshit.

566
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,260
- I agree, I think all this car stuff is,

567
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,340
it's because there's too much gatekeeping in the car world.

568
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,060
Where I walk in and I say,

569
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,060
I say, "Hey, all the lights in the doohickeys are going off in my car."

570
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,660
And they say, "Oh, well this means this and this."

571
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,060
And I say, "You think I'm a fucking idiot?"

572
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,360
Okay?

573
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,060
I'm 90% sure that you're trying to screw me, okay?

574
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,060
Because I may not know what any of these symbols mean,

575
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,260
but I know that you only have 3.9 stars on Yelp,

576
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,860
and that means that you're probably screwing somebody over.

577
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,060
Yep.

578
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,060
But I'm not gonna ever learn that shit.

579
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,460
No.

580
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:33,940
I have a latent DIY-like issue in my brain that makes me want to do that kind of stuff

581
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,940
myself.

582
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
I just hate spending money.

583
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,300
I like one-on-one on a card.

584
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,300
I know.

585
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,300
I hate spending money.

586
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,620
I replaced my side-view mirror.

587
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,620
It took me hours.

588
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,420
It's supposed to be like a ten-minute fix.

589
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,420
It took me fucking hours.

590
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,140
I had to have my cousin there to hold stuff for me.

591
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,140
It took me forever.

592
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,140
It was the hottest day of the summer.

593
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:54,100
And then right after I did that, my fucking wife broke the other mirror.

594
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,100
So now I have to...

595
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
ago I'm gonna do that shit again.

596
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
Zip tie mirrors.

597
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
And then she was like, well it's not a big deal.

598
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:03,100
You did it once before.

599
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
I said, oh you stupid bitch.

600
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
You don't even know the half of it.

601
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,100
You don't even know that it took two guys.

602
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,100
And now you're gonna have to come out there

603
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,100
and sit with me.

604
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
While I yell at you.

605
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
Yeah, while I yell at you, pretend it's your fault you haven't touched it a single time.

606
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Just hand me the fucking screwdriver!

607
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
The part's gotta be wrong.

608
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
We had to have ordered the fucking wrong part.

609
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
We had to have ordered the fucking wrong part.

610
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
God.

611
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,100
It's so funny how pissed you get like

612
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,100
instantly when you're doing

613
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
anything like

614
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,100
with tools.

615
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Yeah. The moment like a hammer

616
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
is in your hand, you're like, I could fucking

617
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
murder. Anything like that

618
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,100
I immediately get like the most

619
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
insane, anything that I don't know what I'm doing.

620
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,100
Like I know my way around like power tools,

621
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,100
I can build stuff, but if I'm

622
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,100
doing something with a car, as

623
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:58,060
As soon as I start doing it, I get the most insane stress headache, where I just instantly

624
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,520
have to lay down.

625
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm like, "I can't even, I don't even want to do, I can't do any of this."

626
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,900
And I just give up so, so fast.

627
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,020
I fucking hate working on cars.

628
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:11,820
I had to replace my spark plugs a couple years ago, and I didn't have enough money to go

629
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,380
get it, have somebody do it for me.

630
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,160
I was working on my Volkswagen Rabbit.

631
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:23,720
Broke the fuck out of my engine cover.

632
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,720
Just destroyed it.

633
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,720
It had like a plastic cover.

634
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,720
I just obliterated it.

635
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
It was just in pieces.

636
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,520
I just suck at that kind of thing, man.

637
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
I'm never gonna be good.

638
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,180
Yeah, that's one of those things you just need to know a guy.

639
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,560
Because no one trusts any mechanic in the world.

640
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:44,400
Apparently every single mechanic is a thief and a scammer.

641
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Yeah, that's again, that's a bad thing. It's a very low trust factor with these mechanics.

642
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,200
I completely believe that. I think I'm getting scammed by my mechanic.

643
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:58,200
You don't have like an uncle who knows how to do this stuff?

644
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:02,200
I'm legitimately running out of uncles, man. It's alarming.

645
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,200
What do you mean you're running out of uncles?

646
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,200
I'm running out of uncles.

647
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
It's alarming!

648
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
How many uncles are you losing?

649
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,640
Three at this point three uncles gone

650
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:19,200
They're fucking dying

651
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,520
Come on Rex you knew that the human who made me say it they're dying

652
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Will they die from like gelato poisoning? No?

653
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:34,080
No, just some insane illness if you must know some insane

654
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,840
Familial illness it kills every single person in his family some call it a curse

655
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:47,040
Yeah, they kill all uncles you better pray to God that your your brothers and sisters never have any little kitties or else

656
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
You're probably next there. Oh, Leo. Yeah

657
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,600
I'm running out of uncles who can fix my car. I

658
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,120
Don't think I have a single uncle who knows how to fix a car and I have to let go I've anymore

659
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,040
No, I like go to an actual mechanic now

660
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,060
That sucks, which is really the saddest situation a man could be in

661
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,920
My brother kind of knows how to fix cars, but lives on the other side of the fucking country man

662
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,560
There's nothing I can I can't get all this time

663
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,400
Yes

664
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,280
Fix this shit, I don't know

665
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:27,240
It's hours and hours and hours of me sitting there unscrewing things realizing. I don't the right fucking tools

666
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,920
Going to Autozone. They closed my door real quick

667
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:37,960
It's getting infiltrated by the ops I'm being infiltrated by music speaking of fucking people playing music

668
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,600
Why is my wife never used the headphones that I gave her? What's going on with that?

669
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,280
You need to just kill her. You need to feed her to Phil. I never even thought of that actually

670
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,680
Today a kid a kid was about two seconds away from getting eaten by Phil today

671
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,360
I was walking home with him

672
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
With a kid?

673
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,140
And with this kid, and then we ran into Phil.

674
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,200
I was walking home with Phil from the park and he was all exhausted and a kid came up

675
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,560
to us and was like, "Is he sweet?"

676
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:12,560
Like a seven year old kid.

677
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,560
He was like, "Is he sweet?"

678
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
And I just lied.

679
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,040
I said, "Yeah, he's fucking, he's sweet as pumpkin pie.

680
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,280
Go ahead.

681
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Is he sweet?

682
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
Go ahead.

683
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Touch the dog."

684
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,680
And the kid, instead of just petting him like I thought he was going to do, which is fine,

685
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,920
He did the thing that Phil hates most in this world and has made him bite me over a thousand

686
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:39,160
times, which is that he gave him a giant hug around his neck and like restrained his head.

687
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,040
And I literally in my head started counting, I was like, one, two, three.

688
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,280
And then as soon as in my brain it hit three, I said, oh, he's really hungry and we have

689
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,680
to go home right now.

690
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,420
And then this fucking this, this little kid, this annoying little kid just started walking

691
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:03,420
down the street going "Aww he was sweet! He was so sweet!" and I was like "I fooled him."

692
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,100
Yeah, but next time he's gonna run into you and be like "Oh my god, it's the sweet dog

693
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,600
that doesn't kill children." I'm gonna, I'm going for another hug. This time I think I'll

694
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,260
make it a little longer. Then he, I mean he gets what he gets man. You were, you were

695
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:23,460
saying how you don't want to be a villain, but you're completely a villain for your neighborhood.

696
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,840
i think i have a little bit of a villain for my neighborhood lady walked out at my

697
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,400
dog started shitting in like a pile of rocks in the day they were in like one

698
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:34,400
of those one of the things around a tree

699
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,680
and the lady cancer it came out i was gonna pick it up i was never left to

700
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,080
shit on the ground but a lady came out and started crying

701
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,180
like on this beautiful and she's like

702
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,240
i really don't like that

703
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,100
i was like

704
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:51,540
what i don't like when you talk shit so my rocks

705
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,380
as a ok i'm gonna pick it up and i picked it up

706
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,560
and i when i got a coffee and i was walking back home

707
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,500
and she walked out of her store

708
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,680
but left a customer come walk and she's like

709
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,440
i'm so sorry i thought that you're just gonna leave that shit there

710
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,000
but i had a bag on my hand so i don't know what the fuck she thought i was

711
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,320
doing

712
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,480
if she did and if she didn't see me to share a motion she might have honest i

713
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,680
mean again uh... i'd i'd do you have a very some kind of villain

714
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,520
reputation

715
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:24,520
I think that I ruin the vibe of almost every Mexican restaurant that I walk into.

716
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
What? Why?

717
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,000
Don't you guys feel- well you don't feel like this.

718
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,280
Rex, do you feel like this?

719
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,040
When you go into Mexican restaurants, doesn't it feel like they were having the best time

720
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,760
ever until you walked in there?

721
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,320
No, what?

722
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,840
Nobody else has felt it?

723
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,360
I feel like they're always like, "Yaaaah!"

724
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:47,960
Screaming at the TV, drinking margaritas, and then I walk in and it's dead fucking silence.

725
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
They turn the fucking music off.

726
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,960
What's going on dude? I feel like it's Toy Story. I feel like when I leave the fucking room,

727
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:59,840
everybody in the Mexican restaurant fucking is having the time of their lives, and then

728
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,400
as soon as I walk in, they just go, they go completely limp. And just, it's like, dude,

729
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,640
I want to have fun. You look like Border Patrol, man. It's your vibe. You have a cop vibe.

730
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:13,880
What would the Canadian Border Patrol, why the fuck would I be in New York City? You

731
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,680
You look like ice, 100%.

732
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,760
You look like ice right now!

733
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,600
100% ice right now, right there.

734
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,760
- You're gonna walk around with a camouflage hat on?

735
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,600
- Yeah, yes sir, yes sir.

736
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,760
- It says walker balls, man.

737
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,000
- Yes sir, I have papers, sir.

738
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,480
Yes, senor, I have papers and I'm walking

739
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,840
and I see my friend with long hair.

740
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,880
Oh my God, I can trust him in public

741
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,000
because he has long hair and he's probably--

742
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,080
- Jesus.

743
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,000
- He's probably the same as Jesus.

744
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,680
You do look Mexican, actually, now that I think about it.

745
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,680
me

746
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,680
I don't need these restaurants.

747
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,680
Gentrify your culture stealer.

748
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,680
I'm getting gentrified out of my apartment.

749
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,680
They raised the rent 25 bucks.

750
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,680
[Laughter]

751
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,680
I look like a maid out of fucking money?

752
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,680
25 bucks? Pissing me off in this bitch ass city.

753
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,680
I'm going to send a letter to your landlord to make sure he raises it more.

754
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
No, no, no. You need to say...

755
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
And he won't listen to me.

756
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
You need to say, "Hey there, cousin."

757
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,720
- Hey there, cuz.

758
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,640
- You are the most resilient person in New York City,

759
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,720
I think.

760
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,080
You have lived in a shoebox that pretty much

761
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,760
it's impossible to do any maintenance to.

762
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,080
You can't put any good internet into,

763
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,280
and it's so expensive.

764
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,040
Yeah, you stay there for years and years and years and years.

765
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,160
- Do you realize how hard it is to move?

766
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,580
- It's easy.

767
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,420
I've done it.

768
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,440
- It's hard as fuck.

769
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,780
- I think the longer you live in a place,

770
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,840
the more impossible it becomes to move.

771
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,760
- This is the longest I've ever lived anywhere.

772
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,000
- How long have you been in that place?

773
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,120
- Three years.

774
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,600
- Yeah, you've reached terminal moving impossibility.

775
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,200
- I've moved 24 times in my life up to this apartment.

776
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,480
I'm not gonna move, I'm not gonna make it a quarter

777
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,560
just to fucking go get an extra bedroom

778
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,040
or something where I'm paying even more.

779
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,400
I don't wanna do that shit, man.

780
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,080
- The thing about New York City

781
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:18,720
is that every apartment sucks complete ass.

782
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,760
- Yeah. - There's something,

783
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,340
there's no flawless apartment.

784
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,120
- Yeah, we should all just-- - Except for something

785
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,560
your friend has and then you don't see the flaws

786
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,080
and then it's like-- - Wait, Brandon Chatter

787
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,800
in the chat says, "I think you guys should all

788
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,880
"move to Mexico."

789
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,120
Wait, that's such a crazy idea.

790
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,960
Wait, Brian, do you agree?

791
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,720
Do you guys agree? - It's a bad idea.

792
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,200
- You think that's a bad idea?

793
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,520
- I don't wanna move to fucking Mexico.

794
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:42,400
Actually, I do.

795
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,280
I do kinda wanna move to Mexico.

796
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,620
I want to move to Mexico and learn how to code.

797
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Would I have to code in Spanish?

798
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,620
No.

799
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,620
That's crazy.

800
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,440
It might be cool though.

801
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:59,320
I don't think I've ever seen non-English code, and I've seen a lot of code.

802
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,640
Yeah, I wonder if they do in like China, I wonder if they do...

803
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,520
Which I feel like it'd be easier in China because you just press one key for a word.

804
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
How do they make those keyboards?

805
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,720
Do they have every word on them?

806
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,820
No, it's like a normal keyboard. I don't know what I'm talking about

807
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:24,520
It's like a normal keyboard with auto every word and every phrase each everything has its own key

808
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,580
How do these guys play video games so good?

809
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,680
Just my thought

810
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,520
It's crazy how we've done like almost 30 of these and that's like the rate most racist thing as it says so far

811
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,820
That is given with Rex and Brian, how's that racist? That's my that is that's more of a language thing

812
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:53,480
Yeah, I'm not even sure it's true

813
00:41:53,480 --> 00:42:02,480
It's one of those things you could just Google like Chinese keyboard

814
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,920
I'm not

815
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,320
Yeah

816
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:10,520
You know, I my you guys know Neil, right? Yeah

817
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,200
Neil was telling me we went out to Pennsylvania a couple weeks ago to do a college show and

818
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:22,920
Neil was telling me on the ride that he has a really big problem with Google which is that he's polite when he Googles things

819
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:26,520
so if he's trying to find out like

820
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:35,100
Like what cable goes to his Android thing? Uh-huh his Android phone. I would Google Android cable

821
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,240
He googles

822
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:43,400
May I please what yeah likes like what what cable goes to an Android phone and

823
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,080
Is it available nearby me? Thanks and

824
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:49,880
Types all that and then hit center

825
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:59,360
That is insane, that's not crazy he was showing me his Google history. I was just a Chinese keyboard. Mm-hmm

826
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,320
Yeah, I mean

827
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:07,200
That doesn't look like what I thought said straight up

828
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:14,680
That does not look anything like what I said. It was gonna look like well, this one's really small so it could be you know

829
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:20,720
It could be different thing. Yeah, that's like a 60% Yeah. Yeah, um

830
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,560
I

831
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,680
Do that with when I use like chant GPT. I'm always like may I please?

832
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,800
Know some information

833
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,160
- Do you say thanks afterwards?

834
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,240
- I do say thank you.

835
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:38,960
Or I'll politely correct it

836
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,000
if it gives me something I don't like.

837
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,840
- My girlfriend does that.

838
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,520
- I'll say thank you for the effort.

839
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,360
- My girlfriend told me that she does that

840
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,480
and I was like, that is crazy, you don't do that.

841
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:49,320
She's like, no, I recognize.

842
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,120
- It's called karma.

843
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,080
And I'm building new karma with the computers.

844
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:54,000
- It's a computer.

845
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,040
You know how I use AI?

846
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,520
I go in the Notion thing, I paste a bunch of shit on it

847
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,760
and I'm like, turn this into a list.

848
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:05,720
and that's it that's the one interaction i have a with the and that's it

849
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,280
everything i got

850
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,960
i stopped using chad g_p_t_ is much a really

851
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,560
it's like everything where you see you use it

852
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,160
a hundred times and it's really boring

853
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,420
until they come out with one that can make a movie that i say to make

854
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,860
didn't get stupid

855
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:24,080
i don't know

856
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,920
and has gotten the but it's beginning to put it

857
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,680
this is what you

858
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,000
if you do like

859
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,860
It's really good for programming.

860
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:35,280
'Cause you can tell it, "Do my job for me."

861
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,040
And it'll be like, "Okay, sir."

862
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,920
- It kinda does 90% of it, right?

863
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,320
And then you just say, you just double check.

864
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,160
- Yeah.

865
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,040
- Now all of a sudden you're a boss.

866
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,200
- Yes.

867
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,240
- Yeah, that is so good.

868
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,880
- I'm sitting back, I've got my feet up.

869
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,920
I'm talking to my computer.

870
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,080
- Yeah, we should just ask it

871
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,960
for podcast topics every week.

872
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,000
- It sucks at creative stuff.

873
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:03,000
It cannot do, it comes up with the worst creative things.

874
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:07,520
Well, let's see, hold on.

875
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,520
Open AI, chat.

876
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,000
Wait, I have, actually I have a way to, I have a way.

877
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,680
You have a way?

878
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:18,640
I have a perfect way that I can, that way I can come up with actually good funny ass

879
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,600
topics that will blow your mind in an alternative comedy way.

880
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Okay.

881
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,600
Watch this.

882
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,760
Watch this shit.

883
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,760
Hold on.

884
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,040
(silence)

885
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,040
- Can you go sing the rap about the nice shark, please?

886
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,040
- Alright.

887
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,040
Come up with some podcast topics.

888
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,540
Get, okay, so that's gonna be bad, right?

889
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,040
But then I say this.

890
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,740
In the style of Tim and Eric.

891
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,240
Okay, certainly.

892
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,740
Tim and Eric are known for their sur-

893
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,040
(coughing)

894
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,740
Tim and Eric are known for their surreal and absurd humor.

895
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,040
Here are some podcast topics in their style.

896
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,240
Absurd advertising.

897
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,640
analyzing the weirdest commercials ever made.

898
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,940
Dive into the world of bizarre and nonsensical advertising

899
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,440
from local commercials to infomercials

900
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,440
that make you question reality.

901
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,440
Infomercles.

902
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,440
The unusual world of public access television.

903
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,440
In search... oh wait, no, this is so Tim and Eric.

904
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,440
In search of the most surreal internet memes.

905
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,440
What?

906
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,440
I think they did an episode on that.

907
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,120
Take a deep dive into the most absurd and surreal internet memes,

908
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:33,520
dissecting their origins and discussing their impact on online culture.

909
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,240
And then wait, let me like this, you'll like this one,

910
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:43,120
cooking with chaos, a culinary adventure in nonsensical recipes.

911
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:48,960
So this would be something like a shit taco or a piss sandwich, stuff where you go,

912
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,160
wait, that doesn't sound very good to eat.

913
00:46:52,160 --> 00:47:01,160
You know, actually the thing about the commercials, whenever I go to the US, the most culture shock thing to me is how you guys have a person that's just like an ad.

914
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,160
What you mean, bitch?

915
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:09,160
Like the guy, Jake from State Farm. He just lives like a, he just, it's an ad, it's a person.

916
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,160
Oh, you mean like a series of commercials?

917
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
What about a mascot?

918
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
What about a mascot?

919
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,120
But he's got like a whole personality and he's like tweeting and posting on TikTok and Instagram.

920
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,560
And I see him on my Twitter when I'm in the US.

921
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,560
He's a man.

922
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,160
No, they put him...

923
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,640
It's just an ad that happens multiple times.

924
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,360
It's a series of ads.

925
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,880
I'm not talking about the ads.

926
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,880
I'm talking about these accounts.

927
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:37,880
Okay, wait.

928
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:38,880
I have another idea.

929
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,880
Hold on.

930
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:41,440
No, I have an idea.

931
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:47,040
So I said, "May I have some podcast topics in the style of Joe Pera?"

932
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,000
Oh, this is gonna be good.

933
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,800
So we've got the history and comfort of porch swings.

934
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,360
The perfect handshake.

935
00:47:57,360 --> 00:48:00,880
The gentle art of rock balancing.

936
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,600
Finding the best bench in the park.

937
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,400
You know, I could see it, I guess.

938
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,120
Do you guys think that as white honkeys you're missing out on the cheek kiss when you say

939
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,120
hello to someone?

940
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,120
What?

941
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,320
Um, yeah, I honestly do feel like that.

942
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:24,120
I also feel like, just, unless you're from a very far land, you do not get to do that

943
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,120
to my wife.

944
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:27,120
I do that to everyone.

945
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,680
If you're from, like, Europe, you know?

946
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,400
Yeah, you know better.

947
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,240
Yeah, you know where the fuck you are, dog.

948
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,520
it's not a no it's just the cheek against the cheek

949
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:43,240
i don't want anybody touching my bitch's cheeks

950
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,240
that is not that is uh... the off there's a no go zone

951
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,800
for for men of of uh...

952
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,220
french backgrounds

953
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,720
i don't like that shit

954
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:57,680
i don't like that at all do i feel amazing when a french woman would do that

955
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,760
to me yes

956
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,920
how do you how do you do that? do french people do that?

957
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:04,760
Do they do that?

958
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,460
- Yeah, I think for even French people do the mwah mwah.

959
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:08,760
- I don't think so.

960
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,500
- I've even seen people who live in New York

961
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,900
but go to Europe, have been to Europe.

962
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:14,980
I've seen them do that.

963
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:17,560
- How do you say hi to a person?

964
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,400
First a man--

965
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:19,800
- I don't even really like shaking hands.

966
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,080
I don't even like saying hi.

967
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,500
Recently I've been doing a thing

968
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:24,240
that's been not working out at all,

969
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,600
but I'm gonna keep trying,

970
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,520
where if there's a new person that I don't know

971
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,840
who's in like a group of other people I know,

972
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,240
I'm not gonna say, "Hey, nice to meet you, I'm Caleb."

973
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,340
I'm just gonna sit there until they do it.

974
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,880
For too long, I was the one who introduced myself,

975
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,680
and now I'm done doing that shit.

976
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,100
I'm done doing that shit.

977
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:49,240
I'm gonna, and then I'm gonna,

978
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,560
if they never say anything, then great, we met.

979
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,760
- We're not talking, yeah.

980
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,640
- We met each, I'll even talk to them,

981
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,480
but I'm not gonna say my name or introduce myself.

982
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,160
I have no interest in doing this anymore.

983
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:02,040
- That is how you-- - Let's figure out--

984
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,040
That is how you get into really weird situations where you've known this person for years and you don't know their name.

985
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,040
And you go to their birthday party.

986
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,040
I'll ask somebody their name later.

987
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:13,040
What if they don't know? Because they're doing the kill 'em method.

988
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,040
Then I get to make them feel bad about that.

989
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,040
Yeah.

990
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,040
But you are at their party.

991
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,040
I'm with Caleb on this.

992
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:24,040
If you are more...

993
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:26,040
There's layers to it though.

994
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:33,740
So, you need to be either cooler or more powerful than them to have that accomplish that.

995
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,660
I don't think so.

996
00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,300
I just like doing it just with...

997
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:44,660
I mean I don't like having to be the kind and gracious one anymore as I get older.

998
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:45,660
That's what I'm saying.

999
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:51,580
You don't need... if you're above them on the hierarchy, they need to come to you.

1000
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:55,580
That is a thick way to think of the world, my friend.

1001
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,080
Okay.

1002
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:59,340
That is a very sick way to think of the world.

1003
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:02,060
As someone who is just very friendly to anyone they ever meet.

1004
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,380
Which is you.

1005
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:06,180
You're the nicest person outside of the world.

1006
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:07,880
Every time I see you-

1007
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:09,880
Why are you saying he's so nice?

1008
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,580
He's not that nice.

1009
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:11,380
He is so nice.

1010
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:11,880
Yeah, I'm not that nice.

1011
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:12,680
He's nice to everyone.

1012
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,780
That's why people approach you and say things to you.

1013
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,080
And that's why Caleb, whenever he enters a room, they were like, "Oh my god, the cops are here."

1014
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,280
Yeah.

1015
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,880
That being said, I've been in New York for like two months.

1016
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,480
I've completely stopped smiling outside of my apartment.

1017
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,480
That is so sad.

1018
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,480
As is customary.

1019
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:31,640
That is so so sad.

1020
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,440
It's called, you know, fitting in with the culture.

1021
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,240
When you lived in Los Angeles, you walked around smiling all the time like a fucking

1022
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,240
asshole?

1023
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:42,480
See, this is what I'm saying.

1024
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,120
This is why you can't do that here.

1025
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:47,680
Nobody in Long Beach is walking around.

1026
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:48,680
Hey!

1027
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:49,680
Hey!

1028
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,680
Hey!

1029
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:51,680
Not like that.

1030
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:53,680
even just like a slight smile.

1031
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,180
A smite!

1032
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:54,680
You should be like...

1033
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,680
No, we're smiting them down.

1034
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,780
Don't smite people, bruh!

1035
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,280
That is bad to do!

1036
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,480
On either coast!

1037
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,180
No, no, no, I'm telling that.

1038
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:07,680
I've realized that I have the worst all-time white guy acknowledgement face.

1039
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,980
Let's see it.

1040
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:11,780
So, you walk by me on the street.

1041
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,980
Maybe I kinda know you or you're my neighbor or something.

1042
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,480
And I do this.

1043
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:14,980
I go like...

1044
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,780
And then I walk away and I go, "What the fuck was that face I fucking made?

1045
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:26,780
What the fuck was that, man?

1046
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:28,780
That face sucked!"

1047
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:32,780
And then I walk back around and say, "Hey, can I try that again?"

1048
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:35,780
Like, try something- just anything new.

1049
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:38,780
You know what my least favorite situation is?

1050
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:43,780
When you're seeing- you see someone out on the street that you know,

1051
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,780
and you know that you're gonna cross paths with them,

1052
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:51,420
But you're far away, and you've both recognized the fact that you've seen each other.

1053
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:52,420
Yeah.

1054
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:54,420
What do you do in between?

1055
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,420
Do you speed up your pace?

1056
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,420
No, you don't.

1057
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,420
Do you wait?

1058
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:02,180
I literally, this is the only way that I've figured out how to do this.

1059
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:07,580
And by the way, this is really showing how socially undeveloped the three of us are,

1060
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,540
is that we have to have conversations and stuff like this.

1061
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:13,860
But I usually just run, I walk straight up to the person.

1062
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,020
Well, of course you walk straight up to them.

1063
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:21,260
I never want the thing where you go, where like you saw somebody and then neither of

1064
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:27,220
you said anything to each other and then later at some other thing you go like "Oh dude I

1065
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,300
saw you on the street the other day" and then the worst part is when you say that shit to

1066
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:37,060
them and they go "I wasn't on that street" and then you realize...

1067
00:53:37,060 --> 00:53:41,860
I'm saying you're going to the same place, you know?

1068
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:48,420
Let's say we were meeting at a bar and we were coming from opposite ends of the street and

1069
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:53,220
I see you and you see me and there's probably like a good thousand feet separating us.

1070
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,420
Well I think, no, I'm like hey!

1071
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,420
I do a big wave.

1072
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:01,900
And then you do the wave, you do the wave, you wave for fucking a minute.

1073
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:02,900
Okay, okay.

1074
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,420
I'm gonna say this is a flawed hypothetical.

1075
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,660
This is a really flawed hypothetical because I think this should, you have to be thinking

1076
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:16,660
about this with people who are not the two of you or like anyone in our circle.

1077
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,500
Because the two of you, we would just be like, you see each other, just go like, "Hey, hey,

1078
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:25,140
hey," just for like that for like the entire way through until you're at their face.

1079
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,700
I would do that if I saw you coming the other way.

1080
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,700
So...

1081
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:30,700
But what if I was someone you're friendly with?

1082
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:31,700
Yeah.

1083
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:32,700
Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.

1084
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,700
Do you pick up the pace?

1085
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:39,980
Do you just, you know, you finish waving and then you just walk normally while making direct

1086
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:46,980
the

1087
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:47,480
Yes!

1088
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,480
Until you're about 15 feet away.

1089
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:51,980
And then you go, "Oh, oh shit!"

1090
00:54:51,980 --> 00:54:52,980
"What's up?"

1091
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:55,480
"Whoa, look at this crazy shit I was looking at on my phone!"

1092
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:56,480
Lock screen.

1093
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:57,480
Look at that!

1094
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,980
That's insanity!

1095
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,980
You're driving me.

1096
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,980
Yeah, yeah, I'm looking.

1097
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,980
Yeah.

1098
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,480
"Whoa, look at this shit!"

1099
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,480
Just, uh, yeah, I don't know.

1100
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
This is why...

1101
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,480
There's a lot of teenagers on the street and they would make fun of you.

1102
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,980
See, people think there's cool people in New York.

1103
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,480
No one in New York is cool, and no one cares.

1104
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,280
No, these people walk around and they're just idiots, man.

1105
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,280
Yeah.

1106
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,360
They're giant idiots.

1107
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:26,040
They don't like any good music and they hate your last movies.

1108
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,040
New York is filled with NPCs.

1109
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,040
Damn.

1110
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,040
I agree, bro.

1111
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,040
Look at stories.

1112
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:31,040
Damn.

1113
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,520
There is a serious NPC epidemic in this motherfucking city.

1114
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:39,600
If I don't know you, I don't want to know you, okay?

1115
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,040
I've been here for 36 months.

1116
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,520
I know everybody that I'm ever going to know in this fucking city.

1117
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,040
I certainly don't want to introduce myself to you.

1118
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,040
Hell no!

1119
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,440
Again, hell fucking no.

1120
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:51,920
I'm not doing that shit.

1121
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,960
What is the least NPC-addled city in the world, do you think?

1122
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,960
Probably Atlanta.

1123
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:00,960
Okay.

1124
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:07,000
I was like, the last time I was in Atlanta I was talking to homeless guys and I was like,

1125
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,640
these guys are awesome.

1126
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,000
These guys are like, interesting.

1127
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,560
These guys have lived?

1128
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:15,640
Yeah, these guys have lived real lives.

1129
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,040
I went to like a park in Atlanta.

1130
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,120
Everybody at the, it was like, honestly it was like paradise.

1131
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:26,280
Everybody at this park was like, like somebody threw a frisbee, not like at like too far and

1132
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:31,320
it hit me, threw a frisbee at me and I catch it, all of a sudden I'm in a frisbee circle.

1133
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,320
A frisbee.

1134
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:33,320
And I'm throwing a frisbee.

1135
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,880
And I'm saying, I love frisbee.

1136
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,040
Nobody's correcting me.

1137
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,080
This is how nice the people in Atlanta are.

1138
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,080
I love Atlanta.

1139
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,360
I would move there in an instant.

1140
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:42,360
That's probably my favorite city.

1141
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,360
Atlanta and Chicago.

1142
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:45,360
I think you said that about every city.

1143
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:50,360
Name one other fucking city I've ever said that about you fucking stupid bitch.

1144
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,360
Beijing.

1145
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:52,360
I've never been to Beijing, motherfucker.

1146
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,360
Tokyo.

1147
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:54,360
I've never been to Tokyo.

1148
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,360
In my dreams I have.

1149
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:00,360
I've destroyed Tokyo in my fucking dreams.

1150
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:05,360
I was 15 feet tall and I broke down every single building in Tokyo in my dreams.

1151
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:07,360
I think we should take over Tokyo.

1152
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,360
My idea.

1153
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,360
I would love to go to Tokyo, guys.

1154
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:17,200
I want to try every kind of food that they have, even the crazy ones guys.

1155
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:22,200
I want to try the poisonous puffer fish that if you eat it, uh, if you plug your nose and

1156
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,240
eat it you die, however that works.

1157
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,720
I want to try every single food.

1158
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,320
You know what I don't like?

1159
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,720
I had this shit recently.

1160
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,720
Fake people.

1161
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,000
I had this shit.

1162
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,360
Fake people, had them in my life, cut them out.

1163
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,600
Did not like them.

1164
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,820
Do you guys like, have you had the sea urchin?

1165
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,680
That yellow orange thing that sometimes they sell at sushi restaurants?

1166
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,680
Nope.

1167
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,560
Guys, this is one of the most disgusting foods ever made.

1168
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,600
It is a human tongue that tastes like a garbage.

1169
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,280
Ooni, that's what it's called.

1170
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,280
Ooni.

1171
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,880
That is not good man, don't eat that.

1172
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,600
Where do you eat this?

1173
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:06,760
Brian took me out to an expensive ass sushi place.

1174
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,480
Oh, don't say that.

1175
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,480
I wasn't thinking that you were going to say that.

1176
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:14,240
Brian took me to this expensive sushi place, guys.

1177
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,400
I don't like this expensive sushi.

1178
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:20,920
I don't want to eat this weird food, man.

1179
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:25,640
I want to eat avocado when I go to a sushi restaurant.

1180
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:26,960
I want guacamole.

1181
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,080
I want chips.

1182
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:30,520
That's what I want.

1183
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:33,440
It is really crazy when you have good sushi for the first time.

1184
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,320
Like wait, this actually doesn't taste like fish at all.

1185
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,520
Do you want to defend yourself?

1186
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,940
Yes or no?

1187
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:40,760
That was Brian and Chad.

1188
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,680
He said after one piece it was bad, shut up.

1189
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:44,720
But it's the only piece I'm ever going to eat in my life.

1190
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:45,220
Yeah, I'm not going to lie.

When Brian was talking about the sushi place, he was talking and...

1193
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,520
Everything else was great, but that thing was odd.

1195
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:57,600

They're terrorizing you mentally.

1245
