00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,580
- Podcasts for the heartless.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,160
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,100
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:11,920
(laughing)

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,960
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,800
- Bang.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,620
- Woo.

9
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,460
- Oh, ooh.

10
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,300
- Woo.

11
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:17,120
- Damn.

12
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,000
- I'm trying to hit the spring.

13
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:19,840
- What?

14
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,200
- Did you hit the spring on your mic stand?

15
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,280
- I hit the spring on my mic stand.

16
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,120
- Oh, okay.

17
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,940
- It's possible.

18
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,780
- Like this.

19
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,620
- Ah.

20
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:27,440
- It's a new instrument.

21
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,280
- Yeah.

22
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,120
- Sounds good.

23
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,280
mic stand Geiger? Yes I do, thank you for asking. Does it have a funny string?

24
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's see, yes this guy right here. Whoa! That's a brand new sound. Yeah the spike on the levels on that is very high.

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
At first I thought you were going to say the spike on the mic stand. Not a defensive mic stand.

26
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,800
Bowser's mic stand. Yeah, well if you don't want to get too close you get too many pops. So it's a

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,460
pretty good invention by the Chinese I believe. An evil spiked mic stand? Yes. I

28
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:07,400
might have to invest it. It keep me from touching it all the time? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

29
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,200
and also it's covered in like hot sauce too. Yeah. So like if you have any cuts on your hands. Yeah.

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,960
It'll fuck them up. That's kind of genius. That's from my own various spillages

31
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:26,200
though. Oh come on. I'm disgusting. I'm a good fast liar. Jesus Christ. Yeah it's true. Fuck you. We're here with

32
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:32,800
Geiger from what report this post I'm sure everybody knows great podcast sure

33
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,880

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,600
Plus subscriptions or something you have no control over my mind I'm pretty

42
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,760
excited for it I mean it's not like you already have you're already bringing it

43
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:28,780
everywhere I think that's yeah just how fun it is to a vacation so yeah that was

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,360
my vacation it was too snowy to go outside so I opened up beach VR yeah I

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,160
was in rec room I was watching Rick and Morty with a bunch of nine-year-old you

46
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,400
know and then one of the nine-year-olds was like on the voice chat he's like why

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:54,960
got blue hair it's a good time it's a really good question why why he why do

48
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,240
you got that now pardon my ignorance but what is this virtual reality game you're

49
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:07,520
talking about oh again you're 50 years old yeah well I know about virtual

50
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,080
reality and I know about games I'm playing various virtual reality games

51
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,120
it's not just okay and one of them is just a is just a theater that you sit in

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,060
with other people other disembodied heads and hands and you all watch movies

53
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,720
together and throw popcorn and you talk to each other and eat their tomatoes at

54
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:35,920
the screen they could have been women with your high voices I didn't ask their

55
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,600
age yeah it's probably a bunch of hot babes

56
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,120
fucking it definitely was I think about it

57
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,200
they weren't children I just told you they were hot babes everywhere and they

58
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,600
just couldn't say their ours very well we're kind of Eastern European model

59
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:06,920
types you know. That's just, that is the reason. But yeah I've just been stuck in VR so that's

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:14,280
been my week. Have you uh, if I got a VR thing I would try going to sleep with it on and see

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,120
what happens. So you can wake up in it? Yeah. What? That would scare me dude. I know, no

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,320
I would just want to see what, I would want to experience it you know. I feel like that's

63
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,000
probably want to that would be too scary but I want to do it I want to see what

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,680
it's like I want to put a dream in virtual reality so that I don't have to

65
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,200
do it myself that'd be pretty cool you just whenever you go to bed you just

66
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:40,800
watch him basically a an eight-hour movie about like you in middle school

67
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,960
you think anyone's ever like gotten high and done VR no no no that would no that's

68
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,640
illegal what are you talking about? I think the laws apply in virtual reality?

69
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,400
That's a good there's a lawyer out there that will take that case. Yeah definitely

70
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,100
some laws were being broken in that theater that I was watching Rick and

71
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:10,200
Morty in. A whole lot of laws. Not by me. What laws? What are you talking about? But there were other people there that were

72
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:22,260
that were they were being a little weird to these beautiful women. It's just how it

73
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,240
is dude. I mean it's it is the wild wild west. There's no there's absolutely no

74
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,080
regulation. There's only the terms of service of Facebook. Dude that just

75
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,600
reminded me of the time we played VR chat. I've completely forgot about that. Oh

76
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,320
yeah. Yeah I'm too scared to go into that one. Yeah. Why? What would be scary with that one?

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,440
Because people use it. So I found out that in VR chat, which Geiger, if you don't know

78
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,200
this, it's like a, it's like second life basically with like virtual reality.

79
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Okay.

80
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,640
But people, I guess what they do in VR chat is that there's tons of people buying these

81
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:58,000
haptic feedback tubes and putting them on their penises and then they'll like walk up

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,920
to you in VR chat and be like, put your hand on my crotch because it'll make their like

83
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,760
actual dick vibrate.

84
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,680
I feel like you can defend against that by just not putting your hand on their crotch,

85
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:16,360
I'm easily manipulated and I will try anything once which is a rule.

86
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,920
One day you're gonna come on to the podcast and say you jacked off Kermit.

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:27,000
I wouldn't jack off Kermit dude. Yeah you absolutely would. These are hot babes we're talking about.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Exactly. These are hot babes who just so happen to use their Kermit avatar.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,400
It was Kermit or Caillou or one of the backyardigans.

90
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm not gonna fucking jack them off unless I have...

91
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,480
If you see a guy walking around VRChat with the Caillou avatar, you know that's someone

92
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
really fucked up.

93
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,480
Because like no kid would be using a Caillou.

94
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,000
I wanna look like Caillou.

95
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,120
That show sucks so fucking hard, man.

96
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Caillou?

97
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,120
You're not a fan?

98
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,120
No, fuck Caillou.

99
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
What's your beef with Caillou?

100
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,120
It's not even funny.

101
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,120
and there's no good violence.

102
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,040
They don't even like, if you're, like there's the whole scenes aren't even colored in.

103
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,880
There's just like white around.

104
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,880
That's just lazy.

105
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
That's just lazy.

106
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
Yeah.

107
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,880
You're right.

108
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,880
Come on.

109
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:12,880
And they don't do any like family guy cutaways.

110
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,880
Yeah.

111
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,120
Didn't, I think I read something that somebody posted about like a Caillou episode got like

112
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,360
banned because Caillou like pinched his baby sister too hard with like malicious intent.

113
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
He's a savage dude.

114
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
Yeah.

115
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,040
Savage being savage makes your hair fall out.

116
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:34,280
I saw an episode of Arthur the other day and I caught the end of it and it was

117
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,520
what's what's the girl's name in the show again I caught the end of it

118
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:45,960
TD or something DW. She walked up to this sandbox full of kids and

119
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,360
she was like what's going on and then they started talking to her and then

120
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:56,480
their words were bleeped out and so apparently earlier in the episode DW

121
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,600
accidentally taught the kids some like slurs or something this is a real

122
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,720
episode I don't understand I don't know what I taught them slurs yeah because

123
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,780
they were like hey what's up beep and then she was like oh brother what did I

124
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:18,020
do so there's an episode of Arthur where DW teaches a preschoolers hate speech

125
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,400
Jesus Christ they just bleep it out they don't even go for like a like a fake

126
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,840
word no that would be good but yeah they're all art for she can just make

127
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,040
something up they're not like maybe maybe anteater is like a slur in Arthur

128
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:42,040
you know maybe it is so true what else would be a slur in Arthur dog dog face

129
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:56,480
how about yeah rabbit bitch yeah yeah well what else other animals yeah but um

130
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,600
yes I that's have you guys done anything interesting this week I have not like

00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,880
left my house except to find cables to plug into my VR headset no me neither I

132
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,680
guess I did go out of the city and stay at a lake house for a couple days but

133
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,160
that again doesn't count. Yeah I did some real fun shit this past weekend we had

134
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:24,600
the Super Bowl here in town and we I watched it with a local family and then

135
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,200
the game over and there was a bunch of people setting off fireworks because our

136
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:34,160
local beloved team won a championship and I went to a neighbor's house I never

137
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,480
met before around midnight and drank with that guy for a while. Wow what's it

138
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,680
like to have Tom Brady on your side now yeah no he stole he stole Tom Brady he

139
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:51,560
stole Tom Brady from Patrick mm-hmm from Patrick from Cameron Wow dude from

140
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,600
Cameron and really fucked New England is a lot of different states it's true

141
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,560
definitely doesn't include Massachusetts that's for sure okay all right

142
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,960
famously fucking taken whatever dude wait how old is Tom Brady now he's kind

143
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:13,800
like the Geiger of football. He's like the oldest shit and still doing it. Yeah.

144
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:20,720
Yeah. Is he like 50 now? How old is that fucker? He's not 50. He might be 50. He's not fucking half of a hundred.

145
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:29,480
He's 70. No. He's 43. 40, that is fucking, that's pretty old to be doing football. Yeah. To be so good at it.

146
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:36,160
Can you imagine a 43 year old podcaster? No. That would be disgusting.

147
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,720
Now a 36 year old podcaster. That's right maybe in the money zone. That's where they need to be.

148
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,480
That might be the perfect age actually now that I think about it. What about two 36 year olders

149
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:54,640
hosting a podcast together? Oh my god dude go on. Where could I even listen to a podcast like that?

150
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,120
Well it's interesting you asked. I would check out Report This Post.

151
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,080
Oh I actually listen to that it's terrible. I have no interest.

152
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,560
I think the hosts are pretending to be 36 too.

153
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,440
I thought that the title of the show was an instruction and I kept, I keep reporting every

154
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
episode.

155
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:19,600
Every episode you're like, yeah this is uh, this is impersonation.

156
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,280
They're pretending to be old.

157
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,800
We were honored to have Caleb on for an episode a little while ago and I think my favorite

158
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:35,480
part was probably about what 45 minutes in we're doing it and then Caleb's like

159
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,480
oh I think my recorder stopped like 30 minutes ago

160
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:56,560
not to me though by the way let me check my yep we're good just making sure yeah

161
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,760
it seems like every time I go on somebody else's podcast I have a massive - the

162
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,240
other day when we did when we did Chapo my downstairs neighbor for the first

163
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,880
time since I've moved here decided to drill into the ceiling for the entire

164
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,720
hour that we were doing Chapo Tram House he was like yeah and then and then it

165
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,960
stopped and I was like okay thank God he's not drilling anymore and then he started hammering the ceiling

166
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,600
yeah he was putting a tin can up there so he could listen in

167
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,440
I think he was a damn liberal. He might have been a damn lib. He was so mad that I was

168
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,160
I was well I did go on there and destroy socialism that's the other part.

169
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,160
That's true. Yeah I took him down. We kind of roasted them on their own turf.

170
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:46,680
Yeah exactly we were like there's no such thing as a free lunch and they got

171
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,360
really mad at that. Yeah but the thing is like the way we did it too was so subtle

172
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:54,240
that they kind of almost did it for themselves. Yeah they didn't realize that

173
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,560
we weren't laughing with them we were laughing at it was like a Borat thing

174
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,440
and we all did insane ethnic characters to expose the hypocrisy of the Jumbo

175
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:15,180
Tramazos. And we were all being Polish. Yeah. What they didn't realize was at the

176
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,720
end when we said thank you so much for having us on thank like thank you so

177
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,280
much we were actually it was actually just like a dark intellectual technique

178
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,280
called sarcasm that we were using. Not many are aware of.

179
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,560
They were not.

180
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:33,080
And let me, their internet addled brains, they were not able to comprehend it even a little

181
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,080
bit.

182
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,360
No, they didn't even realize that we were making fun of them the whole time.

183
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,280
And we still are.

184
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,680
We didn't even watch that movie.

185
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,080
No, we just barely.

186
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,560
We made up the whole movie as we went.

187
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,640
That's like a lot of sarcasm to use in one podcast, it sounds like. Just sarcasm and

188
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,880
irony too, I think.

189
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Yeah, we actually did a little bit of both.

190
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,580
Yeah, I had to lay down after because I did so much.

191
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,280
Yeah, yeah, Pat had a headache.

192
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,080
I will say one thing, one more thing about VR.

193
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,080
The other day, I went on a four-hour VR trip

194
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,280
through Half-Life Alyx, which is very realistic.

195
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,180
Yeah, what was that like?

196
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,080
How late at night did you text us?

197
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,580
You were like, "Half-Life Alyx is the craziest thing."

198
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,680
It was like 2 in the morning and I was playing forever.

199
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,780
And then I couldn't fall asleep because I was so freaked out.

200
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,240
And so I had to just stare at it.

201
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
I had to pour a glass of water

202
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,480
and then move it around in my hands

203
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
and then just stare at it for like an hour.

204
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,400
(laughing)

205
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,800
I was just like, what the fuck?

206
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,280
Like, am I alive?

207
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,840
And it really terrified me, dude.

208
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,680
I don't know that I'll ever play that game again.

209
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,080
It was so scary.

210
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,560
Yeah, that's a problem.

211
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,800
They need to make things just not realistic.

212
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,640
- True. - Everything needs

213
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,920
to stop being so awesome.

214
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,560
- Well, like, reality is realistic.

215
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,760
virtual reality shouldn't be also realistic exactly there should be a

216
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,400
cartoon in it true you should be able to be a car you should be able to put

217
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,000
yourself in the Simpsons house and be kind of an extra Simpson family member

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,120
oh that'd be amazing yeah and you create your own Simpsons episodes so VR and you

219
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:11,400
can just like Walker it like you could like it could be like oh this in this

220
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:15,640
episode like it's like while Bart is at school I can walk from the school and go

221
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,320
of the house and see what Homer was doing. Oh my god. While the show was showing Bart. I bet he's watching TV.

222
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,280
I bet he's watching TV and eating donuts. I would bet he's at work.

223
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:31,720
It's during the day. That is okay. All right. It could be a weekend. Okay but hey. Somebody's a Simpsons fan.

224
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,280
This is Homer Simpson we're talking about though. This guy doesn't like work. You know I think

225
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,280
there's every chance he could be. You never know. That's the thing. They don't have these kind of

226
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:43,720
behind the scenes stuff for The Simpsons. They have it for most other shows. They need it though.

227
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:50,680
Yeah, he's at work asleep at work, right? Yeah, famously hates work, but still goes to it like a

228
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:56,440
fucking idiot. I got fired like nine months ago. That was like great. That's it.

229
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,520
So you're saying if only Homer had been fired,

230
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:05,080
maybe he could have been saved. And I don't think he's ever been fired on the show or

231
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:11,960
taken on new jobs or anything. No, but I have seen every episode. So yeah, Simpsons Pro.

232
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,400
all right uh you guys want to do this list no not really all right that's that's fine so anyway

233
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:27,720
about my simpsons idea this is what if you found out that bart had an identical twin and sometimes

234
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,480
it was that twin in the show and you didn't you know and you could be the twin in and you could

235
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,280
be the twin in vr i wouldn't want to be bart simpson's twin dude i'd be so short i'd be short

236
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:41,080
as fuck you would not be any shorter than you already are bart simpson is not five nine and

237
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:48,620
three-quarters you don't know that he is not six feet tall everyone else is like

238
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,460
eight feet that's a secret they don't tell you about the Simpsons that everyone's really big

239
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:58,300
you would know in VR you find out all the Simpsons are actually 30 feet tall

240
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,860
I don't see I don't want that kind of forbidden knowledge that's why VR is a

241
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,820
problem well then you just wouldn't play the the Simpsons behind-the-scenes

242
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:11,260
experience but that's an easy Marge upskirt if she's 30 feet tall that's

243
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:17,860
like dude where's my car remember what she walks over him oh yeah do I do yeah

244
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,220
that's right that was it that was a movie I just remember that finding the

245
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,500
car that's all you remember uh-huh I'm gonna remember movie you got to check it

246
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:30,980
out the barbers are funny as hell it's so funny and that's the see it that's the

247
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:34,940
other thing you think anyone's ever gotten high and watching dude where's my

248
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:43,820
car again I don't think nah those don't really go together okay what about a

249
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,740
VR thing where you can go to dude where's my car you can see where the car

250
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:52,540
was the whole movie oh you can wait it's a car!

251
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,940
And then the movie just happens far away from you.

252
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,500
Yeah, that's the car's point of view.

253
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,000
Yeah.

254
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,500
The director's cut.

255
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,940
He'd sit in the car.

256
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:01,660
Yeah.

257
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,820
You just sit in your car looking at your phone and that's an hour and a half of that.

258
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Yeah. It'd be perfect. I do that all the time.

259
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:15,740
90 minute lunch breaks every day. Just staring at the phone.

260
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,780
There is one thing in VR where you can just use your computer.

261
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,740
And it's like, why would you do that?

262
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,260
Why not?

263
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,620
I guess the appeal is you can use your computer like in space.

264
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:33,060
But it also looks like shit and there's like insane latency

265
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:37,080
But it's using your own computer via

266
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,620
Okay, it just streams to your VR headset and you're like, okay, you're just looking at like you're so well

267
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:51,380
it's it starts up and there's like this music and like all the like a galaxy forms in front of you and then just

268
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,940
Your computer pops up and then you're just on you just like looking at your files

269
00:18:57,260 --> 00:19:03,500
Damn, it's pretty fucking awesome, dude. That's cool. I can't wait to pour so much money into this

270
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,040
Yeah, just be broke every month because I'm buying how much you fucking it's only like 300 bucks

271
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,020
Jesus Christ, yeah

272
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,020
It's not that bad. Yeah

273
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:21,660
Hey, man for a portal to another to insider worlds. Yeah, how much a wormhole Pat?

274
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:30,160
library it's called it's called your library card oh my god that's that yeah

275
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:37,780
no books are bullshit dude yeah I'd rather get lost in a good movie you can

276
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,860
actually watch movies with all your nine-year-old friends and oh really yeah

277
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:51,300
well just saying dude that's 300 bucks ever spent you already you've you've

278
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,860
pulled your thingy out on there. I didn't. Where would I put it dude? I don't have a third controller.

279
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,980
No, in real life you've watched the, you've gone to that website.

280
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:06,940
What website are you even talking about? VRBangers.com. VRBangers? This better be a

281
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:14,660
hip-hop song. I have to check this out. I'm gonna check out VRBangers. That, what

282
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:21,420
could that be dude these drum solo videos or something? Where I get to be the drummer?

283
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:28,980
This is it's a POV shot from Travis Barker's drum set. That actually sounds awesome and

284
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:36,580
I would do that game. Yeah. Yeah I will not do the porn I refuse to. That surprises me.

285
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,700
Yeah I honestly I thought. I feel like you're just saying that for the show because that's

286
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,740
like the opposite of the person I know you to be. What I don't like porn. You know what

287
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:54,100
it is is he hasn't done it yet I haven't had the house to myself I think once

288
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:59,220
you're in the virtual reality world that you are by yourself from you can just

289
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:02,860
start jacking off that no one is a very good point yeah you put your headphones

290
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,940
on and you have the headset on your own little world there will be one day when

291
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:12,180
Janet gets back from work and like I'm I'm in the bathtub and it's filled to

292
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:27,420
the top of peanut butter in VR like moving through like a colonoscopy in

293
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:42,700
virtual reality drowning in Riley Reid's ass please save me yeah that day is

294
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:46,460
coming that that will be a reckoning because you're gonna have to have like

295
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,180
the court going across the house from your computer to the bathroom

296
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:58,740
you have a whole pulley system and there's like scratches that go from the bathroom

297
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:07,140
all the way to the computer desk and back and you're like I'm just jacking off I'm

298
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,700
like okay don't say anything but fart my face but don't let me know you're there

299
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:21,980
just fart right near my face. Ugh. Come on dude. That's pretty gross. Come on. Come on Caleb. What's wrong with you man?

300
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:29,740
You nuts. I need to stop making purchases. Okay let's do this list and stop talking about my awesome new life.

301
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:37,740
This is things you do that you would never admit to on the top tens. Yeah kind of

302
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:41,820
irrelevant. Yeah the description is no sex-related or x-rated items please.

303
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:46,620
Items that fall in that category will not be added to the list. Yeah we'll see

304
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,500
about that. Yeah. Number one you like a person but you are insisting that you

305
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:59,220
hate him or her. I would do that. I hate fake friends. Mm-hmm. No this is it.

306
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:06,140
This is the opposite of fake friends. I hate real friends. This is if you like someone but you say you hate them. Why would you do that?

307
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:11,540
Oh yeah you're right. I don't know about this situation. Yeah I thought it was a hating

308
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,740
fake friends thing. That's why I said I would do it. Well Ron Luna comments, two comments

309
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:22,240
actually "You can't hide it because you are blushing" and then also "I know lots of people

310
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,740
doing this. They are so bitchy with that guy and they do lots of fantasy about him." What's

311
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,860
up you pussy bitch? Like fuck you man. Get the fuck out of my, this is my fucking block.

312
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
Hey man, you're blushing.

313
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,260
I think you secretly like me.

314
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,540
I think you might be doing lots of fantasy with me.

315
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,540
Teehee, you caught me.

316
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:42,780
Are you do- Dude, you cannot do fantasy with me right now.

317
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:43,780
Come on.

318
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:44,780
I swear to God.

319
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:48,100
I swear to God, if you do fantasy with me- If you do some fantasy shit with me, I might

320
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
wild out on you.

321
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,340
I'll freak the fuck out.

322
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,660
You do fantasy at me.

323
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:56,140
I hate my fantastical friends.

324
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,100
Number two, don't wash hands after using the public restroom.

325
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,700
- But just public?

326
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,420
- Here's a comment from Hi there.

327
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,180
It says, "In the pre-COVID-19 world,

328
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,700
"I did this from time to time.

329
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,480
"Now, not so much."

330
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,900
- Oh, they mean not washing.

331
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,960
For a second, I was confused there.

332
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,220
I thought they were saying they stopped washing their hands

333
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,780
because of COVID-19.

334
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,820
- That's what I did.

335
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,580
- Yeah, that's a boss move.

336
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,820
- Build up an immunity.

337
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,780
- Yeah.

338
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,340
- I've never really cared about washing my hands

339
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,180
or germs or anything.

340
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,000
- Oh, yeah.

341
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,020
You don't have to wash your hands after you pee.

342
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:33,700
I don't really I don't really believe in germs as much as most people I think.

343
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,340
After you poop though you got to wash your hands.

344
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,700
You know I mean it depends.

345
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,380
You're touching your butt.

346
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,540
Well no you're touching paper that touches your butt.

347
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,460
Right but it can get through the paper.

348
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,420
What kind of toilet paper are you buying that has like are you buying like lace toilet paper?

349
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,540
I'm using tissue paper.

350
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,500
Doilies.

351
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,180
Fishnet toilet paper.

352
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:54,260
It's from all the presents I got.

353
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,620
I'm using the tissue paper for my presents.

354
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,140
That's right it's a happy birthday man.

355
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,540
Yeah, happy birthday, Pat.

356
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Thank you.

357
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,300
No, I mean, you should wash your...

358
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,740
Do you guys ever just wash the hand that you wipe with, though?

359
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,240
No.

360
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:09,740
What?

361
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,240
What?

362
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,960
[laughter]

363
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,760
You guys don't do that?

364
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
Why would I do that?

365
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
That seems right.

366
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
How do you wash one hand?

367
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,760
Just like that?

368
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
Because I'm using my phone with my other hand.

369
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,060
[laughter]

370
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,660
I don't want to put it in my pocket, so I just wash the...

371
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,060
You're on a phone call.

372
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,060
Yeah, I'm on a...

373
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:33,820

374
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:40,620
cat away explain that to her now it was it was stated that you shouldn't you

375
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,580
don't need to wash your hands after you pee which I normally agree with but I do

376
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:52,900
I do stick my fingers up my ass while I pee I mean then you just again you wash

377
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,500
that hand that's just something you got to do when you get older though

378
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
You're checking for lumps.

379
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
[laughter]

380
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,500
Once you turn 30, you have a free pass for the rest of your life if somebody catches you with your hand in your ass.

381
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,500
I've found many brown lumps.

382
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
[laughter]

383
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:17,500
You gotta get in there and you gotta squeeze your balls from the inside like a clown's flower.

384
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:24,500
Yeah, just play in your fucking butt balls wiener and taint like a one man band to see if you have prostate cancer.

385
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
That's what you have to do, just shoot like a popcorn.

386
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Like a clown's flower?

387
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,500
The penis really is a clown's flower, isn't it?

388
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Yeah, dude, it has a button that makes it squirt.

389
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
That one's in your ass.

390
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,500
Yeah.

391
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Yeah.

392
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Yeah.

393
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,500
Number three, you drop food on the floor, but you eat it anyway.

394
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Oh, you nasty.

395
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Big time.

396
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
I have no problem with this.

397
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,500
Never had an issue doing that.

398
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
I have an issue with this.

399
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
It depends on the floor.

400
00:26:53,500 --> 00:27:00,060
yeah I will say if I'm in a barn I will not eat the food right yeah yeah I've

401
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:06,620
seen osmosis Jones if I'm in my poop floor room I will not do that if I'm in

402
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:11,660
war-torn Syria and there's just bodies everywhere I'm not picking up you know

403
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:18,580
anything that's I don't want all that shit on my eggs just walking around with

404
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,860
with a plate full of three scrambled eggs and cereal.

405
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,180
(laughing)

406
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,060
Fuck, I hope I don't drop any of this.

407
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,380
- A giant Scooby-Doo, like quadruple-decker sandwich.

408
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,420
(laughing)

409
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:33,660
And just tripping over body, whoa, whoa!

410
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,780
- Yeah, starving kids are like reaching up from the ground

411
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,300
to try to eat the lettuce off of it.

412
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,700
Hey, if it drops, you can have it,

413
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,260
'cause I'm not eating that shit.

414
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,380
Disgusts me.

415
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:47,640
I dropped a Mike and Ike on the patio,

416
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,800
then ate it two minutes later. I'm fine. Yeah.

417
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,120
I think, I don't think a Mike and Ike, I think it's impenetrable to germs.

418
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,200
Yeah. It's got a hard shell.

419
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,440
You got anything that's not sticky, it has, when something falls on the ground, it's sticky,

420
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
it sticks up germs.

421
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Anything wet.

422
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:13,240
It picks them up like Katamari Damacy. But anything that's normal, you can't get germs

423
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,240
from.

424
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,120
Yeah. Any normal thing, any normal natural thing like a Mike and Ike.

425
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,400
a McDouble like if you drop a McDouble on the ground now I pick that back up if you drop

426
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:27,040
a McDouble and it comes open then maybe some germs can get inside it but the outside of

427
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,160
the bun and the edge of the patty that's safe.

428
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,920
If the bun stays closed as it hits the ground you're fine.

429
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,600
Have you guys ever eaten an old chicken nugget in your car?

430
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,600
No.

431
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,720
Yeah I've done that.

435
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,200
Fries are different.

436

the hallway in high school and somebody called me gross for picking it up and

445
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,040

446
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,560
it was gonna like poison you. I did fall asleep immediately after I put it in my

Yeah.

506
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,140
Number four, you lied.

507
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,140
Not me, I don't lie.

508
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,580
You lie all the time.

509
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,220
Yeah, I do.

510
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,020
That was my first lie I've ever done.

511
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,020
So it wasn't a lie then?

512
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,020
No.

513
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,740
I'm already too confused.

514
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,780
I'm instantly too confused to do this with you.

515
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,000
That's the point in saying that you lied.

516
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,580
That's a good point, Frostfeather of SnowClan.

517
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,780
I'm sorry about your fish crystal, by the way.

518
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:56,940
That's now I'm going to remember these usernames from that list and we're going to see somebody

519
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,220
who comments on here and is going to, "Oh yeah, their uncle choked on fish."

520
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,220
And their fish died.

521
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:08,660
Recipes to your school security guard.

522
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,700
Number five, you masturbate.

523
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,060
It's a good picture for this one.

524
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,060
I'm going to vomit.

525
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Yeah it looks like the obey thing.

526
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,060
Except it's a guy coming.

527
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,060
Didn't they say no like filthy stuff on this list?

528
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,060
They did.

529
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,060
It should be taken out.

530
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
Yeah you're right.

531
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
And then the guy, someone in the comments says it's funny because the description says no sex related items.

532
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Oh okay so this guy's kind of bucking the rules.

533
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
Wait a minute.

534
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
Wait don't tell me he's a bad boy.

535
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,060
Jackhammer619.

536
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
So the description lied to us.

537
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
Yeah you're right.

538
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,060
Oh my god.

539
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:44,420
that's a that's a fucking lie right there mm-hmm

540
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:50,300
jackhammer 619 comments I ate a basketball once teehee

541
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:56,660
the same guy said he he he up at the time no it's a different person it's a

542
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:02,900
different that one was the frost feather of snow clan I think so you got a laugh

543
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:07,860
through the pain of your fish crystal dying you have to eat he he through it I

544
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:12,420
I clicked on the TeeheePerson's profile and it's just a list of their comments,

545
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,780
which I've never seen a profile in this format before, but one of the top ones

546
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,860
is just "Ew, I don't want to eat powder."

547
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:31,060
What kind of powder? Who knows? We will never find out.

548
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:36,500
It's a comment on McDonald's on the list of top 10 places to go eat breakfast.

549
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,940
Dude, McDonald's, are you guys gonna get this new McDonald's breakfast, the McPowder?

550
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,740
Yeah, it sounds amazing.

551
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:44,980
Yeah, it's like a, it's like Huel or something.

552
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,300
Yeah, it's just sugar.

553
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,460
Just white sugar.

554
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,860
Number six, afraid to swim.

555
00:35:53,860 --> 00:36:01,220
Okay, so you do afraid to swim, but you would never admit to afraid to swim.

556
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,380
Okay.

557
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,620
All right.

558
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:04,980
I don't like swimming.

559
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,340
Yeah, no, I mean there's a lot that can go wrong with swimming, you know.

560
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,580
You could end up a pothead like Michael Phelps.

561
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,580
Mm-hmm.

562
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,140
That might be the worst outcome possible.

563
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,140
Yeah.

564
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,140
Yeah.

565
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,140
Look where he is now.

566
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,820
I hate that drug addict piece of shit.

567
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:25,180
Someone should fucking-- I wish he got fucking domed in a deal gone wrong.

568
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,260
I think it's so disgusting when he swims.

569
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,940
I wish he got eaten by a shark in the Olympic pool.

570
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,940
That's right.

571
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,500
When he swims you can see the track marks all up and down his arms too from where he's been

572
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:39,740
using. Yeah and also the ones where he got bit by sharks when he was practicing in the ocean.

573
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:48,220
Yeah he's a fucking piece of shit. And it's crazy that they didn't even kick him out for using PEDs.

574
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:54,860
I know yeah. Being bit by a shark by the way does give you the swimming powers of a shark.

575
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:57,340
Yeah he got bit by a half man half shark. Yeah.

576
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,980
Yeah.

577
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
And he did it on purpose.

578
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,700
Do you remember when that article came out that he sleeps like 30 minutes a day and then

579
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:10,340
just swims for like 15 hours and eats like 10 pizzas and shit?

580
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,340
That's sick.

581
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,340
He has a pretty awesome schedule.

582
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
That's so cool.

583
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
Yeah.

584
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,340
He's going to evolve.

585
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:19,580
Yeah, I remember it was like what, 15,000 calories a day or something like that?

586
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Yeah.

587
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,580
That's insane.

588
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,580
Something awesome.

589
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:25,500
Something that I would do any amount of swimming to be able to eat.

590
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,500
Yeah.

591
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,500
That's why he does that.

592
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:32,900
Yeah, he just wants to eat. He doesn't care about the Olympics at all. He doesn't give a fuck about swimming dude.

593
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,900
He just wants to eat fucking 30 pizzas a day. Right. He just lives like a ninja turtle now.

594
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:46,340
Yeah, including the weed dude. Yeah, those guys are fucking stoners. That's why they live on the ground. That's why they're green.

595
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,980
That's why they're fucking stoner. You're telling, hold on, you're telling me

596
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,780
that there's a group of turtles that love eating pizza and do karate under the sewers? And their dads are damn rat.

597
00:37:55,100 --> 00:38:01,780
yeah hey hold on were you guys high this stuff are you smoking yeah yeah hold on

00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,940
they live in New York and what the hell do the turtles crazy names even mean

604
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:41,100

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:04,420
this TV show supposed to be the office max show that's so true yeah what are

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,940
you but yeah what are you supposed to be a paper shredder what kind of fucking

609
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:15,660
shit is this? Sorry he's got a foot clan? Hey hold on, they got a freak. Whoa, okay. It was

610
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,780
weird but now it's just awkward. Yeah, a foot clan, that's what I would call it if

611
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,860
Quentin Tarantino had a clan. Hey. Another Hollywood man. Tarantino, another name of

612
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:37,740
the turtles. Famous turtle, Quentin Tarantino. Number seven, you sucked your own blood from a cut.

613
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:44,640
what I would tell people I did this yeah dude that's a brag yeah yeah one of the

614
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,860
comments is I got to the point of taking a swab of blood from my classmates face

615
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,360
and dot dot dot I think it's continued I think dot dot dot is supposed to be the

616
00:39:54,360 --> 00:40:00,060
I do this a lot well I don't know why you under misfortune that why would that

617
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,740
because there's another dot dot dot so there's another road dot dot dot and

618
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:09,260
their message you assume it's a two-part message it also would not surprise me if

619
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,780
somebody tried to do a two-part message on this fucking it's not even it's two

620
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:16,180
separate sentences you don't know that. The dots are at the end of both of them.

621
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,820
They're not. It's not like at the end of one and the start of another. Well one of them you can it's like the

622
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:27,500
fridge magnets you can put them wherever. Okay so in that case it makes way more

623
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:31,380
sense if it says I do this a lot. Hold on wait I wait these two comments both end

624
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,180
with a period so I think they might be part of the same comment. They could.

625
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:39,540
Well I didn't consume it like a vampire but it is kind of my natural reaction to

626
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:43,180
suck on the cut and then from a different user it tastes fine. I think

627
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,820
those might be a two-parter. Yeah. I'm not some if I get a cut dude I'm not I don't

628
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,880
want to know I don't want no blood in my damn mouth. I sprayed or if it's a

629
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,780
big enough cut I just kind of wiggle it around so the blood gets everywhere. What I

630
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,900
will say is if I will I'll suck the blood off a cut if like I don't like I don't

631
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,060
to wipe it on my clothes I don't have like a napkin like cuz I don't want to

632
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,860
like I don't want to smear it on myself you know what I mean if I get a cut I

633
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:11,900
just whip my dick out and I use the foreskin

634
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,020
I let it pool up in there and then I go to the toilet.

635
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,220
Me and Cam don't have that privilege dude.

636
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
And I shoot it like a super soaker.

637
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:29,380
Got my blood on you.

638
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,020
For the record, I also have that privilege.

639
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,500
Just so everyone's on board as far as the cut corner around here.

640
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:41,340
I remember as a kid I would like pee in my foreskin let it fill up and then yeah

641
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
blast it out everywhere.

642
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,340
Drop it on the toilet?

643
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,340
Blast it out!

644
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,340
The water balloon?

645
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,340
Yep that's right.

646
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,340
What kind of foreskin were you rocking as a kid where you could do that?

647
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,340
Relax fit?

648
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
That's the 90s.

649
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,340
Yeah this was the 90s we're talking here.

650
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,340
Boob cut, fucking penis.

651
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:03,340
Yeah.

652
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,340
Ready to rock. You put all your coins in there?

653
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
Oh yeah.

654
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:12,700
sure I've done that before actually yeah. You've put coins in your penis hole. I think I did that when I was like

655
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,380
eight I think I put a penny. Did you ever try putting like whipped cream in it I

656
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,780
feel like that'd be funny. No. Oh yeah okay. That's crossing a line. Funny for who?

657
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,740
Your penis. Okay. Oh cuz you could fill it up with like the whipped cream or like

658
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:33,820
the easy cheese and then just dispense it out. Yeah. Somebody's like damn I'm hungry.

659
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,140
You want a tiny bit of whipped cream?

660
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:42,260
You pee a tiny bit and it forces that it displaces that amount of whipped cream out on top of

661
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:46,100
your friend's strawberry shortcake.

662
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:51,380
Now that's I'm so glad that I went through the terror of having my penis chopped off as

663
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:55,380
a child so I didn't get to do any cool pranks with it later.

664
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,820
It would have made me too powerful as a kid.

665
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,820
Yeah.

666
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,300
It would have been bad for the people around me if I'd had an extra compartment.

667
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,660
In virtual reality you can see what it's like yourself.

668
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:06,660
Oh that's right.

669
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,660
Yeah.

670
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,660
Oh my god that's a really fun tab simulator.

671
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,660
That would make a killing.

672
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,660
Four skin simulator?

673
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:19,380
Yeah, because all those people, like the anti-circumcision people, would go out and buy VR headsets.

674
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,380
We gotta get on this.

675
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,980
I think we got an idea dude.

676
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:23,940
We gotta talk to a developer right now.

677
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,940
Okay.

678
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,940
Yeah.

679
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,700
Patrick, you should email back that guy who keeps emailing us about chipset.

680
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:29,700
Oh yeah, okay.

681
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,700
Have you talked about that before?

682
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,900
I heard you had one idea for my other app, but I have a completely different one.

683
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:39,220
Who the fuck did you email that guy in the first place?

684
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,220
No.

685
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,580
I don't know how we found the email.

686
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:49,540
Some guy, some app developers, like a month ago, he just emailed the podcast email just

687
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:54,420
repeatedly, like fucking once a day for weeks, just saying like, "Hey Patrick, just wanted

688
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,500
to circle back about your idea for Chip's app.

689
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,900
I would be willing to develop this app if you like, and we can talk rates," and just

690
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,460
kept emailing over and over.

691
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:04,220
Matt had an idea for an app that is,

692
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,980
you can look at different bags of chips.

693
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,600
And then this guy has been,

694
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,280
he's probably sent about 600 emails to the podcast email,

695
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:14,120
just trying to make some money.

696
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,380
He doesn't do it anymore.

697
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,220
Yeah, he took a hint.

698
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,020
I already talked to, I already had a fucking,

699
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,660
I already had it in the works.

700
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,000
Yeah, dude, he was trying to fucking undercut you.

701
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Did we ever reply something mean to him or not?

702
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,260
Dude, he was trying to Mark Zuckerberg you, dude.

703
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,860
I think I was gonna reply something mean to him

704
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,220
and then Patrick told me not to.

705
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,180
I'm gonna check really quick.

706
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:35,380
the Winklevoss twins and this guy he was gonna hire him and be like yeah how's

about which chips you ate okay it's like the letter box media yeah exactly

711
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,380
letterbox chips that's pretty good I found out why he stopped replying to us

712
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,780
why cuz I replied to him after he sent a bunch of emails and I said we are going

713
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,380

714
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:20,460
Wow he got really offended trail yeah I don't want to make an app like that

00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:04,260

728
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,980
- Just come out and say it, dude.

729

754
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:05,020
doing with them holding their hand and watching Rick and Morty with them

755
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:10,300
Yeah, imagine spying on them from the back of the classroom.

756
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,500
You just imagine doing that?

757
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,060
You don't even actually do it.

758
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:14,060
No.

759
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,780
Opening a joint checking account, that's what I imagine.

760
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:18,780
With my crush.

761
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,780
We're starting our life together.

762
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,780
You're so beautiful.

763
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,060
You're starting a registry at Target.

764
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:28,140
I skip way past like the courtship, I skip the dating, I skip the fucking marriage.

765
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,140
Joint checking account.

766
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,140
Yeah.

767
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:31,140
I go straight to that.

768
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,140
I know what I want.

769
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:35,100
- We're doing a registry for my foreskin restoration surgery.

770
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,580
(laughing)

771
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,420
- Start again, start again.

772
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,460
- I would love if somebody could buy me an ice pack.

773
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,500
(laughing)

774
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:45,860
- An ice pack and some weights, and some strength.

775
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:48,140
- Yeah, I'm hoping to get really, really strong

776
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,020
while I'm recovering.

777
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,380
- Have you guys seen those devices out there?

778
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,860
- The foreskin restoration ones?

779
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,020
- Wait, there's a device?

780
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,220
I thought it was a surgery.

781
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,060
- Oh, well.

782
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,900
- There's both.

783
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,060
- There might be a, is there a surgery?

784
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:01,380
- There's a surgery where they just put

785
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,280
little bit of duct tape on it. Oh, these are the, you like stretch out your

786
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,640
foreskin, right? Yeah, yeah. It's like, it's like a, it really is like a system of

787
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,640
weights that you just like wear all the time. Yeah, I was on a, what's that, How To

788
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:19,780
with John Wilson. Is it like jelking? TLCTugger.com. Is it different from jelking? Yeah, that's the guy, that's the guy from How To.

789
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:27,000
That's our, that's our friend. TLCTugger.com, notice, COVID-19 delays are

790
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,260
possible, Black Lives Matter, and the product has been discussed on Jimmy Kimmel

791
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:40,860
I'm on I'm on r/forskin right now and it's uh it's just it's just pictures of

792
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:48,940
uncut penises I thought it would be something different but there's some

793
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:52,940
guys with a there's some guys with some baggy fits here hey Pat number nine

794
00:49:52,940 --> 00:50:03,500
number nine you are gay so you're supposed to say just say be mad ah there

795
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:09,100
we go that's better yeah that's much better you are gay which is something

796
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:15,360
you would do but you would never admit to doing is being gay I guess that's a no

797
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:28,200
no I am a straight lady yes you are Caleb are you serious I talk to you about

798
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,560
virtual reality for 28 minutes yeah and this is how you repay me that's that's

799
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,480
how I repay you with I can't well I'll tell you this much I'm not gay and I'm

800
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:45,880
not a girl my compass is towards girls which I guess my guess is that their

801
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:51,480
compass is their penis when it's erect yeah it's always pointing towards a girl

802
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,040
yeah I mean my penis points towards the nearest bitch even if she's behind me it

803
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:00,120
goes completely inverse and it pokes out of my butthole towards a woman standing

804
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:10,920
behind me in line. Did you let women stand behind you? No. No. That is gay dude. No, I don't let a...

805
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:20,120
No. Come on dude. I don't dude, I'm normal. Number ten, you pick your nose. Do you pick

807
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:29,400
every time I've sold like a bed on Craigslist or something I wonder if they

808
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:34,280
like got the bed or the chair and they like set it up at home and then they like

809
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,360
went to like put you know people store stuff under their bed they'll like put

810
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:44,560
something under their bed yeah and it's like five years of my boogers yeah yeah

811
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:51,240
and they'll just be like oh it must be an odd design yeah I guess if they're

812
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,880
really stupid they might think that yeah yeah yeah but also you see me there's no

813
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,560
way you think that I'm somebody who puts their boogers everywhere oh of course not

814
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:03,200
why would you know that based on looking at me that doesn't make any sense I'm

815
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,680
clearly I have class and I put my boogers in a job toilet is that where

816
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:14,040

817
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,920

818
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,800

819
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,800
Casserole.

820
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:24,800
That is fucking gross, dude.

821
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:33,800
Dude, can you imagine how great it would be to have your girlfriend's friends over for

822
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:38,560
a dinner party and when you want them to leave you just go, "Hey, I've been meaning to show

823
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:42,000
you guys something I've been working on for a few years."

824
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,040
Oh, I thought you meant like you come out with a...

825
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,600
You want them to leave so you bring out the booger dessert?

826
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:49,280
Yeah, I thought that's what we were...

827
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,560
You serve them the boogers.

828
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,560
I feel like just...

829
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,200
I feel like the very appearance of a jar full of boogers would make any woman leave your

830
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,200
house.

831
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,200
Why?

832
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,200

833
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,200
Why?

834
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:07,600
If I showed you a can of my boogers that I've been keeping, would you, like a Folgers can,

835
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:11,080
like a Folgers tin that I've just been throwing boogers into.

836
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,000

842
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:31,640

843
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:47,280
doesn't accuse anybody of anything it just says I farted I farted yeah you I

844
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,560

990
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,280
Hey Patrick, number 30, I shagged your mother.

991
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:00,560
Oh my god.

992
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,560
No you didn't.

993
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:03,560
What does shagging mean?

994
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,000
Shagging is like British for...

995
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,240
It's like British for long shaggy hair.

996
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,240
Yeah.

997
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,240
Oh, okay.

998
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,720
You're saying you cut his mom's hair.

999
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:12,960
It's giving someone hair.

1000
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,240
Oh, that's actually very sweet.

1001
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:21,560
Yeah, it's especially sweet since my mom lost all of her hair to cancer.

1002
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,560
True.

1003
01:01:22,560 --> 01:01:23,560
Yeah.

1004
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:28,440
She doesn't have cancer. No, I just wanted to have a nice moment.

1005
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:34,760
You just want to say are you the 21 panic fan by any chance? Why? What did they say?

1006
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,840
Uh, because their mom died of cancer

1007
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:45,080
All right, let's see north 35 you buy soundtracks to movies

1008
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,720
Why would that be bad? You guys got us

1009
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,440
Now statistically one of us on this podcast has to do that.

1010
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:56,600
I bought the Halo 2 soundtrack. I think I probably bought the Fight Club soundtrack

1011
01:01:56,600 --> 01:02:00,520
but I also might have pirated it I can't remember. I definitely had it in my iTunes library.

1012
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:05,960
I had the Train Spotting soundtrack. I'm pretty sure none of those are good.

1013
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:07,960
Yeah. Yeah. I think I got Team America.

1014
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:12,760
Oh that's a good one. Okay well that might as well be like a Weird Al album though.

1015
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,800
Right. You know. I got the soundtrack to Weird Al.

1016
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,280
Which I have, I did buy straight out of Linwood.

1017
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:19,000
Oh me too.

1018
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:19,480
Yeah.

1019
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:23,960
Yeah the one with the two disc, the two disc one with the DVD and it had all the music videos.

1020
01:02:23,960 --> 01:02:25,560
Fuck yeah I had straight out of Linwood.

1021
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:28,520
But here number, sorry, number 41.

1022
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,000
You don't go trick-or-treating for Halloween.

1023
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,240
And there's a comment here from Mocha Cat that says,

1024
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,760
"After 2012 I stopped going after my friends and I had a creepy encounter

1025
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,760
with this really tall bald skinny man.

1026
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:42,200
He kept on following us so we decided to take a different route to my friend Cat's house.

1027
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,280
An hour later we saw him on Cat Street walking around.

1028
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,000
It was really weird.

1029
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:49,320
Caleb do you want to talk about why you followed mocha cat?

1030
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:55,400

1033
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:13,080
Pegasister 12 said that. It took her till number 43 to find something she had done.

1034
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:19,120

admit to that because it's embarrassing dude that's creepy yeah yeah you wouldn't

1039
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:46,720
Because of what Varg Vyrknas has done. He's not death metal but nice try dude.

1040
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:54,160
You fucking idiot. I knew you would say that. Yeah.

1041

Because you knew you were wrong. Yeah. You knew you were wrong and you still said it?

1042
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,040
Mm-hmm. That's bravery. That's like a lie. Yeah that is almost a lie.

1043
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:07,760
It's kind of a fucked up lie. So you think it's okay to lie just to make a joke for the audience?

1044
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:14,400
no I'll never do it again thank you thank you all I wanted to hear this whole

well it's a podcast where my co-host Christian and I find goofy stuff online

1049
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:43,760
line and read it and I believe it's original idea.

1050
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:51,020
We've been caught. I do think you guys started like a month or two before us

1051
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:59,000
which is so - that sucks. But here's the thing Geiger, we actually have three guys.

1052
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,920
That's true. We have two. If you can't tell.

1053
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:07,720
first we have like do we have like two two different lanes there clear it's

1054
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:12,760
like our show on steroids it's like one extra person exactly yeah yeah yeah

1055
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:19,960

thousand times better than we yeah I will say the hardest I ever worked for a

1059
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:38,280
podcast was being a guest on Report Disposed. I was like what the fuck is all this shit? I gotta like look stuff up.

1060
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:43,560
Fuck this. But it was fun. I can't imagine putting effort into anything. I know. Can you believe it?

1061
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:48,920
It's so dumb. It's part of the reason why I got fired from my last job was I

1062
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:53,600
was like doing everything for the podcast while I was just I was like

1063
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:59,720
researching and then editing the podcast at work. Just on the clock? Yo yeah.

1064
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,720
Oh, fuck. That's sick, dude.

1065
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:03,720
Like a hundred percent. Like everything.

1066
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,720
Yeah. Respect.

1067
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:12,720
Yeah, I would bring in the episode like on an SD card and then put it on the computer and then do it.

1068
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:13,720
So it wasn't even like...

1069
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,720
Because you can't do it at home. You're too busy drinking alcohol and eating ice cream.

1070
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,720
Right.

1071
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:20,720
Yeah. There's no time.

1072
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,720
Yeah, so, but I also did that at work too. So, because I am addicted.

1073
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:27,620
- Well, yeah, that's the problem.

1074
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:30,120
Your job was alcohol and ice cream taster.

1075
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:32,640
(laughing)

1076
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,560
- All right, Geiger, thanks for coming on, man.

1077
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,220
- Thank you, everybody.

1078
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:38,520
Reportthispost.com.

1079
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:40,480
- Check it out. - Oh, you got a website?

1080
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,320
Fuck.

1081
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,260
- Yeah, actually, it's a website I made

1082
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:46,420
using the HTML knowledge I learned in the '90s.

1083
01:06:46,420 --> 01:06:47,600
So it's really-- - I bet it looks great.

1084
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,960
- It looks really sharp, yeah.

1085
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,000
- I gotta check this out.

1086
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,640
- It's got like images and text on it.

1087
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:57,440
So if you have a modem, it might be slow.

1088
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,840
Yeah.

1089
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,840
Man, I could embed so many images.

1090
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:03,240
- Oh my goodness.

1091
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,520
All right, thanks man.
