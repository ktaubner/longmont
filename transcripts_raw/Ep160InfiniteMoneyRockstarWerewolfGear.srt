00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,740
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,160
- You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,400
(laughing)

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,560
- Keep going.

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,280
(singing)

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,780
- I have something important to say.

8
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:19,880
- Okay, let's hear it.

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,200
- If everyone listening could please,

10
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,200
please go to patreon.com/podcastsaboutlists.

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,180
I am ruined.

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,180
We all are.

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,180
Oh, Cameron's not.

14
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,220
No, dude, cash out Cam.

15
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,900
Cash out Cameron's not.

16
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,740
We went to Atlantic City this weekend.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,460
Atlantic City has broken me.

18
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,700
I'm a different man.

19
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,700
I'm worse.

20
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,700
I'm a worse man.

21
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,700
I'm a bad man.

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,580
I rose from the ashes like a phoenix, but I didn't even need any ashes.

23
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,580
I was fine.

24
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,420
You mean you rose from the dead like Christ.

25
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,780
I rose from myself.

26
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,780
I rose from life.

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:03,020
How many times on the podcast did I say I was afraid of gambling because of how much I would lose?

28
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:10,780
Probably a million. You don't know didn't pain and then you didn't even lose the most though. You lost the least I did not

29
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,620
Lease and you put in the least money if you had kept going you would have made money

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,180
No, I would have lost no you also you you have the worst energy going on

31
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,220
I my strategy at the slots as you play until you get five dollars and then you can buy any drink you want

32
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,720
- Dude, you had the absolute worst strategy.

33
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,560
- The Doran system works every time.

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,400
- Imagine--

35
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,200
- You get a vodka cranberry whenever you want.

36
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,660
- Think about a soccer game, right?

37
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,500
- I've never watched it.

38
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,640
- There's a guy kicking penalty kicks, right?

39
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,480
- Yeah.

40
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,800
- If he walked up to it every single time like,

41
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,540
"Oh, I'm gonna miss.

42
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,120
"Oh, I'm gonna miss right now."

43
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,520
He would miss every single time.

44
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,780
- That's not the attitude I went--

45
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,660
- This is the Doran strategy in the soccer metaphor,

46
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,580
is if the guy walking up for the penalty kick,

47
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,820
if he kicked it 100 times in 10 seconds,

48
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,460
missed them all, and then walked off the field

49
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,020
like Charlie Brown looking at his feet.

50
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,540
(laughing)

51
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,360
- Dude, you just, you have to--

52
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,200
- That's the Doran system.

53
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
- You have to approach a slot--

54
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,000
- Look, the Patty Jackpot system--

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,160
- Listen, okay, I'm gonna let you in on a little knowledge,

56
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,760
and I shouldn't do this, because this is a free episode,

57
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,340
and I shouldn't be giving away these money tips.

58
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,420
- I'm not kidding, please, please.

59
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,460
There's over 100 hours of content on that Patreon, okay?

60
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,260
And $5 gets you, that's, come on.

61
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,600
- Come on, and also, if you wanna just send just me money,

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,460
you could do that, you could too.

63
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,540
- No, you gotta send it to me and Caleb.

64
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,580
- If you wanna just send me like a, just a bunch of money.

65
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,420
- And me too.

66
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
- And Cameron.

67
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,100
- Okay, fine, all the--

68
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,920
- And Patches.

69
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,100
- Okay, just do the Patreon then.

70
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,580
- Listen, here's the system, here's what you wanna do, okay?

71
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,420
- Okay.

72
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,240
- You're going in there,

73
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,580
you're putting your money into the machine,

74
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,180
you spend maximum three times, you are going to win money,

75
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,240
you're gonna be up 40 cents a dollar, it doesn't matter.

76
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,620
The second you're up, you cash out.

77
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,080
You shake your receipt around,

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,320
you shake the voucher back and forth, okay?

79
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,280
- Yeah. - Yeah, we gotta close

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,680
this window, dude. - Oh, fuck.

81
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,000
- That's okay.

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,600
- You guys gotta shut up out there with your motorcycles.

83
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,160
- You're shaking the voucher around, okay?

84
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,560
'Cause that's like aerating wine, okay?

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,960
That gets-- - Yeah, yeah.

86
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,040
It's like a decanter.

87
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,700
- Exactly. - Yeah, that's a good point.

88
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,300
- You're walking around and you're letting,

89
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,700
It's not your heart, okay?

90
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,540
It's not your heart that's pulling you to the next machine.

91
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,540
It's your spirit.

92
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,900
It's your soul.

93
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,140
Your soul is going to tell you where to go.

94
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,140
It's like a compass.

95
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,340
You walk over to the next machine.

96
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,980
One spin, you're going to win $17, okay?

97
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,740
You're up $17.40.

98
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,580
Next machine, down $40.

99
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,780
Doesn't matter, okay?

100
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,500
Next machine, down $20 more.

101
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Doesn't matter.

102
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,580
Next machine, you're going to be up $47,000.

103
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:45,580
That's right.

104
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,580
That's the system.

105
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,580
And it works.

106
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:48,900
Because they've got little cameras in the casino.

107
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:49,900
They're watching.

108
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,200
They're saying, "Who's shaking the voucher the most?"

109
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,200
That's the hustler.

110
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,780
that's the person that's gonna win the jackpot. We want to give that man all we can.

111
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:59,920
Right, who's the guy who hasn't ordered a single drink this whole time except for

112
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,460
one bottled water at the very end? I'm gonna dress up, next time we go I'm gonna

113
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:07,020
dress up like an Afghan veteran right? I'm gonna like, I'm gonna duct tape one

114
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,420
of my, one of my arms behind my back. That's a good idea. I'm gonna dress in full

115
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,540
fatigues, keep looking at all the cameras, saluting them and then sitting down.

116
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:18,700
See if they don't fucking, see if they don't treat me right. I'm gonna do

117
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,300
the opposite. I'm gonna go in, dress up like a Taliban soldier and I'm gonna

118
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,900
chase you around the casino.

119
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,300
Well that'll be even better for me, that might sell it even more.

120
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,060
Right, see but then whatever money you make, we split the profits.

121
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,580
No, I'm not going to split my money with a Taliban damn dirty low down son of a bitch

122
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,580
dog.

123
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:40,420
Here's another tip, and I really, I should not be giving away these tips, but I will

124
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,540
because I love the fans so much.

125
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,220
What you want to do, you want to go in there, put five dollars into the worst machine, the

126
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,820
most terrible slot, the one you can tell is not going to pay.

127
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,320
You put five minutes in there, five dollars in there,

128
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,580
five minutes at the machine,

129
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,680
you're gonna get down to 12 cents, okay?

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,740
You might start crying, you might think,

131
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,580
"I'm ruined."

132
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,640
No, this is what you do.

133
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,420
You take your voucher for 12 cents,

134
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,700
you look for the richest guy in the casino,

135
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,200
you walk over, you say, "Here man,

136
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,760
"let me just give this to you, I'm not gonna use this."

137
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,580
You give them the 12 cents, they add it to their slots,

138
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,760
you are entitled to half of whatever they win.

139
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,600
- That's true. - That's how it works.

140
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,980
- 'Cause you don't know which money

141
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,220
they're making their money off of.

142
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,540
- Exactly, exactly.

143
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,240
You don't know if they just made money off of your 12 cents.

144
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,420
You don't know what the proportion is,

145
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,260
so you just assume it's gotta be 99%.

146
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,100
- Exactly.

147
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,780
- Yeah, so you know what, I'll settle for half of the money.

148
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,580
- You tell 'em, if I hadn't put that 12 cents in,

149
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,700
you wouldn't be winning.

150
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,540
- Yeah.

151
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,940
- Gambling is so beautiful, dude.

152
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,300
I'm still, every time I close my eyes,

153
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,060
I'm just seeing cash, cash, cash.

154
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,460
- I honestly, I love Atlantic City.

155
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,180
I hate the gambling.

156
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,980
I love the free concerts.

157
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:44,340
- You sound like a mom.

158
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,180
- I love the atmosphere, I love the restaurants.

159
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,980
You love the atmosphere of Atlantic City?

160
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,700
You didn't even like the view.

161
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,660
You looked out at the marshes and you said, "Those are disgusting.

162
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,100
It looks like Final Fantasy VII."

163
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,500
It looks like Final Fantasy VII.

164
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,740
You know what Final Fantasy VII Advent Children looks like?

165
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,300
I do know what that looks like.

166
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
And you said it was disgusting.

167
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,300
It's a beautiful movie.

168
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,300
I never said it was disgusting.

169
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,300
You did.

170
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,300
You said it looked horrible.

171
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,300
No.

172
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,300
I said it looks beautiful.

173
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,300
I did not say that.

174
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,300
I said it looks like Final Fantasy VII.

175
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
I said look at the sun reflecting off the water.

176
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,300
No.

177
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,300
Yeah, that's what I said.

178
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,300
And you said, "This looks like a poop and a dirt combined."

179
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,600
I never said it looked like poop and dirt.

180
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
You did.

181
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
No, you just did.

182
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,400
all I call that dupe and I said what are you talking about that doesn't make any

183
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,400
sense you said this looks like dupe I said that's not a thing stop saying that

184
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,920
you said it's poop and dirt combined. Dupe is a thing though. Dupe is not a thing. I said it's it is a

185
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,680
thing it's called pert and he said no it's dupe and we got in a big fight yeah

186
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,360
pert's a shampoo dupe is not a thing. Dupe is a thing. Where? Gwyneth Paltrow has it.

187
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:42,680
That's goop and that's what she puts. No dupe is dupe is dude goop. Dude goop?

188
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,520
- Dude goop.

189
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,340
- Dude goop.

190
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,180
- It's dude goop that you eat.

191
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:46,020
- Dude goop, it's goop for dudes.

192
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,560
- It's dude goop dirt poop.

193
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,960
- They should, dude.

194
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,680
You should sign up for goop that should come

195
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,600
like Hello Fresh.

196
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,440
- Yeah, I got it.

197
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,000
- It's like, dude, doop is like,

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,560
it's a yoni egg that you put through your urethra.

199
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,400
- Yeah.

200
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,240
- Through your butt.

201
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,060
Why not your butt?

202
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,900
- No, no, it's your urethra.

203
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,740
Come on.

204
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,720
- Can you use those on your butt or is that dangerous?

205
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,460
- You can use a yoni egg on your butt, but be careful.

206
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,600
- That's probably a really good move like for self defense.

207
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
- Yeah.

208
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,640
shoot it out like a burrito. Yeah, exactly. Shoot it out like a burrito. Using a yoni egg on your butt is like when you

209
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,520
know like you see those posts that are like oh an inexperienced witch tried to

210
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,880
take on a law and got put in the hospital like you're not ready for the power.

211
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:31,320
Like there's too much shocker energy. That's why you put it in your penis first because it's both going

212
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,240
it's going to the same place it's going to the pee stot. Yeah, it's true. It's both

213
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,440
going there. How you gonna put an egg in the tip of your fucking thing? It's really

214
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,320
small. It's a tiny egg. Yeah it's the size of a grain of dirt. That would hurt. No it

215
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,520
wouldn't. It's really soft. It has fur on it. Look, if you don't subscribe to

216
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,600
dupe, if you don't go to dupe.com you won't you you won't understand it. I

217
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,040
don't think there is a dupe.com. There is a dupe. I'm going on incognito for dupe.com.

218
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,040

Dudegoop.com.

229
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Yeah, that's right.

230
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,740
We have an announcement to make.

231
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:37,940
It's officially, you know, before true fans of the podcast will remember, we had Next

232
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,420
Gear, okay?

233
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,700
We had Ultimate Gear.

234
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,700
We're entering a new era of the podcast.

235
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,460
We're entering a brand new gear.

236
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,460
That's right.

237
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,380
We are in money rock star, lots of millions of dollars gear.

238
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,700
Atlantic City changed me and now I would like to make,

239
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,100
I would honestly like to become a millionaire.

240
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,940
- Yep. - It's truly--

241
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,380
- And not because I wanna buy a fancy car,

242
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,580
I would just like to be able to sit at the slots

243
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,860
a little bit longer than I was able to.

244
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,580
You know, and lose a little more money.

245
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,100
- Yeah, when you're sitting at the slot

246
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,480
and you got $20 worth of credit in there,

247
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,940
you look at the guy next to you, he's got $350.

248
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,180
- You know that he wouldn't--

249
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,620
- That is the best guy in the world.

250
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,460
- Exactly, yeah.

251
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,300
- You know what it is, you have to keep putting money in

252
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
to keep winning.

253
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,380
I mean, yeah, the feeling when you, I mean, even when you have the $20 in there, you look

254
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,380
over and you see the guy next to you has $3 left, you are the most powerful man in the

255
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,380
world right now.

256
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,380
Exactly.

257
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
It doesn't matter how much he put in.

258
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,380
Exactly.

259
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,380
As long as he got more money.

260
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,380
Money is power.

261
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,380
Power is beauty.

262
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,620
Especially if you spend that money on Rise of Ra MegaWays.

263
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:44,140
Oh my God, Super Rise of Ra.

264
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Super Rise of Ra.

265
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,780
I didn't play Rise of Ra, but I did play Money Frog.

266
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Money Frog.

267
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,900
I played Buffalo Soldier bonus game.

268
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,460
Oh, Hip Hop Clinko.

269
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,460
Hip Hop Clinko.

270
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,460
I got a time.

271
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,460
I got a time.

272
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
Clinko was crazy.

273
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,180
Myths and legend, when that dragon breathes the fire onto the slots, you know you're about

274
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
to win big.

275
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,180
Oh, dude.

276
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Press the pustule.

277
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
That's a good one.

278
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,180
Yeah.

279
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,460
I forget what I was playing.

280
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,780
Which one did I cashed out $6.66?

281
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,780
Oh my God.

282
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,380
Yeah, Monster Slots, Monster Frankenstein.

283
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,620
I went there after I cashed out, but it was a...

284
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,820
Oh, Clinko Hip Hop Pump Up the Club bonus.

285
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,820
Yeah.

286
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,820
That might have been it.

287
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,700
And again, y'all. Had a great song. Oh my god, yeah. The Squirting Sprayer, that's one of the best.

288
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:29,420
Dude. Yeah. Funky... Funk? Funky Funk. Yeah. Yeah. There was a lot of different like combos.

289
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,820
The Dagwood. The Dagwood. Mighty Monkey Massacre. That was... Oh, that was so good. Yeah, when you

290
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:42,380
get the monkey decapitation bonus, oh my god. Gringo's Revenge. Gringo's Revenge is great.

291
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:46,380
The Skunk of the Day is a great one.

292
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,980
The Slug of Siam was a good machine.

293
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,660
The Slug of Science is also good.

294
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,580
Yeah, they put those two together. It's like Klinko and hip-hop Klinko.

295
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,700
There was also... Did you guys play Oriental Patrick?

296
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,980
Oh, that one was really good.

297
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,780
Oriental Patrick, Kung Fu Patrick. There was African Patrick.

298
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,620
Yeah, Patrick's Fortune.

299
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:12,540
Yeah, Patrick's Fortune. Yeah, there was a lot of good ones.

300
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,540
there and you know I didn't sign off on any of them.

301
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,540
Aztec chief Patrick.

302
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
Patrick the bone doctor.

303
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,540
Yup.

304
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,540
The witch doctor Patrick.

305
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Yeah.

306
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
Yeah.

307
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,100
And there's a lot of pictures of my face photoshopped into those things.

308
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,660
In a different, pretty offensive scenario.

309
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,660
Yeah.

310
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,660
Yeah.

311
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:29,660
Which is, you know, that's why I didn't like the machines.

312
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,620
That's why I like to go into the ice cream store and the, what was that place, Destinations?

313
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,620
The convenience store.

314
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,140
Destinations, the convenience store with the $8 soda.

315
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,980
They should, there should be more convenience stores called stuff like Destinations.

316
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,380
I agree. I agree. That's a really good idea.

317
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,380
What was the...

318
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
Ah, fuck.

319
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
There was another...

320
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,380
another thing.

321
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh, Guy's Sandwich Joint.

322
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,380
Oh, we did hit Guy Fieri.

323
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,380
I finally ate at a Guy Fieri restaurant.

324
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,380
That's been a lifelong dream of mine.

325
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,380
And it was the sandwich joint.

326
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Yeah, just a roast beef sandwich. It's pretty normal.

327
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
We live in New York. We could go to Times Square and go to

328
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
Guy Fieri's restaurant.

329
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
What kind of food does he make?

330
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,780
he make? He makes like... It's just a TGI Fridays, right? Yeah, it's just TGI Fridays, but you know,

331
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:21,340
it's got that, it's got guys, a seal of approval. Yeah, which is like a Michelin star. Yeah, yeah.

332
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:27,740
It's like a Michelin star, but the Michelin tire is on like a smash mouth, like hot rod.

333
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:33,180
It's on like a, it's on like a model T that has flames on the side. One of those.

334
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,220
That shit is sick, man. Yeah. Yeah. But I think we need to, I think I've decided like...

335
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,420
We also, we did also eat at Cosby's Crepes.

336
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:42,420
It's true.

337
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,420
We did, yeah.

338
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,420
Cosby's Crepes, I mean.

339
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,420
Cosby's Crepatorium.

340
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:52,660
Save it what you will about that guy, but those crepes, oh my god.

341
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,460
Those are some of the best crepes I've ever had.

342
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,820
Oh my god, Cosby's Crepe Crypt, that was just, that was a culinary delight.

343
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
Yeah.

344
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,820
Cosby's Crepes.

345
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,820
It's a bad name.

346
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:05,820
Yeah.

347
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,820
Yeah.

348
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,820
I know, it's just one letter off from what he did.

349
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Yeah.

350
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,400
- Yeah, be a creep, right?

351
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,240
- Yeah, creep.

352
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,060
- That's what we're talking about, right?

353
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,400
- Exactly, yeah.

354
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,620
- But I think I'm gonna get into political organizing,

355
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,700
but just for like trying to get gambling legalized

356
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:25,440
in every state.

357
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,280
- Yeah, absolutely.

358
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,120
- I think it like is a--

359
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,140
- Everybody deserves it.

360
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,500
- I think everybody deserves to gamble and should gamble.

361
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,120
And also I think we should lower the age of gambling.

362
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,960
- Yeah.

363
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,640
- Like way, way, way lower.

364
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,480
- 16.

365
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,020
Like if you can drive to the casino, you should be able to put a dollar in.

366
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:48,120
Did you see all those signs on the casino floor that said like don't leave children unattended?

367
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,620
No.

368
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,760
There's like a picture just like a really sad kid.

369
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,380
Dude, a kid in a casino, that kid would not be sad. That is like a paradise.

370
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,820
Also, you can just walk into a casino and use the thing.

371
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,060
You don't have to be, as long as you don't order a drink, they're never gonna card you for the casino.

372
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,300
Yeah, the whole thing you could can be done just with a I'm really this is a good piece of advice for any young people

373
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,700
We were listening. Yeah, just if just go to the casino. Yeah, start putting money

374
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,820
They're not gonna stop you as long as you avoid, you know, like poker or like anything with a dealer. You're fine

375
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,660
Yeah, exactly. Nothing with if you go to Crystal Cove, you can smoke as many cigarettes as you want. I'm in

376
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:29,340
Cove was a smoking section. Yeah, it's not Crystal. Where's Crystal Cove?

377
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,220
Crystal Cove is probably in the Middle East and it's probably magical but Diamond Cove is a room. It's not even a room

378
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,980
It's a half wall. Yeah, which is great for keeping smoking

379
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,900
Really really good. Yeah, you're not a little smoke on the on the regular floor

380
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,980
But like, you know once you go through that half wall that half wall keeps the smoke in. Yeah

381
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,020
Yeah, that's always the best dude. Like I miss smoking section

382
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:53,380
so I remember Golden Corral used to have a smoking section and it was literally a it was a

383
00:14:53,380 --> 00:15:00,500
Like a like a velvet rope. Yeah, and I and that was how I could still know well the velvet absorbs the smoke

384
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,500
It's like a sponge for smoke.

385
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,460
Also, smoke is disrespectful and low class.

386
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,340
If you put something fancy like velvet, it can't pass through that.

387
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Right.

388
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,340
Yeah, it can't go past.

389
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,620
It's like drawing salt around a ghost.

390
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,620
Exactly.

391
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,620
Yeah.

392
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,620
Yeah.

393
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620
It works really well.

394
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,620
It does.

395
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,700
Man, I do, I mean, smoking at a casino, pretty fun.

396
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,060
Smoking at a slot machine, that was awesome.

397
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
Pretty fun, yeah.

398
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,060
Yeah.

399
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,060
That was sick.

400
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:33,060
at the Tropicana, there was like that whole section

401
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,900
of just like the oldest, leatheriest people.

402
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,020
- You used to get the worst people there.

403
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:38,860
- Yeah, oh my God.

404
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,180
- Just smoking just like, like misty 100s.

405
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,020
- Yeah.

406
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,580
- So many people, like multiple people,

407
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:47,500
like old people just like passed out at the slot

408
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,180
with the hand of the spin button so badly,

409
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:51,380
wanted to just go over and do like a stealth,

410
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,740
like Indiana Jones switch and switch out our voucher,

411
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,940
like cash them out and put my 10 cent voucher in.

412
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,140
You would have lost nine cents if you did that.

413
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,380
Yeah, does a guy just pass that next to like a

414
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,980
Smucker's cigarettes somehow?

415
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,860
Like some cigarettes that just like,

416
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,340
like a hundred year old brand of cigarettes.

417
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,220
- These are unbrushable cigarettes.

418
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:15,660
- Yeah, it's like a cigarette with like a leather pouch

419
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,820
that they come in.

420
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,260
- But they didn't roll their own, they're just that old.

421
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
They just stocked up in 1920.

422
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,100
- I remember sitting down next to a--

423
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,420
- They're made of parchment.

424
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:31,020
I sat down next to a dude who like clearly was smoking before I got there and I saw him

425
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,060
like slam the machine like he was mad at it.

426
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,940
And I asked him if he had a light and he looked at me and just went, "No!"

427
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,940
Just like, "Let's go."

428
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:39,940
My man, dude.

429
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
Yeah.

430
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,340
The best part of going to the casino and seeing like everyone like being like, "Oh, these

431
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
people are weird.

432
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:49,300
Like this guy's like, this guy's swiping the screen on the slot to try and get to win.

433
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,660
Like this guy like is like has a special, he hits the button to try and win and like,

434
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,500
these people are so ridiculous and by the end of the first day I'm trying to like

435
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:01,540
cast spells to make it. My new thing was, it has worked one time so I started drawing an

436
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,700
infinity sign with my finger on the screen. And that never worked again. On the Dracula machine?

437
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,340
Yeah on Dracula. Oh yeah. What a machine that was. One of the best bonus games.

438
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,420
They also they had amazing Dracula characters I'd never heard of. Yeah well

439
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,220
you know you you never read the book dude you don't understand. What's that guy's name?

440
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,860
Renfield. Renfield's cool dude. He's an insane, he's insane.

441
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,180
Lucretia. He's great as long as he's a second best.

442
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,980
Lucretia's not a Dracula character okay. If you're gonna fucking try and be a...

443
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:35,980
Latoya. Shamiqua. Shamiqua? Kiki. What?

444
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,300
Titi. These are the girls. You're thinking of a different Dracula.

445
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:48,060
You're thinking of Mina Harker. The Dracula girl. Oh my god the Dracula girl.

446
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:52,060
Oh God. What's hotter than a girl? Oh my God, the bats and wolves.

447
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:56,780
With a girl. What's hotter than a girl? Let's be real. A Dracula girl? That's right.

448
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:04,060
Yeah. It's a damn good answer. She got the fangs. But we really want to design a podcast

449
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:11,100
with a list slot so bad. Yeah. I think that's the next logical step. I have a slot concept that I'd

450
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,100
like to pitch to you guys. It's, you know, when you walk around the casino, there's some that are,

451
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,100
you know, like Dracula themed or like Game of Thrones themed or whatever. But the

452
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,500
most prevalent thing is you'll see different ethnic themed slots. Like

453
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,260
there's the Chinese slots, there's a Native American slots, there's the

454
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,060
African slots. And it's always great when you are sitting right next to somebody

455
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:36,260
who is of that ethnicity while you're at that slot. Exactly. So here's my pitch,

456
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:41,260
is a slot that matches them all up. So one of the symbols is, you know, it's

457
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,460
It's the slots are, the reels have the different slot machines on them.

458
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,900
Oh, okay.

459
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:52,740
So you see, you see like you get like five oriental mysteries in a row or whatever, you

460
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,740
know?

461
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,740
That's a pretty good idea.

462
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,900
I think that's a good idea for a slot.

463
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,540
I would say it would be tricky.

464
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,060
I don't think there are enough meta slots.

465
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:04,060
It would also be tricky because the way that slots work is that there's different symbols

466
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,740
that are ranked best to worst.

467
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,740
Right.

468
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,740
So that would be a pretty tricky thing.

469
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
Yeah.

470
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,060
- So you end up with like, you know,

471
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:13,140
like one of them scoring like the least

472
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,380
and it's like, well why does that one score the least?

473
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,340
- Okay, here's, okay.

474
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,680
- Well, because.

475
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,140
(laughing)

476
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,620
- Yeah, that would not be a good conversation after that.

477
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,860
- Okay, here's my solution.

478
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,260
- Okay.

479
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,540
- It's, and get ready, this is gonna blow your mind, okay?

480
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:31,180
You win the more different symbols you get.

481
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,620
- Wow.

482
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,000
- If you get a line with one of each,

483
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,580
that's the biggest win you can get.

484
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,700
- That's beautiful. - That's a jackpot.

485
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,340
There might be a line for this slot.

486
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,500
Yeah, this is a slot that will make a lot of people happy.

487
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,820
This might be the new Wheel of Fortune cash link.

488
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,100
It might be.

489
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,220
The RTP on this is gonna be amazing.

490
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,540
I have a slot concept.

491
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,380
Yeah, let's hear it.

492
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,220
My thing in your slot.

493
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,060
Come on, dude.

494
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,180
That's just nasty.

495
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,380
Ooh!

496
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,260
I won't pay out.

497
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,780
I had a slot concept that was basically just like,

498
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,820
if you won, the slot just turned into a TV for 30 minutes

499
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,620
and you got to like earn TV.

500
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:14,580
TV time. Yeah. You get to watch a scene from a movie or the TV show that the slot is based on.

501
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,380
And then if you guess what scene the movie's from, then you get money.

502
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,880
How about...

503
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,180
The slot itself is like the Gilligan Island slot.

504
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,480
I had another idea which is that you put in money and then it's like a food themed slot.

505
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,780
And if you get a full line of a kind of food, it pops out.

506
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,380
You get that food.

507
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:29,680
Yeah.

508
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,980
Here's a slot idea for you.

509
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,480
That is a really good idea.

510
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,680
Here's my idea.

511
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,280
it's the slot is a massage chair and you win to turn on different parts of the

512
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,040
massage chair and there can be an adult version

513
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,000
that's a sibyan

514
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,680
that's a really there should be a slot in women's stomachs

515
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,040
that you can play

516
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,040
when you're looking at them. And with your babies in it?

517
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,000
yeah yeah right and you can gamble to see if it's a boy or a girl

518
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,360
yeah yeah or to make them a boy or a girl. Oh no jackpot I just won five thousand babies

519
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,600
I have to take care of these now. This sucks. This is the only slot you don't want a jackpot on

520
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,400
It's true. Which I mean, most slots I don't want a jackpot on. I just want the free drink.

521
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,900
That is a diabolical thing that they have, which is that you...

522
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,900
If you play for five bucks... If you just keep moving machines, if you just keep moving around...

523
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,100
You can get a free drink every ten minutes. Exactly. They don't even... They don't know.

524
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
They don't know that they're over-serving you.

525
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,400
You can just go to a bunch of different machines... It's true.

526
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,100
And just keep getting vodka cranberry. And you know what? Your P-Stream the next day,

527
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,900
That thing's gonna be one, you're gonna have no chance of a UTI.

528
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,700
That's true.

529
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,200
Yep.

530
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,100
Impossible.

531
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,300
So, you're honestly, you're getting healthier.

532
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,600
Yeah, so I mean, so do whatever you want to your thing,

533
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
because you are not getting a UTI.

534
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,500
You can do it.

535
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,200
You can stick it in the dirt outside.

536
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,600
Yeah, you can blow dust into it with a straw, you're fine.

537
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:55,400
Yeah, you can take your pants off, walk into a Home Depot where they're cutting plywood,

538
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,500
just stand right next to the saw, let all the shit get in your wiener hole,

539
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,200
and you're fine.

540
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
- You're drinking vodka cranberries

541
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,400
or just cranberry juice in general?

542
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,440
- You can start hiding your boogers in there.

543
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,400
It's gonna be all right.

544
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,240
- And you know what?

545
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,320
This also goes back to dupe.

546
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,960
You're gonna have the clearest pee stream ever.

547
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,760
You're gonna, it's gonna be hard.

548
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,600
- Okay, I have an invention.

549
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,600
This isn't a slot. - This isn't a urethra egg out.

550
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,640
- I would like to pitch this idea to Brita,

551
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,200
the Brita filter company.

552
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,960
It's a tiny little Brita filter that you put in your wiener

553
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,640
and it purifies your pee as it comes out.

554
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,120
- Okay, so it's basically like a tiny brick of charcoal.

555
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,600
- Yeah. - I don't think charcoal,

556
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,080
not my, charcoal ain't gonna fix much.

557
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,120
- Well that's why we need the Brita Filter Company's help.

558
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:35,960
I don't know what company--

559
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,760
- I mean they have the science.

560
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,240
- I mean I know they got scientists.

561
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,280
- And you know they got science.

562
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,520
- They used to have Zach Braff do the voiceover

563
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,680
in their commercials.

564
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,400
So you know, and he's a doctor.

565
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,240
- True.

566
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,280
- I will say one last thing about Atlantic City.

567
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,200
It turned me into,

568
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,420
just the, it made me feel like a rich person

569
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,740
the entire time I was here.

570
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,900
And I started putting my boogers wherever I wanted to.

571
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,740
- Really?

572
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,220
- You could probably clone me.

573
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,060
- The back of the waitress's head?

574
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,140
- How much D&D I put, DNA.

575
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,620
(laughing)

576
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,460
- DNA?

577
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,540
- I put all over the Harrah's Casino.

578
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:12,260
- Did you put it on the lady that walked up to you?

579
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,540
- I put one on a slot 'cause I thought it looked funny.

580
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,380
I put one just on the screen.

581
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:17,140
- That was so fucking funny.

582
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,700
- I was treating every slot like a baby's eye pad, dude.

583
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,500
I was just fucking sneezing on 'em.

584
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,020
I thought it maybe would help my chances.

585
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,400
If you disrespect the slot.

586
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,240
- Yeah, absolutely.

587
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,840
- That is, dude, that is my biggest,

588
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,600
if you, if you tell, if you, you,

589
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,720
what you gotta do is when,

590
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,040
while the slot is spinning, before it stops,

591
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,080
you say, "You're a fucking disgusting piece of shit.

592
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,580
"Squirt out some money for me right now.

593
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,420
"Squirt, squirt, squirt." - Oh yeah, you gotta

594
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,320
make the squirt. - Oh, dude,

595
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,520
it's all about making 'em squirt.

596
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,560
- Yeah, the machine's gotta squirt for you.

597
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,720
- I mean, every time I said,

598
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,600
I think I went a little too hard.

599
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:47,080
I was sitting down saying, "You're a stupid slot.

600
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,540
"You're a fucking whore.

601
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,340
"You're a dumb bitch." - You were saying,

602
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,000
"Squirt for me, monkey."

603
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
You were saying that a lot.

604
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,880
I was saying, "Squirt for me, you little monkey," a lot to these different slots.

605
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,820
And they did not, at some point, it's like, it wasn't fun and sexy anymore to them.

606
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,120
They found it actually disrespectful.

607
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
Yeah.

608
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,680
You know, that I was saying, "Squirt for me, you little putrid monkey.

609
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,800
I'm going to kill you, you little monkey.

610
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,920
You're my little monkey and you're going to make me squirt."

611
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,920
Yep, "Give me the monkey."

612
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,920
"Give me the monkey bread, you stupid."

613
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,920
"Show me monkeys."

614
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,920
Yeah, "Show me monkeys."

615
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,920
"Show me monkeys."

616
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,920
"Please, five monkeys in a row."

617
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,000
"Five monkeys in a row.

618
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Monkey bonus.

619
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,840
- Back pot.

620
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,660
- Yeah.

621
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,340
Yeah, that, yeah I probably drank a little too much.

622
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,180
- Yeah.

623
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,020
- Over there.

624
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,880
- Yeah, oh my god, we were at that club thing.

625
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,440
That lady came up to us, I thought we were getting

626
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,600
in trouble and then she just wanted to dance with Caleb

627
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,740
'cause he was like, you were just fucking--

628
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,640
- I was dressed like Pitbull and I got great hips, bro.

629
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,480
I don't know what the fuck to tell you.

630
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,680
- Oh man, you were going off.

631
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,760
- I can make my shit move.

632
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,680
- Yeah.

633
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,320
That club was so funny.

634
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,640
- I'm playing Rockabye Baby with my hips at the club.

635
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:50,000
- Dude, I had like, I had an out of body experience there.

636
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,960
I was like dubstep is awesome.

637
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,720
- Yeah, I had an out of body experience too.

638
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,600
My body teleported to the stage and started playing music.

639
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,440
- Yeah, oh yeah, they played Lose Yourself.

640
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,800
You lost yourself.

641
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,320
- I did, I unbuttoned my shirt all the way.

642
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,280
- Yeah.

643
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,480
- Lucky ladies and the crowd that night.

644
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,160
- That freaking club gave me an out of wallet experience.

645
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,000
- Oh yeah. - I mean, come on.

646
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,240
- Oh my God.

647
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,060
- Yeah.

648
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:09,900
- It was in the pool.

649
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,440
- Gave me an out of money experience.

650
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,520
(laughing)

651
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,960
- Damn, I wish we could've swam in there.

652
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,480
That's the thing, we gotta go swimming soon.

653
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,160
- I would love to go swimming, dude.

654
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,140
We need to do that thing. I don't own a bathing suit. I have to go buy one.

655
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,960
What are you wearing one right now?

656
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,160
Look at that. This is a bathing suit to you? You can put that...

657
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,760
Any shorts are a bathing suit.

658
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,260
You got a pedigo in your baggies.

659
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,660
If you're a man... That's a bathing suit. That's an all-terrain vehicle.

660
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:33,660
Any shorts are a bathing suit.

661
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:34,760
Yep. No. Yeah.

662
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Absolutely. Yeah.

663
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,060
I just bought new swim trunks too.

664
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,960
I bought... They got a frog on them.

665
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,360
You bought a frog on them?

666
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,860
There's a frog on them.

667
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,960
Is it like a little kid's bathing suit?

668
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,960
No. Why does it have a frog on it? It's an adult bathing suit with a frog on it.

669
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,440
Really? Yeah. A rain forest frog?

670
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,160
No, it's a little green frog.

671
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,960
A green frog comes from the rain forest. Everybody knows that.

672
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,560
Well, you don't. It's a cartoon frog.

673
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,060
Why would they put that on a baby? Put a shark?

674
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,560
Put a fish. Put a whale or a fish.

675
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,860
It's got a frog on it.

676
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,160
Well, don't have that on there.

677
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:06,160
Why? I'm not going to put it. I would never put it.

678
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,460
A frog doesn't swim.

679
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,960
Yeah, I'm not going to put a handle on my frog.

680
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,360
Frog doesn't swim. It jumps from the lily pad to the lily pad.

681
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,360
It like specifically can't fall into the water or it resets the level.

682
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,560
It has to hit the lily pad.

683
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,660
I don't even know what you're talking about.

684
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
You don't even know what you're talking about.

685
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,660
You don't know.

686
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,660
It says that they're in Memphis right now.

687
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,660
Oh wait, we have a good one today.

688
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:28,660
I'm taking it. Your frog shorts are in Memphis?

689
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
Those look like shit.

690
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
What are you talking about? Those don't look like shit.

691
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
They got a little green frog on it.

692
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
You paid that much for a swimsuit?

693
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
Let me see it. You are stupid.

694
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,660
Oh my god.

695
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,660
You're worried about Atlantic City and you're spending 60 bucks on a swimsuit?

696
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,660
Yeah.

697
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
Oh my god, dude.

698
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,660
dollars for a swimsuit and I never will.

699
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,660
That's true.

700
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
It's got a frog on it.

701
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,660
Fuck off.

702
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,220
So the transition here, I've been really into the Dog Man recently.

703
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,080
There's a lot of people on a lot of different forums and on Facebook who are really fascinated

704
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,200
by the Dog Man, which is a cryptid from I believe Michigan, which is if you can't guess

705
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,380
it's a dog and a man combined.

706
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,380
A lot of people...

707
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Is it half and half like a...

708
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,500
It's like a big dog that stands up like a guy.

709
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
It's like a werewolf basically.

710
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Okay.

711
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,040
There's a lot of crossover between people who believe that Dog Man is real and

712
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,140
people who believe that werewolves are real and the government is covering them

713
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,900
up.

714
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,580
And so I was looking for some werewolf stuff and I found this website called

715
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,660
ILoveWerewolves.com which it wouldn't let me send these links to myself over

716
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:36,420
Twitter to look at them because it thought that it was a spam website which

717
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,460
is how you know this is going to be a really good list I think.

718
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,620
Well it's not a list.

719
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:43,260
I got a few pages here for a story.

720
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,560
This is a list but I have a few different pages that aren't lists and the comments on here

721
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,060
are really great from this werewolf community.

722
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,120
It's called I Love Werewolves.

723
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:57,060
If I believed in werewolves, I'm not sure that I would love them so much.

724
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:03,380
This is a website that is mainly frequented by people who are werewolves.

725
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,380
And this website was, you can see in the logo, this website was founded by Werewolf967 and

726
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,380
Buddy.

727
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:15,420
buddy's I'm guessing buddy's a either an alter ego or a dog I think it's got to be

728
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,380
a sidekick yeah and before we get into this I just noticed that there's a

729
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,820
there's a head on the sidebar on for an article on this website called Johnny

730
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:26,260
Depp says the chupacabra attacked him I would like to get some more details yeah

731
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:33,020
yeah let's open that up really quick let's see here let this load a chupacabra

732
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,220
attacked Johnny Depp I believe it Johnny Depp was expected at a Japanese

733
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
press conference.

734
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,220
He put copper's name Amber Heard.

735
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,860
Earlier in the week.

736
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,660
However to the disappointment of everyone he missed it.

737
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,180
He had been recovering from being sick.

738
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,700
However that's not why he told report.

739
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,980
Oh he lied.

740
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
What a fucking piece of shit.

741
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,220
So this is just yeah Johnny Depp's a piece of shit liar.

742
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,580
There's so many good articles on this website I can't stop clicking them.

743
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,400
This is an article just called Abominable Snowman and it's just about the Abominable

744
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
Snowman.

745
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Look at this.

746
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,940
I don't fuck with the Abominable Snowman.

747
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,940
You would fuck it.

748
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,940
I don't fuck with much Abominable.

749
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:13,000
Anyway, our first article we're looking at on ilovewerewolves.com is "10 Insults to Never

750
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,500
Call a Werewolf".

751
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Okay.

752
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:23,300
I mean, like, what situation would I be in where I...

753
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,300
Number two, werewolf.

754
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:29,820
Yeah, I mean, like, I don't know what situation I'd be in where I would be, like, trying to

755
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,060
talk to a werewolf in the first place, really.

756
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Well, here we go.

757
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,740
What if it's like you don't know that it's a werewolf?

758
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:39,740
Well, it's like fine, like I got time before the full moon usually.

759
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,500
Yeah, it's like when you make a Polish joke in front of a Polish guy and then he tells

760
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,460
you "Hey, you know I'm actually Polish."

761
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
Yeah and then you say "Yeah, I do know you're a werewolf too."

762
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:51,500
It's hard to not know you're Polish when you look like that.

763
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,500
Yeah.

764
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,540
So the very last thing you should ever want to do is insult a werewolf.

765
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,740
Werewolves are stronger, faster, and smarter than any human.

766
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:00,240
In a battle, a werewolf would win every time over a human.

767
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,100
So the smartest thing any human can do?

768
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,180
Stay away from the insults.

769
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,620
Now chances are the werewolf will simply ignore you.

770
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,100
an insult from a mere human is not worth the werewolf's energy or time. Every now and then,

771
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,300
however, you'll catch a werewolf in a mood where he or she just isn't in the mood to put

772
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,180
up with you. With that in mind, you'd be well advised to stay away from the following monikers,

773
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,740
which are considered insults to every werewolf." So it just has all ten in a row right here.

774
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:23,140
I'll read them out here.

775
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,940
Puppy is the first one.

776
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,900
Yeah, that's like calling someone baby. That's fucked.

777
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,900
Yeah, you can't do that.

778
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,020
Unless it's your beautiful wife.

779
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:37,740
breath. That one I think is okay. If somebody said guy breath to me, I'd be like, okay.

780
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,000
Yeah. What else is my breath going to smell like?

781
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Yeah. Hairball.

782
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,060
That one, nasty.

783
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,260
That's just, that's not right.

784
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,100
That pops up when you clean, when a cat cleans itself.

785
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,300
Fur face. That one.

786
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,700
That's kind of fucked up.

787
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,700
That is.

788
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:52,700
Yeah.

789
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,700
Yeah.

790
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,700
Fleabag.

791
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,700
Oh no.

792
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
Mongrel.

793
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
That one's charged.

794
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,100
That'd be mad. I'd be mad if someone called me that.

795
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:05,120
yeah i'm i'm not any amount don't know

796
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,320
it's that one also feels wrong

797
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,340

00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:23,100

00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,420
- That's dog names.

846
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,260
- Kibbles is like calling you.

00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:39,260
werewolf a dog you're a dog I think it's offensive to call anyone a dog yeah I

852
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:42,220
don't think it just applies to werewolves I guess these also apply to

853
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,060

857
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,140
a comment from Sarah my friends at slash boyfriend hates when I say good puppy or

858
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,580
good doggy I know my boyfriend hates most of those words my boyfriend has

859
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,660
sharp teeth green eyes that sometimes turn to blue or gold type of color he

860
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,940
He has hair all over his body.

861
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,900
He doesn't like sleeping at night and he stays up.

862
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:18,020
His eyebrows join together and he has hair all over his hands.

863
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,000
He gets mad really easy and he only likes meat.

864
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,400
He is also really fast and can run for a long time and he can hear really good and can see

865
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,400
good as well.

866
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,220
How many times have I have tried to walk up to him without him knowing and failed?

867
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,780
But that doesn't mean he is a werewolf.

868
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,420
My boyfriend's brother thinks he is a werewolf and a vampire and my boyfriend's dad is like

869
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
that as well.

870
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:37,020
My boyfriend and his dad has everything that all of you talked about, but they don't go

871
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:39,180
around saying they're werewolves because werewolves are not real.

872
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,060
only in books and movies and the same goes with vampires but I don't know about

873
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:46,500
witches because my Nana believes in witches lol just saying it's good good

874
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,860
thing she said it was she was just saying otherwise I would have she

875
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:54,060
clarified that her boyfriend is not a werewolf at the end yeah yeah I could I

876
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,300
was everything was leading up to it yeah my boy wears wears purple robes has a

877
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:04,060
tall pointy hat uses a wand has a big white beard but he is not a Merlin he is

878
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:10,420
nothing like a Merlin yeah I disagree that a werewolf would win every battle as

879
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:13,140
battles don't always depend on strength and size sometimes it is technique and

880
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,540
intelligence that determines a fight I mean take Derek Hale for instance for

881
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,660
Watchers of Teen Wolf that said I love your articles and they really get me

882
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:22,740
into the mood for writing my werewolf novels this article I think rings true

883
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,420
werewolves are double beings they're human and wolf would you want to be

884
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:29,180
reminded of your lineage and hate speak I think we call it being racist smiley

885
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:38,420
face wouldn't it be specious true species I just have I would kill a werewolf yeah

886
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:42,460
yeah I mean yeah you're always carrying that silver bullet with you just a case

887
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:47,180
or I would drive it in with my own hand I don't even have a gun do you guys have

888
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,100
any tips for a recently turned werewolf aside for telling me dating a werewolf

889
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,180
was a bad idea my boyfriend accidentally bit me a couple weeks ago and I've been

890
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:56,300

897
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,660
- That's right.

898
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,780
- No, don't track mud in the house.

899
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,620
- Yeah, that's disrespectful.

900
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,820
- You're a werewolf, yeah.

901
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:15,660
- That's not right.

902
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,480
- Mm-hmm.

903
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,020
- You go outside, you play in the mud as a werewolf,

904
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,660
you come back in as a human.

905
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,380
- How you gonna let your boyfriend bite you?

906
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,220
- True.

907
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,060
- Mm-hmm.

908
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,880
- Yeah.

909
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
boyfriend no more.

910
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Absolutely.

911
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,080
I'm not dating no bitch I gotta wear chain mail around dude.

912
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,480
I'm not doing that.

913
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,800
You wouldn't wanna wear chain mail?

914
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:37,000
I would take any excuse I could get to wear chain mail.

915
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,780
Yeah I know.

916
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,120
But what if they smell out all my shit?

917
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,120
What do you mean?

918
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:46,680
All the shit that I have, what do they smell at?

919
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
All my shit that I have.

920
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680
You think they're gonna sniff out your shit?

921
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:49,680
They might smell you.

922
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,400
I got different kind of shit in my house that I don't want no bitch smelling.

923
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,400
What do you mean?

924
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
I've got different kind of shit in my house.

925
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,000
I don't want no bitch walking around smelling and shit.

926
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,960
Dude, what if, I would hate dating a werewolf because what if they got the zoomies and I

927
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:07,120
was trying to go to sleep and there's running back and forth everywhere.

928
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
Running on top of the bed.

929
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Yeah.

930
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
Yeah.

931
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,680
Running on top of the headboard.

932
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,080
Plus my backup plan has always been mailman.

933
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,560
It's a really good pension.

934
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,040
Like, that ain't going to work.

935
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,640
I mean, a mailman wearing chain mail.

936
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
True.

937
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,640
That'd be pretty sick.

938
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:28,400
would be really cool actually yeah but you're sending you to the chain mailman

939
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,360
yeah plus a like it's a mailman but he only wears chain mail and then he

940
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,960
delivers you like letters from no return address that say yeah send this letter

941
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:42,080
to the other clown statue will come to life and slaughter you. No disrespect to

942
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,200
extremely hairy women that are covered in hair all over their body head to toe

943
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:52,120
but I don't want to date that. That's your problem. Hair all over their

944
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,000
face yeah hair all over their entire body

945
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
YP that's it that's not those teeth are too big and you know they got teeth in

946
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,480
there it's true and you know they bite mm-hmm they probably didn't give him no

947
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,360
sharp teeth for nothing true the most shame for soup it's for human flesh you

948
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,760
think you get more how many teeth does it a wolf have all right I don't want to

949
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:17,160
fuck an animal yeah but if you had to fuck an animal or not an animal if you

950
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,500
- If you had to fuck a human-animal hybrid,

951
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,660
what animal would you most want to be a half?

952
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,400
- Probably a human and a human.

953
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,600
- No, no, what animal?

954
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,860
- That's right, I know the loophole.

955
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,520
- Probably like a Irish-Italian.

956
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,180
(laughing)

957
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,920
- I think like a--

958
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,160
- Yeah, maybe like a Russian-Hungarian.

959
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,960
- I think like a shark.

960
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,800
- A shark?

961
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,640
- Or, yeah.

962
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,460
- A shark?

963
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,300
I don't know, dude.

964
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,040
- Something with smooth skin.

965
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,880
- Yeah.

966
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,280
do not have smooth skin. A whale? They have very rough skin. Like a dolphin? Dolphin!

967
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,800
Oh that's... I just felt something. A dolphin woman? Well dolphins are like the horniest animals.

968
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,080
Oh my god dude my bitch half dolphin? Yeah but that's the... you gotta keep her in the tub.

969
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,080
My bitch a dolphin she be fucking like a bunny.

970
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:11,200
Okay. Okay. But she got a bald butt if she's a dolphin.

971
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,400
It's like the opposite of a wolf girl.

972
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,040
Ba ba.

973
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,520
She got a bald butt.

974
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,880
She got a bald butt.

975
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,680
Ba ba.

976
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,800

Talking about like dogs and pets and stuff.

982
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,160
This is a pivot from this website.

983
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,400
Okay.

984
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:34,720

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:35,600
Hold on.

987
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,560
Probably like a...

988
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,640

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:27,160
directly on top of an ant hill the biggest and it said they actually said

1007
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,080
that the park ranger came up to me and said it was the biggest ant hill in

1008
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,520
Central Park history. He says that it's like someone almost moved it there from a

00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,040
different location. It's like it was being collected for months just ants just

about a very scary hybrid. Oh my God. This is a hybrid called the

1015
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,160
vampire demon. The vampire demon sometimes referred to as vamp

1016
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,120
demon is a half vampire half demon hybrid. This type of

1017
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,080
creature is generally considered extremely evil and dangerous.

1018
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,120
Pure demons are of non human sometimes referred to as coke.

1019
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,520
This is straight up. This is this is a human and animal

1020
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:24,440
hybrid. Listen to this. Your demons are of non human origin

1021
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,520
and some say are actually angels that have fallen out of grace

1022
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,520
and now serve the devil vampires. On the other hand,

1023
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,600
were once human creatures. When you meet a vamp demon, you are therefore meeting something

1024
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,200
that is not close to being human and has little empathy for humans or living creatures, the

1025
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,220
influence of the demon side, as well as little empathy for vampires themselves. This is what

1026
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:44,120
makes them so dangerous. In addition, the vampire demons has powers that go beyond those

1027
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,040
of the vampire. Combine that with sunlight not being much of an issue for them and their

1028
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,880
ability to live longer without blood and you have a nearly unstoppable creature. They are

1029
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,720
extremely rare. Human portrayals of this creature are that of an extremely evil being, but there

1030
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,280
is some thought that they can mask themselves as humans pretty easily and

1031
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,240
don't necessarily all look like the image picture below and the image doesn't work

1032
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,600
oh fuck can you search a vamp demon to see if anything comes up yeah the

1033
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:11,640
expression bad out of hell is a good reference to the vamp demon so it's like

1034
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:20,040
a meatloaf basically meatloaf does look like a oh my god whoa oh my god shit

1035
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:23,960
damn they're scary as hell this is really scary I would not want to run

1036
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:28,320
into these. Isn't like a like a vampire oh what's Buddy say here? That's that's

1037
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,800
the author. Yeah here we go. Here's the first comment. Whoa that is

1038
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:43,040
UGLY. Here's a comment here from Mineski Canna Plus and they say can you

1039
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,280
explain what on it is? Oh they're real and you don't want to cross paths with

1040
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:51,760
them either. In my family's history book I ran across one of my great great my

1041
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,120
great Gandad's journals. He wrote that some do look like part human and bat,

1042
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,840
but some do have human bodies and he drew a pic of it. It was a young girl with

1043
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,320
fangs, long nails and her hair. Wow, it was amazing to look at. But he said

1044
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,920
that they don't kill just for food, but they also just kill to see blood on them

1045
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:07,840
and the areas around them. And he said that they are even more dangerous than

1046
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,040
others that don't look human because they get irritated, SLE, love the sight

1047
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,480
of blood and laughed at pain, but they don't mind killing few living creatures

1048
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,280
either. Oh, and the one thing that he put in cap and underlined, they love

1049
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:21,800
pooblice places but they also go crazy if they're around humans too long.

1050
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
Whoa.

1051
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,720
I mean, a vampire is scary enough, but a vampire that gone crazy.

1052
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,720
Yeah.

1053
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,520
Gone crazy at the pooblice?

1054
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,520
That's horrifying.

1055
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,520
Damn.

1056
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:37,200
I am a vampiric demon and it's taken a- What?

1057
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,200
Werewolf name generator.

1058
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:39,200
I already opened that.

1059
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,200
Fuck you.

1060
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,200
What?

1061
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:42,200
I have that already up in a tab.

1062
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,200
Just trust his plan.

1063
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,200
What the fuck are you doing, dude?

1064
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,560
I was in the middle of reading a comment.

1065
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,560
Spoiling everything.

1066
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,360
I leave the page for no reason. I thought that I have that tab open. I didn't know you had it open

1067
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:56,840
Eat this you spoiled the fucking finisher. You need to punish yourself. We can edit the finale. No

1068
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,060
Everybody's gonna know what you do

1069
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,240
crap, I

1070
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,860
Am a vampiric demon and it's taken a long time for my to see a reference to me

1071
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:11,000
And yes, we are very rare and I'm thankful that Lycons have kept a record of my existence and that is more than I had expected

1072
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,660
Oh that image is aquarium a dead harpy that is puppeteered much like a necromancer's golem

1073
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,900
(laughing)

1074
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,380
Yeah, I mean, this is, there's,

1075
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:22,560
anytime you combine two things that are already scary,

1076
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,020
it's gonna be twice as scary, right?

1077
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:25,300
- Yeah, mom and dad. - Absolutely.

1078
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,900
(laughing)

1079
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,140
- Mr. Mom. - Yeah.

1080
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,980
- Oh my. - That's the scariest thing

1081
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,600
you can get. - Jesus Christ.

1082
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,340
Yeah, Mr. Mom is scary.

1083
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,380
Ghost and-- - Don't even,

1084
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,500
don't even get me started on Mrs. Dad.

1085
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,580
- Ghost and chores? - Mm-hmm.

1086
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:41,620
- That's it. - Ugh.

1087
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,620
- It's Casper. - Yeah.

1088
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:44,900
Ghost dad?

1089
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:45,740
Ghost dad.

1090
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:46,580
Oh my God.

1091
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,400
That's the most Cosby thing.

1092
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,940
Scariest thing it could be.

1093
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,500
If you combine a ghost and dad,

1094
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,820
you get a creature twice as evil.

1095
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,180
Yeah.

1096
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:55,740
Okay, I'm gonna move here to,

1097
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:59,020
this one has a shit ton of comments.

1098
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:01,820
And this is, these are the comments

1099
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,100
where everyone is figuring out that they're werewolves here.

1100
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:04,940
Oh my God.

1101
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,220
I'm scared that I might realize something about myself.

1102
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,060
Am I a werewolf?

1103
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,500
This is a, you can, this is a werewolf quiz.

1104
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:13,480
It says it's a quiz, but, oh wait, no.

1105
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,840
Is it like a, is it like Scantron?

1106
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,940
'Cause I don't, I didn't have a pencil.

1107
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,760
- Let's see, is this an actual quiz here?

1108
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:21,600
- No.

1109
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,720
- Well, the quiz takes you to the test.

1110
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,560
- Okay, wait, let's try the test.

1111
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,280
- Click the test, yeah.

1112
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,160
- It doesn't work, doesn't do anything.

1113
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,120
All right, fine, we'll just read it.

1114
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,920
Many of you ask yourselves, are werewolves real?

1115
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,560
And if they are, how do I know if I'm a werewolf?

1116
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,560
Is there an easy way to tell?

1117
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,160
Unfortunately, there are no easy answer to these questions

1118
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:40,360
because no one has come forward

1119
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,440
and submitted themselves to scientific investigation.

1120
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,240
If I was a werewolf, I'd do that immediately.

1121
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,480
Anyway, but on to the better question.

1122
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,980
How do you know if you're a werewolf?

1123
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,200
Well, there is no real way to know.

1124
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,940
Some of our readers say that when you transform,

1125
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:53,260
you remember that you became a werewolf.

1126
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:55,020
Some say this is the best way to tell.

1127
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:55,860
The truth is though,

1128
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,560
while some may remember the transformation,

1129
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,120
for many werewolves,

1130
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,640
who once they have become human again,

1131
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:02,280
they do not remember being a werewolf at all.

1132
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,860
Some say that an aversion to silver

1133
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,480
indicates you may be a werewolf.

1134
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,440
The truth though is that silver's not really bother

1135
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,680
a werewolf in human form.

1136
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,800
Some say that the only real way to tell if you're a werewolf

1137
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,280
is to have someone watch you during a full moon

1138
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,960
see if you transform. The problem here is that some older werewolves can transform

1139
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,400
when they want to. The other problem here is that if you do transform and someone

1140
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,600
is watching you, you may never know the answer to the question "Am I a werewolf?"

1141
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:25,480
because your friend will not survive. Werewolves are not friendly after all.

1142
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,520
So basically there's no way to tell if you're a werewolf or not. That's what

1143
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:34,240
they're saying. That's fucking terrifying. Next full moon. When is it? Let's see. Oh,

1144
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,880
July 23rd was a full moon. That was my birthday. September 20th. Do you remember your

1145
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:45,960
birthday? Wait. Actually. Oh my god. Wait a minute. You were out and then nothing.

1146
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,740
I could have blacked out drinking though. It could have been...

1147
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,020
What is that? Listen, I know you. I know you wouldn't drink that much.

1148
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:58,100
That's true. But becoming a werewolf. I don't know. I mean what else happened that...

1149
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:03,460
I mean I'm drawing a blank. What does it say there? It says you

1150
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:09,940
need to it's it says you need to kiss your your friend to find out which one

1151
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:17,780
it says whichever whichever one is closest to you yeah it says you need to

1152
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:24,340
kiss him and if he likes it then you're okay and you're not a werewolf all right

1153
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:31,500
it's just gonna it didn't work didn't work on my end I don't know about you

1154
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,260
I'm not gonna tell you if I liked it or not. Really? Yeah. It says that you need to

1155
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:43,380
do it 5,000 more times. Okay. Well now I'm nervous because I don't remember one,

1156
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:47,820
the last full moon. Right. Or the full moon in Jewel. Also there was a full moon

1157
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:53,820
August 22nd and were we hanging out that night? What happened? I don't remember. I

1158
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:58,460
don't remember that either. Wait, I don't remember. There was a night a couple

1159
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:02,560
couple weeks ago where I was sitting under a palm tree and I was looking up at the

1160
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:10,340
moon and then it a coconut fell on my head and then I don't remember the rest

1161
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:15,980
of that night. Oh my god. Let's read some experiences here that people have had.

1162
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:19,620
I think some of these might line up with what you guys have have experienced in

1163
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:25,180
the past few weeks. Okay. The palms of my hand grow hair the size of toothpicks and

1164
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,080
And sometimes when I feel threatened, which is rare like my steak.

1165
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,080
Wait, hold on.

1166
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,480
On instinct, I attack.

1167
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:33,980
Look at the palms of-- there's-- oh my god.

1168
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:34,980
So much hair on--

1169
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:37,980
I've ripped flesh of bone and brought the strongest to their feet.

1170
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,980
I've done that.

1171
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,480
Wait, that sounds like something I would do.

1172
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,180
I've tasted blood and want more.

1173
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,380
No one has stoped me and no one will.

1174
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,180
This sounds a lot like us.

1175
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:48,780
Yeah.

1176
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:49,980
I've never been stoped.

1177
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:52,480
I am the alpha and deserve respect and fear.

1178
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,080
Oh, that's me for sure.

1179
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,580
Yeah, that's you to a T or someone else dies and it won't be me. This is Luna Wolf

1180
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:05,080
Remember the name because someday if you're just so unlucky, you'll find we'll one day find me boiling and hungry

1181
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,920
So sleep well and don't let the monster bite

1182
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,120
Why would you give I would say so sleep well and let please let the monster bite. I wanted by you

1183
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:19,880
I want to be I want to be the biter so bad and and sleep well and don't look under your bed right now

1184
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,360
There's nothing under there don't sleep well and keep your window wide open

1185
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:30,220
The way to stop a werewolf is keep your window wide open and keep a pie on the windowsill

1186
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:34,320
That's a good idea. Yeah, maybe a blood pie. Yeah

1187
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,400
Everything is bad. I'm nine

1188
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,000
I'm a werewolf my friend looks like a werewolf like wired

1189
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,280
But I still will not turn into a werewolf till I'm 14 or 17

1190
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:47,260
I still got life, but it's hard to control my anger and hunger. I want blood. I still control my sister

1191
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:49,780
I'm not sleepy at night in a full moon. I'm out of control

1192
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,480
Then I get tired when it's back to half moon and I'm sleepy

1193
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,000
I was scared of dogs then but no more my eyes get a little red when my tummy hurt it just the middle bit

1194
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,940
I'm not cold when I'm not Polly I for the spells are not real

1195
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,040
I said it but I knew it was not real but then I'm a werewolf

1196
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,760
Whoa, that is a scary kid. Yeah, that's a

1197
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:10,060
Haunted child. That's also it's also making me think maybe

1198
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:16,100
Yeah, maybe I am a werewolf. I think you might be a werewolf. I'm thinking I mean

1199
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,100
Let's think of the symptoms.

1200
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:18,600
Yeah.

1201
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,100
My sister.

1202
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,100
Your sister.

1203
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:22,100
My sister is hungry.

1204
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:23,100
Yeah.

1205
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,100
Yep.

1206
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,100
I'm covered in hair right now.

1207
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,100
But I mean...

1208
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,100
Every night you don't remember.

1209
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,100
Mm-hmm.

1210
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,100
Yeah.

1211
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,100
You have...

1212
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,100
I have a full moon on my birthday.

1213
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,100
Right.

1214
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:38,100
Scary.

1215
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,100
That's terrifying.

1216
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,100
That's very scary.

1217
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,100
It was the buck moon.

1218
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,100
No.

1219
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,100
Uh-huh.

1220
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,100
Not the buck moon.

1221
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,100
Yeah, and the next one is the harvest moon.

1222
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,900
- No. - The harvest, that's scary.

1223
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:48,900
- But what if you harvest blood?

1224
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,800
- That's true, what if I do harvest blood?

1225
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:53,300
I don't know, I have to keep this,

1226
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:54,380
hold on, what was the other moon?

1227
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:56,620
- Wait, here we go, we got a symptoms list.

1228
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:57,700
- Sturgeon. - The last one.

1229
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,620
- We got a symptoms list from William right here.

1230
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,900
- Oh, perfect, okay. - Okay, all right, good.

1231
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:02,780
- It's actually a symptoms list.

1232
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:05,280
- Oh, I don't know if I have any symptoms.

1233
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,860
- I used to be weak, nerdy, not that good with girls,

1234
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,820
and not cool.

1235
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,380
Now here's where the bullet points start.

1236
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,260
I became stronger, way stronger than I ever was before.

1237
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,060
I've tried lifting weights and I'm way stronger.

1238
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,500
Plus I have lifting weights gym class,

1239
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,980
but my friends don't suspect nothing.

1240
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:21,260
- Wait, I recently became stronger, I decided.

1241
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:22,740
- All of my senses became better.

1242
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,520
I can smell things from far away and I can hear things too.

1243
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,620
My fangs are sharper.

1244
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:28,460
Even when I talk, you can see my fangs.

1245
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:29,300
- Wait, hold on.

1246
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,440
(sniffing)

1247
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,060
I think there might be a car outside.

1248
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,420
You guys smell that?

1249
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,260
- I think...

1250
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,500
(sniffing)

1251
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:37,340
(snorting)

1252
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,020
- I think there might be car, maybe a lot of cars.

1253
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:41,840
- I think there's a mailman delivering mail.

1254
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:46,280
Oh my god, I think a wave just crashed on the beach.

1255
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,440
I think a dog just barked and I smelled the breath.

1256
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,440
Guys, I don't want to alarm you, but there's a crack in the surface of the moon.

1257
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,840
No, oh my god.

1258
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,960
Your neighbor's making pico de gallo.

1259
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
With chips.

1260
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:03,920
They're making, they bought the chips though.

1261
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:04,920
On a plate.

1262
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,320
Yeah, the plate is glass.

1263
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,720
And a nacho cheese sauce.

1264
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:11,240
And they're not wearing shoes.

1265
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,640
they're inviting us over to help them eat it all. My nails grow faster and they are

1266
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:20,420
stronger. My reflexes are a whole lot better than before. I accidentally used my

1267
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:24,620
reflexes during class. People just stared at me. Oh man, I used my reflexes during

1268
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:30,560
class. I used my reflexes. I blew my cover. I've grown muscley. I'm like 100% more

1269
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:34,180
confident than before. I am NOT shy anymore. I am good with girls. I can talk

1270
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,820
to them way smoother. Girls are attracted to me. Even my friends have told me the

1271
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:42,220
way girls look at me. I get angry very quickly, short temper. I didn't used to be like this,

1272
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,140
but I can handle my anger and I calm myself down. I am faster when I run, tried running

1273
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:50,100
while I walk my dog, my dog couldn't even keep up with me. I like the dark, I didn't

1274
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:53,620
used to be like this. For some reason my room is more colder than the others. I've heard

1275
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,820
that this only happens when there is something evil or otherworldly in the room, meaning

1276
00:53:56,820 --> 00:54:01,380
me. Now when I dream, I can manipulate them. I don't sleep a lot at night, I mostly sleep

1277
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,700
during the day. Every time during the full moon I feel different and I just can't stop

1278
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:09,020
staring at it like today. When I am angry, I am way stronger, more than before.

1279
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:13,820
Yeah, that sounds like me. It does sound, it sounds like me too. Yeah. I've become

1280
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:18,020
way stronger than I was before. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and I'm much smoother and more

1281
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:24,300
confident too. Yeah, when I'm talking. Oh yeah, I mean, I'm not smooth. I don't think I'm smooth at all, but I

1282
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:30,980
think maybe, uh, well, smoother than before. Come on, you're smooth. No, I'm not, you know.

1283
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,260
Here, give me a kiss.

1284
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,260
I'm way hairier, I mean.

1285
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,260
Oh.

1286
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:39,860
I was smooth, now I'm too hairy because of all this lycanthropy.

1287
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:42,140
That's so true.

1288
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,140
I hate lycanthropy.

1289
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,620
Oh my god, it's such a curse.

1290
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,020
What's uh, what else do we got here?

1291
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:50,460
Here's a comment, here's two comments in a row from Suzette.

1292
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,460
Okay, Suzette.

1293
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,380
I'm a werewolf, what about you guys?

1294
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,460
Also once I ate a whole pig.

1295
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,980
Yeah, I was in Hawaii, I ate a whole pig.

1296
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:03,500
Yeah, I was at the Dixie Stampede. I ate an entire pig. I'm pretty much a werewolf.

1297
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,620
Okay, I am a werewolf and I'm 11, but if you have a kill list, werewolf or not,

1298
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,060
you're messed up, even if you're a werewolf. And actually, it's only movie

1299
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,620
werewolves that are extremely psychopathic. I'm a werewolf and I'm a

1300
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:18,100
peaceful person. I would say I'm less scared of werewolves than I was going

1301
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:22,540
into this website because so many of them seem to be 9 or 11. Yeah, I think

1302
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:28,020
maybe this is like PBS Kids for werewolves. Maybe we got to look up,

1303
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:31,020
Can you look up this website for me?

1304
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,020
Werewolf.xxx.

1305
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,580
- Werewolf.xxx?

1306
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,420
- Uh-huh.

1307
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:39,880
- Nothing.

1308
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,220
- Werewolf.sexy.

1309
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:45,740
- Okay. - Nothing.

1310
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:48,000
- Look up sexywerewolf.com.

1311
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:52,140
- Dot com?

1312
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,700
- Yeah.

1313
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:55,820
- How about this?

1314
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,340
- No, I wanna see, go on a--

1315
00:55:57,340 --> 00:55:58,340
Oh my god.

1316
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:59,340
Whoa.

1317
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,340
Female werewolf art.

1318
00:56:00,340 --> 00:56:01,340
Female werewolf art.

1319
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:02,340
That's interesting.

1320
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,340
Oh my god.

1321
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,340
Yeah, can we pause recording for a minute?

1322
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:06,340
Sure.

1323
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:07,340
Okay.

1324
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,340
Okay, we're back.

1325
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:09,340
We're back.

1326
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:10,340
We're looking at sexy werewolves.

1327
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:13,340
I feel a lot more relaxed right now actually for no reason in particular.

1328
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:15,340
I feel like I got a huge release of something.

1329
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,900
Yeah, I also, I feel drier.

1330
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:20,740
I feel like my skin and all the moisture from my body is kind of like gone.

1331
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,900
Yeah, yeah.

1332
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,580
I feel like there's one part of my body that there's like a weird film on that I can't get

1333
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:31,660
off if I use hot water. Yeah, and it's, uh, it's, it smells like chlorine in here now.

1334
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,900
Yeah, it's really weird. Is there, did you get a pool installed? Yeah. Yeah, I think I

1335
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,260
might have got a pool installed by accident without realizing it. Yeah, that's why we

1336
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:44,940
had to take a break to let the pool guy in. Yeah. Yeah. And that's it. That's it. Let's

1337
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,540
see, let me see if there's any more werewolf comments on here. I think that we really might

1338
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:52,460
be werewolves altogether. Yeah. I'm starting to believe it. I know I'm a werewolf. I am

1339
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,100
I am always warm. I found out when I was, I was 56 degrees Celsius,

1340
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,220
which is possible for a human.

1341
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,580
And with my canines being huge and my balance is really good.

1342
00:57:00,580 --> 00:57:03,500
I've managed to read minds, predict the future and interact with my spirit,

1343
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,100
which is a Wilf. I have always admired wolves. And every time I'm near a dog,

1344
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,940
I have a connection woman. I'd like to fuck my spirit.

1345
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:12,340
My friend said her dig is shy and won't go to anyone.

1346
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,140
As soon as I stepped in the room, it came to me. I'd like to be an alpha,

1347
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,940
but I know I don't have the responsibility to, so I'm a lone wolf for now.

1348
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:20,580
Hope you guys find out if you're a wolf or not, but let me tell you,

1349
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,140
There are lots of us, but it's hard to tell who are these days.

1350
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,500
If you need more information, visit Experience Project.

1351
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,820
They will find you real werewolves.

1352
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,280
And to my knowledge, werewolves are friendly.

1353
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,780
It's just they're scared of being a lab rat.

1354
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,320
So that's why they come across as aggressive.

1355
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,160
That's all I have to say.

1356
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,620
Love you all.

1357
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,380
- Sorry for the spelling errors.

1358
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:37,420
My spell checker is awful.

1359
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:38,920
- Hi, I think I am a werewolf

1360
00:57:38,920 --> 00:57:40,540
because if I get really mad, I growled

1361
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,980
and have growled at my sister a lot.

1362
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:43,460
I mean, this is not a one-time thing

1363
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,300
and I have a lot of hair on my arms and legs and I love meat.

1364
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,140
I don't know about Ro-mean though.

1365
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,900
I like to stay up late and I love the movement

1366
00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:51,900
I'm really work and hot all the time.

1367
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,260
- Who's real mean?

1368
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:55,860
- Yo, I think Patrick might have left this comment

1369
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:58,140
during our break, "OMG me and my BFFs tried it

1370
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,180
and had all the side effects."

1371
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:00,020
- Did you just leave that?

1372
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:01,220
- I did just leave that comment.

1373
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:02,900
- Under the name Alexa?

1374
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,980
- Well I was saying, "Hey Alexa, can you comment on

1375
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,140
where was that comment?"

1376
00:58:08,140 --> 00:58:08,980
Yeah.

1377
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:11,340
- Yeah.

1378
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:14,500
- It's like when you try to say send to Siri

1379
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:17,220
and then it puts send it at the end of your message.

1380
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:18,500
- I don't use Siri, man.

1381
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,300
I've done that a few times.

1382
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,300
I still got my hands.

1383
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,740
Why would I need Siri?

1384
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:26,860
I'm like making dinner or something or making a sandwich.

1385
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,860
Dinner or a sandwich.

1386
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,420
Sandwich for lunch.

1387
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:32,980
So either dinner or a sandwich for lunch.

1388
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:33,980
And you gotta use Siri.

1389
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,980
Yeah.

1390
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,300
Because you got these ingredients in your hands.

1391
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:39,220
I mean, I don't want to put my ingredients down.

1392
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:40,260
Just put your ingredients down.

1393
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,260
Just put the ingredients down.

1394
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,260
No, you gotta take care of your...

1395
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:44,300
You're so addicted to me, you won't let it leave your claws.

1396
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,860
You gotta take care of your ingredients, dude.

1397
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,860
You are a werewolf, because you're greedy.

1398
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:49,860
Werewolves.

1399
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,860
What's the last comment I'm going to read?

1400
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,860
What's the last comment I'm going to read?

1401
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:53,460
That's a stereotype of werewolves.

1402
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:54,460
Now it is.

1403
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,460
Why?

1404
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:56,460
Because of you?

1405
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,460
No.

1406
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,460
Greedy ass werewolf.

1407
00:58:58,460 --> 00:58:59,460
You're going to make a generalization based on that.

1408
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,460
Wait, it says werewolves are terrible at gambling too.

1409
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:03,460
What does it say?

1410
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,460
It just said that, yeah.

1411
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,900
No, it says don't trust sites.

1412
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,620
None of us went on any sites you.

1413
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,620
No.

1414
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:10,620
And that's Zelda.

1415
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:11,740
Zelda Claus said that.

1416
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,260
Here's a comment from a real werewolf.

1417
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:17,360
"Hey, I'm a wolf and I love pasta more than chicken, but not deer. You cannot beat the

1418
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,280
sweet taste of deer, raw or cooked."

1419
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
Raw deer?

1420
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,280
You eat raw deer?

1421
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,280
I mean, if you're a werewolf, you gotta eat some raw deer.

1422
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,320
I guess you're right. You know what? I bet the best feeling ever is when you, like, when

1423
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,040
you're a werewolf, you eat raw meat and you get that blood mustache.

1424
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,840
Yeah, oh my God. I hate that shit.

1425
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:32,840
That's when you know you're satisfied.

1426
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,120
Yeah, you just leave it in there all day.

1427
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:36,120
Right?

1428
00:59:36,120 --> 00:59:37,120
Yeah.

1429
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,840
All right, now the part, the one that no one will expect. No one's gonna see this coming.

1430
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:41,840
Yeah.

1431
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:42,840
