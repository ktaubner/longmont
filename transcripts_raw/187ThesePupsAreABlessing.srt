1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
and

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,760
hitchcock did not do

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,080
scooper to the side i think he did not know that is a very common in this fall

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,720
moves a very common that he did i think i read a list of spending a bit around

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,680
you know around is what i have talked made no they will make it and then

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,320
drowned

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,680
you're thinking of uh... of the third suicide is pretty lynchian

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,680
No, Squidward suicide was Hideo Nakata. Oh, okay. It's a Japanese film. Oh,

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,320
yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense because it has themes of suicide.

10
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,480
That shit honestly still scares me. Yeah, I rewatched. I'm not gonna. I can't

11
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,160
it been drowned. I will never revisit that. It's too scary, bro. Do you like

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,280
remember they made they made multiple people made multiple animated versions

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,480
of like what the description of the episode is? Yes, I watched I sat in bed.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,680
and I had my girlfriend's laptop and I was watching every single one of them

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,040
and rating them to her. That sounds like something where you would come here. I

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,120
was watching them and like turning to her and going like that one wasn't as

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,840
good as the first one. What was the best one? Best one I saw was the one, I

18
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,480
think I took a picture of it. Please don't show it to me. Please do not show

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,440
me that. You're going to see it. Has Ben drowned the Legend of Zelda one? Yeah,

20
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,080
yeah, that's that one. He hacked the entire game. He did modifications. That

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,280
That one that one's so sick. That's impressive. There was a one. How is this

22
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,880
guy not? How is this guy not like a very famous?

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:36,560
Squidward suicide, lost episode 2005 by SpongeBob lost episodes. That's a good

24
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,080
one. Show me the picture. Whoa!

25
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,360
Oh, he's got poop in his eye.

26
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,520
Oh God, it actually looks like poop. You know what this close up camera is? This

27
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,720
is for Patrick to show his phone. Yeah, wow! That's genius. Yeah, my girlfriend's

28
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,720
mad because I ruined her YouTube algorithm. The girlfriends always get

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,840
they get mad when you fuck up their YouTube algorithm. I signed on to my

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,280
YouTube account on the TV. Now, this is all Jimmy High Roller NBA videos. Yeah,

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,320
she's pissed man. She's trying to watch house tours or some guy shows a town

32
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,680
remodeling. Yeah, all that shit. Fuck you. You know what's it called

33
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,920
Pretty Brothers.

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,920
It's called Rehe.

35
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Rehe.

36
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,920
Rehe.

37
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,920
Rehe.

38
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
Rehe.

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,920
That, you just blew up so bad.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:24,920
I know, holy shit.

41
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,520
My, today my heart hurts.

42
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Yeah?

43
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,520
Yeah.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,520
Because of what?

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,880
The air is doing bad things to everyone's lungs.

46
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
Not that.

47
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,880
I was fine with that.

48
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,880
I don't care.

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,720
I thought it was bad until I went outside and there was a bunch of Latino people playing

50
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
volleyball and I was like, "Oh yeah, it's not a big deal."

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,720
Everyone was outside all day.

52
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,720
Who gives a shit?

53
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,720
Yeah.

54
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,720
It's a nice out today.

55
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,680
more than I saw today. Is that video came out today. I don't recommend you watch

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,800
it of a man being eaten by a shark.

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
Where'd you see that? I saw it. How do you see all these videos? You're

58
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,080
searching them out. I don't search. You're like the biggest, you're the

59
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,360
biggest wimp when it comes to videos like that. Don't say wimp. And then... You

60
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,000
are a wimp. I am not. He's the biggest wimp when it comes to videos like that,

61
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
but then he's the one who sees every single one of them. I hate violence

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,740
because it's just so, it used to be so natural to me.

63
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,080
- Yeah, you have to watch those videos

64
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,080
when somebody sends you man eaten by shark.mpager

65
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,800
- It was just a daily dot or some shit.

66
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,840
- Daily dot is what they put in restaurant foods.

67
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,560
That is not a thing.

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,720
- What?

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,080
- That's what I, one time I got shrimp at the 99 restaurant

70
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,080
and they baked a daily dot into the bread.

71
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,760
what the fuck are you talking and the guy came over. I was like hey, I there's a

72
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,660
bunch of paper in my food. What the hell is this? And then the manager said, oh,

73
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,000
you found our daily dot that just means well. The good news is that means that

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,520
the shrimp is fresh and we cooked it today and I said I buddy, I don't want

75
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:07,280
paper. Give me my money back. They put paper in the food. They dropped a piece

76
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,240
paper into the breading of the shrimp. Oh, so it's like if somebody finds it,

77
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,020
they know that it's... It's like a quality... It's to get it away.

78
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,800
It's a quality thing. Also, it's probably on the bag. It's not like

79
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,400
paper goes bad, though. Paper goes bad.

80
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,320
No, it doesn't. I ate a bunch... Paper goes bad. Paper goes bad. It

81
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,560
yellows, yellows over time. I don't even think that's true. Yeah, it does.

82
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,760
Does paper go yellow over time? Yes, it does. I think paper just used

83
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,400
to be more yellow. Because of the pulp.

84
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,920
what know are you on about paper goes bad. It does not go over over a day

85
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,280
three month rule. Do not purchase more paper than you can use in three months

86
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,600
not a three monthly dot. The point is video. How long does paper expire? What

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,280
is the lifespan of photo paper three month rule? Wait what

88
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:57,200
five years five years yeah,

89
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,880
how does paper go back? Wait no way listen. What it says it says the first

90
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,760
lines of deterioration or loss of speed, huh? Oh,

91
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:12,580
that must be about photo paper yeah yeah on photography for yeah, no normal just

92
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,220
copy white paper does not go bad. Paper goes bad. Paper is yes. Paper does

93
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,940
expire. This again is photo. This is photo stuff. Okay, search does normal

94
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,260
paper go. There's no school that I was right there expired printer paper,

95
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:29,340
read it, our slash ebay zoom in wait. Somebody's trying to buy this shit on

96
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,740
day. I'm having a hard time finding any info about expired paper until recently.

97
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,260
I didn't even realize it had an expiration date. So does it really

98
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,620
expire? I have some that expired twenty years ago,

99
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:45,740
so, but I can't test it. This has got to be one of the comments here.

100
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,980
There's a gun. Oh, my God, the comments are deleted. Oh, my God, it's because

101
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:52,660
they're trying to suppress this information. Normal office paper will

102
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,220
absorb moisture from ambient humidity, unless it is sealed in an airtight

103
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,360
so paper can go bad if it is exposed to moisture, but that's only that you can't

104
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,300
print on it, because it might jam the printer from being wet, but just dry that

105
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,020
out, just dry that out, just dry that out, put that shit, a clothesline with

106
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,960
all paper. If you saw that, paper must go bad eventually. Paper, everything goes

107
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,540
bad, everything has an expiration date. Well, at the very least, it disintegrates.

108
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:22,260
Unless you freeze it. I mean, on a, yeah, that's why they have paper straws and

109
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,100
shit, but it doesn't go bad. It's not like you. It goes bad, but also a paper

110
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,520
straw even doesn't even they've recycled that. I mean, I think more if you leave a

111
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,820
slice of or a sheet of paper out, a slice of paper. I like that my fucking my weird

112
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,140
math teacher in sixth grade, the one who gave out deluxe hugs. I was wondering why

113
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,680
I remembered this. He would say, he would say, fresh slice of paper and then lick

114
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,220
his lips. He loved it. Fresh slice of paper. I said it by accident because I'm

115
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:51,160
addled. Speaking of paper, you guys saw what I sent you. The Dundee Mifflin was

116
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,180
under a scranton had the for some time the worst air quality in America,

117
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,880
scranton pennsylvania. Well, our heart goes out to jim and pam. I don't give a

118
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,180
fuck about jim and pam. Well, they I think they leave scranton for philly at

119
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:10,480
the end. So dwight and angela and andy, Angela's a whore. She's not a whore.

120
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,980
She's a christian. Oh wait, wait, bro. I forgot. Have you seen the fucking show?

121
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,980
She's a slut. What's out with andy bernard. She sluts out with everybody.

122
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,980
She sluts out with Dwight and then she's...

123
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,980
She marries Dwight.

124
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,980
She sluts out with the senator.

125
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,980
I never watched it.

126
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
The whole crew is hitting Angela.

127
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,980
Yeah.

128
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,980
And honestly she's mid.

129
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
She mid?

130
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,980
She's mid. I would rather have Kevin.

131
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,980
I would.

132
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
Close your eyes. Kevin.

Whoa.

And you have to eat that chili after.

136
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,980
Kevin doesn't have teeth?

137
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,980
I think he's missing his front teeth.

138
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
He's not missing his front teeth.

139
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:51,120
his lip is just big. No, he's missing his he is missing his front top lip. I

140
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,900
believe that I just I don't know. I'm going to look wait. Look up Kevin the

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,100
Look up with big big teeth without Kevin the office.

143
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,300
He's got some kind of just his lip. No, he has no front. He has no front teeth.

144
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,380
Are you crazy? His lip covers his teeth. Oh, whoa. Look at that. Well, I'm there,

145
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,980
but go down there was one where he's like me he's got tiny little chiclet teeth

00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:39,180
different he's gotten so much surgery since the show Kevin you can't be doing

150
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:42,700
that man you can't be dressed he's training for a bodybuilding competition

151
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:47,460
Oh yeah, that shit's so fun. The bronzer that they put on bodybuilders. I'm going

152
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,340
to join a bodybuilding competition. Yeah, yeah, I think I should join. I think I am

153
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:55,180
going to join. I found one that is a instead of doing a drug test, they do a

154
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,500
lie detector test. Oh really? Which is the funniest thing. Yeah, that you have

155
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,100
to go into and that you do a lie detector screening. That's so funny. And

156
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,620
they ask you, do you do drugs? Why not? Yeah, why not just do a drug test? What

157
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,220
other questions are they going to ask? It is really scary. I guess maybe it's

158
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:17,300
It's cheaper to it's a one-time purchase to buy a polygraph versus buying a bunch of drug

159
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,300
testing.

160
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,460
How would you, so many podcasts have done a polygraph.

161
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,980
I don't think we'll do it, but yeah, how would you beat it?

162
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,540
What's your strategy going into that?

163
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,460
Probably give myself a heart attack.

164
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,700
Yeah, just die.

165
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,820
Heart attack, sociopathy.

166
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:38,340
It is funny to imagine the bodybuilders like going in for that lie detector test and then

167
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:42,140
immediately just like they think that the lie detector is not passable at all.

168
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,860
So they just like are breaking down just like, yes, I smoked a little weed.

169
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,060
It's streaking the bronzer. Yeah. The bronzer is like going away.

170
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
It's like, actually, I don't think you do.

171
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:54,780
I smoked a cigarette before I came in here. I think you do only your face.

172
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,180
I think you do. You do your face.

173
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:58,820
What kind of you're going to face building competitions?

174
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,220
That would be cool. Just get the biggest, pointiest face possible.

175
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,220
Like doing the jaw training. I would beat a polygraph by having,

176
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,220
I did that because I have TMJ and it was affecting my sleepy.

177
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:13,980
I would be the polygraph. I would just use a prosthetic arm.

178
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,980
Yes.

179
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,980
Or whatever they connect it to.

180
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,380
Well, that's a hack, by the way.

181
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,860
Then they notice there's zombie flesh on it.

182
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,380
If anybody does bodybuilding competitions.

183
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,380
I would use zombie flesh.

184
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,380
Yeah.

185
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,740
Or I guess if anybody has an extra limb or is missing a limb or has an extra finger,

186
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,140
I think that that's -- you're almost a shoe-

187
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Polydactyl.

188
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,140
Like a low-level bodybuilding competition.

189
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,740
Well, that's why the first question they always ask on the polygraph is, "Do you have a sixth

190
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
finger?"

191
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:44,280
a girl in my German class in high school who had two thumbs on one hand. I knew a kid with

192
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:49,140
an extra polydactyl. I never saw it in person. I only ever saw it online. She had a big thumb

193
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:54,320
that was going out like this. Two extra fingers. Going like this and she would wear those,

194
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,460
like her sweatshirt over it. I would too. I think on a first date that might be a deal

195
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,540
breaker. Extra finger? Not if you're in the smoke circle and you're like, here I got roach

196
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,620
switch clips right there. Oh snap, fucking blowing up to people, helping people out.

197
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,780
Oh fucking snap, putting the fucking two thumbs could be a game changer. Yes, if

198
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:20,180
there's any two fingers, if there's any finger you want two of, it's a thumb and

199
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,740
here's what this person should do. They should be a movie critic. Uh huh. Yes,

200
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,420
three thumbs up. Yeah, yeah. Oh my God, I mean, we're down, then they can just do

201
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,940
this. You see some crappy fucking Michael Bay movie. Yeah. Oh, four thumbs down.

202
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,440
don't say that about Michael Bay. I'm just joking. I actually like his movies

203
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,680
quite a lot. Yeah. What's that movie he made about the Transformers?

204
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,120
What's that movie Michael Bay made with the, with the rock, the robots and the-,

205
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,440
well, it's funny you say with the rock because, you know, he made movies with

206
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,640
the rock in it. Yeah. And then he made a movie called The Rock. That's true, he

207
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,680
made it. So it's kind of that, you kind of did a funny little-,

208
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,720
what's the movie he made, Pain and Gain? Yeah. I want to see that. That's The Rock,

209
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:05,420
that is the rock. I've only seen Kevin Hart. No, it's Mark Wahlberg.

210
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:09,220
Mark Wahlberg, yeah, yeah. Speaking of Mark Wahlberg, I started watching

211
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,340
Entourage. Yeah. I've seen a lot of similarities to our lives. Really?

212
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,300
Yeah. Is that show real? Jubio is turtle. It's real. Yeah, Jubio is

213
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,060
completely turtle.

214
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,740
I'm Ari. Okay. You are...

215
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,140
Vincent Chase. Vince, yeah. You're Vince for sure. And he's Johnny Drama.

216
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,580
who Johnny drama, Johnny drama, drama, you don't know drama

217
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:38,120
I'm one episode on whose turtle this is yeah, that's the way it's the first

218
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,080
picture. That's him

219
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:43,000
the first picture of the yeah. He's a turtle where they put a bunch of

220
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,020
hamburger ingredients

221
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:49,620
do dubious sent me the most fucked up picture of a hamburger

222
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,480
last night. He was eating with the burger. Yeah, he sent me the most

223
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,300
picked up picture out of burger. He said he was on to go look at that. He sent me

224
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,060
that to what kind of

225
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,460
a plastic for show the show the GoPro in his house.

226
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:08,820
In what world is this a hamburger? I'm sorry. I came to America. I started

227
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,500
complaining about every single food saying this is not a tent to go enough,

228
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,300
but that is not a tent to go. That does not look like an American burger.

229
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,100
There's nothing like a burger. I'm sorry. I'm not even looking up whose turtle

230
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:28,300
so funny, not even who's a turtle from we need to pop so hugely that then we do a

231
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,460
an entourage style produce a movie about or a show about our what is

232
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,100
entourage

233
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,100
based on mark. It's a reality show. No, no, no, it's a it's like a script. I

234
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,860
mean, it's a it's like a show. It's a show. It's a show. Show. It's a drama

235
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,460
show about it's a it's it's it's hooking up with Sasha Gray. Pretty funny.

236
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,520
She's in that. I don't know. I've only seen the first episode.

237
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,400
That was her big acting role.

238
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,920
That was the one when she made the jump over and now she is a Twitch streamer.

239
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,440
What a fucking loser. Just, I mean, just stick, just like,

240
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,000
I don't get that shit.

241
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,520
Just you do porn for like four months and just make enough money that you never

242
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:12,720
have to do. You don't make any money doing that though.

243
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
You don't think so. You get paid in pleasure.

244
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,180
You get paid in pleasure. Trust me. They did not pay me enough.

245
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,780
You wouldn't do porn. I did and

246
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,080
you can't tell it's me because I'm in a suit. I couldn't do porn man.

247
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:31,780
My penis is too small. I could do it, but I don't want to. I'm inflated.

248
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,680
I'm inflated. I could see you pulling up in the porn movie.

249
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,080
No, yeah, but you'd be the dead there. To be honest, you'd be the wimp that

250
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,880
they kick out. It's a little cringe. You'd be the makeup artist. I would

251
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:50,980
the makeup artist they fuck. Yeah, that would be you. Yeah, as a part of it. Do

252
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:55,700
they have like PAs and shit? Yeah, it's a full industry. Yeah, it's a whole, this

253
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,700
world is a whole ass thing. The whole thing is pretty crazy. I mean, they used

254
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:06,340
to, if I'm going by Boogie Nights rules, they used to have a whole thing. That's

255
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,420
true. Porn has really fallen off since Boogie Nights time. They don't really do

256
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:13,260
porn anymore, do they? They don't do it the same way. It's downscaled a lot.

257
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:20,060
They're not shooting it on a 1x, 3x, 8x or whatever CinemaScope.

258
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:22,260
They're not shooting it on IMAX.

259
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,760
I wish I was looking at you through a scope right now.

260
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,760
WakandaScope. I hope it's binoculars.

261
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,760
You say WakandaScope?

262
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,760
WakandaScope.

263
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,760
I guess probably a WakandaScope, yeah.

264
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,760
Some kind of laser beam shooting directly at your head.

265
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,760
You wouldn't do that.

266
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,260
I would.

267
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,760
Do they have laser beams in Wakanda?

268
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
You gotta assume.

269
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Yeah.

270
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,260
Why would you assume they wouldn't?

271
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,000
because they mostly have little claws. What they are made out of I think

272
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,240
you're thinking of Black Panther.

273
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:56,720
Am I thinking of just one guy? They all have like his name is it what kind of

274
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,800
right? No, no, no, his name's not what kind of you racist,

275
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,200
then what was the movie about the movie is about the basically this it's like

276
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:10,160
isn't it? I don't know. It's like a town. Isn't it crazy? I got a job. Yeah,

277
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,560
they got a worm in an after the Black Panther, the second Black Panther movie

278
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,980
when Chadwick Boseman died and they're like we're going to do this movie in his

279
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:21,200
memory. This is dedicated to him and it's about Africa versus Mexico.

280
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,860
It was a cause very close to his heart.

281
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,280
Underwater

282
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,620
and try to destroy Africa.

283
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,700
Yeah, that is

284
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:39,040
yeah. If I was him, if I was trying to honor Chadwick Boseman, I would have

285
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,280
even his family, the budget for the movie, a hundred million dollars,

286
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:47,220
giving him that then fucking then make the most movies ever not made a fucking

287
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,320
sequel to Black Panther. I actually didn't even see it. I didn't see it

288
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,040
either. I just saw the trailer. I like the first one man. The first one was

289
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,240
cool. It's fun. I like when he jumps around. The ending was terrible.

290
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,800
Jumping the jumping is impressive. Yeah,

291
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:06,040
the jumping is a my God. I love that movie. The jumping and the stunts, the

292
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,780
stunts on the singing. Do they ever explain whether or not sharing all this

293
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:16,380
technology with the world? I think that gets solved in the end. Yeah, maybe I

294
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:18,620
don't know. I don't remember. They should have just put what kind of should

295
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,220
be a planet so that you don't have to answer that question. Yeah,

296
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,340
yeah, yeah, because there's I mean there's a lot of things. There's a lot

297
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,180
of things that take place at the early. I mean listen. I okay, I get it.

298
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:34,560
You don't want to share with us white people at least share it with the rest

299
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,100
of Africa. Yeah, exactly. Africa's in such bad sorts, bro, and you're

300
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,900
at least spreading it around the continent a little bit.

301
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,380
I'm not even saying I need to have all that shit. I don't need a flying thing.

302
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,380
Well, does any of that shit exist in that world? Does any of it exist in real

303
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,940
life? Does any of that shit exist in that world, like apartheid or the

304
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:57,620
Holocaust or anything that they could have stopped with their vibrate back

305
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,260
steely superhero? Well, yeah, because Magneto's a Holocaust survivor. Well,

306
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:03,820
I guess he's not part of it yet, is he? Did superheroes in some multiverse...

307
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,260
Is Marvel and DC and shit, where superheroes, have they always been around or was it just

308
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,980
like I think they've always been around?

309
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,500
I think it's in the 40s and onward.

310
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:18,140
I think that it just depends on, I think that there's no like overarching canon to any of

311
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
that stuff.

312
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
Because when does Superman come into play?

313
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,740
When is he his first kind of thing?

314
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:24,140
Well he's a little kid for a long time.

315
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
In the 40s, yeah.

316
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:26,140
So he should be the one.

317
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,020
That's the funny, they all started in the 40s because it's when they came up with all

318
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,020
the ideas.

319
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,020
I Need a Hero.

320
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:36,860
I need a hero, but they all were punching Hitler on the comic books and stuff

321
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,820
that's true. There is one. If you look at his burn, he burns those you burn

322
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,980
those I burn what

323
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,980
it off

324
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,660
a slide show of all the

325
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:55,220
the yeah. If you look on like every single like one of those like Superman

326
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,660
wiki, the flash wiki, any of those and you look up Hitler, there is always a

327
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,180
page yeah in the

328
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,140
There's always a...

329
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,380
Well, I mean, it's just a fact that there's always the coolest guy you can be fighting

330
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,380
as a Nazi.

331
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,540
They don't have the Punisher fighting him, though.

332
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,060
They're the best, most evilest.

333
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:16,300
They don't have the Punisher fighting Hitler, but I guess that makes sense because he came

334
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:19,140
out and said, well, I don't know, maybe they could do a what if.

335
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,220
I bet you $100 that the Punisher fought Nazis.

336
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,180
He fought Nazis, but the neo kind.

337
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
Yeah.

338
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:27,180
Maybe.

339
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,180
So I'm saying they all did.

340
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,180
Yeah.

341
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,180
All of them fought them.

342
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,420
I'm talking about the first ones.

343
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:37,260
talking about Hitler and that's gonna be so sad to be a Nazi. Yeah, that's gotta

344
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,660
be so fucking sad. Yeah, no representation whatsoever, because

345
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,740
you're you're also a dork.

346
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,140
You saying you get bullied by the other Nazis? Yeah. Oh, I see. Yeah, it's like

347
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,660
kind of like you're on the at the bottom of the barrel on both sides. Yeah,

348
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,660
you're right. Yeah, because you're not and I mean you're you gotta be the only

349
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:00,940
Nazi comic book nerd. I'm starting to feel bad for these guys. Honestly, I mean

350
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,740
It's just like, yeah, it's kind of sad.

351
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,460
It's very sad. His whole life is sad.

352
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,740
He should kill himself.

353
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,180
No, no, no, no, no.

354
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,300
If I was in that position, I wouldn't kill myself.

355
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,460
We don't want anyone to kill themselves.

356
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,300
What?

357
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,620
No, no, no.

358
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,460
Okay.

359
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:15,620
No, no, no, fuck no.

360
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,460
Okay.

361
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,300
That's disgusting.

362
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,120
All right, all right.

363
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,740
I'm sorry that I brought up suicide.

364
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,260
He has a whole family.

365
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,100
What?

366
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,920
Yeah.

367
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,460
I know people who have committed suicide

368
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,920
and you're saying stuff like that to me.

369
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,300
Who?

370
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,140
Kurt Cobain.

371
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,140
That's disputed.

372
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:38,140
Who else? Oh, Anton Yeltsin.

373
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:41,140
Yeah.

374
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,140
Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs committed suicide.

375
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,140
In a way he kind of did.

376
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:50,140
He definitely did. He completely gave up.

377
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,140
He invented a computer. He knew about medicine.

378
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,140
He didn't even invent it, man.

379
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,180
Steve Jobs would a huckster. He was a huckster. He's a snake oil salesman.

380
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,440
Absolutely. You think computers don't even work would like he would be he

381
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,240
would have literally been Merlin the wizard back in English times

382
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,180
back in the English

383
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,340
do you guys ever

384
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:16,700
think that maybe you have the possibility of being a Steve Jobs style

385
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,900
change of the world kind of guy. I think I could get there. What do you think

386
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:26,060
would be what would be your your Avenue me? Yeah, I was not this. It could be

387
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
is

388
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,900
we could come up with an invention that actually that some scientist thinks yeah I guess probably

389
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,980
funny to make it and then he makes it and then he's like oh probably either like an

390
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:42,100
inventor or a dancer or a singer or novelist or an artist like painter type artist or an

391
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,780
artist with words not artist in a way for a no space graphic novelist or like a chef

392
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:53,300
or a construction worker there's no construction worker that has ever changed the world not

393
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,740
true no no no my friend Eiffel Tower Empire State Building Stonehenge I'm

394
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,060
thinking of a different that did change the world yep whoever invented Eiffel

395
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:08,060
towering that shit changed the world whoever thought up of that yeah not even

396
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:13,020
I mean I guess the name - yeah but what did they call it before that shit ring

397
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,020
around the Rosie the tower of gardens

398
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,780
Let's hanging gardens of Babylon this girl. Yeah, you know, it doesn't have a

399
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:28,000
Colossus of Rome. Does not have that good of a ring to it. Yeah, yeah, great wall.

400
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,800
Yeah, it's a great when a woman gets a great wall. That's when it's

401
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:38,880
like the like the 500 person gangbang. Yeah, how's that great line up? Because

402
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,480
they all lined up. Oh my does she I thought that they were the ones moving.

403
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,980
She's the one well, she doesn't she just time there on the great wall. That's why

404
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,520
That's the thing that would suck about doing the 500 person gangbang is just waiting in

405
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,520
line dude.

406
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Yeah.

407
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
You should be able to fast pass.

408
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,780
They should have a guy going up and down the line selling food and concessions.

409
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,080
We need to break a world record.

410
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,400
We need to break a world record very soon.

411
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
We've maybe talked about this before.

412
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400
What could we do?

413
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,460
We've definitely talked about breaking world records.

414
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,040
Any man worth his salt has done that.

415
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,040
has talked about it at the very least considered it.

416
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,840
But there, I mean we had this conversation.

417
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,640
Can we do longest podcast?

418
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,240
Can we podcast for two days?

419
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,080
We had a great plan that I wanted to do that just never shook out.

420
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,080
Oh yeah, that one.

421
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
But I think we can still do it.

422
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
We can definitely still do it.

423
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
We're going to do it.

424
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Yeah, we have to.

425
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
We'll do it for some milestone.

426
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,440
But look up world's longest podcast.

427
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,000
I want to see what the record is.

428
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,240
It's probably held by Rogan or something.

429
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Four hours?

430
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
You think that's the world's longest podcast?

431
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Yeah.

432
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,860
for a fact they got longer ones because I listened to them before Mike Russell

433
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,980
thirty six hours. God fucking now that's hard. That's no that's easy to beat

434
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,140
yeah

435
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,540
fuck we'd have to hire. I think you'd have to pay like ten thousand dollars to

436
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:00,100
get the Guinness person to come yeah. Ten thousand something like that. That'd

437
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:03,600
be funny to pay the Guinness person to come and then just immediately. So

438
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:09,000
thirty six is so so beautiful. That is hard. Well, what's the exact time?

439
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,820
you can beat it by it was like if it was like forty eight hours and we had to go

440
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,520
past forty eight hours, I would be like no, I don't want to do that, but thirty

441
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:20,980
six hours is completely doable, but it's a day and a half yeah and you have to

442
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:23,360
what you have to you just have to go past that you do thirty seven, but it

443
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,960
doesn't matter over a hundred and fifty hours.

444
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,040
That's the longest, that's a lot of hours in one minute, fuck yeah, I'm not

445
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,380
doing that shit. You say fifty hours in one row. I literally and I do not want

446
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:41,960
you break a record. Why because you don't have four to somebody going to break my

447
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:46,060
record, the fame change you if you so I'd fame would change me. Somebody would

448
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:50,140
break my record. Is it audio only live stream? That's bullshit that that is not

449
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:55,100
at all. No, we're saying podcast. We're saying iTunes. It's in the feed. Rss

450
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,700
it's a full yeah. That's what always made me laugh about somebody opening it and

451
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,460
being it's a forty hour. It takes up all the storage on your phone, your phone

452
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,900
auto down. Yeah, it just check yeah. No, I think that's a good idea. I think it's

453
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,780
a really I think we can do that. We can also break some kind of food record,

454
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,820
probably not even eating probably some kind of we make the making make the

455
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,140
biggest make the tastiest

456
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:24,020
the world's tastiest make the world's the world's most unhealthiest salad. Okay,

457
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,380
oh that's good. So what would it be

458
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,340
poison nine? Yeah, no, it can't be point. It needs to be something that

459
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,980
somebody can take on health iceberg, lettuce and strict. That's it. That's

460
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,180
the only two ingredients. Oh my God, the world's least amount of ingredients in a

461
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:45,540
salad. I could be like the I could do the world's least interested in eating a

462
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,220
chocolate bar and I could just sit at the chocolate bar and not eat it. How

463
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,800
long do you have to sit? What's the right? It's not about how long somebody's

464
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,320
about how disinterested, how long is the way you measure that is how long is

465
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,940
somebody sat across the table from a chocolate bar and not touched it? Yeah,

466
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,840
I think I could break that record longest, but nails, but it is we need

467
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,100
to make that also Guinness. We would like to set the record for longest

468
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,340
sitting near a chocolate bar and not even thinking, but also yeah, you can't

469
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,240
also it has you have to be most disinterested. So you can't even be

470
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,780
like you can't even be like

471
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,300
thinking about it. You can't even it can't even register. So we oh that'll

472
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,060
be once we get the Neuralink technology, there will be a whole new

473
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,620
brand of world records. Yeah, 20 easy world records to break. Maybe I could

474
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,920
just try and break tallest guy. Yeah, there's no way. What do you 63 that?

475
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:42,840
Yeah, I could see there's no way you're not even in the top 100. I might as well

476
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,500
just submit to the record, but you won't get it. There's taller people everywhere,

477
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,520
but I might get it. Well, how you think you're gonna be if they've tried to get

478
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,420
the record or not? What if everybody is a little taller means like, oh, there's

479
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:59,020
probably a taller Robert Wadlow something. What's that guy? I think

480
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:01,620
that's what's his name is living guy. There's like a there's like an eight

481
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,020
foot guy and fucking yeah, but maybe he never called the Guinness Book of World

482
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:10,420
Records. He's famous. So he obviously was he saw it was they took a picture of

483
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:17,020
him. You don't know that I was that guy that the guy from Big Fish. Maybe I

484
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:23,020
The big guy like, oh I don't know. You don't remember that guy?

485
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:29,020
You're talking about the guy who played Jaws? No. The shark? No the guy in big the

486
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Big Fish by Tim Burton. I never watched that movie. I never seen that. With Ewan McGregor.

487
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:43,020
Never seen it still. Oh. It's about a dad who's a liar. Oh. Yeah. You say it's a

488
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:46,980
you say it's a horror movie? No, it's just like a normal movie, but this guy

489
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,660
was in a lot of stuff. Oh, he's not even that tall. Seven to seven. There's

490
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:55,020
taller people in the NBA. Yeah, yeah. The number one pick. Maybe I can get

491
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,740
shortest guy. There's your why? Why is he having a conversation for sure? Oh,

492
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,660
oh, I was like, damn, why does he have an LAPD article? I was like, I was

493
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:10,260
because he was found dead. Oh, no. So so that's what I'm saying. Oh, you might

494
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,340
he has the largest feet. He had twenty nine and a half. I have bigger feet

495
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,580
than that hit twenty nine and a half feet yeah

496
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,460
shoes. Oh

497
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,780
that's not any height. That's a size where that's not even a size yeah.

498
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:26,760
Yeah, that's they don't. That's not a real. So they don't make. Why are you

499
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:31,260
even? Why are you even asking for the size right? Yeah, it's not like you're

500
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:34,180
getting you're getting your shoes custom. Yeah, now you don't go to the

501
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,300
store and say I'm twenty. I call a hundred thousand size a hundred. You

502
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:42,340
let's say I yeah. I have special feet yeah, just make them. They don't need to

503
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,140
be sized. They're not there's no stamping the vans on

504
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:51,100
size on the soul. They might not for this guy. No, I might they might step his

505
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,900
name big, big guy and you know he's not wearing vans either. Yeah, he's an

506
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:58,060
actor. He definitely has some kind of

507
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:03,740
orthopedic insole. He has to wear his knees are definitely over porinated.

508
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
What?

509
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,380
Pronated.

510
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,380
Pronated.

511
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,380
Over pronated.

512
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,380
Oh, okay.

513
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,380
Does that mean they're like this?

514
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:13,700
I think pronated is when your ankle bleeds out.

515
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,700
Oh, that hurts.

516
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
That has to hurt.

517
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,700
That would hurt so badly.

518
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,380
I actually don't know if it's out or in, but yeah, it's when you...

519
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:22,140
Well, I know about it from feet.

520
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,380
I don't know about knees.

521
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,380
He knows a lot about feet.

522
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,820
That's what he's telling us.

523
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,860
I don't think he does.

524
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,380
I just know about my own feet.

525
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,380
Tell me your feet facts.

526
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,380
What size shoe do you wear?

527
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,380
12 and a half.

528
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:40,380
11 and a half. I think I'm like 12. These are in 11 and a half. Mine are yeah. Okay. These

529
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:52,740
are 11 and a half, which means the last shoes I bought were made in Vietnam sample, not

530
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,380
for people. Oh, I thought it was people. I was like, get that shoe off your foot right

531
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:00,660
now. What are you doing? I thought you were trying it on. I don't want. Why would I try

532
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,740
I got your shoe on. I looked at the size of my shoe and said 11. I thought we were trying

533
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,940
them on. I thought that we were showing off that we all had the same shoe size. Mine are

534
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,380
some fucked up French size. So they say they're 38 or something. I have a bigger shoe. Does

535
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:23,380
it say 43? I don't know. What are you guessing? 48? I don't know. I'm telling you. 33? 43.

536
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:30,180
forty forty three. Whoa! Oh my God, you're smart. No, he's not. We are the

537
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,980
same shoe size and you wear a forty three in this. Let me see.

538
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,280
How did you know that?

539
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,780
Okay, so

540
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,980
he's putting the shoe on. You look like a girl. I feel like Cinderella.

541
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,980
Give me my shoe, bro.

542
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,680
You want to try mine on? No, dude. We're not. That's the worst radio of all

543
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,560
sometimes trying to their shoes on it's horrible. No, we need a topic to talk

544
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,800
about okay. Say something

545
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:01,220
fuck oh, I feel like I had something. Oh America's secret weapon against hearing

546
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,560
losses here, and you guys know that

547
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,040
I think it's not screaming.

548
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,240
I've been getting more and more and more of the alert from my phone that says the

549
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,280
volume needs to be turned down. You listen to your volume too loud. I did. I

550
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,280
I don't think I do. I don't think I do at all. Why we mean why I don't think I

551
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,980
don't think it's loud at whatsoever. I think that my headphones are quiet and

552
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:30,560
my and my computer for a long time. No hours, hours and hours and hours on end

553
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,760
on end. I never stop. I always have my always. I play speakers out instead. I

554
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,280
don't do my phone speaker. I find that to be annoying. I will. I don't I do it.

555
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,880
I'm usually alone even then. I think what if the name I don't also have an

556
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,800
embarrassing taste in music. I don't want people to hear this. Me too. I probably have

557
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:53,760
more embarrassing taste in music than you. I use my phone speaker. I use the sound bar

558
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,160
that Noah got. For some reason, I think using a speaker, a Bluetooth speaker, I think it

559
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:06,680
makes you a bad person. That's crazy. Wait, what do you, you listen out of your phone?

560
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,160
That's weird. That is weird. That is really weird. That is very weird. That's what I put

561
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,620
out of my pocket and I walk around to put it on. That's extremely weird.

562
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,440
You're muffling it. You're muffling the sound. No, I'm not muffling it 'cause I

563
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,940
put the speaker coming out of my pocket. That is still on. That means that you

564
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:26,380
have to wear at least chinos or some kind of slacks that have the side pocket.

565
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,020
If you wear, like, jeans, that's gonna muffle the shit. I don't wear jeans.

566
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,460
Okay. I didn't know you were, I didn't know you had it like that.

567
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:37,240
I didn't know you were wearing jeans. I usually wear shorts in my house anyway.

568
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:45,640
Damn. Damn. Damn. You got that warm house. I usually just actually don't wear pants in

569
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:49,360
my house. Yeah. Don't tell me this shit. We already talked about that. Don't fucking tell

570
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,280
me that though. That's true. No, he's told us about this. He walks around this house

571
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,480
half naked. You were the one who said it more than me. You go pooh bear in your house. You

572
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,640
like it even more. I made it all up. How about that? I lied. I don't lie. I made everything

573
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,240
up. That's why we call him Cameron Lincoln. Because he don't lie? Because he's incapable

574
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:12,080
Google of lying. I'm on his cherry tree. That was George Washington. Did he also

575
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,440
not lies at the story? He said I cannot. He's just said I cannot tell, but then he

576
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,360
probably did later on. It wasn't his overall quality. It was one thing he

577
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,200
did. So you can't be a war general and not lie right, because what if they call

578
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,720
you capture you and then yeah, they send you a carrier pigeon that says are you

579
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,480
guys going to attack us tonight? Yes, we're actually going to attack you at

580
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,600
eight o'clock shit, but that's noble. That is noble, but that's better. That's

581
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,480
better than this type of fucked up backstabbing, betraying type of war we

582
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,960
have nowadays. True. Where everything is on social media and so everyone is

583
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,400
doing it. All the soldiers are posting plans for attention. I kind of can't

584
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,560
believe that people used to fight wars by walking in a line at each other. I

585
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,880
just don't believe it. I don't believe the paintings. That just can't be true.

586
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,040
It has to all look like... There used to be chivalry. Yeah. It used to be. That

587
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,600
What was that movie, The Patriot, with Mel Gibson, where they're all walking in a fucking

588
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
line?

589
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
I don't fucking know.

590
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
I don't know either.

591
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,600
Had to watch that in school as a kid.

592
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,240
They used to, it used to be knights who would just run at each other on their horses.

593
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
And then so they thought, well...

594
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:20,080
You gotta do that with guns now.

595
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:24,400
Yeah, well we don't use horses anymore, because you can't aim a gun on a horse.

596
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:28,560
That's crazy to think that they were like, even both sides were like, we need this to,

597
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,280
I mean it has to at least be fair.

598
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,600
Like, no, you have to decimate them completely.

599
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,960
completely. No, it needs to be fair. I don't think it come. I think they need to

600
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,440
I think that the next step in warfare is we take all the drones and the planes

601
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,480
and we fly them in a line at each other. I said this forever that war should be

602
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,480
two robots fighting each other and you just sign a contract. This is whoever

603
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,360
yeah, whoever wins yeah, not we should be champion. You choose your champion

604
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,600
like a fantasy movie that literally nobody should be dying in war. We're so

605
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,120
past that it should be two planes flying at each other. The one that also saves

606
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,720
so much money, you just make one really good plane. Exactly. The instead of a

607
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,060
bunch of them, it can be so quick. Yeah. And whoever, obviously the bigger, just

608
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:13,200
like right now, the bigger countries have the bigger, better armies. The US is

609
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,960
gonna have the most tricked out fucking robot. Yeah, turned invisible. And that's

610
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,280
it. We need electrical robots. We need zords. Zords. We need zords. We need

611
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,580
huge. Yeah, zoids. Oh, zoids. Zoids. Zoids. Zoids. Zoids are power rangers. Yeah.

612
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,400
Yeah. No, we need zoids. We need zoids more than zords. We need robot bears and

613
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,940
have to run at each other and swipe each other. Oh my God, that would be so cool.

614
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,060
Have you guys ever seen that movie Robot Jocks? No, no, it sounds really funny.

615
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,900
That sounds like a death punk. They'd fight with big robots at each other. In

616
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,460
the entire war? I think it's a war. I can't really remember, but it's all

617
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,340
stop motion robots. Whoa, that's what I want to see. I want to see less people

618
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,420
passing away in foreign countries. And I want to see robots. I want to have the

619
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,660
a folded flag, the body, but a factory don't don't be crying for a slur when

620
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,080
your decision about war actually makes a I even angrier yeah. Why would it be

621
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:09,860
angry because AI and robots are the ones perishing, but I don't give a shit

622
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:14,020
about them. I'm saying don't come crying to me. Did you start giving a you guys

623
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,280
see the the footage is another video I saw of the

624
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,820
police officer responding to the UFO call where the people said that a UFO

625
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:26,060
in their backyard. I think my mom said it was two eight foot aliens walking around their

626
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,940
backyard. Yeah, I didn't see it's over. I don't think that's real. It's over. I think

627
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:34,300
that's all AI. I think that's an AI video that's being no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

628
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,300
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

629
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,300
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

630
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,300
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

631
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:44,060
AI to that's bullshit. I think that the aliens are AI and I think that it was all CG. It's

632
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:51,380
over where they've already won. I don't think that aliens an alien if an alien came here.

633
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:56,780
I think that we would have the wherewithal to beat the crap out of it with like by like

634
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:01,260
showing it different kinds of sodas and like showing it like that would beat the crap out

635
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:07,260
of it. I don't think an alien could ingest Diet Coke. I don't think an alien could ingest

636
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:11,800
think it would drink it. I think of an alien drink diet. Dr. Pepper is

637
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,600
something one of the chemicals in it would have a negative reaction. But you

638
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:21,340
think the alien would drink it when it got here? Yes, we would say we would

639
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:27,500
hand a diet. Dr. Pepper to the alien. We'd say, Hey, I think this is what we

640
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:34,020
drink every day. Only explanation for why we see so few aliens is that there

641
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,640
is probably only like 25 of them. Yeah. And they're from a very small, little,

642
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:45,320
big planet style planet. It's like Hawaii. Yeah. They're from like a Mario

643
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,600
Galaxy planet. And then they just come here. It's Delfino Plaza. Yeah. Yeah.

644
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,240
It's the guys from that. What are they called? I think they're called Delfinos.

645
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,880
Well, I jump on their head no matter what they're called. And they go...

646
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:02,760
Yeah. But basically, I think that the only explanation is only like 25. And

647
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,260
and they're not bringing it. They're not smart. They're not hitting us with any

648
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:11,240
kind of artillery. They know that yeah. Oh, no, they're eight feet tall, man.

649
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:15,100
They could live. We were just talking. You were like there's a hundred guys who

650
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,640
are eight feet tall. Yeah, you literally just said that earlier, but they look

651
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,960
do you think some people have gray alien DNA? I will say really tall people do

652
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,160
look bad. They look fucked up and not. There's people who here on earth who are

653
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:36,560
not human. 100%. Let's just go out, let's list them. I don't know them, but you see them

654
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,760
sometimes. You know one of them maybe. I don't think I know any of them. You don't know if

655
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:48,160
you know is the problem. That is the problem. Because a lot of them have used gene therapy

656
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,200
and they look a little more similar. They're doing gene therapy, they're wearing jeans

657
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,660
so you don't think they're a fucking alien.

658
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:54,500
- Exactly.

659
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,320
- Retail therapy.

660
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,400
- Yeah, you think what alien would be wearing this outfit?

661
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,360
- What are those, 501s?

662
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:00,440
- Anya Taylor-Joy.

663
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,460
- She's just ugly.

664
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,440
She's not an alien.

665
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,760
- That's what she wants you to think.

666
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,880
She wants you to think she's ugly.

667
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,720
- I think she's ugly.

668
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,160
- But in actuality, she's not.

669
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,040
- I watched this new HBO show, I watched the first episode.

670
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,880
- The Idol?

671
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,560
- I was mostly doing the crossword, but I had it on--

672
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,400
- The Idol, that one?

673
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,280
- Yeah.

674
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:27,320
the one with um, Lily Rose Depp. This show is pornography and it needs to be, it needs to

675
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,320
get out of here. That's the new Euphoria. It's by the same guy. It's worse than pornography.

676
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:37,000
It's the weekend and he's fingering her and stuff on the show. Weekend fingers, everybody's

677
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,200
fingering there's nipples abound. Oh my god there's too much fingering on the show. I

678
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,680
don't like it at all man. It really is just not, it should not be on TV. I saw a clip

679
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,760
and she is one of the worst actresses I think I've ever seen.

680
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,360
She's only around 'cause of Nep,

681
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,620
like literally, it's stupid to complain about it,

682
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:59,220
but genuinely, I think she's only around

683
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:02,440
because her dad is Jack Sparrow.

684
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,280
- I, yeah.

685
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,000
(dramatic music)

686
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,480
I agree, and I think if she wasn't around,

687
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,560
I think you'd be the star of that show.

688
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,840
- I would definitely be the star of that show.

689
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,840
Are you kidding me?

690
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,680
- I think The Weeknd--

691
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,800
- Oh my, wait, watch this, watch this.

692
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,800
The weekend would be braiding your hair. Watch this.

693
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,900
This is not that's the kind of faces she makes in the show. What's the type of

694
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:28,600
face? Describe it. It's a teeth out, teeth out, smile, smile like this.

695
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,880
That is not to that smile. I watch the show. She doesn't make that face and

696
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,680
she blew and she she winks her eyelashes at the weekend and it goes like don't

697
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,800
you guys think it's kind of fucked up and scary that when an actor is walking

698
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:47,740
around in his daily life or her daily life. They could, they literally have

699
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:52,840
been trained to do whatever and act like whatever person. So it's like we don't

700
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,980
know if they're acting right now, if they even need to be shopping.

701
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:03,060
Man, you just, you just, I mean, you see them at a red carpet and they're

702
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:07,160
flashing a smile, teeth out, and then you think, well hold on, I saw them do teeth

703
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,180
out smile on that one movie. Yeah. Are they even happy? Are they even enjoying

704
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:14,760
enjoying them. They are not enjoying it. At most actors, I think all the time,

705
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,200
what if you were married to an actor? Most actors do not enjoy their life.

706
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,020
They were crying. They go, "Shut the fuck up! I know you're fucking faking.

707
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,840
I saw you cry." You're researching a role. That was a Curb Your Enthusiasm

708
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,700
episode. You're researching a role. Exactly. So that's why you didn't do the

709
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:32,480
dishes. Well, that was actually, she was a paid crier. She was a paid crier.

710
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,920
That's even worse. That's even worse. I think that's the future of acting,

711
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,820
is we're not gonna, we're gonna specialize further. We're gonna have actors

712
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:42,940
you. It's not like one person who can act and play whatever role it's like yeah.

713
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:47,820
This is a laugher. This is a smiler. This is a sad actor and then when they

714
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:50,620
happy, when they cross over, they can get really, really good at it, so they

715
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,440
don't because like nowadays actors are bad because it's like well. I have to

716
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,060
learn to smile. I have to learn to act crazy. You don't know everything. I

717
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,900
have to learn how to make everything suffers. If you have to absolutely have

718
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,420
to learn how to make my smile into a frown exactly the transitions between

719
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:09,220
them, it's a lot of muscles, but a guy who just smiles and he's ten thousand

720
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,500
as as as hours of smiling yeah, ten thousand, how do you train for

721
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,860
something ten thousand hours, but then also the smiling guy moves over to

722
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,760
crying. It'll be like Adam Sandler doing a dramatic role, right, but that would

723
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:25,300
never have holy fucking shit. I would not let that happen. Yeah, true that

724
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,220
when this deal gets finished,

725
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:32,300
smilers will never cry. We need to get rid of every union on this planet. Oh

726
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,040
yeah, they ruined fucking everything. They ruined smiler, the smilers union

727
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,940
because you're right, every single thing would have a specialized union and

728
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:42,080
then all asked to be paid a million dollars a fucking minute. Yeah, I'm

729
00:42:42,080 --> 00:42:42,760
fucking smiling.

730
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,580
You can't say anything sad when you're on the down union, the standing up. Yeah,

731
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:52,940
every oh my God, the smilers union. I'm imagining maybe this is the future of

732
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,820
movies where a character can be a group of actors and may and a character is

733
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,740
five people and they walk around together. There's one guy who sits down

734
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,300
when the character sits down. There's one guy who smiles when the character's

735
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,780
happy. More of the same crowds. More of the same crowds when the character is sad. I can't

736
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:10,420
tell people apart. I'm not going to notice. Yeah, but no, it's not that they're switching

737
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,020
them out. It's that they're always together and the group of them as one is the character.

738
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:19,140
Oh, well, we're probably headed that way with people too because people are going to do

739
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,980
monkey see, monkey do. They're smiling Steve, crying Steve. Yeah, well, it's just like they're

740
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,020
different. It's like Inside Out, but in real life. Yeah, the real life of a movie. Outside

741
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:36,500
inside. There's going to be Smilers East and Vomit. That's a bad union to be in.

742
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:43,060
Vomiters Union. But you know, that way a smiler will never have to vomit in a movie again.

743
00:43:43,060 --> 00:43:47,620
That's true. That's the people who always want to be, I mean, Lord knows there are people who

744
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:52,340
like that type of thing. Can you imagine? I don't even want to bring it up, but the people who like

745
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:56,900
vomiting, that's all they have to do. Imagine having to pay your dues to the Vomiters Union.

746
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,920
I mean it probably just be like every other one hundred pukes a month. I

747
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,240
don't think you would pay in puke. I think you just probably pay money.

748
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,900
You would pay you. Why would you pay a puke and you're not in this word

749
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:11,740
envisioning a new world here. We don't have to be bound by the restrictions

750
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:15,580
that bind us right. We had a good idea and you guys are turning it into a

751
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,580
fucking bullshit. Okay, fuck a thought. It's not a bullshit fuck a thon to

752
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:20,500
think that come on.

753
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:27,340
A porn actor and a normal actor would almost never cross paths, so that's so

754
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:33,100
but basically it's already our idea is already true. You can make it you can

755
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,700
make their sexual actors and non sexual actors already can make the jump like

756
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:40,380
the lady from the never jump. They jump all the time. There was a jumper in

757
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,260
you in euphoria. There was a jumper in

758
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:49,020
I don't think Hayden Christiansen was a porn actor. I don't think he will. He

759
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,140
did a lot of CGI porn. What do you see? Oh, I think you're just talking about

760
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,020
jumping. No. Oh, well, that would be another. Yeah, that would be another

761
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,740
about a jumper's. There you go. Jumpers, jumpers. I didn't. I didn't realize that

762
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,820
the conversation was about jumping from. I've seen so many amazing videos this

763
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,260
week. I also saw the video of Tom Cruise doing his jump. Did you watch this? No,

764
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,540
yes, I've got to say it was so awesome. I see that video every few months. I

765
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,100
always watch it. It's one on one. Y'all you pull out that video. Did you see?

766
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,620
Did you see? Don't watch the video. Did you see that very long mission

767
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:23,020
impossible dead reckoning part one will only have one week in IMAX before it is

768
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:26,960
pushed out by Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, who gives a F about

769
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,640
Oppenheimer. Nobody even knows who that was, bro mission impossible at least

770
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,960
three weeks in IMAX, if not more. Here's the thing, Christopher Nolan,

771
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,800
IMAX more than Oppenheimer needs IMAX Nolan right now.

772
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:44,880
I need you. I need you to stop it. I need you to stop what you're

773
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,840
doing. Stop making this movie about nuclear war.

774
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,440
Okay, clear bore nuclear bore is what I'm calling it black and white black and

775
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,160
white and then

776
00:45:55,160 --> 00:46:01,260
hey, hey, Christopher Nolan, you know who did that first Pleasantville, Toby

777
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:06,480
McGuire, Spider-Man, think about it. I don't think you're copying Spider-Man

778
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,080
and Wizard of Oz and any other movie that's gone from black and white. Well,

779
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:16,840
Wizard of Oz was sepia. So that's different. Shut the fuck up. That's a

780
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:21,280
sepia movie tour with color movie. I'm going to make you sepia. You're not

781
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,240
going to be or yeah, I'll make you sip you on some says are sip. I'm gonna get

782
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:26,880
you. I

783
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:36,160
sip your sperm sip your sperm on my sip your sperm. Your sperm up set my

784
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,640
I don't think I've ever heard that song. You've heard you've heard probably not

785
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,000
like my bitch. I don't think I have either. I've definitely I know these

786
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,320
I have it in my head. I've listened to it in my head hundreds of times.

787
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,320
I've never seen Charlie's Angels.

788
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:51,320
You've seen Charlie's Angels.

789
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,680
I used to love that movie.

790
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:58,840
Yeah, it's the fight scene between Crispin Glover and Lucy Liu. They play that song.

791
00:46:58,840 --> 00:46:59,840
Tom Green is in that?

792
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,840
Mm-hmm.

793
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:02,840
And he falls in a tube.

794
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:08,640
See, that guy should not, in my vision of Hollywood, that guy would never be in an action

795
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:09,640
movie.

796
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,640
100%.

797
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:11,640
Tom Green?

798
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,640
Yeah.

799
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,640
He's in an action movie.

800
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,640
I don't like when comedians cross over and do any kind of...

801
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,640
my vision of Hollywood. What are you not understanding?

802
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,640
Freddie got fingered was an action movie. He did a lot of action.

803
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,640
Shut up. Shut up.

804
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,640
Well he does skateboarding. He did actions of violence towards his father.

805
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
There would be no skateboarding in any movies.

806
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,640
No, no, no. That would be strictly for YouTube videos.

807
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,640
And chimpanzees. And chimpanzees who go on a mini ramp.

808
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:38,640
And bulldogs also. Bulldogs and chimpanzees.

809
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,640
Viral. That would be only for viral Hollywood.

810
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,560
Hollywood. Yeah, they're making a new sector of Hollywood called viral wood to

811
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,040
try it because a lot of these viral videos nowadays are not as good as the

812
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,680
ones we used to have. So I'd like to maybe section off and divide get some of

813
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:56,680
these producers, directors, actors, get them out of movies, out of the movie

814
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:01,760
industry and just working on getting better viral videos. We get to see and

815
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:06,200
also there should be a union for us who like to make viral videos. Yeah, yeah. We

816
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,960
we get Newman, a guy we get Tays on day we, well, it would be like a

817
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,520
dramatic of the Union. Yeah, a monk has died many years ago.

818
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,440
You have to say it that meanly

819
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,840
years and years ago, they're like way before you saw the video.

820
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:26,720
That's a death.

821
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,280
You're saying it so flippantly

822
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,880
I'm so I don't that's a horrible. I mean, I guess you're right.

823
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,500
he's just finding this out right now and you said it like that

824
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:44,860
yeah. I mean there's nothing to be done for him. He's he's done and dusted he's

825
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,400
in the dirt.

826
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:48,860
Yeah,

827
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:55,460
he's gone man since when since probably one or something. I don't even know how

828
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:57,660
old that video is. It's older than the Internet, though,

829
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:02,220
what's that that dramatic chipmunk has passed. It says probably

830
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,580
and that's probably our thought and that was so that you're fine. That means he's

831
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,300
okay. A chipmunk doesn't live very well. I would guess it's not a chipmunk. It

832
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,780
wasn't even a chipmunk. He was a prairie dog. Dear God. Well, I got prairie dog

833
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:18,740
probably lives even less time than a chipmunk. No, it lives more.

834
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:23,060
I think he's still alive. I think there's a good chance he's still alive.

835
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:26,700
There's no chance. If there's one prairie dog in the world who's been alive,

836
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,220
it might be him because he has a reason to be preserved.

837
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:36,280
he's dead. He's not it says two thousand and also I hate to ruin this for you

838
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,940
guys. He wasn't even being dramatic. He probably just saw some food.

839
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:45,120
What he was not trying to be dramatic at he doesn't know what drama means. I

840
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,000
thought he was being funny. He doesn't know what being funny is. He's an

841
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,680
animal. He doesn't know what being funny is. He has no idea what that is to be

842
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:53,080
funny.

843
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,600
Well, you know people I just don't understand

844
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,800
and by the way, if you have a dog and it licks your face, it just wants to it

845
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,360
means you have a fucking salty face.

846
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:07,360
If you were wondering and if you have a cat that

847
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,520
sucks on your finger, I never had a cat.

848
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,400
It means you finger, you know, funny finger, your finger tastes, yeah, I don't

849
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:22,920
know. I don't know what it means. I'm not a veterinarian. Yeah. Yeah, you are a

850
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,480
veterinarian. I couldn't be a veterinarian. You have to kill, you have

851
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,920
to kill too many animals. You have to kill every single animal. It's so funny that

852
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,720
being a veterinarian, your entire job is just chop them all up. Even when you're

853
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,560
not killing them, when you save them, it's that you have to cut them apart.

854
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:38,140
Yeah, take their legs off and then you put them in that thing. It's always

855
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,700
someone who's like, "I love animals, I wanna be a veterinarian." You torture

856
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,560
animals all day. You go and be like the apprentice or whatever it's called.

857
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,060
Yeah, you're doing experiments on animals. You're like an intern or whatever.

858
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:48,400
I think at that point you just have to... That's literally what it is.

859
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:50,840
Yeah, I mean, I've told you that I had a friend who wanted to be...

860
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:54,840
Who became a veterinary assistant, first day killing dogs, second day killing

861
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:01,080
today like back in the 1800s or I mean honestly the 1950s like a veterinarian when they like

862
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:06,200
like they brought somebody brings their dog in and the dog dies they like like well you

863
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:12,240
know I don't might as well make it into lunch. No because you don't think they ate dogs in

864
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:16,760
the 1950s. You don't think you don't think that they dies of natural cause. You don't

865
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:22,200
think that they picked it up and just like threw it on a grill and the 1950s yeah. What

866
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,700
What do you think will the 1950s had refrigerators?

867
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,320
1950s was a backwards ass time, bro.

868
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,320
Not for animals.

869
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,320
It was actually better for animals.

870
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,800
It was in a factory farming.

871
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,840
Well, not in factory animals.

872
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,360
They didn't invent leashes much yet.

873
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:39,360
People were walking.

874
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:40,360
Really?

875
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,360
Dogs had their own houses and lives.

876
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:42,360
That's true.

877
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:43,360
They just go in.

878
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:44,360
There weren't really dogs in the cities.

879
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:45,360
Well, they'd run around.

880
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:47,960
That's what my dad always says.

881
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,960
That's one of the things he says.

882
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,320
you ever hang out with my dad, I'll say it at least one time, which is he says, you know,

883
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,320
dogs just used to roam around. They weren't fenced in or on leashes or anything. They just

884
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
go all over the place.

885
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:59,320
It's probably for the best.

886
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
He's just lying.

887
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,320
He's not lying.

888
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:05,520
I mean, back when, not when he was a kid, not in the 70s and 80s.

889
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,520
Yeah.

890
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,520
Nobody was...

891
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,520
In the 60s and 70s, yeah.

892
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,520
Your dad's that old?

893
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:10,520
Yeah.

894
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:11,520
Yeah, that was probably...

895
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,520
Whoa.

896
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,720
That was probably because he lived in like a small-ass neighborhood.

897
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,720
He lived in Cambridge.

898
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,320
Oh my God, that was not a small ass neighborhood.

899
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,320
Oh my God, it was actually a big ass neighborhood.

900
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,320
Oh my God, that was actually one of the biggest developing neighborhoods at that time.

901
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,320
They said kids would just get chased by dogs and you'd know which dogs lived where,

902
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,320
so at certain times of day you wouldn't walk by a certain house.

903
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,120
I don't believe it until I see it on a fucking cave wall.

904
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,120
You see it on TV shows.

905
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,120
Fuck you, I do.

906
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:39,620
That's always in a movie, a kid gets chased by a dog.

907
00:52:39,620 --> 00:52:42,320
Yeah, they would show that in like Malcolm in the Middle and shit,

908
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:45,320
and it was like, oh, is that because he lives in a crazy neighborhood?

909
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:46,520
you know that's how you say

910
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:52,220
I say you know that's what it was like that back then here. It's like that

911
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:56,620
right now in India, so you know and in Mexico yeah, there are many places are

912
00:52:56,620 --> 00:53:01,520
having a war in India between monkeys and dogs. There's dogs everywhere in

913
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,720
Mexico. I went and I saw you're tripping maybe not in your little you remember

914
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:08,840
that I guess you live you because you live you're gentrifying Mexico. You are

915
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,520
you live in a fancy neighborhood.

916
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,160
oh nothing to say now. Oh,

917
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,160
silence, because he's in the one percent.

918
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,160
He is in the one percent.

919
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,160
Always is. Silence.

920
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,160
But there was a

921
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,160
there was like a war between

922
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,160
yeah, the monkeys are throwing dogs off of towers.

923
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,160
Monkeys are throwing dogs off of towers

924
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,160
and then dogs are biting monkeys.

925
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,160
That sucks. I think all the time

926
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,160
about if my dog had

927
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,160
opposable thumbs and could articulate

928
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,160
fully articulating arms

929
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,160
that he would be doing

930
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:44,120
way to have a way different life. Yeah, if he had his brain in a monkey's body,

931
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:48,100
you're lucky you can't jump up on the can even if a ball goes on

932
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,020
table, he can't eat barks at it, because I have to come get it, because he can't

933
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,760
he can't do anything. If I had a dog and he learned to speak

934
00:53:54,760 --> 00:54:00,200
and I would have to kill him instantly, I would be teaching because imagine you

935
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:03,960
come home to your dog and you open the door and he runs up and he goes. I love

936
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,300
you

937
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,100
where he walks in and you're whacking off. I love you. What are you doing in

938
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,400
there? What are you doing in there? That's all he knows. He would only say I

939
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,040
love you.

940
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:15,400
You're trying to

941
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,400
you would walk up to and you're you're jacking off and you'd say I love living

942
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:20,760
here.

943
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:28,000
I like my food shut up dog. My dog could speak. I'd be teaching it like if these

944
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,280
dogs could talk. If I'd be teaching him any young men joke, so we go on tour.

945
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,840
Yeah, he'd be I'd be given. I'd be holding him. I'd be holding him like

946
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:41,680
on stage and it'd be like, huh, like a little vintroquist that'd make him say, "Take my bone,

947
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,680
please."

948
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,680
Take my bone, please.

949
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
Take my leash, please.

950
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
I don't need that.

951
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,640
I think if my dog could talk, I'd fall in love with him.

952
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,640
Yeah.

953
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:49,640
I think I would get, you know.

954
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,640
You would immediately...

955
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:51,640
No, I think it would be...

956
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,960
I like my dog too much.

957
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:53,960
I can't...

958
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,960
Go to try and suck it off.

959
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:57,960
No, it wouldn't be sexual, but I think I would have an emotion...

960
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,360
I would emotionally cheat on my wife with my dog.

961
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:01,360
Yeah.

962
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,360
Or no, I wouldn't.

963
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,200
What does that mean?

964
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,200
Emotional cheating?

965
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,880
It's like when there's a girl at work and you go like I'm thinking of fucking you.

966
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:21,040
They're not fucking, but I would be like I am in love with you. I'm so is that and more in a way

967
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:25,440
that was different from it being a child. You'll be doing it romantically. It's hairy.

968
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:33,600
You got hair. That's what makes you. What if you like what if like your dog learned to speak

969
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,620
right and you're sitting there one day, you're just watching the news or

970
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:41,640
whatever and he walks up to you and he's like by the way. My name is not

971
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:45,500
Phil. Yeah, he would say that my name is not the first thing you would say. My

972
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,900
name is no, you know, you would say he would be like

973
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,500
I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you this whole time. My name is

974
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:55,180
my name is yeah. He would say my name cannot be pronounced in your language.

975
00:55:55,180 --> 00:56:00,600
Yeah, it sounds like this. Yeah, I would be like whoa, I'm an M, M, M, you

976
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:05,320
name him? I would never tell you what his original name was when I got him. His

977
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,800
entire litter was named after the Encanto. Yeah. Oh, yeah. This was

978
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:13,120
Augustine. Yeah, that's cool. It's not cool. I'm so glad. What's the other

979
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,880
in contact? I don't know. That seems like maybe a good one. I mean, I haven't

980
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:19,600
either. I'll just into a dog. But what were the other dogs names? You must know

981
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:24,160
at least one or two of them. They all got changed. One of them's name is

982
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:29,080
flippy. But I just wanted to know, like, ruggy or some shit. Ruggy. I don't

983
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,920
way I can tell you I'm going to group chat with all the pretty close. I was

984
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,880
curious what if that's a good on conto name or a bad one, I guess, but I don't

985
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,260
think that I guess that doesn't matter and some of the group chat is called in

986
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,160
conto family.

987
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:45,600
There's Charlie. These are not the original names. These are what they got

988
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:48,920
changed. Yeah, these are these are new ones. There's Charlie. There's now now

989
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:53,600
there's Bruno Bruno Bruno Bruno stayed the same. There's Dugan. I think that

990
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,760
one is actually original Dugan Dugan Nash.

991
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:04,040
let's see Mel Dugan, Phil Rudy, this is the only people who are active. I

992
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:07,680
never post in this shit do that. Damn, can you send a pic right now? Tracy

993
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:13,640
send a picture? What if we have a play date? Can you say why? What do you

994
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:17,740
mean you play date? You do you think people would think it was weird to see

995
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,900
a picture of me? Yes, they're going to think wait. What if you put on a

996
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:25,380
picture? You say Phil is having an amazing day. Put the dog filter on

997
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,900
they sorry, no send a picture,

998
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:32,300
well, even just say something like he's taking care of Phil today, so excited

999
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,340
okay,

1000
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:42,540
got this guy taking care of bill today. He's so excited.

1001
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:45,540
My brother, I say my brother is

1002
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:48,480
here of bill today.

1003
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:52,600
He's so excited. These these pups are a blessing.

1004
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,100
it.

1005
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,860
These pups

1006
00:57:55,860 --> 00:58:00,180
are a blessing. That's just a heart emoji

1007
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,180
and I was thinking

1008
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:06,100
to this bro. I was thinking there's twenty people in this. There's no

1009
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:09,240
way nobody's going to respond. Oh my God, somebody's somebody's going to

1010
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,780
heart react it. Yeah, hopefully I'm going to leave it. Let's see someone's

1011
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:13,200
not going to

1012
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:16,360
two minutes. I said this

1013
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:25,680
wait. They named it Charlie like Charlie XCX. I mean just no e. Oh my God, one

1014
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,760
minute in no likes, no response. It's one minute. It's a face. People take

1015
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:30,040
to

1016
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,200
it was Facebook. No, it's text messages. Damn, I have all these people's number.

1017
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:39,160
It's completely over. You should have put the dog filter on him and said,

1018
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,960
look at how big Phil has gotten. Jubio wants me to send this photo. That would

1019
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,840
be weird, though.

1020
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,320
Phil, take a

1021
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:47,320
go for

1022
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:53,760
Why does he shit like that?

1023
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,760
Oh my god.

1024
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:59,440
Dude, he literally, I remember I told you what he looked like.

1025
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,840
No fucking responses still dude.

1026
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,840
You're making me look like a dickhead.

1027
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,120
No, it's not me.

1028
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,120
Phil looks like the night stalkers from New Vegas dude.

1029
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,120
You wrote the message weird.

1030
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,120
It's so funny.

1031
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:10,120
You look weird.

1032
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:11,120
No, you wrote the message weird.

1033
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,360
I'm telling you, you should have put a filter on him.

1034
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,360
That would have made no fucking sense.

1035
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:19,440
and do it in black and white with like wish him luck or something like that,

1036
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,060
then people be like OMG good luck. You should have you should have

1037
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:26,900
you should have put it in black and white or something. You should have put

1038
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,120
it in like a crazy. You should have sent the picture of me on all fours.

1039
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:34,400
Now my wife's going to be so mad at me. I'm going to get a call.

1040
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,560
Oh, I auto woke my phone, but I thought I got a notification.

1041
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,980
I flop in the family group chat man.

1042
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:51,260
I've never fucking flopped in there every fucking time. I send a message

1043
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:55,720
heart react, smile, react, exclamation point. What the fuck you did this to me?

1044
00:59:55,720 --> 01:00:01,600
You made him a now I am bro. You should unsend it right. I am a pariah. You

1045
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:05,520
are a fucking pariah bro. How do you unsend something? Don't don't teach him.

1046
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,160
I don't know how he has to live with his flop more. You should send it an

1047
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,480
invisible. I just delete it. No that just deletes it from your how do I do

1048
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,240
it? I can't unsend it bro. You didn't update your phone. I shit yeah

1049
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:22,200
that sucks for you man dude. I am going to get cooked. Just send another one

1050
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:27,660
say jk. He took my phone. That's it's obvious somebody else took the photo.

1051
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:33,020
He took my phone and took a selfie. Both your hands are out.

1052
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:38,020
I'm not doing that man. You're ruining my reputation. My friend took my phone.

1053
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:41,740
I just know the next plate. We have a snap. The next play that we have on just

1054
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,720
say that we're going to be sitting there. Phil's going to be playing with

1055
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:48,480
Ruby and or Dugan and Yuki and Charlie and one of the guys is going to be like

1056
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,400
so you as your brother, how's your brother doing? How did he fare with Phil

1057
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,120
and I'll just go what and he's like your brother. He took care of Phil go. Oh

1058
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:59,320
man, it was amazing. Yeah, he did. Well, that means that would mean that he

1059
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:04,120
remembered yeah and that was it was not a flop putting me in a in a situation

1060
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,760
where I have to lie to some of the closest people in my life.

1061
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:13,220
I didn't say that yeah, but you also aren't taking care of Phil. So you made

1062
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:17,000
me lie. I've taken care of Phil before, but you're not today and also I can now

1063
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,620
he has to

1064
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:23,460
you. Oh my God, we go get no even cushioned. It was by saying these pups

1065
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,420
are a blessing. Why'd you say that I thought that they would come across as

1066
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:31,560
more because it's just kind of that honestly ruined it. That is not ruin it

1067
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:34,760
that did ruined it a little bit. That's a weird thing to say. I just send

1068
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:42,360
another message. Yeah, I say guys, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to send

1069
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,740
guys. I

1070
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:51,080
I'm not doing that. I'm not sending another message. I'm just going to see

1071
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,620
if people nobody's going to respond. It's going to be days and somebody's

1072
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,000
going to be like

1073
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,540
Yuki had an amazing play with a

1074
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:01,840
that's the kind of thing they send in there. They just send when their dogs

1075
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:05,080
to play with another dog pretty here. I'll then why do you care about

1076
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:09,120
loving because I don't want to flop bro charlie did not want to go for a walk

1077
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,640
last night and apparently she takes after me and the light was too bright

1078
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,200
for her as she was trying to sleep.

1079
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:20,440

1086
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:50,720
attacked by an off leash dog while out on a walk this past Friday. Oh my God,

1087
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:53,640

later tonight. Send a picture of yourself crying say OMG. Well, my

1096
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:25,240
brother was watching film

1097
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:26,440
brother died.

1098
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:31,340
Just hands in my head a self timer photo sitting on the bed in my

1099
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,540
underwear with my hands in my head.

1100
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,740
My fucking brother died.

1101
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:35,740
Phil ate him.

1102
01:03:35,740 --> 01:03:36,840
It's can't be.

1103
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,440
Phil dragged him into the street.

1104
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:41,040
Phil dragged him for miles by his neck.

1105
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,140
All right.

1106
01:03:42,140 --> 01:03:42,740
I have to handle.

1107
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:43,640
I need to make some calls.

1108
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,140
I have to go.

1109
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:44,840
I can't.

1110
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:45,740
Wait, show the pic.

1111
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:46,840
Show the pic first.

1112
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:48,140
The pic of Cam?

1113
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,140
Yeah, we have to get a close up of it.

1114
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,840
Oh, and what day did we choose for the shareholder meeting?

1115
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,540
Shareholder meeting is June.

1116
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:59,580
This is one. The photo that is ruining my life right now. June 23rd is the

1117

home planet and appears at Campion and it's camping. You may know him all of

1120
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:18,420
us. Station station station station. Go watch that. Go watch it now. All right.

1121
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:19,740
Bye. Motherfuckers. Bye. Bye.
