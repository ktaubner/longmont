1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
- Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,380
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,080
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:10,900
(laughing)

6
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,000
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
- Okay.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,240
- Okay.

9
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,080
- Go.

10
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,900
- Okay, I'm going.

11
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:16,740
- Okay, go.

12
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,400
- Um, there was a--

13
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,240
- Go.

14
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,060
- Okay, I'm trying to go.

15
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,900
I'm trying to go right now.

16
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:22,740
- Faster.

17
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,560
- Okay, there was a guy.

18
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,400
That's just higher.

19
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,240
- There was--

20
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,060
- There was a--

21
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,160
I'm just re-correcting.

22
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,000
- Faster.

23
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,820
- There was a guy--

24
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,660
- You're pitched.

25
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,900
- Why, why, why, why am I?

26
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,980
- Musically.

27
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,440
- Every time I shit, for some reason,

28
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,460
I can't just enjoy my shit and I have to read something,

29
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,380
so sometimes I read the ingredients on the shampoo bottle.

30
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,380
- True as fuck.

31
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,200
- Isn't that true?

32
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,820
- That could be a good rage comic.

33
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,140
- That would be a good ass rage comic.

34
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,620
- Why is that though?

35
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,420
Why is shitting just not enough for people

36
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,420
to just take a shit?

37
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:58,020
- 'Cause it's, I don't even wanna think about poop.

38
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,460
but it hurts so bad.

39
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,300
- I don't even want to think about it.

40
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,140
- It's completely hot.

41
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,420
- It's one of those things where--

42
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,580
- You're struggling, like why do you need distraction?

43
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,860
- It's like muscle memory to poop, right?

44
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,980
And if you focus on it, you get all in your head

45
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,340
and you fuck it up.

46
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,180
The poop can go back up.

47
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,020
- The poop goes sideways and shit.

48
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,020
- Yeah, 'cause something weird can happen.

49
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:17,000
- You ever been holding a shit in

50
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,460
and then you take a shit

51
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,340
and it feels like it fell out of you sideways?

52
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,300
- No. - Yeah.

53
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,260
- No, I know what you're talking about.

54
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,620
- Yeah, he knows what I'm talking about.

55
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,460
- I don't know if I know what you're talking about.

56
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,860
There's a couple of shit, I just have shit questions, honestly. I have a lot of shit

57
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:34,180
questions. What is it about, I can tell that I need to poop, but I won't be able

58
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:38,700
to poop until I have a sip of coffee and it doesn't even hit my stomach. I just

59
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,180
need to have it in my mouth. I think my gut biome is probably very disgusting.

60
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,780
The biome? Yeah. I think you have like acid rain in your biome and your gut. I

61
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,620
feel like most gut biomes are really disgusting. It's all gross. I

62
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,620
I think that my gut biome looks like the lower level of Coruscant.

63
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,620
Yeah, I think that most people have bacteria and stuff.

64
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,620
I think you have macroscopic animals.

65
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,620
You can see them with your eyes.

66
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,620
I think I have a bug that walks around.

67
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,620
You have a lot of bugs.

68
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,620
It looks like the other world from Half-Life.

69
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,620
Whatever it's called. The other dimension.

70
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,620
Yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,620
The Vorgonauts.

72
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,620
Vortigaunts.

73
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,620
Vortigaunts.

74
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,260
pronounced. Have either of you even played Half-Life? I played some of Half-Life. I beat

75
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,380
Half-Life 2 episode 2. You guys need to play the VR of your Half-Life. Yeah. Oh yeah? Yeah.

76
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,340
Because you can actually grab a trash can and you can throw it as hard as you can. Really?

77
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,420
You can do that with a gravity gun. No but you actually use your hands to do it in Half-Life

78
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,100
Alyx. That's way less cool than a gravity gun. Can both of you just get into virtual

79
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,740
reality and we could just be. Why don't you buy me one? Why don't you buy me a VR headset?

80
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,740
Yeah, why don't you buy me one?

81
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,740
I'll do that for you.

82
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:52,740
I'd gladly do that for you. But I know he's gonna break it.

83
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,740
Yeah, he's gonna do something.

84
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,740
He's gonna use it for weird stuff.

85
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,740
Yeah, you're gonna use it for porn. VR porn, by the way.

86
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,740
It's too low quality.

87
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,740
It's like 480p video.

88
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,740
Yeah.

89
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,740
And also, you look around, you see the GoPro where your dick is supposed to be.

90
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
Yeah, you can see the GoPro and then you can

91
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,740
probably just see like how

92
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,740
disgusting the room that they're filming it in is.

93
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,740
Can you look in the mirror?

94
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:19,300
you can do anything you want. I guess it's not like a game it's a video. You can't

95
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,660
move around. It should be a VR porn where you can move around and you actually feel.

96
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,420
That's not VR that's just a like that's like a movie

97
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,780
screen that's 360 degrees. That shouldn't count as virtual reality.

98
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,300
It's not immersive. Unless there's like inputs I can put in.

99
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,420
They should just add on top of VR porn, just add like hands like

100
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,580
bad like low poly like arms and hands so I can just wave my hands around.

101
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,340
It should be yeah it should be it should be exactly like super hot it should be

102
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,940
yeah every time you move super hot yeah you come and she explodes.

103
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,300
Super hot super hot and then it plays it back really fast. You should play as the girl and you have to

104
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,180
dodge the cum or you explode because that's the fun part of or you that could be the multiplayer.

105
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,940
You dodge squirt like you got to look in this like vr porn room and it's just like one of those rooms

106
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,660
like pink room, pink walls with white carpet, and you can see a stain in the

107
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:18,820
carpet from when they filmed before. Yeah, that is how a lot of it feels. Yeah.

108
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:22,420
Yeah, you look around, it's like a model home. You know, it's like

109
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,300
not a real house. You walk by a bathroom and it's completely unfinished. There's no tile or

110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,300
toilet. Yeah. You know, it should be like, it should be a whole MMO

111
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,900
type thing. There's a hub world. You can go to different raids, which are the

112
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,220
different sex scenes right and and you can like their cosmetics you can sell

113
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:45,480
like maybe I could like trade a cosmetic of like a three-inch penis for someone

114
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,020
is giving me a cosmetic of like dirt caked under the fingernails definitely

115
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:59,460
yeah yeah no that's a great porn VR how disgusting yeah yeah I want him to be

116
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:05,620
balding yes yeah I would like to 400 400 GP for stomach acne but you can't

117
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,300
can't fuck other people in the game. You can only fuck the...

118
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,900
You can tag team with other people.

119
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,900
It's all PVE.

120
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
Yeah, exactly.

121
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,900
That's a really smart idea.

122
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,300
I think that that could be huge.

123
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,300
I would really like to get into...

124
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,300
World of sex craft.

125
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,340
Yeah, sex of girl craft.

126
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,980
He's playing Pokemon Go while we record in this lab and he thinks that we won't notice.

127
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,980
I have to get a streak.

128
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:26,980
You have to get a streak?

129
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Yeah.

130
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,980
I would like to see you streak.

131
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
You know what we're doing?

132
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,980
I'm going to get a streak.

133
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,980
I'm going to get a streak.

134
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,980
You know what we're doing?

135
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,980
I'm going to get a streak.

136
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,980
I'm going to get a streak.

137
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,700
hour of the day where you could work on this?

138
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,540
- Yeah, you'd love to--

139
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,180
- No, it was gonna reset.

140
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,420
- It resets at, what is it, 3.30?

141
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,260
- 3.40.

142
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,860
- Well, I did it around like four yesterday.

143
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,680
- I don't think--

144
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,420
- So it's a 24-hour timer.

145
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,920
- I don't think it's 24 to 24.

146
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,300
That makes no sense.

147
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,660
- All right, well--

148
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,500
- 'Cause then you just--

149
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,300
- What if you did it an hour before every day or something?

150
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,220
- I don't know.

151
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,300
- You could've done it beforehand.

152
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,700
- I could've, yeah.

153
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,180
- I don't think that makes any sense.

154
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,020
I think that we should get into game development, though.

155
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,820
we've been talking about that a lot.

156
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,740
Woman go, that's the like the mobile version of world sex.

157
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,020
- And also you can actually scan in women

158
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,860
that you see on the street and then capture them digitally.

159
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,700
Man, would you also know why I do a 360

160
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,540
around you really quick?

161
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,700
I'm a street photographer.

162
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,100
Last night, I was leaving the bar

163
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,860
and somebody took a picture of me.

164
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,420
Some random guy took like a picture of me.

165
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,260
I was like, what?

166
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,700
And I was like, what the fuck are you doing?

167
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,300
And he was like, I'm a street photographer.

168
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:31,540
And I don't know why that, I was like, okay.

169
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,100
And then he just left.

170
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:39,620
you ask him for you was a new into a flash photo of me yeah yeah on his phone

171
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:46,700
no on a with a DSLR I was like what the fuck are you doing yeah I hate when I

172
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,860
see people doing my shit and I told him that's my violation and you're losing on

173
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,740
film was it like why are you obsessed with the camera I don't know it was just

174
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,500
as you could have asked him you could have asked him in that moment to delete

175
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,020
the photo. It's not that honestly I'm with Caleb and that that I feel like him

176
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,040
had to me less about him had the photo existing and more about him taking a

177
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,980
picture. I more like wanted to fight the guy. I didn't because if that guy took a

178
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,860
picture of me and I didn't know that's I'm not I wouldn't yeah I wouldn't know

179
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,940
it wouldn't matter. And also he used a flash and it was like there was this light. I wouldn't even notice

180
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,180
if he didn't I was like sitting there waiting for an uber and I just got a

181
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
flash in my face. I was like, "I'm gonna fucking kill this guy."

182
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,180
It's okay to take a picture of someone from behind.

183
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,180
Yeah. On the street.

184
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,180
If you take a picture from very far away with like a very

185
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,180
big lens, that's fine.

186
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,180
I'm so bad at taking stealth

187
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,180
photos of people. I'm really good at

188
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,180
taking stealth photos of people. I'm really, really, really bad.

189
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,180
I bet you have a lot of practice at that.

190
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,180
I have a lot of stealth photos I've taken of you.

191
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,180
I tried to take a photo

192
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,180
of a guy who was a barista

193
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,180
the other day because he looked like somebody

194
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,180
that we know and I just couldn't get a photo

195
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,900
of them. I just got too nervous every time I pulled my phone.

196
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,980
The thing is, 90% of the time it's not worth it.

197
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:03,460
Yeah, it wasn't worth it. 90% of the stealth photos I've taken are like him in the bathroom

198
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,460
or like him. And the other 10% is where he just puts up... The first show we did on tour,

199
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,580
I was taking a shit and he just popped his phone on top of the stall. Oh yeah.

200
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,420
He just took a photo of me taking a shit. I forgot about that.

201
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:21,220
Like five minutes before the show started. Yeah, I forgot we did that and then I have a photo

202
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:26,660
before my my point-and-shoot broke just a photo of you in a wah-wah bathroom just

203
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:31,060
pissing yep he thinks that's funny it is funny you realize you could go to

204
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,460
pre-realize that's why dr. disrespect was banned from twitch really yeah because

205
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,020
he brought a camera into a picture of Caleb peeing yeah you get in trouble for

206
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,860
taking cameras into the bathroom really I'm for real it's fucking illegal no

207
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:50,100
really yes yeah it's fucking illegal that's illegal that explains a lot then

208
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,980
Brandon yeah explains a lot thanks Brandon I don't think Brandon had

209
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,780
anything to do with it I think Brandon actually is Brandon is fighting against

210
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,460
yeah just stop it so you're pro Brandon now I mean if honestly if he makes it

211
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,460
completely legal to take pictures of people shitting and wiping their butts

212
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:13,060
and yeah yeah here it is that's a really nice photo that's that's cute yeah yeah

213
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,700
that's really cool that's taking a portrait 400 the fucking portrait body

214
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,580
That's what I was being in can we go back to our game develop another guy that's

215
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,380
a guy being on the street you should do oh that would be so awesome to a whole

216
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,860
series of guys peeing yeah I really really fucking like that and then and

217
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:36,700
then this is I think this is Pierce also peeing yes you're snorting like a pig

218
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:43,740
and then that's Cameron peeing don't stop not Cameron penis Cameron sitting in a

219
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:47,140
car get your hands out of your pants while you're showing these pictures.

220
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:53,100
Okay, okay, yeah, this is no this is Pierce. I think this is Pierce pooping. That

221
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,640
looks like a poop to me. Yeah, that does look like it's not enough of his body to

222
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,340
actually tell, but I bet he's right at the like the bar for old people and

223
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,700
handicapped people to sit down on the toilet. So yeah, he's about there. That

224
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:08,980
bar is also for sitting down if you want to do a trick shot. Definitely. From above

225
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,820
off the toilet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that's Neil. He's not peeing though. No, it's just

226
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Neil. Can you stop showing us photos? Can we get back to developing? Because I have a

227
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:22,020
game development. These photos got developed. First of all, Women Go was great. Yeah, I

228
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,880
would like to add to Women Go. Yeah, okay. So we were talking about you can take a picture

229
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,820
of a woman on the street, scan it in to become part of your team that they fight against

230
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,740
each other with Pokemon. Mud Wrestler. Yeah, that's one option. It depends on the gym you

231
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,380
go to okay but so do you remember there was that game that was I think for like I

232
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,100
don't remember if it was game GameCube or it might have been PlayStation it was

233
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,220
like Monster Rancher or something where you could put a CD in and it would uh it

234
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,300
would scan it and make a monster out of the like just did like metadata on the

235
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:56,020
CD like like

236
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,180
super not yeah that like Skylanders so it's like that or not where instead of

237
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,140
putting like a random CD that you own but you can get that like the credit

238
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,580
card reader for your phone, and if you swipe a woman's credit card on your

239
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:11,660
phone, it like puts her into your game. That's smart, because women are basically...

240
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,500
Because from the credit card bill, you can also basically devise all her

241
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,380
stats. Also, women are basically... yeah, they're basically... women are just

242
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,740
what they buy with their credit card, and then what they look like. So

243
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,500
we can get pretty much with the scanning technology, that is my idea, and the

244
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,900
credit card idea, that is your idea, we have an entire woman can be completely

245
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,540
digitized, and then Patrick basically hasn't worked on this at all and did

246
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,540
nothing yeah so that's who will be cutting them out of the property and I

247
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:43,620
think about this this better be a good feature the theme song is like it's a

248
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,700
game not a show that's football huh that's a football theme song now here's

249
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,660
another so I think that I think that what we can what we can do here I think

250
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,560
that the most the best part of this game is going to be the peripheral so you can

251
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,060
buy to connect to your phone that you can use to play it so we got we have

252
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:03,500
maybe a bit really big telescopic lens so you can attach to scan the women from a

253
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,900
distance and then of course the credit card reader and then maybe the top of

254
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,740
the line roller shaped like boobs that one's important to will definitely have

255
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,780
a control it's already a mobile game you come up with some actual good I have you

256
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,380
okay like no listen all plus like the pokeball plus for Pokemon goes at the

257
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,020
top of the line the the most expensive peripheral you can buy that we will sell

258
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:26,340
make a lot of money off of is a one is a really big 3d printer and after you've

259
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:31,000
scanned the women into the game you can print her and have your own version of her in real

260
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
life.

261
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
That's really smart.

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,100
Subclasses of woman.

263
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,100
That's really fucking smart.

264
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,660
That's just a thing in real life.

265
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
Electric type.

266
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,140
We can scan women on the street.

267
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,980
And also another thing we can do.

268
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,220
You can connect the duck hunt gun.

269
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,680
Yes, so you can shoot them.

270
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,900
Another thing you can do is we'll get a hula hoop and we'll surround it with iPhones and

271
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,100
and we'll walk up to women and be like hey, we're

272
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,660
we're from like a hula hoop youtube channel. You should and we do street

273
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,580
hula hoops. See how many hula you can hoop and then they'll actually just

274
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,260
scan themselves yeah by doing the hula. Well, you know you don't even really

275
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,020
need the who all honestly all you can do is excuse me. Would you take a selfie

276
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,100
of yourself? Yeah, most about most women say, guys, size power ups for the women

277
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,140
like diet coke

278
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:24,540
yeah yeah okay handbag handbag yeah and what would we throw what do you throw to

279
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:31,060
catch him you think a flasso Lou batons no just a lasso okay like a last idea a

280
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,580
lasso and now a butterfly net a pokeball yeah yeah any of that works well a rock

281
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:40,820
but we need well sometimes it'll be hard to catch one so then you can dangle

282
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:47,040
things in front of them like a $10 bill yeah yeah yeah we need also more

283
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,400
Starbucks gift card. I think peripherals are what's gonna sell this game.

284
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,240
Definitely diet coke is a thing that you can use as a power-up. Haptic gloves.

285
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,120
Haptic gloves. Haptic gloves are gonna be huge. Haptic shoes. Haptic shoes, haptic knee pads, and a haptic head.

286
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,000
Nose, nasal inserts so you can smell the women when they're on screen. A haptic like

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,880
like lip cover. It should be an entire haptic suit. And kiss all the parts of their bodies.

288
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,960
It's an entire haptic suit. It looks exactly like the still suit from Dune

289
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,840
that they wear when they go in the desert. Okay, you can feel the touch all over

290
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,640
your body and the the little tubes that go into your nose. They pipe in the musk

291
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,480
and the I don't even want to say what types of smells but I think we all know

292
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,680
crevice smells. Yeah, the smell of the crevice. Yeah, the crack gashel aroma, the

293
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:40,160
butt crack, a piped in poop, the pipe odor, odor, she I'm still thinking of the lures.

294
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,160
Here's how we make money on this. Shein Coupon. 30% off at Shein. What's Shein?

295
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,920
It's a website where women buy clothes for $3. That's funny Pat. I just held up my phone

296
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,160
with "woman go" and scanned you and it actually added you to my game. You must be a registered

297
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,840
woman. You know a lot about women and it seems like my phone is detecting you as one. I know

298
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:05,560
a lot about women. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, because you are a woman. Takes one to

299
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:11,000
no one when it comes to women that is I've watched that movie with Mel Gibson.

300
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,520
Oh my god and I'm rubbing your crotch on my phone and you're coming. You're

301
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,560
turning red and your eyes are rolling back into your head. That's coming from

302
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,240
his phone not Patrick by the way listeners. I think that another thing we

303
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,040
can do is okay and I'm exporting a gif of this and posting it to reddit. That's

304
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:36,080
it's going to be next level. The other thing that we could do is a way to make

305
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:41,160
money on it is it's a free app, but then for 99 cents it adds coins feet to the

306
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:46,080
well okay. No feet. They float around. They have like chopstick legs. Yeah,

307
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,520
like tentacle. Yeah, yeah, yeah, something disgusting. Not tentacles,

308
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,920
something because that's serving another audience. You have to pay even more for

309
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,320
that. I just think that the feet are going to be the thing. We rope everybody

310
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,560
It's like, have you guys used that Replica app?

311
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,560
No, what's that?

312
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,560
No, what's that?

313
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,840
It's like this thing where it makes a little person that you're supposed to talk to, a

314
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,840
little AI person.

315
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,840
Oh, it's like a chatbot thing?

316
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,200
Yeah, but it has like, there's like a 3D model.

317
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,360
So it's like Smarter Child, but it's got like legs and stuff?

318
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
It's not a child.

319
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
I don't, it's not a child.

320
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Do you remember?

321
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,360
No, no, no.

322
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,360
Smarter Child was a bot on AOL chat.

323
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,360
It's basically, what's their name?

324
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,360
No, Smarter Child.

325
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,360
Patrick Googled child chat.

326
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,360
Why are you going on child chat on AOL?

327
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,720
smarter children. Google child chat. Why are you going on child chat?

328
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,960
Looking for smart children on AOL. Get off of child chat. Looking for very precocious

329
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,800
smarter children. No I need a smarter child. What are the other apps? I think

330
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,240
you could talk to... But Replica if you say to the app you're like

331
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,360
because it'll just be like what what's the weather like how are you today and

332
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,160
if you say to the app like I want a nut in your mouth then it'll like read that

333
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,720
that intent no it'll say like yeah it'll say like you can tell me that if you pay

334
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,920
five dollars oh get the preamble yeah that's smart it's really smart that is

335
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,680
really smart I think we could have that really easily yeah I think most of the

336
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,840
money honestly is gonna be on peripherals mm-hmm I think that maybe

337
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:13,160
yeah we can also have maybe like like a power glove remember the power glove oh

338
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:18,280
you could talk to Austin powers we get an awesome powers and Austin powers I

339
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,080
I think if we could just download the like the API or whatever the fuck that

340
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,960
they'd use to have the Austin Powers AOL chat bot and Austin Powers can teach you

341
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:31,200
you can ask Austin Powers questions on how to pick up women. That's smart. That's

342
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,840
really smart. He could be like the Professor Oak of the game.

343
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,320
Yeah, Professor Powers. Yeah, we're gonna catch some women today with a big bug net.

344
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,680
match. Yes, you can pick one of your three starter women. Uh-huh. Yeah, and I'll tell

345
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:55,680
you Michelle Michelle on Quan the figure figure skater. Yep. And then no is that

346
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,880
and then also Akira. Uh-huh. And then a random woman from Facebook Jennifer

347
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:06,680
Aniston a Facebook woman. Yep, a Facebook woman with one mutual friend and it's

348
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:11,520
your mom, but I will tell you guys what one peripheral we won't have for woman

349
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,320
go and that's the freaking steering wheel. Okay, why why would we not have the men

350
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,880
play the game? Well, it's we just wouldn't have the steering wheel. It's

351
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,480
like as a it's a joke. I was telling no the men would play the game. So we would

352
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,960
have the steering wheel. I was a man. I was telling wheel so that the girls

353
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,000
don't drive the cars. Yeah, I know the girls don't drive the cars because

354
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,280
there's no steering wheel, but how they're who drives the car. Then it's

355
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,200
women go

356
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:41,440
already an app. I feel like I've heard of this before women go yeah woman.

357
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,560
it's definitely not. I haven't heard of it at all, even a little bit.

358
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,040
There's a screaming dying child upstairs.

359
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,800
There was, there was, they were going, the children here were dying all day

360
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
today.

361
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Whoa!

362
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
What the hell?

363
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
That was crazy.

364
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Patrick just did a fucking dude perfect.

365
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
That was nuts.

366
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Whoa!

367
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,800
I was moving, I guess I moved, tried to move my phone and a pencil just

368
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
slipped.

369
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
That was fucking awesome.

370
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,300
That was the craziest pencil flip I ever saw.

371
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,000
The pencil did a quadruple somersault midair.

372
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,840
- It didn't even break either.

373
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,720
- It was more than quadruple.

374
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,720
- I forgot how much of childhood is just running around

375
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:23,120
and screaming.

376
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,800
- Maybe for you, I was learning.

377
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,160
- 'Cause I keep hearing the people who live upstairs

378
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,480
screaming and running around and shit.

379
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,880
And it's just like, man, don't they ever get tired of it?

380
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:35,920
And it's like, no, you don't, you don't.

381
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,000
I remember when I was a kid, we were playing Star Wars

382
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,600
and uh... there's like the screaming like things in uh... jedi academy

383
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,680
and i was trying to mimic that

384
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,080
and uh... i just was in my grandma's backyard is screaming and she i think

385
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,280
you're not a little bit of a yeah i think that's housing i was you didn't

386
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,040
practice screams and i would like my imagination for stuff i was writing my

387
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,240
own magic treehouse book with a hangout with hitler

388
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,880
i was inventing video games back then to a

389
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,680
I was I made up dishes. Me and my friend created a game called Monster Attack.

390
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,080
Yeah. Yeah.

391
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,360
Tell you the coolest thing I ever did as a kid, I'll never forget it.

392
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,240
I made chocolate mousse.

393
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,800
I had a magic bullet. I made, my aunt got us, and I made chocolate mousse.

394
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,400
I did Tinker Toys.

395
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,080
I made it one time. I did, I did, uh...

396
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:25,920
There's this,

397
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,440
we'd have like buckets of, we had like a big like toy bin.

398
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,360
I was using Tinker Toys. And uh...

399
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,160
the the game that we would play

400
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,880
was that we would take all of them and then throw them all over the ground

401
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,800
uh... again then we play

402
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,720
uh... that up

403
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,680
as you know that i'm not gonna not put them back on my god and fifty-two

404
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,720
thirty-eight up

405
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,600
you know it's like a solid giant like rubber made thing of action figures just

406
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,960
all over the floor

407
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,280
and we would have a little is my preference

408
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,680
devilishly difficult solitaire game yeah

409
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,440
i was playing uh...

410
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,800
Mancala, oh I did actually play so much my college a fan as I loved Mancala and Chinese

411
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,820
That's the mancala is the it's got the rectangle board where it's two rows. Yeah, they're not quite marbles

412
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,880
They're flat. They're a little bit closer to a per a bit different. Yeah. Yeah

413
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,980
It's kind of like if you stepped on a marble and you are really strong and you had a hot foot

414
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:28,140
Yeah, so actually wrong. Yeah, like melted it a little bit. Yeah. I also did like mark had a little marble collection as a kid

415
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Oh my god, did you ever build a marble track?

416
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,500
You ever try to roll a marble get like a marble to roll a goldberg machine my dog

417
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:40,940
I had a rock collection, but it was like rocks that I found outside. It wasn't even like I had one of those two

418
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:42,620
I also had I had a dead bug

419
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,580
Little boys love collection like I wanted a collection so bad

420
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,340
I had I had a sick dead bug collection my dad and then I told my dad that and he was like

421
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,780
Well, I have a coin collection brings out these two huge binders full of coins

422
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,260
None of them was worth a single fucking dollar. I yeah, they were just shit

423
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,740
I had my mom got me this thing where it was like a board where it was the map of

424
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,260
the US and it had like quarter shaped holes for every state and you're

425
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:08,060
supposed to like collect every state. Oh yeah I know that. Yeah and I think I got

426
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:11,740
to like like probably like 20 or 30 different states and then I just like

427
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:15,420
took them all out and like bought a DVD. Yeah that's smart. It just helps you save

428
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,340
up money. Yeah yeah. There's this realization I was like oh my god that's

429
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:25,020
like six dollars right there. It's free money. There's this like '04 Red Sox' like pin

430
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,220
collection thing that you could get and it was like pins of like each of the

431
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,660
players and like a like a headshot of them like their number and their

432
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:35,940
position. I'd like to do a headshot to the Boston Red Sox players. Whoa watch it.

433
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,340
That's right. Watch it. You're a bald ass bitch. What the fuck are you talking about?

434
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:44,040
You are kind of acting like a bald ass bitch. Okay. I normally wouldn't call you that.

435
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,020
Boston should be wiped off the face of the planet. You are a bitch.

436
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,180
You're a bitch. You're a white bitch. These two brothers tried and they couldn't do it.

437
00:22:53,180 --> 00:23:00,460
Yep, that they were heroes. They were failures. They were trying to destroy the worst country. Yeah, your heroes are complete failures

438
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,620
You can get the whole set for $6. I want to do the Civil War again

439
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,520
Yeah, it was the Boston the Boston Globe me want to start the Civil War again just for Boston

440
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,940
I want South versus you want to be it on the side of the

441
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,100
Yeah in the second Civil War that had nothing to do with the first one. It's called that you get like picture like pokey Reese

442
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,980
You're I'm gonna make me side with with Caleb. Yeah, don't put your phone down here comes the Civil War

443
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,420
It's coming right now

444
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,500
You don't want to go have these on this with me

445
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,380
I want to cut the country in half Z's and do civil war between the two halves ease I

446
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,980
Don't I don't I don't even know what you're what would be look at that

447
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:42,420
It's David Ortiz right there if a new civil war we could share a David Ortiz pin together

448
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:48,020
You guys

449
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:54,140
I might have a better he's talking about bullshit. I know I know so shut up fuck

450
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:59,500
you I did already bitch-ass civil war where's the dividing line I think it

451
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:04,780
might be East versus West yeah and it might be a rap well and we can cut out

452
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,700
all the middle stuff that's the battlefield yeah it's the East Coast

453
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:14,660
versus LA versus New York and the entire middle is about is just squish the whole

454
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,420
whole country horizontally. So the east is touching the east coast is touching

455
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,660
the west coast and just kind of like there's a border there yeah, yeah, it's

456
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:25,700
just a but well yeah, because they maybe we could it can go down and become like

457
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:30,580
a bottomless chasm and kind of like fold in you know what I mean yeah, yeah, yeah

458
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:33,940
and then really tall and become like a wall and then the earth kind of becomes

459
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,340
like an egg shape. That would be cool and we also get rid of Mexico by doing that

460
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,220
wait. How would the earth become an egg shape? Like we're all that awesome.

461
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,480
get out of some fire. I think there's no longer room the earth would actually be

462
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,720
more of an M shape. I think I don't think so well because we're making the seam

463
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,560
like this is actually it'd be more like a like a teardrop almost right a

464
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,440
teardrop right connecting both ends of the earth we take two longitudinal lines

465
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,840
and then we'd delete the middle so that it would be like almost like a sharp top

466
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,320
like this I don't understand what this round part at the bottom means though

467
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,520
What round wire is it? Why are the two ends touching at the top?

468
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,760
What do you mean two ends? That's like if you looked at a side profile of the world. Yeah like this

469
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,820
Let me slide like a line give me this here a side profile. We look exactly like this. No

470
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:28,220
No, you're thinking of two we're getting rid of too many things here. Okay, so we take the world like this, right?

471
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:34,040
That's not what the world looks like. Okay, fuck you. We take the world and then we take these longitudinal lines, right?

472
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,520
right? And then we get rid of those, right? So now the world looks a little more, it's

473
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,440
like not as wide, you know? It's like that almost.

474
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,240
Here, so this is what the world looks like side profile.

475
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
It doesn't look, oh.

476
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,600
And then we'd be getting rid of this and it would maybe look like this or like this if

477
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,800
we push it into the ground.

478
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Maybe look like it.

479
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
Are you saying the world is flat?

480
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
No.

481
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,300
you're not saying the world is flat. You're saying a side profile of it just

482
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:11,820
looks like a line. It just looks flat. It just looks flat. It's not flat, but it

483
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,520
does look flat. Yeah. I think that's a good idea. Yeah, I think that's what if

484
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,760
there's one part of the world to get rid of. I want to be involved in a civil war

485
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,820
or a war, but I wanted to be civil because I don't want the people to be

486
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,760
like I don't want to feel bad about killing other people. I think the next

487
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,740
civil war could involve robots in a cool way. Because if we do a civil war, then

488
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,340
and it's everybody's just like also a fucking dumb American guy. So I'm like

489
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:40,140
it's fine. I just kill you Americans versus robots. That's smart because then

490
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,740
we don't give we don't care and also the robot we should build a robot army just

491
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,040
for us to defeat and they're not very good at fighting either. Yeah. Yeah,

492
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,240
maybe they're not even robots that would actually be really genius. Wouldn't

493
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Boston have an advantage there because of their dynamics

494
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,040
because of the Boston.

495
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:59,540
Those are my those might as well be Roombas. Those are completely useless.

496
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,700
don't they make Roomba? I don't know do they do that I think Roomba makes Roomba.

497
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:12,980
Does Roomba stand for room bot? No it's a robotic operating awesome

498
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:20,180
managerial my big my big ass. I don't think I think it's my big apartment.

499
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:25,740
Oh right because it cleans your big apartment. Yeah. Robotic operated awesome my big

500
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,940
apartment. I think it's short for room bat. It's like a bat that flies around your house.

501
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:35,340
It does zoom a little too fast for me. My mom got a Roomba.

502
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:43,740
Oh no, iRobot makes Roomba. Yeah, my mom got a Roomba and it's very funny to see a dog interact

503
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:50,220
with a Roomba. It's like funny every time forever. She's had that Roomba for probably like two years.

504
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,780
It's like a knockoff Roomba and every single time that it like starts to move around,

505
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:00,060
my dog just freaks out and goes crazy. Yeah, Phil's been doing this thing where

506
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,060
we any time we buy him a new like crate or like something like that that has a

507
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:07,580
picture of a dog on the box. He start he thinks the dog is a real dog. He starts

508
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:13,260
barking at it. Nice just a pace. The dog's this big like it's the it's three

509
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:21,100
inches tall image of a pit bull. Yeah, it's so we're smart. If you can see that

510
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,540
on, I think he's not so smart. I think it's good. I feel like most dogs would be

511
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:30,180
we wouldn't be able to see a picture of a dog right. What isn't can't they like not

512
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,920
see stuff

513
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,540
fill? I have very all the time. I feel like most dogs don't can't see stuff on

514
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,440
TV does watch. He just watches TV anytime it's on. He'll watch watches

515
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,140
gemstone. He loves girls. Girls is his favorite show yeah yeah, because

516
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,500
honestly here's the truth about Phil. When he was a kid, he looked like Lena

517
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,020
don't know there was a kid when he was a little baby. There was like three or

518
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:53,220
four days in a row. We first got him where like the only people we saw on the

519
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:57,460
were really big fat women and they would like give him they'd like give him

520
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,400
attention and he just loved them and so now every time we walk by a fat woman on

521
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:08,740
the street he just starts like right to her like she's targeting them and trying

522
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,940
to get them to pet him and then also on girls he loves Lena Dunham yeah yeah

523
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,660
whenever there's a fat woman on TV he loses mind you should show him Big

524
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:20,460
Mama's House I think that he would love that no he'd like that a lot I think Big

525
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:24,620
Big Mama's House and Madea would probably confuse him a lot.

526
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,700
It's important to challenge him.

527
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
He just loves big women.

528
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,740
Because there's scenes, well I guess Madea wouldn't confuse him, but there's scenes in

529
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,840
Big Mama's House where Martin Lawrence is halfway in the suit and then there's scenes

530
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,640
where he's like not in the suit.

531
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,340
He just sniffs them out for me.

532
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,900
He sniffs out Big Mama?

533
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:46,580
He sniffs out big ole women on the street.

534
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:50,580
I think I think he need to let me walk.

535
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,080
Come on, Phil. Go boy.

536
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,280
Come on.

537
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,180
Come on, Phil.

538
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,380
He's doing the pointer thing.

539
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:02,280
He is like a pointing.

540
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,380
It's like a heat-seeking missile, but he only goes to Torrid.

541
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:05,980
Yeah.

542
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:14,580
Yeah, just him giving him like a bloodhound just like

543
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:23,480
39 waist jeggings. It's been like go get them, Phil. Sniff out these. Go find these from somebody.

544
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,680
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, maybe he thinks they're a ball and he's trying to fetch them.

545
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,240
I don't think so. I think he just really likes -- and fat women are -- I mean just fat people

546
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,280
are generally more jovial.

547
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,280
More jolly.

548
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,680
Not in the summer. They're fucking falling over.

549
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Yeah.

550
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
In the summer, it's horrible.

551
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,000
- I mean, we see so few huge fat people here,

552
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
and the other day I saw giant, ginormous humongouses,

553
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,320
and he was walking down the street,

554
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,440
and he was like, it was hot, but he was barely moving,

555
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,400
and he was having the worst day of his life.

556
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,760
Just big old Heather Grace T-shirt,

557
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,960
just sweating right through it.

558
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,520
And then he did the thing where he folds up his shirt

559
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,480
just over his belly, so just his belly's out.

560
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,320
- That's a sick move.

561
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,160
- That is a sick move.

562
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,400
- I do that at home,

563
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,600
My living room is so hot.

564
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,440
- Yeah.

565
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,060
- My living room, it's just my apartment is shit.

566
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,900
I hate living in my house.

567
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,100
If anyone wants to give me a big mansion.

568
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,640
- I don't think many places, many people do that.

569
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,960
It's not very common.

570
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,680
- If anyone wants to sell me a mansion for like,

571
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,520
maybe I can live in a mansion for--

572
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,600
- How much would you be willing to pay?

573
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,980
- 720 a month.

574
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,860
- In New York City?

575
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,720
- Yes.

576
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,360
- You're not willing to move?

577
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,200
- No.

578
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,960
- We could move to Texas and live like fucking kings.

579
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,800
- I know, I think about that so much.

580
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,600
that so much. I don't want to leave the East Coast though. But what if we were in

581
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,560
Texas and we could maybe have like... We could literally have a mansion. We could

582
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,120
have a huge mansion. We could buy a mansion. That us three just lived in. And

583
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,600
we can get rid of the girls. Yeah. We could just ditch them. That's right. Get out of here.

584
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,800
Get rid of all the distractions. Yeah. We could actually be cowboys. My girlfriend has a

585
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,960
house. A hundred percent we can live there. She's got her own place. Yeah exactly.

586
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,440
So but we'll just go to Texas do a cowboy style man. Oh my god week. It could be we call it

587
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,720
In a pinball we could call it. I can just how but we can call it the Cowboy Palace and we could dress like Cowboy Princess

588
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,880
Oh my crown. Oh my god. We could be happy to be like a mixture of royalty

589
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,560
Meet the new Royals. They are like how meet the royal

590
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:33,700
Cowboys who are taking the left wing by storm. What if we don't like okay, so

591
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:42,640
of the variety. The three cowboy prince's. The three cowboy prince's podcasters of Texas

592
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,880
who are actually saying that Bernie Sanders isn't far left enough. Wow. Yeah. That sounds

593
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,680
like an amazing headline. And it's us three, we're grabbing our nuts doing the middle finger,

594
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:57,640
also chewing tobacco. And we're holding a 3D printed rifle in each hand. Yeah. And we're

595
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,400
scalping people. I need to be a cowboy prince. We need to scalp people. Yeah. Holy shit.

596
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:07,040
Well, you think about it like how cheap it is for it to live in Texas. I bet it's even

597
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,480
cheaper to live somewhere like I don't know like

598
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,360
Ohio

599
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,080
Myanmar we can move to Myanmar. That's a really good idea

600
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:26,340
Aleppo Aleppo the Congo Aleppo dude walk around Aleppo Aleppo's you just do it's awesome. You do fucking battlefield bad company

601
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,580
Explosion physics on everything you just knock it down buildings and shit plus

602
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,340
They plus they got a whole pepper named after and we could literally we could move to Syria and us three could become

603
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:42,680
Cannibal serial killers and nobody would know we can literally just kill people all day eat their

604
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:50,060
Better making Syria a little more social

605
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:55,420
These three American cowboy princes are

606
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
doing some crazy fucked up shit.

607
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:02,420
Are eating right wing children's bones in Syria.

608
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:05,420
Okay guys, I have like crazy news.

609
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,420
Yeah.

610
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,860
I just googled something because we're talking about starting a palace, becoming cowboy prince

611
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
cannibals.

612
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
Yeah, no shit.

613
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:16,340
And you know we could move to a city, we could move to a place.

614
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,340
But that's like we're going, we need our own place, right?

615
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,020
And this I just googled this here.

616
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,660
Prices can range and I'll just read you the full sentence prices can range for

617
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:33,460
approximately US 1 to 3 million dollars for smaller islands.

618
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,460
Holy shit.

619
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,960
One million dollar island?

620
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,460
A million dollar we all know.

621
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,620
When you get an island you start doing weird shit.

622
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,140
Well we want to do we would only want to we would not do weird shit we would

623
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:47,140
dress like cowboys eat flesh and have royal ceremonies.

624
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,500
We want to eat people.

625
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
I want to kill people.

626
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,100
Yeah but that's not weird.

627
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,300
- Okay, well then whatever your definition of weird is,

628
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,140
here's what I want, okay?

629
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,120
- Weird is like sex.

630
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:59,100
- I wanna kill people, I wanna eat their bodies,

631
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,700
and I wanna have a 4K TV.

632
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,540
- Okay.

633
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,420
- And that's basically the islands done,

634
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,260
that's all I want.

635
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,340
- You can do that in Texas.

636
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,660
- Dude, it's less than a million dollars.

637
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,500
- A million?

638
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,340
- $475,000.

639
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,180
- What's that?

640
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,740
Like, we just save up podcast money for like 10 years.

641
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,580

689
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,120

696
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160

697
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,160

00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Alright, you don't.

702
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160

703
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,240
This white boy don't even want seasoning on this person.

704
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240

707
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,680
Yeah.

708
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
We're starting, it's our own thing.

709
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
I don't have to, if anyone makes fun of me for-

710
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,680
It's our own thing, he's not even going to want to use the seasoning on the island.

711
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,960
- If anybody makes fun of me for not seasoning my flesh,

712
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,800
I will eat them.

713
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,620
- I would like to start a human factory farm on the island

714
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,440
where we have a constant nonstop flow of people

715
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,280
that will eat Perry Perry poor butt.

716
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,440
- That fits perfectly into the cowboy theme too,

717
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,820
because we can be cowboys and lasso the people

718
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,280
and lead them into the--

719
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,680
- Yeah, no, we just eat Perry Perry poor person butt.

720
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,280
- Also, we teach them how to--

721
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,120
- Like Nando's.

722
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,240
- We teach them how to call for help

723
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:39,480
and dial 911 and shit,

724
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,180
just to make it kinda like fun.

725
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,760
- It could be, yeah, it's like that,

726
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,720
what's that Yorgos Lanthimos movie

727
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,320
where they teach everyone the opposite?

728
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,200
Where they teach the kids-- - Invention of lying?

729
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
- Invention of lying.

730
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,980
- Where they have like, it's like,

731
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,820
look at this fucked up family.

732
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,680
- No, it's not Yorgos Lanthimos, it's Ricky Gervais.

733
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,760
- Gervais.

734
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,120
They teach-- - That is,

735
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,780
that could have been a Yorgos Lanthimos movie.

736
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,620
- Yeah.

737
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,480
- That, like, if it was made by him,

738
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,880
it would have made a little sense, you know?

739
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,720
Like, that's the kind of premise he would come up with.

740
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,800
I don't think I've seen, I've never seen The Invention of Lying.

741
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,520
It's fucking on Opposite Day.

742
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,280

00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,120
The sequel?

746
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,240
The Invention of Opposite Day is a way, let's start writing that right now.

773
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,720
says Bloody Sunday because he's British and he's being insensitive towards Bloody Sunday.

774
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:11,000
And then he goes to the store and he goes up to the counter and he says he buys a bunch

775
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000

776
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
He buys a bunch of junk food.

And the cashier is Fieldy the bassist for Korn?

778

784
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:49,700
people's head explode no no no that's the plot twist yeah yeah there's a

785
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,500
at first you think it's just because they didn't want to pay for to like for the

786
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,700
cameo for that long.

787
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,500
They just want like a 10 second cameo but and and at the you're like oh it's a

788
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:03,000
funny like meta thing yeah but then at the end of the movie so I mean we'll go

789
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,300
through the whole movie or whatever but the end the police bust down the door

790
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,000
and they say Ricky the dentist you're under arrest for not exploding people's

791
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,400
heads but by that point by that point that's right when opposite day drops

792
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,500
when that's when you realize it's been opposite.

793
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,260
- Yeah. - I always thought it'd be great

794
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,500
to do a rom-com movie where it's just a normal rom-com

795
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,100
and then at the end the guy gets arrested

796
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,700
'cause he has multiple personalities

797
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:28,300
and he's killed over 100 people.

798
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,540
(laughing)

799
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,020
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

800
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,060
- That would be a good idea. - Like Ryan Gosling,

801
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:36,980
Jennifer Aniston, he's her little more older boss,

802
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:39,740
he's, or she's his older boss,

803
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,740
he's kind of like down on his luck, like tax guy.

804
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:45,420
They have to work together for a little bit.

805
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,380
They fall in love over, they go,

806
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:51,340
First they hate each other, but they have to do a work meeting, a working lunch they say.

807
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,740
They go to a sushi bar that has the conveyor belt.

808
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,900
They're picking things off, they're flirting.

809
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,380
He puts chopsticks in his mouth and says he's a walrus.

810
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,380
Can I suggest something?

811
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:07,820
Instead of a sushi place with a conveyor belt, they go to a sushi place where it's a nude

812
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:08,820
woman covered in...

813
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,820
They eat off the...

814
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,820
Yes, because we want the sex appeal.

815
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,820
It's a nude woman...

816
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:14,980
And also it's kind of foreshadowing, like this isn't a normal rom-com.

817
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,300
wouldn't normally have nibbles and a close-up of a pussy shot with rice on it.

818
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,940
But this is gonna be a completely different type of movie. It's like a full, like

819
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,340
there's two chopsticks. That's where he gets chopsticks from, it's the woman's vagina.

820
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,940
Yeah, she shoots it out. Yeah, it's like you know when you go to a restaurant and

821
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:37,580
they have the cup for forks and napkins and stuff. At the nude sushi place it's...

822
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:41,380
And her mouth is full of napkins. Yeah, it's because that's how they... I don't know,

823
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:45,460
it's a weird place and they were seeing that movie something wild that's kind of

824
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:50,220
like that I don't know something wild it's like a rom-com and then Ray Liotta

825
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:54,380
plays like the woman's like ex who comes in just like tries to kill them at the

826
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:58,340
end it's cool it's really cool it's sick I was thinking it would be more like but

827
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,300
like yeah he's the maybe that's it yeah well maybe you could do like a sequel

828
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,860
cuz what's his name Jeff Daniels is the guy in that so maybe he could that's the

829
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,260
plot twist is the one down to Georgia or no Jeff fucking what's his name what do

830
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,020
you thinking you're gonna Charlie Daniels no yeah Jeff Daniels yeah no I'm thinking

831
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:18,180
a devil went down to Georgia yet by Charlie Daniels the devil went down to

832
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:23,020
Georgia he was looking for a soul of steel that song by Jeff Dan I miss cover

833
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,700
that has a claymation music that's not for me primus literally has a big song

834
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,260
called my name is but they just don't make mud no it's my name is but his name

835
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:40,220
is mud my name is but you're from your miss her hearing it my name is but you

836
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:44,060
don't know anything about fucking awesome metal but basically they would he would

837
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,860
he would go down on one knee to propose at the end uh-huh and immediately

838
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:53,740
personality yeah and he starts twitching and going actually I don't want to get

839
00:44:53,740 --> 00:45:01,740
married and then he starts and then he would try to kill her and then he'd get

840
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,260
arrested yeah get the death penalty there's a last shot is him getting

841
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,740
electric chair executed and he says I love you and then he says wait no I

842
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,680
i switch back to my first personality again and i'm actually in love with my

843
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,540
girlfriend

844
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,280
double-double propose you to go

845
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:20,040
to stop the execution he's actually a good version of himself for at the

846
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,700
moment because electricity cured him

847
00:45:22,700 --> 00:45:26,400
and then can you switch his personality to discuss now kill him actually

848
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,600
actually you should kill him i'd like to highlight that he's i'd like that he's

849
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:34,060
nice and he's dying and i'd like to have a nice way to express how he's evil

850
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,440
yeah and she's still able to select

851
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,560
weight don't kill him cuz he's evil and i like evil people and i don't think

852
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,540
evil people to be killed, they need to let him out to kill more people.

853
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,260
Yes. And the cops listen because that's his girlfriend. And he's like, no, you should kill me

854
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,820
because she doesn't want you to kill me so that will make her upset because I'm

855
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,340
evil and I want her to be upset. You are so good at writing movies. And then maybe like...

856
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:54,740
You took my idea and just ran with it so well. And then maybe she switches

857
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:58,300
personality. She's like, I'm a firefighter now, I have to go fight fires. And then

858
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:01,660
the dog, they have a dog together, the dog's name is Bunsen, and he switches

859
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:04,940
personality into a cat and he starts acting like a cat and he's drinking milk

860
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,780
look out of a little bowl yeah and he's like this could all fall under the

861
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,140
opposite day umbrella - and then we zoom out and it's actually just a guy playing

862
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,100
the Sims all the Sims that the guy and then he switches personalities and he

863
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:25,100
kills all the sims yeah and I'm gonna delete my save file I'm completely

864
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,060
deleting my save and then you can't watch the movie ever again yep and then

865
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:32,140
we zoom out actually a movie and it's Donald Trump and he's sitting in a

866
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,920
in an empty theater by himself right? He says "you're fired" "this is my favorite

867
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:41,780
movie" "you're fired" "I loved how crazy it was" "it was completely unexpected" "it was entirely

868
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:45,040
unexpected" "I didn't know he was gonna switch personalities" and then it's another twist

869
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,400
he's like "I think this movie just inspired me I think I might have to run

870
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,320
for president" and that's the beginning of the Trump campaign. And that's the most evil movie ever. And then we zoom out and it's

871
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,920
Hitler and he wakes up from a dream but he says "this is my favorite dream I've ever had"

872
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,580
- Yep, he says that's his favorite dream ever,

873
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,420
he wants it to happen again.

874
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,260
- I'm going to do a Nazi thing.

875
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,680
- But then it's another dream.

876
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,140
It's the pizza monster from the episode of Jimmy Neutron,

877
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:09,740
and he's waking up from his dream,

878
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,660
and he says, and then his wife says,

879
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:14,640
"Go back to bed, honey, you know kids aren't real."

880
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,480
- Whoa.

881
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:18,480
- 'Cause it's just that same scene from Jimmy Neutron.

882
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:21,900
- And then it zooms out again, okay,

883
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:24,560
and it's the guy from the rom-com, the original guy,

884
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,080
it's all a dream he was having.

885
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:26,920
- Yes.

886
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,320
- And then, and then, and you're like,

887
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,580
oh, it's all a dream, none of it actually happens and then he wakes up and he and

888
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,920
his wife wakes up. She like here's a wake up. She wakes up to and she turns and

889
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,340
was like wasn't all that stuff that happened to us yesterday crazy and

890
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,200
yeah, where you and he was like yeah, I just dreamed about it all in a row,

891
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,120
yes, and then what do we hear by not done done on that whole thing was a

892
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:51,300
Simpsons couch gag. Wow, oh my God, sitting on the Simpsons episode, the

893
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:55,920
rest of the episode plays yeah and the end of that it's his dream. He dreams

894
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,740
Homer was dreaming it. Yeah, this is all just so fucking good. This is going to be

895
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,840
fucking and the movie is the movie ever is called Homer's dream. Yeah, and it's

896
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,340
actually yeah, it's called Homer's dream because that's because you're like

897
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,740
how you're kind of waiting. You're watching that and you're like you're

898
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,440
like, oh my God. I know there's going to be a plot twist that makes this Homer's

899
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:17,040
dream and all the other you're like you kind of know it's going to happen.

900
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,340
Fuck is this going to be but it's like a seven hour movie because it's so by the

901
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,140
end you kind of forgot it was called that and then when it finally shows Homer

902
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:26,060
dreaming it. It's like oh, Homer's dream.

903
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:30,380
It's not like ambiguous as to who the Homer is. Homer is on the cover.

904
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,380
He's on the poster.

905
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,380
He has a pink donut and he's dreaming.

906
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:35,580
It's the exact same poster as the Simpsons movie.

907
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:38,980
Oh my God, he has a donut shaped pillow.

908
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:39,980
Yes.

909
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:40,980
Yeah.

910
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,100
And then, oh, when he wakes up from his dream, he's thinking of what happened in the movie

911
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:46,100
and he goes, "Mmm, sushi."

912
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,100
Because he had, because he ate sushi.

913
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,180
Yeah, that proves that it was all the, yeah.

914
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,180
That's so good.

915
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:52,980
and then he goes crazy personality changer.

916
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:57,780
Yes, yes, and then he's like Donald Trump.

917
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,980
Yeah, and then he's working and then he's right back to his

918
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,080
radioactive job. You got the kids that fucking don't respect

919
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:09,280
him at all and then he mutates into the romcom guy. Yep. Yeah.

920
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,980
Oh my and then it's a closed loop right. Let's loop. Yeah.

921
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,080
Well, I just heard that movie Marge, you know, in March takes

922
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,600
powder her hair and she has bunny ears yeah she takes off the bunny ears under

923
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,400
that she's the woman from the time travel movie which one

924
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,760
or prime prime or not powder powder about the white kid yeah I mean I made a

925
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,480
movie about a white kid yeah it's a movie powder is a movie directed by a

926
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:41,200
pedophile about a white kid same guy did Jeepers Creepers I think Victor Salva

927
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:45,720
yeah he also made a movie which I never saw this movie I'm mad that he made it

928
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,720
because it sounds like the best movie ever, but it's called Clown House and

929
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,720
it's about a haunted house that's filled with clowns. That sounds sick! That

930
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,720
sounds so good, but apparently that's the movie where he like made it like to

931
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,720
abuse boys. Oh, that's not very good. He like made it to film naked little boys.

932
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:05,220
That's not very good. Yeah, so I didn't watch that movie, but I feel like I would

933
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:09,220
like someone to remake Clown House and take out the kind of pedophiles stuff.

934
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,720
Isn't that the one- You won't even watch it? Just watch it. I mean, I don't really-

935
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:18,040
There was there's somebody that fought really fucking hard for that guy to still work in Hollywood

936
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:24,200
I probably a lot of people know I think it was Patrick for Francis Ford Coppola who gives a fuck. He's awesome

937
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,800
Yeah, I know he made

938
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,300
Yeah

939
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:33,560
Victor self is probably the funniest pedophile to fight like the guy who made Jeepers Creeper like at least fight for like Polanski the funniest

940
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,560
But the funniest pedophile yeah

941
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:40,520
Yeah, like like incredible. Yeah, Victor Salva made a movie about a green guy. Yeah

942
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,520
yeah and a movie called "Cloud House"

943
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,520
A movie about a white kid, an albino

944
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,520
oh he's albino

945
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,520
I don't think he's albino, I think that the

946
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,520
thing about that movie is that

947
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,520
it's a Disney movie too, "Powder"

948
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,520
and I think that it's

949
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,520
he falls from the sky and he's completely

950
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,520
stone white

951
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,520
white as a stone

952
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:02,520
white as a white stone

953
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,520
he was as blue as a blue stone

954
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,520
I do think we have a list to get to

955
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,520
right?

956
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,680
Let's do it. Come on. We got 10 minutes. Why would even do the list? But I'm looking at

957
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:16,360
I'm reading about clown house. All right, tell me about clown house. Casey.

958
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:23,800
A list of plot elements from clown house. That's just one thing that the guy from Boondock Saints

959
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:30,280
is the guy in powder. The white kid. Wow. That's crazy. Here's the plot of Irish and white. Here's

960
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:35,160
the plot of clown house. Casey is an adolescent boy whose life is constantly influenced by his

961
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,000
his intense fear of clowns. His two older brothers, Jeffrey and Randy, are

962
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,840
mostly disobliging. I don't know what that means one night. The three boys are

963
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,800
left alone, so they decide to visit a local circus. Despite Casey's

964
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,720
uncontrolled, I'm reading Patrick. What does it say?

965
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:57,600
He looks good, despite Casey's uncontrollable colrophobia, that's fear

966
00:51:57,600 --> 00:52:01,200
of clowns. Okay, well, at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune

967
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,040
teller and she reveals to him that his life has been cut short.

968
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,780
that his lifeline has been cut short. Meanwhile, three psychotic mental

969
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:11,720

- But he's just fat.

1023
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:07,640
Why does he have to be white too?

1024
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:10,040
Well, you gotta specify his race.

1065
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:52,560
- It's on, it's like around Avenue A, right?

1066
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:54,280
It's like in the Lower East Side.

1067
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,680

1069
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:00,080
It's not around Avenue, no, it's near like Union Square.

00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:02,240
- Where'd you guys, how'd you meet her?

1071

- We were eating the same Sour Patch Kids.

1072
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:06,520
- Not the same flavor, the same kid.

1073
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,040
- It's like a big one.

1074
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,800
It was like an eating contest.

1075
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,840
- You did an eating contest with Lori Beth Denberg.

1076
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,320

1078
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:16,420

1079
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,260

1080
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,080
- Yeah.

1081
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,840
I shook her hand, I said, "Good game."

1082
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,800
- And that's how you met?

1083
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,640
- Yeah.

1084
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,160

1085
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,080
- Yes.

1086
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,080
- From eating a patch.

1087
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,640
- Once you meet her, you'll get it.

1088
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,720
- Would I even be invited?

1089
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,720
- And then Katrina Johnson.

1090
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,560
- What's that?

1091
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:34,960
- From all that.

1092
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:35,800
- Oh, uh.

1093
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,600
She did a Ross, she was a little kid who did a Ross Perot impression.

1094
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:39,600
It was very cool.

1095
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,000
K-list friend ever.

1096
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,360
So I call my coolest friend ever.

1097
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,360
What's his name?

1098
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,360
Patrick.

1099
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,840
He's your K-list friend ever?

1100
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
Yeah.

1101
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
Not Caleb?

1102
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,840
Oh, I forgot.

1103
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
That my name is Caleb?

1104
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,840
No, Caleb Landry Jones also would say he's one of my K-list friends ever.

1105
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:57,880
Alright, be straight up with me.

1106
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,400
Where am I on both of your lists?

1107
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:00,400
Tell me.

1108
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,760
I think you're probably after Danny Tamberelli.

1109
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,480
Which is what spot?

1110
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:08,320
That's 10, but I don't know where.

1111
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,480
So I'm just after 10, you don't know where I am?

1112
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,480
Yeah.

1113
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,480
Because you haven't ranked that far.

1114
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:14,860
Where am I on your list, Cam?

1115
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,840
You're probably right after Sydney Sweeney.

1116
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:21,360
I will say you're definitely after Nick Cannon.

1117
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,360
I would hope so.

1118
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,360
If you know Nick Cannon, I don't even know you fucking--

1119
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,360
But--

1120
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:29,480
You know how big that would be for a podcast, to get Nick Cannon on the show?

1121
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:36,880
definitely before Mark Saul. I don't even know who that is. You're

1122
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,300
before Mark Zuckerberg for me. Yeah he's not cool. Yeah but he's I mean you're

1123
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:46,420
you're like one above him. I'm one above Mark Zuckerberg on the list of
