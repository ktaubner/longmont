00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,400
- He got new pants.

17
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,360
- These are not new pants.

18
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,720
I've had these for a while.

19
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,560
- He got new pants.

20
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,380
- I don't.

21
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,840
- Why are you paying so much attention to which pants are new?

22
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,280
- Why are you ever looking at the bottom half

23
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,360
of another man's body?

00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,940

35
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,660
I don't want to do this because I haven't peed in five days.

36
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,660
Something's wrong.

37
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,460
Yeah, something is wrong.

38
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,780
Yeah, I'm sick.

39
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,340
I've just been squirting water out of my ass and it's been bypassing my penis.

40
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,340
It's the craziest feeling.

41
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:16,820
I've not felt the joy of having something come out of my penis in five days.

42
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,980
Well, the joy of a lot of things going into his penis though.

43
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:20,980
No, nothing is going.

44
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,980
He's sounding.

45
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,860
Although, I've noticed my penis has gotten smaller with no pee coming out of it.

46
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,700
- Yeah.

47
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,960
(laughing)

48
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,800
- I'm not kidding.

49
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,740
- You'd think it would be bigger

50
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,300
because the pee would fill it up.

51
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,240
- No pee has been coming out of my penis

52
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,100
and it's getting really small.

53
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,260
(laughing)

54
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,100
I'm serious.

55
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,100
- Dude, you're developing a second butthole.

56
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,100
- I think it, I don't think it's that.

57
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,020
- I think his penis is going in.

58
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,660
- I think your penis might go in and become a second butt.

59
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,260
- No, 'cause nothing's coming out of it.

60
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,580
Stuff comes out of your butthole.

61
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,580
- Well, yeah, but it comes out of one of your buttholes.

62
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,780
- My penis is getting small because there's no,

63
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,620
there's no peas pushing power through it.

64
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:02,180
- It's like one of those sponge grow toys.

65
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,180
- Yeah, it needs to stimulate the cells.

66
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,380
You need to stimulate it to make it grow.

67
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,020
- Yeah, you need to just lay flat on your floor

68
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,460
with your penis in a cup of water.

69
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,540
- Oh, that's a good idea.

70
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,340
I need to keep my penis in the shower.

71
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,580
- You let it grow like a caterpillar.

72
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,320
- Have you been covering it with a shower cap

73
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,300
when you shower?

74
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:30,460
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's your issue. Not really. You're not watering it. Like one of those

75
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:35,740
things is chefs. One of those finger condoms they put on when you cut yourself. Who?

00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,860
Chefs. Why are you saying it like that? I think you're talking about our friend. No.

00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,140
No. Not. No. Like chefs and uh. Chefs. What? Stop. Stop saying it with a V. What do you

- That's our friend's name.

87
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,940
- Prove it linguistically. - You're confusing me.

88
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,940
I keep thinking you're talking about our friend,

89
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,020
and I keep thinking you're saying

90
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,700
that she wears little finger condoms.

91
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,220
- You keep bringing it up like you're bragging

92
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,700
that you know stuff, friend, chef.

93
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,100
Like, yeah, this is my friend's name!

94
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,100

95
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,340
- You are. - I was genuinely confused

99
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:17,340
the uh-huh one fish. Him and his son in the truck once they're going cross country. Once his son

100
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,340
- And so he becomes a chef?

101
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,180
- Uh-huh.

102
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,020
- Oh my God.

"and I'm going cross-country."

109
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,540
- That's right.

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:32,380
- "To tour colleges."

111
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,220
- Who would be--

112
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,020

113
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,860

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,140
I thought a news story was cool,

128
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:32,140
was when Jamal Khashoggi got chopped into Khashoggi tartare.

129
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,100
That was cool as fuck.

130
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,860
'Cause it was like, they chopped him up into pieces.

131
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,900
It was, there was probably a saw involved.

132
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,860
That's cool.

133
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,100
But Russia going into-- they kill every single living thing

134
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,740
in Ukraine, I don't give a fuck.

135
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:47,300
What is this?

136
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,860

Turn the TV off.

139
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,340
This is bad, dude.

140
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,380
This is really bad.

141
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,740
I don't know where the remote is.

142
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,740
How is it that just a picture that

143
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:00,300
changes every 15 seconds can just ruin an episode?

144
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,620
Because you will just--

145
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,020
look, it just munches.

146
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,740
Just a screensaver.

147
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,580
It's not even like we're not doing anything.

148
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,860
I have not broken eye contact with this fucking television since it went on screensaver mode.

149
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,860
Turn it off.

150
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,340
I have to, we have to, where is the remote?

151
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,340
Just unplug it.

152
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,780
Don't unplug it because you could unplug the wifi.

153
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
Okay well then turn it off.

154
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,980
Just go, you have to go under and feel around.

155
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,700
Okay you're making me do this?

156
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
You don't have to do it.

157
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
For you?

158
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
I have to do this.

159
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
You don't have to do it.

160
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
It's under.

161
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,700

175
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:31,940
He doesn't need to suck the truckies off. I don't know which side you're supposed to be on.

176
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
I don't give a shit about it.

177
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,380
Truckers are lazy, it's the easiest job in the world.

178
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,380
Oh, I have to sit!

179
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:44,380
I have to sit in my car and do all this free crystal meth.

180
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,380
It's sad.

181
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,380
It's an easier version of being an Uber Eats driver.

182
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:52,380
Yeah. Oh no, I have to see every gas station in America.

183
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:54,380
Oh no. I have to go on a beautiful journey.

184
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:58,380
Oh no, I can't have a family.

185
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,380
Oh, I get to go to stay in the cool parking lot at the gas station that you're not allowed to stay in.

186
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,540
I get to visit every motel and I get to shower with all the other truckers.

187
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,780
Yeah, me and my friends suck each other off and get sucked by each other off.

188
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,580
Oh, and my car, it so stinks in my car that there's seriously a bunk bed in there.

189
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,780
We have bunk beds.

190
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,980
Oh no, it's so...

191
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,780
I have to drive a car with thousands of cool things in the back.

192
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:28,380
Oh, I have to drive a car that if it crashes, it kills everybody except me.

193
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,580
Oh my God, my life sucks so bad.

194
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,580
Oh, I have to work for Walmart.

195
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:37,180
Oh, and I have to bring things to my favorite store, Walmart.

196
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:40,580
And get this, I have to stay awake for 16 hours.

197
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,180
16 whole hours.

198
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,580
Fuck you, you fucker.

199
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:46,780
They want a better, and they want better conditions.

200
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,980
I heard they want faster trucks.

201
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:51,580
They want a truck that goes...

202
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,980
They want faster trucks.

203
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,980
They want faster trucks.

204
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,480
Meanwhile, they get all the fucking Arby's that they want whenever they want.

205
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,180
Yeah.

206
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,180
They can stop at...

207
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,780
They do just get unlimited fast food.

208
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,180
Yeah.

209
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,700
I heard they were there. They're protesting because they want a DVD

210
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,580
player and you know what the trucks well that's it. That's the real job of

211
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:14,020
these truckers want to watch cranky. I want to drive. Yeah, they're real job

212
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:17,060
of trying because they want it. They want to play plug and play pac-man.

213
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:22,660
The real job of trucking is watching movies on your phone. Yeah, that is

214
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,060
the actual job. That is where you're getting paid. We are gathered here

215
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,380
because we want to play the whole Atari collection. A semi truck. A semi

216
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,860
truck is so heavy it basically drives itself we want to play most Jax

217
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,420
Pacific's games in our cars while we're going 500 miles an hour I'm glad the

218
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:48,380
trucks to be faster I'm glad we're finally covering the truck there's

219
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,100

220
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:59,500

222
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:14,540

223
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,860
Colbert a yeah yeah which everyone Colbert cries over we got to see what

224
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,220
what what John Oliver's gonna say yeah he's clearly big really you're doing

225
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:29,220
this right now you're doing this right now why can't you do that yeah why can't

226
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,140
you do that instead you're doing this that's right you shouldn't do this

227
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:39,060
that is better that is a better thing to do talk to him John I heard John Oliver

228
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:45,860
is gonna do a is gonna do an episode where he's wearing cat eye contacts

229
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:52,860
look at my funny eyes I heard he's gonna do that to try and scare Russia so they stop the fading increase

230
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:58,540
Putin I want you to look at this Putin I want to say one thing to you

231
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,220
Yeah he puts his hand over his eyes and then just goes like...

232
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:13,180
Then there's a video of Putin like just giving a speech two days later he's like "the cat

233
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:19,540
was not that scary to me, the cat was only a little bit scary."

234
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,140
I think John Oliver would be the scariest late night host to have cat eyes.

235
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,140
Yeah.

236
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,140
Cause he opens his eyes really big.

237
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,140
Cause he looks like a mouse.

238
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,140
Yeah true.

239
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:33,540
mouse with cat's eyes yeah the whole house it's that was in end times yeah I

240
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,620
want to kick him in the ass and make him fly like Team Rocket yeah John Oliver

247
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:09,860
you didn't build that you did not apply for a loan because you didn't know what

248
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,420
it meant you didn't build that debt that debt's not yours we did that we are

249
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,420
imposing heavy sanctions on cat eye contact for all UK immigrants.

250
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:28,420
That's a reminder for John Oliver's terrifying episode last night.

251
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:35,380
John Oliver just doing like increasingly like specific things about like how like he can't

252
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,620
get the shit that he wants in his life because of sanctions.

253
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,620
And why, why can I-

254
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,420
Why do condoms start at medium?

255
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:47,100
Why can't I get the Chalupa shell made fresh?

256
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:51,900
I ask them to make it fresh when I go to Taco Bell and they're never fresh.

257
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,900
They come out soggy.

258
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,380
This is your warning Taco Bell.

259
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,820
I'll be making a visit with my cat eyes.

260
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,980
I'm going to the Taco Bell on Myrtle Wycombe.

261
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,980
That's the bad one.

262
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,940
That one's good.

263
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
Is that the good one?

264
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,940
No, I'm not Myrtle Broadway.

265
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,300
I don't know what you're talking about.

266
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
Nobody knows what the fuck you're talking about right now.

267
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Three people do and that's who I do this for.

268
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,180
I'll tell you what was the bomb ass Taco Bell back in the dizzy.

269
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,420
The one on Old Yonder in Wilmington, North Carolina.

270
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,420
You know what the worst one?

271
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,420
Remember the one on School Street?

272
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,420
Yeah.

273
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,420
That was maybe the worst Taco Bell I've ever heard.

274
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,420
That was the worst Taco Bell I've ever heard.

275
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,420
Worst place in the world.

276
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,420
Yeah, literally the worst one.

277
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,420
I never got to see it, man.

278
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,420
I was just inboxed.

279
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,420
You're lucky, dude.

280
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,420
That place sucked.

281
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,760
It literally would take an hour to get your food every time no matter how big.

282
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,440
You could be the only person in there.

283
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,800
And they'd look at you and just like...

284
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Yeah.

285
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Are you waiting for something?

286
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Are you waiting for something?

287
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
Yeah.

288
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Yeah.

289
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,960
We've got to take them down a notch.

290
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
People that I am imposing...

291
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
Someone has to go in there with cat eyes.

292
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:56,120
I am imposing heavy economic sanctions on Taco Bell.

293
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,040
I will only be eating there once a week instead of every single day.

294
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,360
Hey, Russia, listen up.

295
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,960
I will be imposing heavy economic sanctions on you if you ruin Christmas this year.

296
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
Yep.

297
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,000
So you better be done by then.

298
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,120
You sort all this shit out before Christmas.

299
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,840
Or I will stop buying t-shirts from your online store.

300
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm cancelling my fucking fake taxi subscription tomorrow, big guy.

301
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
It's over.

302
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,360
Did you see the, um, it was like, there was a Patreon made for the Ukrainian army?

303
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,600
Oh yeah, I did see that.

304
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Who the fuck, how fucking stupid are you to donate to that?

305
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,400
I think we should add a fighter plane tier to our Patreon.

306
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Yeah, you can buy a fighter plane for our military.

307
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,640
(laughing)

308
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,280
- We should just start a military.

309
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,120
- We should just--

310
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
- Can we start a military?

311
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,640
- Yeah, we should just kill everybody in the whole world.

312
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,720
- That's our new thing.

313
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,840
- We should just become--

314
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,920
- Starting a military.

315
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,120
- Murdering lunatics.

316
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,040
- That's what we're doing.

317
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,360
- We should become murderers.

318
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,960
- Starting a second Patreon for a podcast

319
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,480
about this military.

320
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,120
(laughing)

321
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,080
- Yep, and you get to, what is it?

322
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,600
- You don't get any of the episodes.

323
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,440
- Yeah, no episodes.

324
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
- This is strictly for our military.

325
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,880
- This is just to support the troops.

326
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,720
- Yeah.

327
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,920
You can become a troop if you pay $100 a month.

328
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,440
No, we're the only troops. We just want a lot of weapons.

329
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,040
Yeah, but we have to get an arsenal.

330
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:13,540
Yeah.

331
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,040
Yeah.

332
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,720
Yeah, but for $100 a month you can like, I don't know, like...

333
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,440
$100 a month, that's one bullet.

334
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,560
I think there might be a giant block falling down.

335
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,240
Whoa, you just got an eviction notice.

336
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,740
I did?

337
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,900
I don't know.

338
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,040
I don't know about that.

339
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:30,540
Oh.

340
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,740
What is it?

341
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,880
the management company will no longer be the our management company

342
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,000
that's a little bit of a good

343
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,160
the

344
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,080
the

345
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,120

346
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,680

347
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,960
the

348
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,160
that i think you really get a big deal

349
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,760
yeah well of course you have been too loud

350
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:58,360
we've heard about your plans to start a military

351
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:05,360
We will be imposing heavy economic sanctions on your apartment if you do not desist.

352
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,360
I'm moving in like two or three days.

353
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,360

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,360
Two to three days.

356
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,360
That's a lot of days.

357
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,360
Two to three.

358
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:22,360

359
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,040
Don't read my new lease.

360
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
That's not mine.

361
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
That's Neil's so you can't read it.

362
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,260
mine you could read it but it's Neil so you can't read it put it down it has his

363
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,320

364
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,120
Neil! I read it! I memorized the entire thing. Neil's actually gonna walk out.

365
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,960
I know he's actually gonna walk out. You fucked everything up. I messed up.

366
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:50,240
You fucker. You ruined it. You ruined the episode. We were on a good roll about what? Sanctions, military, cat eyes.

367
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,920
We wanted to become a new military. Yeah so $1 tier that's the cat eyes tier

368
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,520
because that's a psychological...

369
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,120
Oh yeah, we need cat eyes to scare...

370
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,520
And then we're also going to have those, you know,

371
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,720
Aztec death whistles, you ever seen those?

372
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
No.

373
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,820
You're the only one who knows that.

374
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:06,720
Okay, well it's really...

375
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,120
You need an Aztec breath mental right now.

376
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

377
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Yeah!

378
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
I'm going to show...

379
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,320
I'm going to play you guys the noise of an Aztec death whistle.

380
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,920
Our military will have a thousand of these.

381
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:20,120
It's just a slide whistle.

382
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
It sounds...

383
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
Aztec...

384
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,220
it sounds like a person screaming

385
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
obscene

386
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:36,220
uh...

387
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:43,020

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,460
yet

391
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,380
Those are more powerful than guns I think in today's battle. There's actually nothing more

392
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,860
powerful than guns except love. Damn maybe we should start a love military.

393
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,380
That's the that's okay so that's what we frame it as. The world's first love yeah that's

394
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,020
what we say it is. It's the podcast about list love military. We do param we

395
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,900
paratroop into the Ukraine into Kiev and we make love to everyone.

396
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:22,140
With big heart parachutes. Yeah. Go down in big hearts parachutes. Meanwhile.

for five years we're gonna win some of those people are gonna be pretty annoying

400
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:56,100
We leave immediately just like a small like smaller parachutes with AIDS test

401
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:03,860
through the city. It's a pretty good idea. We don't say it's that, we just say it's

402
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,620
it's poison cum. Yeah. So no one gets mad. The love army. There's nothing funny about it.

426
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,900
- We can't do anything.

427
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,620

428
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,340

- No, just look at me.

431
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,780
I'm just telling you a fact here.

432
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,140
When AIDS cases were on the rise

433
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,460
before they knew what it was,

434
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,140
the newspapers were calling it gay cancer.

435
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,220
- Yeah, I know that's sad.

436
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,780
- Yeah, it's really sad.

437
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,740
- That's really sad that they called it.

438
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,780
- It's really sad what they called it.

439
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,260
- It's not gonna work now.

440
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,780
What's not gonna work?

441
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,260
The staring thing is not gonna work now.

442
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:59,580
I'm not staring at you, I'm trying to inform you about something you showed a flagrant

443
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,580
disrespect for.

444
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,580
Are you talking about you have a corona?

445
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,580
No.

446
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
Caleb has COVID and he's in my house.

447
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,580
Oh, COVID's funny?

448
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
Yeah.

449
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,580
You know how many people die from COVID?

450
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,580
Zero.

451
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,580
Because it's not real, big guy.

452
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,580
Okay.

453
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,580
It's a fake disease.

454
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,940
And there's nothing funny about that.

455
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Yeah.

456
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,300
And tell you what, a lot of those people I meet are the ones that made it work.

457
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
What is it?

458
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,300
It's norovirus?

459
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,300
Yeah, that's the stomach flu.

460
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,300
Well, is that contagious?

461
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,660
Is that contagious? I don't want you like, because I'm just thinking about it now.

462
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,020
I haven't had the fever in a while.

463
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:24,580
Okay.

464
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:29,940
Yeah, I'm fine. I just have some residual diarrhea because I was on a diet of Pepto-Bismol only.

465
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,820
Oh, dude, it's so crazy. It's so crazy when you like, your poops after Pepto.

466
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:39,220
Especially if it's all you've been having, because I just was pooping

467
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,980
the water that I was drinking mixed with the Pepto, and it was just a,

468
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,620
there was like a black like mask of my...

469
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,900
What?

470
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,820
Why were you mixing it with water?

471
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,700
No, I was in my stomach, you fucking moron.

472
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,100
I was drinking water.

473
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,860
No, the way you said that made it sound like you were making like,

474
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,460
it sounded like you were making a Pepto cocktail.

475
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,460
Not to me.

476
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,220
What kind of cocktail would that be?

477
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,940
Water and Pepto, just be watered down, would that be so great?

478
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
That's not even that weird.

479
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,420
No, I thought you were like putting it in a water bottle.

480
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,060
I'm like Jager bombing it in water and chugging it.

481
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,500
Be cool, it's not a bad idea.

482
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,340
Actually, because I mean, sometimes it tastes too chalky.

483
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,740
literally looked like a foot like it looked like an oil spill in my bed my

484

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,980
- Do Zolo, like a, I don't know how to say the full name,

509
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,160
but it's like the hairless dog.

510
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,000
They look like demons.

511
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,980
- Oh yeah.

512
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,340
- And Lycoi cats, dude.

513
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,180
- Oh, and uh.

514
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,220
- Lycoi cats just look like werewolves.

515
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,780
- Yeah, Sasquatches.

516
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,980
- Yeah, I wouldn't believe it.

517
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,820
- And a Wampa.

518
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,700
and then see ya know

519
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,540
yeah the crate dragon definitely

520
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,160
you're seeing a great drag a rank or yet you know

521
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,220
uh... well they will this is the only great like i'm sorry i don't know

522
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,820
rancor rancor you can see a lot of our industry

523
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,660
mhm

524
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,740
but you can see there's there's a lot of like an evil egg with an eye

525
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:35,620
there's a lot of rancor in the i'm going to your also the uh...

526
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,580
the ipod monkey

527
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,580
Yeah, yeah, the pizza rat

528
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:47,620
Wouldn't believe it. It's crazy when you like you can only see an iPod monkey if there's like one color of a big

529
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:51,620
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's a big one. Yep

530
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:56,660
Stuart little sewer little I'd a chair sitting Jesus

531
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,460
cheese this chair sitting Jesus

532
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:03,780
Believed it

533
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,780
I have a yeah before I started sitting on a chair and this yeah and cheesing

534
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,780
yeah, no, that's a chair sitting cheeser. Yeah, do the cheeser the cheesing is is

535
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,980
way a cheesest a cheesing and a cheeser three different animals. They're all

536
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,280
part of like the same kind of family, though it's like a hamster versus like a

537
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,500
mouse versus actually yeah,

538
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:28,660
fight. They do fight. If you put a cheeser and a cheesing in the same,

539
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:35,880
one's whoever wins becomes the animal. Yeah, whoever won, well that again. Whoever won to

540
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:43,320
become the animal. We're doing new linguistics. Yeah. Caleb American Vernacular English.

541
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:52,600
Okay. What do you think of that? No. I don't know. I don't know if that's going to catch on.

542
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,480
I think it might catch on. What about the breast bug? Have you ever seen one of those?

543
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:01,560
I've seen a breast bug. I have to go.

544
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:11,240
The breasted bug. It's a bug that's just like as big like double d's and it can't walk.

545
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:21,080
It's like two huge human tits. On a horn beetle. Like a bug this big.

546
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,480
For many breasted bugs they spend most of their lives stationary.

547
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,960
It never, it never, yeah, it never moves.

548
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
The lifespan of a breasted bug is one day.

549
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,080
(laughter)

550
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,900
As it cannot move to find food.

551
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,480
Their eggs are the size of human boobs.

552
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,840
Their eggs are, sorry I got distracted for a moment.

553
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,080
(laughter)

554
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,280
Yeah.

555
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,440
A breasted bug.

556
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:51,560
That's what the ladybug should be.

557
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,400
Yeah.

558
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,080
They was talking, back when I was in bug school,

559
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,560
they were talking all this shit about ladybugs being beautiful. Ladybugs are

560
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:05,600
fucking stupid. They're ugly. Ladybugs go into your house in the spring if it gets

561
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:13,320
too warm and they get and they they and they say you're people like when they

562
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:16,400
claw and you'll find them on your pillow and women don't like it when you kill

563
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:22,560
them yeah that is a red fly they literally have they have ten targets on

564
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:28,200
them. Exactly. They're designed to be killed. They have a perfect pattern for a

565
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,960
bird shot. Yep. If humans were one inch tall we'd be hunting those MFs.

566
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,280
That's right. That's right. I wish I was one inch tall and could hunt bugs. My

567
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,000
weapon would be a toothpick. I'd probably use a rifle but you can use a toothpick

568
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,800
if you want. Yeah well you're not you're not respecting the tiny. Of course not I'm

569
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,200
blowing them to smithereens. No, I'm not saying you're not respecting the tiny world. You're

570
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,600
shrinking a rifle down the field. Of course not. I'm scouring them. You're already violating

571
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,600
God's natural laws. No, you get shrunken down by accident and then have to survive. I'm

572
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,960
born one inch tall and I've learned to coexist with the bugs and then I turn on them and

573
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,160
I kill them after they don't suspect me. In those movies when everyone gets all small

574
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,400
is shit. Honey I Shrunk the Kids. Just in any movie of the genre. Yeah. They always try to...

575
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:26,400
No there's tons of smallie guys movies. Downsizing. They don't fight a bug in downsizing. No I'm not getting to that.

576
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,640
No let me finish my goddamn point. Anytime they try to get the attention of somebody

577
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,640
they never can.

578
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,640
(laughter)

579
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,640
(laughter)

580
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
(laughter)

581
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,640
(laughter)

582
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
(laughter)

583
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
(laughter)

584
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,640
(laughter)

585
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,640
(laughter)

586
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
(laughter)

587
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,640
(laughter)

588
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
(laughter)

589
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
(laughter)

590
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
(laughter)

591
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,440
saw a person that big like I don't I don't if I see something running like

592
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,600
that I'm not like checking to see if we're an inch tall. I think that's

593
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,720
usually bigger than people are in those movies. Okay, but if that runs on

594
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,840
the right desk, let's see I'm slapping it honey. I shrunk the kids. I mean

595
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,680
they're pretty small now. I think about it. Yeah, they're definitely smaller

596
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,360
than an inch. Yeah. Well, yeah, they ride a inch and they ride an ant but

597
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,000
it could have been a bull ant. Oh, what a bull ant live in California. It's

598
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,720
a bull ant they might have bull ants they're a cow ant maybe could have been

599
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:38,080
either one I think they never if ever if ever get noticed hardly if ever and

600
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,160
that's that's a real to me that's something that I would like them to put

601
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,920
in the movies is it noticed at the end of get noticed they get noticed at the

602
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,640
end of honey I shrunk the kids never saw that movie you stupid ass never seen any

603
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,360
of those movies. If they really wanted to get noticed, they should like set a fire

604
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,600
or something. That's a really good point. You'll know about Reza Alinsky. But think

605
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,520
about how big a fire is to a small thing. Well you'd set a small fire

606
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,280
because that would make smoke. You should see the sequel. You can't make a fire small

607
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,200
enough to make smoke without it being huge. It's like a candle-sized fire. Yeah,

608
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,280
but you don't like you don't have to like sit on it or anything. A candle-sized fire would be a

609
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,280
serious 9/11. If you're an inch tall, no. No, no, if you're real. Oh, so we're changing it

610
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,380
now yeah we are changing it because I re I re I re okay I would set that I would

611
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,280
carry a match the match is long enough that you would be fine if you if you

612
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,320
held it out hmm I would well what if you shrank down what if it was like an

613
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:41,200
ant-man situation where you shrink down like that and you still have a molecular

614
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,920
level you know you shrink something interesting you shrink down to that size

615
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:49,420
but you also have like the same like you can still like like a map nothing over

616
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,900
And then you can get noticed in like one second.

617
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:54,900
You know it's something, you said people never get noticed.

618
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,660
How we do it?

619
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:01,100
People never get noticed in small movies, but something interesting I realized is in

620
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,260
movies when people go giant, they almost always get noticed immediately.

621
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,820
That's a really good one.

622
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,160
They explore that in Honey I Blew Up the Kid.

623
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,460
You never have a scene in a movie where someone's like, "Look!

624
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,020
I'm over here!

625
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,620
I'm right here!"

626
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,380
Honey, do you hear something?

627
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,100
No, I think it's just a normal beast.

628
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:22,700
i think it's a bit i think it's that tall guy i think it's a leg tree that must be

629
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:25,740
so i don't know what michael craig

630
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:30,340
my great must be outside i think that that giant leg and foot have always been

631
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:34,260
there any and you know i had a minute was and now that i think about it i would

632
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,100
say movies where the characters become normal size they're noticed about half

633
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,540
the time

634
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,260
but often not by the one they want to be noticed at least at the beginning

635
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,060
group who at least the beginning

636
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,940
there's so many movies are people are normal size and they're just trying to

637
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:52,380
find love yeah if they were small it might be harder and if they were big it

638
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,580
would be easier mm-hmm it's a lot easier to find love if you're

639
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:01,820
giantly sized yeah because there's one line for you slicedly yeah she's in New

640
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:06,820
York well yeah well if you're giant size every lady and however many mile radius

641
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,300
can see you he's so tall and at least one of them's gonna think that you're

642
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,300
beautiful or handsome yep if you're so this guy barely one lady will ever see

643
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:22,140
you that's and it might be your mom dude that's the thing about I'm trying to

644
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:26,500
relax that noise so loud you ever see the you ever see Louis CK when he's on

645
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,980
stage he relaxes you know doing a Louis CK you can say that yeah not the first

646
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:38,460
time the thing is if they if Godzilla was a real person right and if especially if

647
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:45,620
he was a good-looking guy if he was that big the reality is Oh every woman in the

648
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:50,540
world would be lining up to fucking suckle on his cock. Definitely. I mean look at

649
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,100
Robert Wadlow. You know why? Because they go, "Oh he's so tall." He was the closest thing we had to Godzilla.

650
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:00,140
These whores love tall guys. Mm-hmm. And a lot of times they leave some average-sized

651
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:04,260
men right in the dust. That's true. That's what I'm saying. Normal size, notice half

652
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,660
the time. It's a sliding scale. It's a perfect equation. And

653
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:12,220
that's just, you know, modern romance. But then if we...

654
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,360
- We can solve all this with a love army.

655
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:18,580
- Yeah, but what if it was a guy that was so big

656
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,740
that the entire universe was just a molecule on his body?

657
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,580
Right?

658
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,420
- Everyone loved him.

659
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,860
- But nobody, but get that, nobody's noticing that guy.

660
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:30,420
- But think about to him, but to him,

661
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,380
all the people in the molecule are so small,

662
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,580
they'll never get noticed, so it doesn't matter.

663
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,580
- But everybody, I mean.

664
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,700
- This is called, this is a new branch of science

665
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:45,100
called noticeology, where we study people of different sizes being noticed by.

666
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,500
Yeah, it's true. Think about it. You're at a-

667
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Have you noticed a person who's 6'1" almost never notices someone who's 5'9"?

668
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,500
It's true. TED Talk.

669
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,500
With somebody who's that big.

670
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
With TED Talk we're just listing heights and being like, "This height notices-

671
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,500
5'9" to 5'6", that's noticeable.

672
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,500
About 77% of the time.

673
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,500
Have you ever been to a concert and there's a tall guy there and he's blocking your view.

674
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:12,800
you you noticed him. Have you ever noticed a very small dwarf at a

675
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,040
concert? I didn't think so, but I guarantee you this he noticed you

676
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:24,140
and he's following you and he's going excuse me, excuse me, excuse me,

677
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:27,400
because that's how they sound.

678
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,960
That's the

679
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:36,100
and behind is another dwarf yeah one it's shorter. Little does he know

680
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,040
- There's an even smaller dwarf.

681
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,480
An elf who lives in a tree.

682
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,880
- They say a Russian nesting doll

683
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,680
never notices the one inside of it.

684
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,520
- It's true.

685
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,560
- It's true.

686
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,160
- Especially when they're inside.

687
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,620
Do women even notice their pregnant babies?

688
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,640
- No.

689
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,000
- Their pregnant babies.

690
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,440
Do they even notice them?

691
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,400
- They don't recognize their pregnant babies

692
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,400
which causes them to drink and smoke all day long.

693
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,240
- That's right.

694
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,040
research I've done is due to my size women almost never notice when I'm

695
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:17,720
inside. That's right. I'm one inch tall. If I were a bit bigger. Maybe if I was a bit bigger.

696
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:24,280
Maybe if I was a bit less of a dwarf and a bit more of a Godzilla. I love TED

697
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,840
Talks man. Yeah. They're all called like the fucking how I learned how I

698
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:36,800
I learned to use my car for good and it's a 50 minute video of a really old lady

699
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,360
just saying nothing and then there's and then five years later it's like how my

700
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,880
car was actually wrong yeah she has the correction TED talk yeah there's a there's

701
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,080
a TED talk Rodney Mullen did where he's all he does is like they're supposed to

702
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,960
like have him on to talk about like how like innovative and like thinking out

703
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,600
like it was like you know clearly one of these things or it's like they got like

704
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:05,920
a guest speaker Rodney Mullen and all he does is just show them tricks on his

705
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,200
skateboard and talks about how he invented like the kickflip and

706
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,000
everything. He talks about like the physics of it but then like like the

707
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,560
whole like thing is like pop an ollie and innovate and it's like he's clearly

708
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,880
like reading off his hands. He's just like yeah he's like yeah you know I

709
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,600
kicked my I kicked my foot into the pocket here and then and then the board

710
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,280
the board flipped and that's the whole TED talk. That's what every TED talk is.

711
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,560
I mean do you think that that TED talk might be why skaters have such a

712
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:40,440
reputation for being pieces of fucking stupid dog shit? I think that TED talk

713
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:44,600
might have forever ruined skateboarders reputation in the in academic circles. At

714
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:49,560
least we can rest assured that if it wasn't him ruining it

715
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,200
probably a different dumbass skater would have done it the next day or the

716
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:58,340
next day so it's like it's it was inevitable yeah we just got it out of the

717
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:03,920
way but like they got they had BAM scheduled yeah I don't want to do this

718
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,840
gay shit anymore yeah he's like trying to he's trying to skate he's just falling

719
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:15,280
over the whole time he's been doing good I can't talk shit you can fully talk

720
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:22,200
shit about BAM Argera I legit can't you can no he's been doing great with what

721
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,360
skating again. His new language, didn't you see his new language? Segillium. Yeah.

722
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:34,360
The Plan B logo was a two. That was the number two. And the Powell logo was number

723
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:38,520
one. Mm-hmm. And the heartagram. That's not so yeah, he's doing great. That was an A.

724
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,880
Yeah. How is that, how many skate board logos, is there one for every single letter? Just the

725
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,440
numbers were skate logos and then all the the letters were sigils. Mystical

726
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,640
- So it's not a language, it's an alphabet.

727
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,400
- Yeah, he made a new alphabet and said it was a language.

728
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,600
- Okay, that's pretty cool, that's what I used to do.

729
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,100
- Yeah, me too.

730
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,160
I did that a lot.

731
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,000
- Yeah.

732
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,820
- Yeah.

733
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:02,660
- I never did that.

734
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,500
- No?

735
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:04,320
- Did that a ton.

736
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,400
- I was pretty much into, what's that shit called?

737
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,360
- Linguistics?

738
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,200
- Codeology.

739
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,040
- Codeology.

740
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,320
- Codeology.

741
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,160
- Yeah.

742
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,920
- Codeology, and it's where you learn how to sweep

743
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,080
your bangs over your, as a male,

744
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,040
you get like a little Bieber haircut.

745
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,880
- Yeah, I did that.

746
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,480
I knew one kid named Cody who looked like that.

747
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,080
- I used to straight iron my hair.

748
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,920
- Fuck you, Cody.

749
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,360
- I probably wear my heads like this now.

750
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,200
I used to fucking--

751
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,340
- You used to straight, oh no way,

752
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,280
you were one of those kids?

753
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,640
- Bro, I was way cooler than you when I was 11.

754
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,680
- Oh, dude.

755
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:33,480
- You were probably some gap pussy.

756
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,320
- Nah. - Me?

757
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,320
Dude, I was--

758
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,680
- I wore bootleg Hollister

759
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,240
'cause my mom shopped at Goodwill.

760
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,800
- Yeah, yeah.

761
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,800
- I got made fun of once

762
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,600
'cause I was wearing a fake Abercrombie shirt.

763
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:44,440
- Sick.

764
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,080
- And someone was like, "Oh, that's not real!"

765
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:51,520
I was like I'm literally like so fat I don't care.

766
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,000
Like I just don't give like look at me. I look poor as shit already.

767
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I had this one hoodie that I wore for like six years when I was a kid

768
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,480
and yeah I remember it was like I dressed like it was like a cartoon like

769
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,100
I had an outfit that I wore every single day.

770
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:14,320
- Dressed up exactly like Chris Griffin every day.

771
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,360
- I did look like Chris Griffin.

772
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,200
I looked like Chris Griffin with brown hair.

773
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,080
Actually, I dyed my hair blonde at one point.

774
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,240
- Dude, that'd be so funny if one day,

775
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,560
one of us pulls up dressed exactly like Chris Griffin.

776
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,440
- I don't think you'd even notice, Chris.

777
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,760
- I'm just thinking about it.

778
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,600
- The thing is about--

779
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,280
- Just for like a week, one of us is dressed up

780
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
Exactly like Chris.

781
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,500
No one's mentioning it. It's just like the thing is Meg kind of has a fire fit. Oh, yeah

782
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,040
Peter's fits kind of tight. I'm into Brian. I don't I'm into yeah torso. I'm into Brian's fit

783
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:53,000
Yeah, nude if you show up in a collar

784
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,840
I'm doing a citizen's arrest on you. Fur too? Uh-huh. You wish you had fur. I wish I had fur.

785
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,360
There was one time. I

786
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,960
think I was like

787
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,440
I don't know if I was like I think I was getting dressed to like go to like a

788
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,320
wedding or something and then realized I was dressed exactly like Peter Griffin.

789
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:21,720
I think I sent you that photo. I was dressed like a white shirt and green pants and like I

790
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:29,040
looked in the mirror and I was just like oh fuck. No! Oh fuck. Ah shit. Yeah hey Loish.

791
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:36,040
I'm dressed exactly, you won't believe this, I'm dressed exactly like Peter Griffin.

792
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:43,880
Going to like a wedding or something, dressed exactly like Peter Griffin, just walking up

793
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:51,520
to people and like, "Hey, three guesses who I'm dressed up like."

794
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,960
It's so funny to be like a person dressing up like a Family Guy character and not realizing

795
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,960
it.

796
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,580
so fucking funny like especially Chris Griffin cuz that outfit like yeah a lot

797
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,700
of people probably dress like that yeah a lot of people dress like Chris Griffin

798
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:14,780
mm-hmm hat that's a staple of the that's a Chris Griffin staple hat fat

800
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,220
red stripes that's crazy I have no mental image of what he's wearing

801
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,420
I know exactly what I'm picturing Chris Griffin perfectly in my head right now.

802
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,500
I can imagine him getting pulled through the milk aisle into cartoon land but that's it.

803
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,100
I can't imagine what he's wearing.

804
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:39,340
Family Guy or Simpsons better fits.

805
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,340
Um.

806
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:44,220
Isn't Homer and Peter wearing the same shit?

807
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,220
Pretty much.

808
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,220
Well, well, Peter's pants are green.

809
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,220

Um.

814
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,220

introducing 15 new cavemen characters that will live in the town you do I

830
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,420
can't help it I have stomach I know that's gonna smell so bad no my farts

831
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:41,260
to smell like nothing. My poop has smelled like just the ground. Yeah. Yeah. When you

832
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:46,940
get sick sometimes your poop starts to smell like earth. My thing is everything, my poops

833
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:53,940
are so fucked up usually. Are you sure this wouldn't be Cam? Dolph? No, see that's the

834
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:59,820
gap. You'd have to work into that. I think that's you. That would be me but I don't think

835
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,820
I have a hair line strong enough to...

836
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,820
That's you except for the hair.

837
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,820
He's got a comb over.

838
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,820
You could comb that thing over.

839
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,820
Would I be Nelson?

840
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,820
Oh, you actually could be Nelson.

841
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,820
You could be Nelson, but Nelson's a little bit younger than the other bones.

842
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,820
Yeah.

843
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:19,820
Damn. Would I have to be Nelson?

844
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,820
No, you could be the other guy.

845
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,820
If we're switching characters, then I am Bart.

846
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,820
What is it?

847
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,820
Dolph Starbeam.

848
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,340
Coolest fucking name I've ever heard.

849
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,940
Well, Nelson's real name is Mandela.

850
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:33,100
That ain't true.

851
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:33,820
Yeah, it is.

852
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:34,320
Really?

853
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:34,820
Yeah.

854
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:35,740
Whoa.

855
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:37,860
That's cool.

856
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,500
All right.

857
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,740
You're Ralph.

858
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:40,240
OK.

859
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:40,740
Yeah.

860
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,660
Just decided.

861
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,180
I'm Ralph.

862
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,500
Just decided, because you know--

863
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,980
And I'm Mr. Burns.

864
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,480
Yeah.

865
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,740
Wait, wouldn't it be Martin?

866
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,620
He's the nerd.

867
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,780
No, but you know stupid stuff, so you're Ralph.

868
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,540
Yeah, you're Ralph.

869
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,060
That's true.

870
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:51,540
Oh, wait.

871
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,980
You're Martin.

872
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:53,500
No.

873
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:54,020
And I'm Bart.

874
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,180
I'm Jimbo.

875
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:55,940
He's Milhouse.

876
00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:57,060
I'm pretty much Bart.

877
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:03,220
I'm not millhouse your millhouse and your Marge and I'm playing with my boobs

878
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:08,900
you're the dog yeah the dog Santa's little helper yeah yeah little little

879
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:13,620
little dog yeah I'm a greyhound and I'm fast wait isn't he Santa's little helper

880
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:19,980
- no yeah get a second yeah or no it's snowball - snowball - yeah snowballs the

881
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:25,020
cat yeah okay yeah yeah this - yeah I wonder if in in countries where they

882
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:29,100
don't have Christmas they have to change Santa's little helper's name to little

883
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:35,340
little helper dog. Probably whatever the deity of that country is. Probably they'd have to do that.

884
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:42,740
Because they wouldn't understand. Santa's little helper. Yeah, that's probably what they would do over there. Yeah, in Canada.

885
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:47,460
Yeah, because they won't let them damn truckers watch The Simpsons anymore. And that's why they're complaining.

886
00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:52,140
They want DVD players in their car to play The Simpsons hit-and-run. Mm-hmm.

887
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,380
and they're doing hit and runs until they get to play it.

888
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,220
- That's right.

889
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,460
It is kinda cool that they can just like,

890
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,420
if the truckers just give up on you,

891
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,960
you don't even get to have all your snacks anymore.

892
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:05,460
(laughing)

893
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,740
Like how are you gonna get shit?

894
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,900
- We just got a chips box today.

895
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,740
- What?

896
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,580
What does that even mean?

897
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,980
- You know those chips boxes?

898
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,900
- No, what the fuck are you even fucking talking about?

899
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,700
- That people get their kids for school lunches.

900
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,740
- Oh yeah.

901
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:20,300
- I thought you meant, what flavors?

902
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,700
- I don't know, I didn't look at it.

903
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:27,740
You didn't even look? I didn't get it. You're an animal. Yeah. What brand? Lay's? I think so.

904
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:33,500
Okay. Okay, so you got Lay's original, you got barbecue chips. Yeah. I don't know, I

905
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:37,860
don't know, I didn't look at it. Ruffles. Cheddar Ruffles. Cheddar Ruffles if it's

906
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:41,500
like the, you know. Yeah, if it's a good one. Yeah. The one that I used to, I used to

907
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,100
buy a pack of those at Costco when I was a kid and I would

908
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:51,500
sell them next to the graveyard next to my house. Oh, you told me about that. You'd sell candy bars and that shit too.

909
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:57,740
make some money doing that. That's how I bought my Abercrombie sweatpants that I used to have.

910
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:05,340
They were $30. Nice. It's pretty cool. But I bet you guys don't have chips boxes. I could get one

911
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:10,140
pretty easily. Yeah but you don't have it so it doesn't really matter. Maybe I do. You don't.

912
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:15,500
Maybe I have two of them. You don't have two. You know they make packs of those with better flavors.

913
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:20,700
Better flavors than what? Than the ones that we were just talking about? Yeah.

914
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,960
I don't know there's the base one and then they have some that are like, you know, they have a

915
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:32,600
cool ranch instead of like a set of nacho cheese, yeah instead of nacho cheese and they have some that have like

916
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:38,740
Like the sour cream and cheddar. That's the thing though. It could it could have Doritos in there

917
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,740
I think you know what I hate the

918
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:43,340
Fritos chili cheese

919
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:49,200
That come in those, you know, it's really boxes. I'm not a fan of Fritos in general. Yeah Fritos not good

920
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,040
- Fritos are pretty good.

921
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,120
- Fritos with actual chili on them.

922
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,760
If you put some Fritos in chili, that's good.

923
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,680
- The first Frito, dog shit.

924
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,520
- Yeah.

925
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,340
- Eat that shit.

926
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:00,920
But the 10th Frito that you have, if it's all you got.

927
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,600
- To me, eating a Frito feels like drinking salt water.

928
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,600
- You acclimate.

929
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,440
You acclimate to a Frito.

930
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:06,640
- Yeah, but I don't want to.

931
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,480
- No, and it gets good.

932
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,320
- You know what it is?

933
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,560
- You acclimate to drinking salt water.

934
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,400
- No, you start getting--

935
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,220
- It smells like a dog.

936
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:15,080
- You start getting really subtle corn flavors

937
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:17,600
once you get 10 Fritos in.

938
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:20,640
the corn. Yeah, that's why that's the thing. It has to be,

939
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,640
there has to be plain Fritos, right? I like the,

940
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,760
I like the tangy barbecue ones too. The twists? Yeah.

941
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,560
That's one that like, they were vegan. That's why I like,

942
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,920
that's the one that I do like. I would have to wait.

943
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:38,240
Like I could probably eat those now, but like for years I couldn't eat them

944
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:42,680
because the thought of eating them like made me feel like I wanted to puke.

945
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,160
Made you feel like you wanted to puke? Because I ate like so many of them.

946
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,960
thought of them? Yeah, I ate so many of them. You know the thing where you eat too much of

947
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,800
one thing? Like I can't eat Peeps ever again? You ate too many? I ate too many Peeps. Peeps

948
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,880
are nasty. Yeah, Peeps are already nasty. If you have the ability to eat too many Peeps,

949
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,960
there's something wrong with you. As a 7 year old? Yes. No, when you're 7 years old, you're

950
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:10,320
trying to put the max amount of sugar in you. No, you should be able to have moderation

951
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:17,320
when you're seven years old or else you should be executed

952
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,440
now

953
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,200
let's uh... that

954
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,480
i like how to use

955
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,360
i like how to use but like i'd leave like the uh...

956
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,720
you know if there's a family in the neighborhood that went to the dollar

957
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,520
store

958
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,680
and got all the snacks which you know you can't really

959
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,640
can't knock them for that

960
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:40,000
banged up a book on the candy

961
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,640
but halloween is the dentist's worst nightmare

962
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,000
yeah because of the scary ghost

963
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,440
uh... because of the terrifying

964
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,920
to the greens of the jack o'lanterns yet

965
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,520
i think i'll never be able to straighten that jagged tooth

966
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,160
why don't the jack o'lanterns have full sets of teeth?

967
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:02,080
they get scared by the skeletons because it's all tooth

968
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,200
they're basically all tooth they realize

969
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,200
they think, they say oh my god everything is tooth

970
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:11,760
No, but you get like a fucking, what was that shit,

971
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,540
Neko wafers?

972
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,880
Love Neko wafers.

973
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:15,720
Really?

974
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,540
I was a fan of those.

975
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:17,660
My granddad loves them.

976
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,720
I mean, I gotta show respect.

977
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:22,720
Those are a fun textural thing.

978
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:23,560
Yep.

979
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,380
Some of them are--

980
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,720
That's a perfect candy for an autistic kid.

981
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,560
Oh yeah.

982
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,140
Yeah, that's like the equivalent of like,

983
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,680
running a horse brush over an autistic kid's head

984
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:34,760
to stimulate them.

985
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,600
Definitely.

986
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:36,420
Yeah.

987
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:37,760
That's why you like them?

988
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,200
probably I always like the the coke bottle ones oh I didn't like those

989
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,600
bottles bottle caps they get a lot of water bottle can you on them yeah or the

990
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:51,360
wax bottle the wax no wax bottle I like the wax bottles yeah you just chew on

991
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,880
them they taste like something for one second yeah chew on a candle yeah of

992
00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:00,120
the night yeah yeah bottle caps I don't know what those are you know what they

993
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,960
are you know the soda flavor things so Wonka makes them Willie

994
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,540
Oh Willie Wonka. Let me look them up I don't think I'd want I never fucked with

995
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,720
soda flavored candy. I had the idea to turn soda flavor you didn't like them. I don't drink soda either

996
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,680
Oh true so whoever turned whoever decided to turn Wonka into a real thing

997
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:26,720
should be put to death yeah pretty fucking smart. You've given a lot of children type 2 diabetes.

998
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,160
I mean I won't name it after the guy who owns the car really think so Ernie the

999
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:36,200
company company or maybe Wonka it's fucking fraud to name them Willy Wonka

1000
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:40,440
candies cuz if there's Willy Wonka isn't real you can't name it that it is kind

1001
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:46,280
of fun about Santa's workshop oh yes Nestle it is yeah it's not good that I

1002
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:55,480
knew that the fuck it's not good I knew that remember this was like a candy that

1003
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,680
was on the market for like... They discontinued it. They stopped branding things as Wonka.

1004
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:04,920
What? Really? It used to be Wonka Nerds, Sweet Tarts, Laffy Taffy, Gobstoppers. Oh yeah, I

1005
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:11,160
did notice that in the past year. I'm not going to say the name of that candy. What

1006
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:24,520
is it? It's called... That was Wonka branded? It's a candy called Negro. Why does it say

1007
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:33,480
Hungarian on it. I don't know. It's interesting. I don't know if you can say that. Negro? I can say it.

1008
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:42,360
There's a name of a candy in Hungaria. That was a Willy Wonka candy. Yeah. Damn. That's cool. Do you

1009
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:47,320
remember there was a Wonka candy, it like, as soon as it came out it was gone.

1010
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,040
Because like people were like, "Jesus." Which one? Oh yeah, the one with the golden ticket, the Wonka bar. Yeah.

1011
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,040
Yeah, the Wonka Bar.

1012
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:53,040
And those seven kids won.

1013
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,840
Dude, I wanted to eat those so bad.

They do actually have a Wonka Bar.

1020
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:01,840
They used to.

1021
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,840
This.

1022
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:03,840
I've never seen that in my life.

1023
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,840
It was like a chocolate...

1024
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:05,840
It was just chocolate.

1025
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,760
It was the most like sugar-filled thing.

1026
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,760
Yeah.

1027
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:10,760

Like did you guys like...

1030
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,400
Like I would always...

1031
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,280
When I was walking, I would always walk home from middle school with my friends and we

1032
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
would just like...

1033
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,840
we just edit it like we just try and find a quarter or something all day and then

1034
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:32,040
by just like lemon heads yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1035
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,560
convenience store working in edge who would just so we would just we just talk

1036
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:40,400
to every day sick yeah I miss that my dad lived like four blocks from a

1037
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:44,680
convenience store and I would go there and the guy who ran it was like a

1038
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:49,880
hair metal guy. Yeah. And I thought he was a woman for my entire life

1039
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,760
until I went there recently and he's just like an old hair metal dude. Getting candy

1040
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,120
from the convenience store as a kid is like the best thing ever. Yeah dude.

1041
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:02,840
Yeah. Oh I got so obsessed with lemon heads. Yeah we would always get, because they had like

1042
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:07,400
lemon heads and like cherry heads. Orange heads. Yeah I like the cherry heads. When I was like,

1043
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:13,000
I think I got a dollar or like a, yeah. Do you still have it? No. Oh fuck.

1044
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:18,560
I got like a dollar from like my uncle or some shit and I went to a quick stop in London

1045
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:20,600
Dairy which is like near my house.

1046
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,760
It was in walking distance but it was like a mile away from my house so I'd walk a mile

1047
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:28,200
then just go buy a shit ton of candy and walk home.

1048
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:32,240
And I went there and cleared out like the, not cleared out but like got every single

1049
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,080
one of those flavors because I was like I have to try them all.

1050
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,440
I have to try chewy, well you know there's chewy lemon head and there's chewy lime head

1051
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,040
and there's chewy orange head and like.

1052
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,040
You tried them all?

1053
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:51,040
I tried all of them and I thought that the characters on the Lemonhead things were so cool that I wanted them to have their own show.

1054
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:56,040
Whoa. Whoa. You mean the show?

1055
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,040
I mean the show where they're all hanging around.

1056
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,040
That's pretty cool.

1057
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,040
That's pretty fucking smart.

1058
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:13,040
I love this candy so much I wish I could watch it on TV every day instead of just eating it.

1059
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,040
I wish I could waste 30 more minutes of my time.

1060
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,040
That's all children's marketing though.

1061
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,040
That's so sick dude.

1062
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:28,040
Dude the fucking Wonderball and pretty much every toy that existed in the 80s only existed in a TV show.

1063
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,040
Well that's because you can make a TV show in 20 minutes with GoAnimate now.

1064
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:32,040
Yeah that's true.

1065
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,400
and you could just you just put it on YouTube and you say it's like a cartoon

1066
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:39,080
like I was at the I was in the Tom I was yeah the Talking Tom so that's a big one

1067
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:43,880
that's what I was at a 400 episodes made in Cyprus yeah yeah we talked about that

1068
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,360
for like a whole episode we did yeah I was at the dollar store recently in the

1069
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:53,120
mall and I was like walking I always go through the toy aisle to see like if I

1070
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:56,800
fortnight toys and I always find like they're always toys that are just for

1071
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,240
like a TV show that's not real like it'll be like like branded toys where

1072
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,780
It's like don't collect them all and it's like yeah, and there's like I forget there was why I forgot was called

1073
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,500
It was called final something. There's like some like sci-fi toys

1074
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:13,520
I was like what the fuck is this I was looking on the back and it's like watch the cartoon like today at youtube.com

1075
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:19,840
Slash like whatever like it's just like they just have YouTube cartoons that they're making toys. That's awesome. Well. Yeah, that's like

1076
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:24,520
They have all the Ryan's World branded toys now. It's just like like blippy toys

1077
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:28,300
And you always fell off toys have fallen off everything's that my own

1078
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,960
- I disagree.

1079
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,360
- All the shit my nephews have been getting, suck ass.

1080
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:37,120
- I feel like if you are operating on a level as a child

1081
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,360
where you can get, you kinda got that like,

1082
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,600
you see it, you buy it status with your mommy and daddy.

1083
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,960
Like I feel like you can get some fire toys now.

1084
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,360
- Yeah, but that doesn't count.

1085
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,200
- I feel like that counts.

1086
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,040
- No, I mean--

1087
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:51,680
- I feel like the highs are higher now.

1088
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,480
Like you can get, well no, you know what?

1089
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,960
Maybe they nerfed a lot of stuff for safety reasons.

1090
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:57,960
- They did. - Like choking and shit.

1091
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:58,920
- They did, yeah.

1092
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,240
And I feel the high end now is like,

1093
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,040
you can get like a drone, but that's not like a toy.

1094
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:04,880
- You're right, you're right.

1095
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,080
- That's like, I think we're talking like toys.

1096
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,760
- You're right, toys, you know, I thought it would follow--

1097
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,160
- Not like technology, but like toys,

1098
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,760
I think they suck now.

1099
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,800
- I feel like games have all gotten cooler.

1100
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,480
I thought toys would follow the same thing.

1101
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,640
No, they kinda, you're right,

1102
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,000
it's all just turned into RC shit.

1103
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:22,000
You did get Kinga.

1104
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,560
- Yeah, 'cause all the toys are for adults now too.

1105
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,400
They're all collectible,

1106
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,800
like all the like, they like good action figures and stuff.

1107
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:31,760
Yeah I know they're putting so many points of articulation on action figures

1108
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,880
Exactly yeah and they're all like they're all like $250 you have to build

1109
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:40,500
them yourself with a soldering iron. You see like the the old Kenner like Star

1110
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:44,820
Wars stuff from the 90s it's like and all they did was slap like dude three

1111
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:51,060
four like five parts yeah but now it's like they would get every color on the

1112
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,040
character wrong uh-huh like every their clothes would be the wrong color yeah

1113
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,720
their skin would be blue because they would have like every fucking oh yeah

1114
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:04,160
like the first the first like 70s like Kenner Luke Skywalker's that had like

00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,240
the arms that were a lightsaber yeah they gave Luke like a yellow lightsaber

1116
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,840
yeah every every every everybody would be cross-eyed because they'd have some like

1117
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:17,800
slave child painting yeah he pulls into the eyes yeah no what a normal I looks

1149
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:25,600
stick of butter and women belonging where they belong and driving a big car that

1150
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:31,080
guzzles a lot of gas and eating and eating stew from a slow cooker and

1151
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:38,760
running from a tyrannosaur and becoming one of the twelve apostles. And getting a bone

1152
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:46,000
through my nose. I'm kind of an old-school guy. And I don't know, discovering the wheel.

1156
