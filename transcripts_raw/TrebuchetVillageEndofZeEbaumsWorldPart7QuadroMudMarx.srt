1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:10,080
- Cam's penis smells like chips and fries.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,400
- It's getting completely cut out.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,320
It's gonna start with the thing.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,600
- No it's not, you're gonna leave it in.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,040
- Oh, I'm not gonna leave it in.

7
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:18,240
- Yes you will because people will like that.

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,920
- It's gonna be completely cut out

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,560
and it's gonna be put in its own episode.

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,880
- I'm gonna tell Patrick to do it in the next episode.

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,720
- I won't do it.

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,880
- Okay, you can start now, Patches.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,360
- Okay.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,200
- Last time on--

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,480
- Cam's penis.

16
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,480
I was not going to cut it out, you'd have to do it again.

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,480
Last time on Tribuche Village, the gang ventured deep into Albert the Witch's cove with Patrick's

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,480
mom's head.

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,480
After the witch, oh no, Albert the Witch was one of the hot babes on Hot Babe Island who

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,480
refused a moniker of hot babe, choosing to nest in the strange cove beneath the island.

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,480
As they traveled through the waterway into the cove, our heroes were attacked by average

22
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,940
average looking women

23
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,540
first with feral

24
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,800
filming fury from being not that attractive

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,780
after passing them by using their dingy

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,780
the gang found themselves in the which is

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,100

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,500

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,160

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,260

00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,100

42
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,620
yeah but i like it fast too

43
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,420
i mean that's not a really good dance

44
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,940
see when we start filming these it's gonna be awesome

45
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,940
Yeah, we're not gonna do that though ever.

46
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:58,700
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, definitely not. So, um...

47
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,940
So yeah, you guys are in your dinghy.

48
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:04,980
You're approaching now the witch,

49
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,140
Albert, and she's...

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,140
There's ship on my dinghy!

51
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,580

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,020
There's ship on my dinghy!

53
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,300
He's ruined every episode for like two years of this is my fault

54
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,420
This is a was a dingy said dingy, and I shouldn't have called it a dingy

55
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,160
I should have just called it a my dingy smells like shit

56
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:42,580
Dropped a bunch of chum out of my dingy. That's not as funny. No, that's all that

57
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,940
You say my dingy my dingy shooting chum

58
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,920
No, you see you're missing a really crucial day. I'm coming maybe what I'm coming

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,520
I'm coming to you with my on my dinghy. Yeah, my dinghy and I'm coming right for you

60
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:00,100

No, you're coming for you. I'm coming for your ass with my dinghy

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,320
My dinghy is coming in your ass pretty soon. The cavern is filled with the the sort of full splendor

63
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,320
I'm coming in that hole with my dinghy. This cavern is filled with ship.

64
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:19,320
Wait, just a question. Does the dinghy have bowels?

65
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,320
It has a bow?

66
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Yeah, a bow. Does it have a bow? Yeah, I mean it's a ship.

67
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,320
My dinghy's bows are full of chum.

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,320
This is crap. This is complete crap. What if I said "chum"?

69
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,320
Okay, that might, yeah. Like you did a bore at?

70
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,320
All right.

71
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,400
So like a sort of like a multicolored sort of a muscular beam, you know, like sun beams

72
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,380
kind of like are coming down.

73
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,420
They're splattering kind of like everywhere.

74
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,820
There's all these creatures that you saw before.

75
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:54,140
There's got to be some prisms in there then, huh?

76
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,140
Oh, yeah.

77
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,620
There's some prismatic light for sure.

78
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:02,420
Grotesque creatures crane their necks and munch on transparent fruits that vent gas.

79
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:08,480
It's sort of this like strange sort of otherworldly garden that's sort of flanking on the edges

80
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,560
of the cavern as you approach her her hovel and there's some flowers that are

81
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,160
like spitting and spinning and like they're shivering it's it's really

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,200
pretty and an interesting. So our dinghy's going into her hovel. I'll just I'll read

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:32,400
this to myself later. No, no, I thought you were done. Don't give me a second cuz I

84
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,060
I will jump on it.

85
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,900
- Any opportunity.

86
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,020
- I will jump on your dinghy.

87
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,100
- I didn't know that.

88
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,820
Okay, it's fine.

89
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,380
I mean, there's just more descriptions

90
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,360
of what it looks like. - Keep describing.

91
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
Keep going. - I'm listening.

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,940
- And use funny words that we can say

93
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,780
in between the paragraphs.

94
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,080
- All right, I'll try to replace some of these then.

95
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,500
There's a persistent din,

96
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,020
sort of a chorus of psychic sounds

97
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,140
that whisper and soothe,

98
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:56,980
sort of like this,

99
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,440
there's like kind of constant whispering around you.

100
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,580
And those fish that you saw,

101
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:06,180
like fish that would leap and sort of hit the water and then like splatter into like other

102
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:11,500
colors. There's more of those and then the snouted sort of reptilian thing that you saw

103
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,740
earlier, you see them now and what they fully look like. They kind of have like a sort of

104
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,020
like a dog's face but mixed with kind of like a crocodile and then this like sort of reptile

105
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,020
body and the sort of like poodley kind of like, you know, curly tail. I'll be putting

106
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,260
my dinghy in there poodley.

107
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,580
They have reptile bodies. Does that mean they're cold-blooded?

108
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,820
I mean um... So the room is really hot?

109
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,980
No, I mean it's a fantasy world.

110
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,500
The room is regularly temperate.

111
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,260
Just wanted to know something about the reptiles.

112
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,220
And then the uh... the crone now speaks, the witch.

113
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,460
And she says um... What does she look like?

114
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,580
She's... I mean she's... she's

115
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,820
quite beautiful. Does she have cold blood like a reptile? I don't know.

116
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,580
I actually cannot answer that. She is, I mean, you'll learn more about her, but she's quite

117
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:07,380
beautiful. She has gigantic boobs. She has, I don't know her boob size. Regular? Good.

118
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:10,900
If you don't know it, then they're small. What's regular to you, Patches? Just like

119
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:19,120
a... Double D. Double D's. Interesting. It's actually most women have, most women don't

120
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,100
buy the correct bras. That's something I have to hear about sometimes. You hear about that

121
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
At your work?

122
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Just from friends or women.

123
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
At Victoria's Secret? Or I forgot you don't work there.

124
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
You just hang out there.

125
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Just hang out.

126
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,100
Something I hear a lot.

127
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,100
You know, you have female friends

128
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,100
and they talk about that stuff.

129
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
Yeah, I wouldn't call them your friends.

130
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
The people in Victoria's Secret, they kind of try to ignore you.

131
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,100
They harass.

132
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,100
You're smelling patients.

133
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,900
It's funny you say friends now because usually you call them targets but yeah

134
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,100
okay well you know let's let's keep let's try to keep the the you know all that

135
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,100
down low. My thingy has shit on it. Yeah Patches is Victoria's Secret. He's like a phantom of the opera.

136
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,300
Yeah he's got the pains on the air duck. The phantom of the opera under these Victoria's Secrets.

137
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,900

It's a language that only the two of us know.

Yes, it's true. I didn't know you spoke that.

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,380
All right, yeah, she thinks you're Black Peter.

172
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,380
There's no consequence really to that.

173
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,380
Okay.

174
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,380
She says, "What do you three doing here?

175
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,380
Oh, I see you've got the mud mom.

176
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:06,380
What are you doing with your mud mom?"

177
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,380
I lied about my name.

178
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,380
I lied about my name.

179
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
I lied about my name.

180
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,380
I lied about my name.

181
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
I lied about my name.

182
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
Okay, what's your name?

183
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,380
Did you think that was cool that was my name?

184
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,380
I would have thought it was your name.

185
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,380
That's about it.

186
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,380
Okay, then it's still my name.

187
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:24,380
Okay, cool.

188
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,380
What are you three doing here?

189
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,380
I have the right mind to cast you out.

190
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,380
We're trying to change our names.

191
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,380
I don't, uh, oh, um,

192
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,380
this, I point to the mud mom.

193
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,380
This one.

194
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,380
She had a, okay, so one of these,

195
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,680
wait which head was it I think I'm off and like just looking at him not this one

196
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,080
oh it's this one that has all my spit in the mouth of it oh my god there's a lot

197
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:54,360
of so she clean this out I like put my hand in and it's like it's the his spit

198
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,080
consistency is like aloe vera it's like so thick as she as you're pulling the the

199
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:08,540
spit out of her mouth the Patrick's mom's head's mouth she Albert has a

200
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:16,060
realization she's like oh no that's Patrick's mom that was her name

201
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,160
do you mean black Peters mom well you changed my name because I thought it

202
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,220
would be funny well you're her son yeah why do you say Patrick's mom that was

203
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,780
her name oh yeah I forgot we didn't give her name and I thought that would be cool

204
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,640
no what happened is this whole situation but that's all right so what happened

205
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:45,780
was tried to break dance on her head like a grape come come I haven't seen

206
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:49,620
you since you order we hi Patrick you're gonna have to explain this one cuz all I

207
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,180
know is what happened is that I took her head off and I put it on to this other

208
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,600
I've blocked out the memory completely I just don't even care.

209
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,900
Alright so we don't really know what happened. Don't you have like a magical memory stone?

210
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,700
Yeah but I can choose to block things out if I feel like it. I didn't even know that

211
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,140
I didn't know much. Maybe the death of my mom is very traumatic and I want to block it out.

212
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,820
It seemed very traumatic when it happened.

213
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,340
When I saw that I said oh crap. I didn't know much about her

214
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:19,260
I didn't even barely know that it was Patricks mom I knew she was kind of a

215
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,740
she's clearly a scumbag because she had this tattoo

216
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:27,300
And I show her the the room yeah, she looks at the room. She says oh my

217
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,020
Okay, here come come here, and she takes the she takes the head if you're giving it to her

218
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:38,780
I kick it. I like punt it across the dinghy to her. Okay. I'm gonna roll an athletics check for her

219
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,840
Oh my god getting some head across your dinghy though

220
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,300
I'm getting head from Patrick's mom on the dinghy.

221
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,300
And then you start...

222
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,700
Will you be giving it to her?

223
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,500
Aren't you giving head on the dinghy?

224
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm gonna use her...

225
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,100
He's giving head on a dinghy.

226
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,500
Yeah, to your mom, who's dead.

227
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,500
She's able to catch it pretty easily.

228
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
It's giving head to me on the dinghy.

229
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
And she sort of sees and she's like, "Ugh."

230
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
And she puts it down on a table.

231
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,500
Oh my god, on a table.

232
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
How disrespectful can you be?

233
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
I didn't know we had a table on our dinghy.

234
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,660
So, it's on your dinghy. Well, you're on - at this point, she has sort of like a little island.

235
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,740
I think it's - I think it's all on the dinghy.

236
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,220
Yeah.

237
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:26,780
I think we're still on it.

238
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,380
You guys can either stay on - you can stay on the dinghy.

239
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,420
No, I'll get off.

240
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,060
You don't have to.

241
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,820
Yeah, get off my dinghy.

242
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,620
Okay, cool.

243
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:37,500
Yeah, you're on the island. You start to see some of those flowers that are kind of like

244
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,140
weirdly alive and then they sort of like curve their heads towards you guys and sort of look

245
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:48,060
around and take note of your presence and note of her not being sort of hostile to you guys.

246
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,860
like there's sort of like a welcoming to it and she takes the the head and she

247
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,820
she she looks at the the hideous tattoo on it she says this alright this is a

248
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,900
Quinta rune. Do you guys know much about runes? La Quinta. That's right. La Quinta.

249
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:12,540
I get a rune at the La Quinta and I got fucked in it. It's pretty good. So in runes

250
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:21,420
there are typically most ruins are a trace of bedrooms tresor is ruins nope

251
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:28,940
no no living in in as in yeah yeah yeah the the quinta in no not a quinta in

252
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:37,780
when you saying you're saying in are you touched yes Barry oh my god what a

253
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:44,500
breakthrough so most ruins are trace ruins right you have the ruin itself

254
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:48,700
she sure points at the room she says you could see here it has a pentagram ik

255
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:53,020
design what that means is that there's five entities associated with it all the

256
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:58,460
ruins have at least two okay the ruin itself and then the place the extant body

257
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:03,380
but it's a that it's a attached to right so for example if you get like your

258
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,420
accident buddy that I'm attached to damn and keep going though. I have five

259
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:14,900
roll a roll persuasion. Okay, one second. I have to see what my persuasion is. I

260
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,140
think your charisma is pretty good because you're a paladin. I don't think

261
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,940
it is. I don't think I have any good ability scores. Let's see here.

262
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:30,900
Persuasion that roll is a 19. All right yeah. She's not like you know into it, but

263
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,780
but she's like, yeah, I wasn't like trying to do anything either.

264
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,260
I just kind of like charming, like you're being sort of silly. Uh, yeah,

265
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,940
it wasn't silly. I was cool. No, it was really cool. It's cool.

266
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,260
I dug that. And she keeps going and she says, uh,

267
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,380
and uh, so there's the extent body in the room itself.

268
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:52,140
Most of the rooms are trace rooms because there's also typically the third

269
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,540
entity involved is the effect, right? So for example, in this case,

270
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,500
well, how did she die? This can somebody tell me?

271
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:05,540
I think that she tried to say a cuss and her head,

272
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,720
she died from cussing.

273
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,080
- So some sort of powered word then, okay.

274
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,920
- Yeah. - Well, I hope it wasn't a,

275
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,980
nothing.

276
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,520
Never mind. - What?

277
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,960
- Huh? - I don't care anymore.

278
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,020
- So in that case-- - I heard the word

279
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,140
was chicken tenders.

280
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,200
- Okay, chicken tenders.

281
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,900
So she said chicken tenders and then she died?

282
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,740
- That's just what I heard.

283
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,780
I was sitting in a line of like 20 people

284
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,540
they were all one by one whispering the word into each other's ears and and yeah

285
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,020
that's what it was the word Patrick do you remember what she was about this what

286
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:42,820
she said before that bathroom break

287
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:51,540
fingers okay sticky fingers chicken no I think it was chicken yeah I mean that's

288
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:57,820
just what I we were playing a way of conveying information called I love when

289
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,300
play away of information. Yeah, it's not a game. If it was a game, maybe the whole

290
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,740
thing would be like to see what funny it, but it's like, you know. But you play it

291
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:09,380
though. Yeah, you play it. Yeah, and it wasn't called, it wasn't called

292
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,580
telephone. Yeah, it was called talking. It was called yelling from one room to

293
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,540
another. Yeah. So then in that case now, that accounts for the third point here,

294
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:26,300
but the other two is the part that I'm a little bit confused by. So some of what

295
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,620
we can do here is look at the runes themselves, some of the magical drawings inside of them.

296
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,940
And I'm also going to have to know a little bit more detail from you what happened. She

297
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,460
said "Sticky Fingers" to you. And then her head popped off like a grape. I don't think

298
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,460
it popped, I think we ripped her head off. Who is Sticky Fingers? He was like, I guess

299
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:55,660
he was like my uncle's buddy. So yeah, Sticky Fingers was the head of the Thieves Guild.

300
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:00,940
back in Trebuchet Village. He was my uncle's buddy. Your uncle's buddy. He was a part of the group

301
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:10,300
that you guys knew about which was called The 60 Tricksters Eating Chicky Tenders

302
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:20,860
and Their Mixing Genders with Their 120 Fingers. Which was Patrick - which is Trunchbull's crew,

303
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,860
is what they were called.

304
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,700
- Yep.

305
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,860
- And so, she says, "Okay."

306
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,700
So when she said sticky fingers,

307
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,120
now that makes some sense,

308
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,580
but the only thing then is,

309
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,820
and if I'm looking at the runes here,

310
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:36,140
we're seeing some transmutation, some illusion magic,

311
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,780
some of that is usually to obscure a rune, right?

312
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,120
So keep it hidden, which makes sense.

313
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,900
Probably people weren't looking for it on her body,

314
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,900
but what's odd is I'm seeing also abjuration signs.

315
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,900
Abjuration is the suppression of magic.

316
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,940
- Observations?

317
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,300
- Abjuration.

318
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,500
A, B, J, U, R.

319
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,660
- Abjurbation.

320
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,580
- Yes, no, you know, closer, but--

321
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,500
- Absurbations.

322
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,940
- What this means is that there is some sort

323
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,460
of protective magic here,

324
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,740
but obviously there is no protecting going on.

325
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,080
And finally, the power word.

326
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,220
Patrick, when was the last time you saw your mother?

327
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,420
100 years ago.

328
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
That's not true, he saw her when she died.

329
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,020
Oh right, I saw her when she died.

330
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,540
Before that.

331
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,620
100 years ago.

332
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,340
So a long time ago.

333
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,620
But that's 700 years if it was in dog years.

334
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,860
Just in case that, I don't know.

335
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,920
I think I saw her seven million years, no.

336
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:43,140
Six years.

337
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,500
You wouldn't know that you saw her,

338
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,620
you only saw her last when you were a baby

339
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:49,620
before you were taken from Babe Island.

340
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,460
So--

341
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,340
- So 100 years ago.

342
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,820
- Sure, you can be 100 years old.

343
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,660
- I forget how old I am.

344
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,540
- Oh my God, you're 100 years old?

345
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,780
- Oh my God.

346
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,620
- I'm 19.

347
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,460
- I'm 12.

348
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,540
- I don't know what the Verdan age thing is, but--

349
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,980
- Yeah, when did I hit puberty?

350
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,820
- Yeah, Verdan's--

351
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,200
- I'm canonically 12 and he took his balls out in front of me.

352
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,420
- They live to be about 200.

353
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,580
- So you're middle-aged.

354
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,940
- You being 100 would be middle-aged,

355
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,700
if you're middle-aged. Yeah, but I hit puberty.

356
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,980
Yeah, well, it, yeah. Late bloomer. That did happen. Maybe it's, maybe you're fifty.

357
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:30,220
Maybe. Puberty at like forty. Yeah, that's basically what happened to you.

358
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,180
You're an extremely late bloomer, maybe.

359
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,780
And she says, uh...

360
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:41,020
"Now this might be a wee bit upsetting, but I think you're sort of responsible for

361
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,900
your mother's death in that case."

362
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,100
That's fine.

363
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:44,940
- Well, okay.

364
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,860
- I didn't know her that well.

365
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,600
- Well, she was,

366
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,080
she was a good woman.

367
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,380
- Okay.

368
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:55,820
- She was pretty stupid, but you know, nobody really minded.

369
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,740
- Can I knock on her head and it sounds empty

370
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,580
like a coconut?

371
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,700
- It absolutely does.

372
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,780
- Yeah.

373
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,820
- Says, "What likely happened here is that

374
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,820
somebody was waiting, or the rune itself was waiting for,"

375
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:10,580
that's power word, "sticky fingers."

376
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:13,180
- Wait, it's not doing anything right now.

377
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,380
Well it's only doing something to the person who had the rune on them.

378
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,980
I put it on.

379
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,940
Well did you put the rune on her?

380
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,220
I put the rune on right now.

381
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,220
It's in her body.

382
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,740
No you can't, it's etched into her body, you can't really put it on.

383
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,740
The way the runes work-

384
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,740
I thought it was a necklace.

385
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,860
No no no, the runes are sort of marked onto a body, usually through some kind of magical

386
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,020
application and cotton and stuff.

387
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,100
It's like a letter.

388
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,860
So did the guy who took me put the rune on my mom and wait for her to say it?

389
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:47,360
That's what I'm wondering. Either somebody did it, could have been the person who took you, could have been somebody else.

390
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,660
It might have been Sticky Fingers because his name was a complete activation phase.

391
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,660
It might have been Sticky Fingers.

392
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Wait, say Sticky Fingers backwards.

393
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:58,160
Bullshit.

394
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,160
Zrig... Zrig... Zrig... Rr... Neff...

395
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,660
Wait... St... Eekis... St... Eekits...

396
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Stop, you're gonna put the curse on us!

397
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,660
What?

398
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
Oh, I'm just kidding.

399
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,660
Oh, don't kid like that.

400
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,780
That actually works.

401
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,600
- Too far.

402
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,820
- Sticky fingers.

403
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,660
Zriffing.

404
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,380
Yes, that.

405
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,200
Ifkists.

406
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,780
Wanna see me do it again?

407
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,580
(laughing)

408
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,740
- Yeah, that doesn't help.

409
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,380
- Give me another one.

410
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,340
- Try poop.

411
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,180
- The only thing here--

412
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,020
- Boob.

413
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,060
Oh no, I flipped it the wrong way.

414
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,100
- It's again that abjuration piece.

415
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:38,920
- Boob.

416
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,140
- Try race car.

417
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:58,580
cat race. Try taco cat, say that backwards. Stuck-o cat. Try bob. Bob. Try... I don't know,

418
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,940
I got no more palindromes. I don't know how to do... I go bob, blay bob. That one's too

419
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:10,940
hard. What's likely happened then, this last piece, the abjuration piece, this was probably

420
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,240
then again, abjuration is usually protection types of magic,

421
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,980
but it also works for alarms.

422
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,880
- I don't do that.

423
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,800
- So, watch.

424
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,640
- Nice.

425
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,480
- Okay, and I got it.

426
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,300
- Up top.

427
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,500
(laughing)

428
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,640
- Pat just got it now.

429
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,960
- She says, if I had to guess, once it's activated,

430
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,700
somebody else or something was alarmed

431
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,020
that it was activated.

432
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,980
- Yeah, I was, my mom's head fell off.

433
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,820
- Besides you, right?

434
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,040
- It sounds alarming.

435
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,040
Somebody or something from a distance.

436
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:46,240
Oh, so like somebody knew that this happened.

437
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,840
Essentially, yes. Potentially, or it just was an alarm that was set for a

438
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,840
specific amount of time, I don't know. Like an alarm clock?

439
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,560
Well, it could be an alarm. So you're saying she was an alarm clock, which isn't real.

440
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:04,840
Alarm clocks are real in this world. No, she's the one piece of technology.

441
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I have no idea what that is.

442
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,840
I don't know what a clock is, but I know what an alarm clock is.

443
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,840
An alarm sundial.

444
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
I don't know, it wasn't quite like that.

445
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:20,840
It's more like if somebody walks into a private place and you have a security guard that sees you and they go...

446
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,840
Like if a horse walks into the bar and the bartender says "Why the long face?"

447
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Right, but imagine if the bartender was doing that to warn everybody but the horse was walking in.

448
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,840
He is.

449
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,840
Beginning a cool joke.

450
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,280
bars a couple of times or the bartender says why the long face and I don't even

451
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:43,360
look I just leave. Well in that case yes it's just like that it's like when

452
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,560
somebody says that and you leave. Somebody somewhere has been notified that

453
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,440
this rune has been activated. I don't like that. Is there any way to find out

454
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:59,520
who it could be? Could we reverse engineer the rune? Reverse the curse. Well

455
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,480
- Well, could we reverse the curse?

456
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,320
- Reverse the curse? - 'Cause otherwise,

457
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,820
- Srook and Sraver.

458
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,360
- 'Cause if we can't, I'm gonna tell you one thing,

459
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,800
this head's going in the ocean.

460
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,040
- No, well-- - No, we need it

461
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:12,880
for our mud mom, don't you dare.

462
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,720
- If you're talking about that kind of--

463
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,080
- Yeah, we need that for the mud mom.

464
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,120
- Look, I'll be honest,

465
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:20,320
runes are not necessarily the thing I'm best at,

466
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,440
but if you're looking to do something

467
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,000
like reversing a curse or a death,

468
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,600
I do know some necromancers in Beriberi you could go to see.

469
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,680
I don't want to bring Patrick's mom back to life.

470
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,120
I'd rather have the mud mom become a totally new life.

471
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,280
But I'm more interested in finding out

472
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,080
where the thing is from.

473
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,600
Also, do you want to buy these other three heads?

474
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,480
I think they might've been your friends.

475
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,960
Oh no, those are not my friends.

476
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,920
Those are just--

477
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,140
So you wouldn't care if we use them as pins

478
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,000
in a bowling game, where we use his mom's head as the ball,

479
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,120
'cause it's the roundest.

480
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,640
Yeah, it's really round.

481
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:59,120
I did know her, but yeah, I mean, she's your head now.

482
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,480
What if we put makeup on her?

483
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,640
Would that be better?

484
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,760
I would love that.

485
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,840
Do you have any makeup?

486
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,080
No, that's why you rejected the whole hot babe thing.

487
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,480
I would like to do a makeup montage

488
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,520
with just kind of like mud and rocks and stuff

489
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,240
and try to pretty up his mom a little bit.

490
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,840
Role, in that case, God, what would that even be?

491
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,640
I guess is that charisma?

492
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,480
I guess it's performance kind of?

493
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,840
Yeah, it's like disguise.

494
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,560
Yeah, 'cause it's a disguise character.

495
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,400
Charisma check?

496
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,600
Yeah, we'll just do straight charisma

497
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,200
see if you know how to and then yeah I would say that's fair because you can be

498
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,600
the most dexterous motherfucker I got a natural 20 you serious yeah she looks

499
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,800
Wow what she looks 15 years younger and alive what song do I do the montage -

500
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,960
that's a good like walking on sunshine there we go and I'm just like using a

501
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,720
like a rock say it was just run through all the scenes you're doing this okay so

502
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,560
So first of all, I take some gravel, some dark charcoal, I burn something and turn it into

503
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:03,600
like a black soot and then I put it under her eyes to make her look like a football player.

504
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,840
And then I give her big Groucho Marx eyebrows too.

505
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,840
And you know what?

506
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,520
Okay, scrap the football player thing.

507
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:12,680
I'm walking on sunshine still playing.

508
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,560
I do Groucho Marx eyebrows, a Groucho Marx mustache, and then I carve I guess an onion

509
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,480
to make it look like a nose.

510
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,800
I put that on her and then I also I'm gonna build up some glasses really

511
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,880
quickly and so she just has a whole groucho thing going on. Yeah she looks

512
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:37,040
amazing. And I put a piece of poop in her mouth like a cigar. Yeah she's smoking on that poop.

513
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:43,840
She looks great. Okay yeah. Now what do you want to do with her? So now let's

514
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,200
reverse the curse. Yeah. Well to reverse the curse do you mean like to track

515
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,900
who do we have to bring her back to life or do we just we don't know if anything

516
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:01,560
coming to life it's mud marks okay

517
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:17,160
the heads yeah they look completely like like all the marks brothers but but

518
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,900
Groucho, the mom has to be the main.

519
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,220
- Yeah, of course she has to be Groucho.

520
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,720
- Yeah, which one's fucking, yeah, they even do Zeppo.

521
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,440
- Yes, yes, yes.

522
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,440
- Okay, so and then we have them just sitting in a row

523
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,320
and they will be coming to life at some point.

524
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,160
- Yeah, that's like a--

525
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,420
- We need you to show us the Necromancer right now.

526
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,680
- Okay, well, you're gonna have to go to Berry Berry

527
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,640
and go to the academy.

528
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,280
There you can find a Necromancer who can help you.

529
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,800
- Wait a minute, are we still,

530
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,400
is this about the rune?

531
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,240
I don't know.

532
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,280
this is not what we'll give you a train to bring it back to life

533
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,880
and some sort of a

534
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,080
uh... famous comedy

535
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,720
the quadro

536
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,160
quartet or what's wrong with what you're here

537
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,640
then you can do that to a trip but you can't

538
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,420
actually

539
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,480
but we're going to let it work we are going to use it for all of the all of

540
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,720
the heads are are on the same body so they will be a quadro

541
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,560
yeah yeah they don't have a quadro marks

542
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
amazing

543
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
quadro marks

544
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
quadro marks

545
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560

546
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
so what you said we need to go to

549
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560

550
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
on the head

551
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560

570
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,160
and I would like to immediately start that time what you without a single more

571
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:12,200
word I can't do that this session because of just it literally I mean how far is a

572
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,240

573
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,880
journey I'm saying let's start the journey immediately I'm I would like the

574
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:26,400
which does not exist to me anymore we've already started by the way just from the

575
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,360
time that you said that even though you're not describing it we've already

576
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
already the clock is ticking. We're already going.

577
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,860
Okay, so I like that. Okay, the adventure is now about creating

578
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,860
quadro marks.

579
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,860
Quadro mud marks.

580
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,860
Quadro mud marks.

581
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,360
The second, yeah, the second that she said.

582
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,360
Well, that's, you know, we'll see. We'll reevaluate what happened.

583
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,860
We'll see in the room too, but that's...

584
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,360
That's our immediate focus is on that.

585
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,360
Yes, yes. Any way to get you further from Sullivan and one of them being...

586
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,360
And a new better sidekick.

587
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,860
And a new better sidekick, yes.

588
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,360
Who I can't wait until Pat just has to do four voices.

589
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,360
I mean, I...

590
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,360
Three, three. Harpo doesn't talk.

591
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Harpo doesn't talk.

592
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:04,720
will they will not the smile the woman who used to be like talk hmm I could do

593
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,520
that that what why why can't he do that maybe a whale in the in the ocean

594
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,800
supposed to be Harpo's horn oh what hack he's a horn he has a horn and a horn and

595
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:23,360
a which one cuts the tie with scissors I don't know yeah I could do a I could do

596
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,360
Groucho Marx. Oh, save it! Yeah, come on. I don't even want to do it almost anymore. You're teasing me. I do. Sorry, sorry.

597
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:34,560
But you're spoiling it. Sorry, sorry. I won't. I want the payoff. And plus, I would like to add a note,

598
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,200
which is that you're not doing Groucho Marx, you're doing a mud mom as Groucho Marx. Oh, okay, yeah.

599
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,920
So, well, don't do it now, okay? I want to, I want to, I want to. I see you leaning back like you're about to do it.

600
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:48,560
I won't. It probably, we'll see how the necromancy goes. I'm sure there'll be some roles involved,

601
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,080
but I can tell you a mud person probably is not going to do a great Groucho Marx.

602
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,680
just keep that in mind. Yeah, even think about that. Well, you have you okay,

603
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,580
okay, I want you to stop massaging different parts of your throat, because

604
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,680
I'm worried you're going to do the voice and I will not do the voice. I'm

605
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,780
saying you have the larynx at least so you have her you have like a real

606
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:13,480
larynx. Now you don't have like real lungs. So that'll be like no. Oh man,

607
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,180
this will be really fun. So we got a fine body. If you go, yes, that's what

608
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,080
I mean. Literally, you guys would have to go to berry berry find a

609
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,280

I'm answering not to Quadro.

617
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:57,640
Quadro is a perfect name for a four-headed marks.

618
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,540
Yeah, Quadro marks Quadro.

619
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,540

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,640
that you had women's heads and mud.

659
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:02,000
quadro marks et and it's like the chipettes to the head but they're

660
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,120

662
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:18,080

663
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:28,080
place man it's a hot one what a scorcher I'm licking mud marks like it's not cold

664
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,720

665
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:38,760
ways of in the dingy goes into the ship paddling a pile of ship yeah and you

666
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,200
notice that the poop deck

667
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,740
you notice that as you're sort of paddling back, you dock your boat.

668
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,100
I putting my dingy in a deck.

669
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:53,100
I'm docking my dingy with another dingy.

670
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:57,040
You hear a two tries to

671
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,240
you're not at your ship yet. You're just you're you're at the beach where

672
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:04,300
you know, your ship is, you carry the ship,

673
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,300
that's like how, part of how that works.

674
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,300
And I need all of you,

675
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,720

- Okay.

679
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,620
- Not a problem for me.

680
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,500
- If you want me to, I will, I guess.

681
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,780
- And I basically rolled a very good roll.

682
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,180
- I got a natural 20.

683
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,020
I got a, can I see that?

684
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:51,940
I'm

685
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:58,940
say it was a five. Okay. All right, we'll just say that. You two take 16 points of damage.

686
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:05,580

687
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:11,260

688
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:17,020

689
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:21,020
I'm down to 7 damage. We're all gonna die right now.

690
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
Bro.

691
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,020
As, before we ever, you're gonna ruin my quadro.

692
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:34,020
As three beams of just, of fire shoot towards you three, you didn't notice it, but each

mud marks is also there my marks probably gets hit by some of

698
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,940
the fire right quadro a quadro can it kind of act like a kiln

699
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:04,440
and kind of harden yeah kind of harden quadro so that when we do

700
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,740
bring him alive he's not just like sopping wet.

701
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
Yeah, he's way too wet.

702
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Alright, then I'll take the damage.

703
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
I'm not worried about it.

704
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,840
Okay, yeah, I'll allow it.

705
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Okay.

706
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Oh yeah, everyone roll for initiative.

707
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,840
Okay, great.

708
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,840
I can't roll, I'm dead.

709
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,840
You can just roll what you're dead.

710
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
You have one HP, you said.

711
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
No, I had one HP.

712
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:19,840
Oh yeah, you're dead.

713
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,840
How much do you have now?

714
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
Oh, you're dead.

715
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,840
You should still roll for initiative.

716
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,840
I have seven.

717
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Because we're rolling for death saving throws.

718
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:25,840
How much negative do you have?

719
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Thirteen.

720
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
That doesn't matter.

721
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,840
No, I, my, um.

722
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:29,840
As long as it's not negative, his first one.

723
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Yeah, I'm going to roll for death saving throws.

724
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,840
13.

725
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
That doesn't matter.

726
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,840
No, I, my, um.

727
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:38,440
As long as it's not negative his full health.

728
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,080
Okay, well that's what I was checking.

729
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,880
Well it's negative 15, but I rolled a 13.

730
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,280
I have, I have initiative 11.

731
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,720
Oh, nat 20.

732
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,720
My second nat 20.

733
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,720
Oh my gosh.

734
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,480
Or as, or a B. I just hit the heal button.

735
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,880
So I guess I'm healed now.

736
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,280
It's seriously fucked up that roll 20 makes a nat roll 20, or, but D&D Beyond makes it

737
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:18,720
to

738
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,960
first in the initiative order and you got

739
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,080
I think I'm going first.

740
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,840
Okay yes you are going first.

741
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Okay I would like to lay down and die.

742
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,840
I'm gonna lay down and die.

743
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,280
Yes I said what I meant.

744
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Alright I mean you could skip your turn.

745
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,280
Whatever I don't I mean I don't even know what's attacking us.

746
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,280
Wait so what's the thing that's attacking us?

747
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,280
You said a yethound.

748
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,480
So it's this massive feral sort of like dog creature.

749
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,760
Yethounds aren't always massive but this one is pretty massive.

750
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,160
feral so it's a dog in the ocean. Well,

751
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,260
yes, hounds are you'll will talk about

752
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,660
have you have hounds later, but they're

753
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,860
usually later. I'm fine. We're doing

754
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,660
know about what role you can roll

755
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,660
history or what what am I like it's a

756
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,660
dog. Let me roll in the water or it's

757
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,660
floating or what's going on at least

758
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,960
Google a picture of a yes hound. Yeah,

759
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,760
you can do that. What do you do that

760
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,660
to it's why ETH H o und it comes

761
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,360
right up from Pathfinder. He's from a

762
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,860
lot of places. Okay. This thing looks

763
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:23,340
like a dog with a dog with a man face Jersey devil yeah it looks like a

764
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:32,380
hairless Chihuahua but it's big Chihuahua and and it's swimming and right now

765
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,900

767
00:41:40,860 --> 00:42:03,780
was

768
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:07,140
- Are you telling me they've been getting intimate with this dog?

769
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:09,860
- No, I haven't said anything like that.

770
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,700
- But why is there--

771
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,620
- Wait, they copulated with the dog?

772
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:14,480
I'd like to check out the dog's genitals

773
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,320
to see if it's a boy or a girl dog.

774
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:21,100
- I guess I'll flip a coin.

775
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,060
- You don't have this--

776
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,300
- You don't even know?

777
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,140
- It doesn't--

778
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:24,960
- You're the dungeon master.

779
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,640
- It's not important.

780
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,860
- This guy thinks it's not important

781
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,940
whether or not it's a girl or a boy dog.

782
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:30,760
- Yeah.

783
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,600
- I think it's important.

784
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:38,440
a weakness point that I could attack. A girl should not have a boy dog. Yeah. Do the coin flip. I want

785
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:45,080
to know. All right. And tails got to be girls. Okay. Actually no, head got to be girls. Okay.

786
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:53,640
Tails got to be guys. One, two, three, girls, four, five, six guys. Deal. It's a deal. We got

787
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:59,320
one, two, three, girls. It's a girl. It's a girl dog. It's a girl dog. Can you re-roll? Yeah, sure.

788
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Okay, it's a guide dog.

789
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,140
Yes!

790
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:06,040
Yeah, it's a guide dog.

791
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,040
Um, yeah. I mean, in so...

792
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,340
I mean, you can roll a history check to see if you what you remember or know about.

793
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,640
No, I know all I need to know now. It's a guide dog.

794
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,140
Okay, cool.

795
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,440
And how tall is it?

796
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,340
It's like...

797
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,840
Like 10-ish feet high.

798
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,540
Whoa!

799
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,140
That's a tall dog.

800
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,140
10 feet to the shoulder?

801
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:24,640
Yes.

802
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,140
Holy sh...

803
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:25,840
Oh my god!

804
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
That's my reaction.

805
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,140
Yeah, it's a big beast.

806
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,940
Can I hold up my...

807
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:29,640
That's gotta be at least...

808
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,540
That's gotta be like 10 feet up to the shoulder.

809
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,700
I'm like oh my God that must be at least seven feet tall as I'm not I wouldn't

810
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,540
know how tall it was. I'm kind of making like an estimate. I'm not so smart yeah.

811
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:44,740
All right, so I get to attack first. I get to I get first first. Yes, you get

812
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:47,660
the first I get dibs. You get dibs. Do I have a bone?

813
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:55,220
I don't know. I don't think I'm almost positive you don't. I could get a bone

814
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,260
out of you. Sure. I guess let's look at your inventory. I do. I have what do

815
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:11,660
dogs like peanut butter peanut butter peba peba jr. That's oh my God wait my I

816
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,460
would like to declare before my turn that all of my rations my the rations

817
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:22,580
that I'm carrying chicken are there pb and J. No, no, what this far no that's

818
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:27,500
what I would eat. No yeah and my favorite food would probably have to be

819
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,320
begging. It's not like I said it's jars of peanut butter. Okay, it's PB and J.

820
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,120
So I'll still have to scrape the jelly off if I want the dog to eat it because

821
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:40,200
dogs don't like jelly as much as peanut butter. Honestly, I don't have anything

822
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:43,820
all that good. You use your action to scrape off the jelly. So you admit

823
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,420
they're PB and J's. I don't have roll a sleight of hand. No. You said roll a

824
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:51,600
sleight of hand, so. No, no. I don't have anything all that good in my inventory

825
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,100
for this. Yeah, no. There's like combat options too, though. Wait a second. I

826
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:56,100
I feel like we definitely all have rope.

827
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,100
Can I just...

828
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:00,100
Dogs love to play tug of war with rope.

829
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,100
I'd like to cast blindness and deafness and I want to try to just flee this battle.

830
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:04,100
I want to try to make him deaf.

831
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,100
So I'm going to try that.

832
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,100
I think that's fair. Let me see.

833
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,100
[Humming]

834
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,100
Oh, that's crazy.

835
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:16,100
That's crazy.

836
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:18,100
I would not let that happen.

837
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,100
What?

838
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,100
Nothing. I was just reading about some of its immunities.

839
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:28,900
about that. That's insane. What's it immune to? COVID-19 and monkey pucks? No, it has some crazy

840
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,580
immunity. It's gonna have resistances but not immunities. So yeah, I mean you can try, let's

841
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:42,260
see, blindness and deafness, right? So it says for hit slash DCS as constitution 12. Okay,

842
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,300
it's ranged within 30 feet so you have to just move, you have to move close right now it's 60

843
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,780
feet away. So you can use your movement. Okay, I'll use my movement. Cool, yeah. What is a,

844
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,100
What does it look like when you try to blind or deafen something?

845
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,960
It's a...

846
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,900
It's just a plastic bag that just appears over their head.

847
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,900
Okay.

848
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,660
Oh, that's not a good roll.

849
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,660
And it can't be.

850
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:08,820
I'd just like to remind you I'm completely dead.

851
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,300
It's a black plastic bag.

852
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,060
Yeah, I'm trying to save your fucking dumb ass.

853
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,060
All right.

854
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,420
It is able to resist it.

855
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,140
So the plastic bag starts to go in its head and you're like...

856
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,180
Just like chews it up and throws it around.

857
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,760
Okay, can I use the can I I would like to use the rest of my turn to mope yeah

858
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:26,100
You wait, that was you should use your

859
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:32,040
You should use your spell create chocolate. It's your thing. It's create water turn

860
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,060
Create you might trick me

861
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,380
Patrick you're a brawl death saving throw. Yeah, I

862
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:45,300
Yeah, be so fun. If we just all died to a dog. I think we're honestly about I have low health

863
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:48,100
I've seven what do I roll it? Yeah, I think 20

864
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:55,060
I think we are going to die here this guy what's his name has something that 20

865
00:46:55,060 --> 00:47:01,260
nice okay yeah you're up or you're you're stable holy crap my mind I was

866
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:04,020
playing with a friend and he was doing that wrong I like that better where if

867
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,540
you get a nat 20 on it or natural one you're just either dead or stable so

868
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:13,860
you're stable now so now somebody just needs to heal you we have a shot here

869
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,860
you're gonna have to heal I don't have any healing you can you were the only

870
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:21,820
with healing. Have you seen the Karate Kid? What's that? You might be able to rub...

871
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:27,180
What's that? It's a movie. Okay. It's the Yeth Hound's turn. What's your AC? Have I seen a Karate Kid?

872
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:35,100
Not a Karate Kid. The movie, the Karate Kid. My AC is 15. Okay, cool. The Yeth Hound comes out to bite you.

873
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:43,900
Like runs up to you, goes at you, comes out. You gay! I'm gay! And then tries to bite you. Oh, you gay!

874
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,900
That's why it was important that it's a boy dog.

875
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:48,700
And if it was a girl dog, I'd be drooling.

876
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,200
Yeah.

877
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,100
And he misses trying to bite you.

878
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,140
You so gay, you can't even bite me.

879
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,460
Shut up!

880
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:54,960
And--

881
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,300
It's a very dog-like voice.

882
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,460
It's a spot on dog.

883
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,540
And you're up now, Cam.

884
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:02,300
OK, I'm going to play with the rope with it.

885
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,780
You're going to play with the rope?

886
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,540
You're going to tug rope with a hempen rope?

887
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:07,260
What?

888
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,540
Why don't you try to kill it?

889
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,740
One second.

890
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:15,320
were uh... like the most important fight is using our

891
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,120
rope

892
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:20,200
i mean you could we're going to try to do exactly

893
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,700
uh...

894
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,460
like that's what it would do it through

895
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:25,460
the fifties now

896
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,400
it seems in talent of the only you will react to but it could be to want to put

897
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:33,760
the magically intent on killing you is there any can i can i fully get this is

898
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,480
loyal to some could i force it to say sticky fingers

899
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,600
no that's not how the power of the uh...

900
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,640
well

901
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,840
Maybe is there any okay? How close to also how close are we to the boat? Is

902
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,320
there a chance we could just run to the boat and like push off? I mean, so you

903
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:51,840
get away from it. Can we doing I guess also I'd like to roll a check to know

904
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:56,480
whether it can swim if that's okay. I mean if I would know that you roll

905
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,920
history check you can do that. It's free action. How much you do that

906
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,360
history? I have a minus one history reception because then you see if it

907
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,680
has some trunks on. Okay, that's an eight. I mean from what you can tell

908
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,640
just because it's a dog like it can probably swim but my dog doesn't like to

909
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:18,360
go on the ocean yeah mine either well you can't quite tell that but I mean you

910
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,080
can tell that it probably could swim not as fast as it could run okay and where

911
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:30,120
are we close to the dinghy you and Patrick is my diggy close to ship you

912
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:36,480
and Patrick are about 15 answer him from the dinghy oh my god no the ship is not

913
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,840
not the ships like you know like 200 feet away to a hundred foot ship. This

914
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,760
dog is between you guys and you are I mean you're 45 because you ran up to

915
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:57,240
attack it and it's about where you are. But yeah you're about now I feel like we

916
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:01,200
run away right. I think that's our only chance here is that we need to yeah let

917
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:06,120
me I can can I make a wave on land I have my wave or yeah that's producing it

918
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:12,360
Magically, okay, you were able to do what you did of course. How could I have sorry yeah, it's magical

919
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:17,440
Yeah, I guess I'll try to push it back with a wave that's a good move

920
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,720
I don't maybe try and pick up Patrick you should have it into the ocean

921
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,480
Well, okay. He just said it can swim. He said he doesn't know

922
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:30,680
It can probably swim probably isn't for sure I would like to push it back

923
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,920
So that means you would do this away your big or spell when you isn't it?

924
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:39,440
But it's between us and the ship though right so then I'll just push it out of the way and yeah

925
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:44,720
I'll push it wherever is going away push it inland so okay. That's what I meant so

926
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:53,080
You can um it's it's got it. You're within range now. You don't wouldn't even have to move towards it to try to push it so

927
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,600
I'm gonna roll first

928
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:02,780
Dexterity saving throw. What is it against? Let me see big or wait. Well, it's an attack roll. I think no, but

929
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:08,840
Dexterity saving throw. That's what I put it up against. Okay, cool. So first roll an attack roll

930
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,560
Okay

931
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:15,960
That is a oh wait, no don't make it a girl sorry. Okay good. Yeah

932
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,920
See who that is not good this probably failed

933
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:29,560
Yeah, if yeah, yeah town failed. Well, you conjure up this 30-foot long 10 feet wide 10 feet tall wave

934
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:36,940
Just like massive. Yeah, and it deals damage - yes, it does. And where's my d8 I can roll it

935
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:41,620
I got it right here. Hey cool before but you can roll it to go ahead. No, you should roll

936
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,420
I'm no, I mean I already rolled it but I feel like you might maybe roll it

937
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:48,400
It's like a four or seven actually, it's plus three. All right, cool. So you do seven damage to it

938
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,400
You knock it back though. Also

939
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:55,420
Yeah, what else did I say you knocked it back? Oh you knocked it prone right shit, okay?

940
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,720
It's not prone

941
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,680
And okay cool. Yeah, you knocked it. You knocked it prone

942
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:07,560
So it's on the ground prone. That's that's basically the turn right now. Yeah, and then I'm gonna

943
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,520
Can I I'm gonna break it to the boat? Yeah, can I like just drag?

944
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,480
Patrick behind yeah, you can just read okay cool like you're not it's and I'll do that yeah, okay cool

945
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,120
And that is a free action. I'll go Steve. Oh over here

946
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,240
mm-hmm just in case you didn't see okay cool and so we're back to the top of the

947
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:28,280
order and it is your turn so I'm gonna so this beast is now knocked prone on

948
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,240
the okay I'm trying to I guess should I heal him or should we just pick him up

949
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:35,360
and really well I brought him to the boat already oh okay

950
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:40,040
I mean you can use me like a bat if you use your full movement you'll be able to

951
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,000
get to the boat and you guys will be able to use me I'll use I'm just gonna

952
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:50,480
run straight to the boat. All right. All right cool. And now it is well actually I

953
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,280
should see here's what I should say. So if you use your full movement you're just

954
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:57,640
gonna be able to get on the boat. If you use your movement and then heal Patrick

955
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:03,000
I mean then he can also. I feel like he's gonna last one more. Yeah okay cool.

956
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,160
Yeah. So you get on the boat. I'm just gonna go straight to the boat. Patrick is just alive and just stable and then. I pull out

957
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:14,420
up my sword and I split my wrist and then the F. I was going to be able to get up.

958
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:20,120
It's going to try to shoot got a fire ability. Yeah, it's gonna try to shoot at

959
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,720
you guys this time. It's going to be to

960
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:28,360
or dead or done. Let's see how it does. It might not do to completely over.

961
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,960
Let's see if I'd be fine. We are it did it did half my health left last hit and

962
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,360
that was like I rolled. That was a surprise round on that one. It did extra

963
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:40,960
damage. It might not do as much as time, but it might still do a lot of

964
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,620
is there. Do we have guardian angels?

965
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:48,520
Yes. No, that says here we do. I'm looking at the rules.

966
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,840
It says each player gets one guardian angel if they want it.

967
00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:55,820
Let's just do it over here. He saw the role. Wasn't going to kill us.

968
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:59,920
So he put, he re-rolled it. I know. I actually saw that happen. Wow.

969
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,840
I saw it live. Okay. Well maybe this one I'm seeing most of this stuff live.

970
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,300
- Okay, all right, so only Dogen got hit.

971
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,400
- How much?

972
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,320
- Thatta was a close-ah.

973
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,160

974
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,000

Where are ya?

980
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,080
- Right here.

981
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,040
- Right here, just joking.

982
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:27,600
- You see, it's a little less damage, okay, cool.

983
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,440
Take seven damage.

984
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,480
- Okay, only seven.

985
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:30,960
- Woo, okay, cool.

986
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:32,760
Yeah, see, it's not gonna be as bad.

987
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,760
I'm at 11.

988
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,760
I'm surprised, like, hitting you guys.

989
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:35,760
You're at 11?

990
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:36,760
Yeah.

991
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:37,760
Bro, you were complaining.

992
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,560
You did half my HP last hit and that was like half damage.

993
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,560
Or something.

994
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,840
And it's also, so it got up, it shot that, so it's still, like, far away from you because

995
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
it didn't, like, then.

996
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
What's the range on this attack?

997
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,880
Would you know off the top of your head?

998
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,280
I do know it off the top of my head, but I'm not going to say.

999
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,280
You could probably.

1000
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:58,400
Realistically, how far can fire go without being blown completely out by the wind?

1001
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,480
In this, I would say this kind of ray, you could guesstimate around 60-ish feet.

1002
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,800
All right.

1003
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
Back to the top of the order?

1004
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,800
Yes.

1005
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,800
No.

1006
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
No, I just went.

1007
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,800
It's actually Patrick's.

1008
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,800
No, Patrick's win.

1009
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
It's your turn.

1010
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,800
Oh, okay.

1011
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,800
I'll row the boat.

1012
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,800
Yeah.

1013
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,800
Yeah.

1014
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:18,800
You can start rowing it.

1015
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:19,800
Cool.

1016
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,800
You can start rowing it.

1017
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,360
So you guys move out of range.

1018
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,040
You guys move a bit further.

1019
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:26,240
You can use your turn also to do that.

1020
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:27,520
Or if you want to heal Patrick, you can.

1021
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:30,340
I'm gonna go ahead and heal Patrick with the healing touch.

1022
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,340
Yeah, do it.

1023
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:32,340
Or whatever it's called.

1024
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:38,060
So you can do that and also use some of your movement action to row the ore.

1025
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:42,900
I know that might be like a use item action, whatever, but I don't give a fuck ass shit.

1026
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,900
Or spare the dying.

1027
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,460
Not your grandma's Dungeons and Dragons.

1028
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:46,460
No, it's not.

1029
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:50,820
She's really strict about the rules.

1030
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,860
Or no, false life is what I'm gonna cast.

1031
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,300
Yeah, spare the dying just stabilizes him.

1032
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:57,140
- Give him some temporary hit points.

1033
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:02,060
Does false life, if you give somebody temporary hit points,

1034
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,100
does that bring them back to life is the question.

1035
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,580
- Well, I'm already back to life.

1036
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:07,420
- Well, you know what I meant like--

1037
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:08,240
- I rolled a nat 20.

1038
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,140
- So eight, I heal him eight.

1039
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,820
- Do you, hold on, let me see, now I'm curious.

1040
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,020
- You said he was stabilized, right?

1041
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,260
And my spare the dying just stabilizes.

1042
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:20,380
- Yeah, but false hit, or like temporary hit points

1043
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,980
are like a different, they're like armor.

1044
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,280
- Oh, well that's all I have as far as healing, I think.

1045
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,420
I feel like I don't have any healing.

1046
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:32,900
I think I used to and then when I broke my paladin oath I lost all my healing.

1047
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,900
That's what I thought.

1048
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,380
Temporary doesn't restore consciousness.

1049
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:38,500
I do have an actual healing but I don't have any spell slots to cast it.

1050
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
So I can't heal.

1051
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,900
Alright, so Patrick is just going to be like chilling.

1052
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:43,420
Okay, so I shouldn't roll that.

1053
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:45,940
Wait, is my Lay on Hands damage now?

1054
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:46,940
Yeah, no it heals.

1055
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:47,940
It does HP healing.

1056
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:48,940
You can use Lay on Hands.

1057
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,060
Oh, I thought I didn't have that anymore.

1058
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,060
No, you have that.

1059
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:53,020
Okay, then I should have done that.

1060
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:57,580
Can we retroactively say that I did lay on hands and Caleb rowed and just switch our

1061
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:58,580
turns?

1062
00:56:58,580 --> 00:56:59,580
Yeah, that's totally fine.

1063
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,340
Okay, I will lay on hands and do.

1064
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,340
And I will row.

1065
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,340
Alright, cool.

1066
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,340
So Patrick, you're up.

1067
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,340
I guess I'll just heal 20.

1068
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,340
How much HP?

1069
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,340
What's your max HP?

1070
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:09,340
27.

1071
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,340
I'll just do 20, yeah.

1072
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,340
Cool, do it.

1073
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:17,340
Alright, so Patrick, you're back up and you're rowing and now Patrick, are you going to row

1074
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,340
also?

1075
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,340
You're also going to row?

1076
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,340
I'm going to row.

1077
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:23,140
So you guys have some serious distance now from this thing.

1078
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:24,140
Because we're strong, right?

1079
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,140
And I just rolled two D100s.

1080
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:29,260
I got a 27.

1081
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:36,580
It's going to charge to the shore and try one more time shooting at you guys.

1082
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,580
God, Jesus.

1083
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,580
Okay.

1084
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,340
It can still reach us?

1085
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,340
Interesting.

1086
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,340
It's really...

1087
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,340
No, it did not really land.

1088
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:48,340
Fascinating.

1089
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:49,340
All right, yep.

1090
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:56,340
again. Oh my god. Bitch ass. Um. How much? Uh, six damage. Six? Yeah. Alright, I'm at five.

1091
00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:02,280
Okay, yeah. And uh, yeah at this point I'll say like you guys are far enough away, you're

1092
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,480
approaching your ship. I mean if you start yelling at them now to get shit going, the

1093
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:10,920
dog won't be able to like fucking turn around. Yeah. Along the coast. Put my dinghy in your

1094
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:17,580
ship! What? What captain? Put my dinghy in your ship! I'm radogging you! Put my dinghy

1095
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,660
on your shit oh you want to fuck me in the ass sure let's go guys like they all

1096
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:26,900
know they all pick the thingy up they put it on the ship the dog is approaching

1097
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:32,860
again just firing like rays of fire rojo eyes and you guys are able to sort of

1098
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:39,060
approaching is it swimming no it's like running along the shore now trying to

1099
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:46,060
I thought it was just coming out here.

1100
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:50,780
Well I think yethounds can hover but I don't know.

1101
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,780
Whoa!

1102
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,780
But this one, but this one.

1103
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:53,780
They can hover?

1104
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,060
No, this one, I modified this one.

1105
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:00,300
That's so funny to know that I rolled that bad check and you're like yeah it might be

1106
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:01,300
able to swim.

1107
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,540
It could swim and you knew it in your brain that it could hover.

1108
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:10,540
I've modified the F-Hound. I specifically didn't want it to be... I wanted it to have spells

1109
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,620
because it doesn't have spells usually and I wanted it to like not... I wanted it to

1110
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:18,460
be able to specifically not be able to like hover so that you can do something like this

1111
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:24,860
which is like get away from it in case like this was happening. But also I wanted it to

1112
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:25,860
be bigger and stronger.

1113
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:26,860
Probably you were a ho-guard.

1114
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:27,860
Anyway.

1115
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,860
You were a ho-ish ass hound.

1116
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,180
So you're able to sort of sail away and next session we'll figure out where you're going

1117
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,580
going to go next if you're going to go to berry berry, if you guys want to keep

1118
00:59:34,580 --> 00:59:38,100

1119
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:41,820
anywhere else on the map and we'll also begin it with leveling up and you guys

1120
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:48,120

Well, just got to the office.

- Here, we'll all be ourselves.

01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,680
moving the door. I think we might we might need to put some oil on the hinges.

1150
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:08,440
Yeah, I think we need hey Patrick. Do you have any oil? I'm not here yet. Okay.

1151
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:11,040
Oh, okay. We'll have to go out of the door to get oil. All right. Well, let's

1152
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:15,640
open the door. I'm here, but I'm in the bathroom. Okay. So you also have to play

1153
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,760
the bathroom door and the toilet. Okay. Okay. Well, I'm going out. I'm opening

1154
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,560
the front door. Okay, I'm walking down the street. Okay, now I'm fine.

1155
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,560
Why is the door making noise when you walk down the street?

1156
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,060
There's something really wrong with the door. I'm on the phone with you, Caleb.

1157
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,560
I can hear over the speaker phone that there's something really wrong with the door.

1158
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,560
It's making noise when I walk down the street.

1159
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:40,060
It's making some weird sounds. It stopped for some reason.

1160
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,560
I'm opening the door to the...

1161
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,560
Are you opening and closing it right now?

1162
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,560
I'm opening the door to the...

1163
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,560
Oh my God, the door's talking!

1164
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,060
I'm opening the door to the oil store right now.

1165
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,060
The oil store?

1166
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:49,060
Yeah.

1167
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:52,780
Okay, so it sounds like the door at the office is making noise when I open the

1168
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,060
door to the oil store.

1169
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:56,060
That makes no fucking sense.

1170
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,060
Okay, anyway.

1171
01:01:58,060 --> 01:02:00,060
I'm buying oil now.

1172
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:02,060
Okay, I don't know what that noise is.

1173
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:04,060
That's actually in the store and not from the door.

1174
01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:08,060
Yeah, it's almost like the door is getting confused about his role in the whole story.

1175
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:12,060
Okay, I bought the oil. It was really cheap and now I'm coming back.

1176
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:14,060
Okay, I hope to see you soon.

1177
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:16,060
I'm knocking on the door.

1178
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:18,060
I'm opening the door.

1179
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:23,100
Oh, hey, sorry, I forgot. Yeah, all good. Patrick, are you out of the bathroom yet?

1180
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:28,060
It seems like Patrick might have died in the bathroom. Hey Pat, are you in there?

1181
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:38,060
I'm putting oil on the door. Oh my god! You're squirting everywhere. The door is making a weird noise when I put the oil on it.

1182
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:45,060
The oil is completely noiseless when it comes out of the container, but as soon as it touches the door, the door makes a squelching noise.

1183
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:51,060
noise. Are you doing it now? I can't tell. Okay, I finished putting the oil on. Okay,

1184
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:56,760
Patrick. Patrick, are you out of the bathroom yet? Yeah, you out dude. Okay, I'm

1185
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:02,140
opening the bathroom door. Why is the front door making noise? Oh, there's

1186
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:05,740
something more important. I'm dead and somebody in the office, there's a note

1187
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:10,860
that says it's I'm dead and somebody in the office did this and you it's your

1188
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,260
her job to find out who somebody like just between me and camera

1189
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:17,900
there's somebody else in the office. I did it

1190
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:23,300
and it's and it's a door yeah. Well, it wasn't me and it wasn't the intruder.

1191
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,940
It must have been Caleb.

1192
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:32,380
It must have been that talking door. Okay, I'm killing the I'm seriously

1193
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:36,020
taking the door out of the office. I don't want it anymore. You're not

1194
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:39,660
screaming door in pain. You're sentient enough to kill Patrick, but you can't

1195
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,280
scream in pain when I kill you?

1196
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,600
- Ah!

1197
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,120
- Oh my God, a screaming door!

1198
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:45,780
We're gonna be famous.

1199
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,420
- Okay, now we're on the Ellen show.

1200
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:48,260
- Yep.

1201
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,160
- I'm Ellen, I'm Ellen.

1202
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,920
- Okay. - Thank God.

1203
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:52,920
- My period!

1204
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:55,980
- That honestly is how you sound a lot of the times,

1205
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:57,300
Ellen, you stupid bitch.

1206
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:58,140
- Yeah. - But check this out.

1207
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,140
- But anyway, I'm an angry bitch.

1208
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:00,980
- But we brought something that even--

1209
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:03,240
- We brought an incredible phenomenon.

1210
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,840
- Wait, wait, I gotta do Ellen's dance.

1211
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,880
- That's very cool.

1212
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:08,520
Now listen, you need to pay attention,

1213
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:12,040
because we brought something that even a lesbian could appreciate.

1214
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,440
Look at this door.

1215
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,440
Oh my god, that'd be amazing in my vagina.

1216
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:20,240
Okay, you're seriously making everything about your lesbian sex lifestyle.

1217
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,240
And my wife.

1218
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:22,240
Stop, okay.

1219
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,840
And now, and Ellen, I'm a girl with a wife.

1220
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,040
Listen, the choices that you make are none of my business, but I'm going to tell you

1221
01:04:27,040 --> 01:04:28,040
that-

1222
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:29,040
Hey!

1223
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,360
Ellen, Ellen, I need to show you something incredible about this door.

1224
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:35,640
Listen for the noise that it makes when I open the front door of the oil store, and

1225
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,640
I'm going to the oil store right now.

1226
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,640
I'm on the phone with Ellen.

1227
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,640
Ellen, I'm about to go into the oil store.

1228
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:43,640
Okay? Now watch this.

1229
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,640
I open the door to the oil store.

1230
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:49,640
That sounds like my wife when I have sex with her.

1231
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:51,640
Yeah, but we get it dude. You're a complete lesbo

1232
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,640
and that's okay these days.

1233
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,640
Hey!

1234
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,640
Ahhhh!

1235
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,640
And every time I say hey ho, we start dancing.

1236
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,640
Yes. Okay, and then it's like

1237
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,640
that's the end of it. Curtains come down and then it's like

1238
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,520
years later. It's like the epilogue and now I have a job at the oil store and

1239
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,140
the years later and it's me and the door. We fall in love and we're sitting on

1240
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:15,240
our porch in rural Tennessee right and we're sitting in our rockers just going

1241
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,340
back and forth right and maybe maybe you know Mumford and son songs kind of

1242
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:24,360
silently like quietly playing like from the on screen not like in reality right

1243
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,240
yeah yeah and we're just sitting there and I and I'm holding the door the door

1244
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,640
not the doors knob and I'm saying you know what you know what door after all

1245
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:37,500
All these years, I gotta tell you what, marrying you was truly...

1246
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,900
The door is making that noise right now because I'm opening and closing the door at the oil

1247
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:43,540
store where my job is.

1248
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:47,700
I seriously think marrying you is the greatest decision I ever made in my life.

1249
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:51,260
And I have absolutely no regrets about the life we've made.

1250
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,380
And then I'm in the hospital with cancer.

1251
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:58,700
And then I quietly, I quietly pass away from old age.

1252
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:00,980
Right there, right there on my porch.

1253
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:01,980
Me as Ellen, I pass away too.

1254
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:05,460
thirty two years

1255
01:06:05,460 --> 01:06:09,500
and ellen is in hell and her name is helen

1256
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:12,700
and that's gonna be it probably right?

1257
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,180
that's the improv part of the show

1258
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,180
i think we should do scenes from now on

1259
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:23,180
i think we pretty much need to do a who's on who anyway briefing

1260
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:37,740
And I will wait, I will wait for you And I will wait, I will wait for you

1261
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:41,620
