[Music]

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,500
Oh, actually, this would be perfect for...

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Okay, here. I'm starting with this.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Okay.

00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,500
[Music]

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,000
Uranus is one of the hottest destinations in the galaxy

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
for Thanksgiving festivities.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,500
Ever since the blue planet formed 4.5 billion years ago,

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,000
space pilgrims from planet Mess have been making pilgrimages there

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,200
to soak their maximally absorbent dipe suits.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,800
Uranus's rotational axis being tilted more than 90 degrees

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,280
means filling a diaper with piss and shit

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,960
much more enjoyable as it causes the mess to flow

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,760
in an interesting way.

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,960
Uranus is cold and icy, so interplanetary visitors

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,640
have always made sure to bring what is now

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,480
one of the most common Stinksgiving delegacies,

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,080
bobo stew.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,400
A beef stew with high alcohol content,

20
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,400
this food forged strong communities between pilgrims,

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:00,720
filling their stomachs and then filling their diapers afterward.

22
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,800
As the pilgrims became more and more intoxicated from the bobo stew, they found themselves sharing

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,560
funny pictures and stories from online communities with each other and laughing their slimy brown

24
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,560
asses off.

25
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,320
This also became an important aspect of Stinksgiving, the part of the feast known as "Diaper Talk".

26
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,640
Messians from the brown and yellow planet of course later learned of the existence of terrestrial

27
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,680
planets beyond Uranus and matched a full-scale secret invasion of Earth's governments and

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
systems.

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,980
hold over human culture is the reason we celebrate Stinksgiving here on earth.

30
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,840
But this is the five weeks of planets, so it's time to leave the earth. Today,

31
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,320
we'll celebrate Stinksgiving more traditionally,

32
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,040
the way pilgrims from planet mass always intended.

33
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,400
Welcome everybody to diaper talk five, Stinksgiving on Uranus.

34
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,640
Wow. Oh my good.

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,400
Happy Stinksgiving everybody.

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,200
You gotta do one of these. You need to jeer.

37
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,340
gear one time. You deserve that. That's what jeering is? No. Yes. Is that? No. That's

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,560
jeering. What is hissing actually? I know, but like do people do that at a stadium? Boo

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,360
and hiss in context? Yeah. I think it's just be... It's hiss. No, that's like a... What

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,880
is that called? That's the autistic hiss. No, but what is that called? Like a... Sucks

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,040
teeth. Sucking your teeth. Sucking your teeth. Teeth suck up. But you do that when something's

42
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,160
cringe. I know you wince a little. It's a little bit of a wince. It's like a cringey

43
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
I think it's more of a wince, if anything.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,160
Or a cringe.

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,160
A sharp intake of air.

46
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,160
Listen up, man.

47
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
I think that we need to eat this bobo stew while it's still hot.

48
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
We need to...

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,160
Is it even hot?

50
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,160
It's not hot.

51
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,160
It's not going to be hot at all when the...

52
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Suck my dick, man.

53
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
I fucking made this all day.

54
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
It looks so good.

55
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,160
It looks so good.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,160
It tastes like shit.

57
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
How do you know it tastes like shit?

58
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
I took a bite of the stew's part.

59
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
It doesn't taste like shit, but there's no rose in there.

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Well, it's going to taste like shit in a second.

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,060
second. It's about to be it won't taste like shit. So here's how we're doing

62
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,120
this. We talked about

63
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,200
no. Oh yeah. Try to do a cap full with this dickhead.

64
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,760
Oh

65
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,880
no. Yeah. No, go ahead.

66
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:07,400
Do a fucking cap full with the core. I didn't know it was a core. Let it soak.

67
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,360
It's not even a real cork, by the way. This is an overproofed alcohol, isn't

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,640
it? Yeah, this is. Oh dear. George Dick.

69
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:23,460
George Dickle White. Corn whiskey, mellow as moonlight. Number one foundation

70
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,340
recipe. I'm so sorry. Pour it. It's 91 proof. Wait, we... Give it... Wait,

71
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,960
no, we need the cups. We need cups. Give me cups. I thought we were

72
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:33,100
gonna have shot glasses to do it like a boiler maker. But we're still

73
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,660
gonna do cups and we'll cheers. Yeah. I'll pour myself a little something.

74
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,780
Some of that dickle. Some of that white dickle. Pour up that white dickle.

75
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:44,520
Let's get a stew. Pour up that white dickle. Let's get a stew. Can't go to

everything that has happened this year. Wow, I'm very thankful for the fact that

00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:21,240

00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,760
actually call it. It's actually unbelievable. I think it's the stink

86
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,720
clip. It stinks.

87
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Stig clips is better than stinking. I'm stink. I'm thankful for our friend

91
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,620
It's so much

92
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,140
much

93
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:52,700
it's gone off. It's so

94
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:58,740
literally completely inedible now. Okay,

95
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:02,840
I was like it smells like when you're cooking. I'm sorry. It

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,640
smells like when you cook more. Sala Jesus Christ,

97
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,440
Caleb, you went right in.

98
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
It's kinda good, man.

100
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm gonna have a bite of beef.

101
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,440
I'm gonna kinda skip the broth, maybe.

102
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,440
You gotta get the broth.

103
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Ugh.

104
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,440
No, it's chewable.

105
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Guys.

106
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
Oh, he spit it out.

107
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
Oh, but.

108
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Oh, it's not stinkful.

109
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Oh, no, no, no, that tasted exactly like throw up.

110
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,440
That tasted exactly like when I throw up.

111
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
You eat beef stew and black caviar?

112
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,440
Oh my god.

113
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

114
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

115
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

116
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

117
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

118
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

119
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

120
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
I'm gonna eat the beef.

121
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,500
- Oh my God. - You eat beef stew and vodka?

122
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,600
- Well, it doesn't taste good. - No, it doesn't taste fabulous.

123
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,540
- I mean, it tastes exactly like you think it would. - It tastes exactly like...

124
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,640
- I mean, I will say, if this had been a big bowl of beef stew...

125
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:49,040
- It literally smells like fucking ethanol, dude. - Oh my God.

126
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,540
- If this had been... It's over-brewed whiskey.

127
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,640
If this had been a big bowl of beef stew... Let me get just the broth.

128
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,240
- I'm gonna do some broth here, too. - I can't do it. I can't do it.

129
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,440
I can't believe it. It just tastes like whiskey, like alcohol. It doesn't.

130
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:10,680
No beef stew in that at all. Okay, somebody told me to do powdered alcohol,

131
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,360
but that has sent too many people to the hospital.

132
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,880
I also brought delicious handmade pierogies. Oh, thank you, Pierce.

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,760
The carrot is not so nice. The carrot literally absorbs all the vodka

134
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,200
immediately. That's why you gotta eat it fast before I come back. I'm gonna

135
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,940
need that to cool off. I think that once that's completely cool, okay, drink it.

136
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,040
I'm going to like it. Hold on, hold on. What?

137
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,440
We did the spillers prayer

138
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,140
before this

139
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,140
and you just put your bowl down by your feet.

140
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,040
At least it's something that wouldn't be a nightmare to clean up. You have this

141
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,000
alcoholic beef stew. You got to spill it. It's not really a big deal. You got to

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,160
push it a little bit away from your feet. You got to put it like towards the

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,640
cameras because that okay, everybody review of beef stew of the alcoholic

144
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,560
beef. I just eat the whole thing. Yeah, I think you put your pierogi in

145
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,760
anything to cut now that I'm past the initial shock. It's just it's just a

146
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:16,960
shot that you have that you have to take a long time. The longest shot. Yeah,

147
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,160
it's not. This is like a jello shot. Yeah, yeah, I thought that the beef stew

148
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:26,140
dilute the alcohol, it doesn't at all. No, it sits on top. Yeah. It sits on

149
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,500
top of the fat and everything and then it like... The worst part of it is

150
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,340
the way it looks.

151
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,820
Let me... I'll just come show one of the cameras. Hold on. Spiller time.

152
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:38,260
Jesus. It keeps getting on my hands. The stew?

153
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,780
I'm glad that we did this with seven minutes in.

154
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,140
Spiller, spiller, spiller. That's dripper, that's dripper vibes. Spilling onto

155
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:53,340
for the power strip. That's a drip. Yeah, drip on a power strip, bro.

156
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:57,100
You dripped on the strip. It keeps getting on my hands and like your brain

157
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,140
is supposed to do certain work for you when you smell your hands like, "Oh,

158
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,260
I need to wash these, they smell like shit." Or like, "Oh, I need to water

159
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,740
these, I've been out by the bonfire for too long." These swim now.

160
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,780
You need to water these?

161
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:09,660
You need to water your hands?

162
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,140
Oh, you get ash on them.

163
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,860
Alright, I'm gonna try a carrot. I do kind of...

164
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,220
The longer you wait for the carrot, the more dangerous it is, I'm gonna say.

165
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:21,140
it's going to soak something up a little. I well guys, you know what I just want

166
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:21,700
to point out.

167
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,300
All three, I think

168
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,940
I can't eat the stew because of my own,

169
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,340
because I'm weak, but also I

170
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,780
just want to say thank you. That's a good point. I want to say thank you

171
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:40,220
you guys for giving me the part of the stew that had no carrots in it.

172
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,260
I did that because I thought that you couldn't eat any carrots. I know,

173
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,620
I can eat cooked carrots. It's a cooked carrot. You're fine.

174
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,520
Cook carrots are like a dirty potato. The alcohol is only on the skin. Maybe

175
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,560
I'll try. It just tastes like I'm eating a potato that tastes normal, except

176
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,020
it's maybe covered in dirt on the outside. Yeah, some kind of pesticide or

177
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,960
soil. Yeah,

178
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:05,220
guys, I'm gonna be real. This is not my favorite food I've ever had in my

179
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,340
entire life. It's up there. I literally don't, I don't even take shots without

180
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,760
thinking that I'm going to vomit. And so the stew that is, I mean, it was a

181
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,980
lot of alcohols. The Bobo stew. Yeah, the Bobo stew. I don't know how they're

182
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,120
eating this on what plate. Somebody... But it's only... You are only consuming

183
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,960
that much alcohol if you finish the stew. So we're fine. I'm gonna try one

184
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:27,160
more bite of the meat. I'm gonna keep eating. It's like my brain... I'm

185
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,920
gonna eat until I feel it, man. The meat actually is... Yeah, it's chewable.

186
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:34,540
Pretty good. It's not bad. But my brain is shouting. My brain is

187
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:40,020
shouting at me that this is going to kill you. That's a good...

188
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,560
I feel exactly the same. It was just pure

189
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:52,260
just off enough from alcohol. Your constitution is so amazing. I know you

190
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,360
would be ninety nine HP in any video game. I just I feel like if we're gonna

191
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,800
do a fucking alcoholic beef stew, you gotta eat it. You gotta be we gotta get

192
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,640
fucking plastered off of this stuff. You're a hundred percent. This is not a

193
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,340
day. That's what I'm doing. It's thanksgiving. I'm gonna shoot the broth.

194
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,520
Cheers, my friends.

195
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:13,220
Oh, no.

196
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:24,720
We have no one.

197
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,620
Okay.

198
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:35,720
Before we do any podcast.

199
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,720
it's so fucked up and then we do the worst episode of all.

200
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,880
I was a God, we gotta get these in while we can, because I'm pushing thirty

201
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
years old and there's no way I'm going to be thirty years old eating poop

202
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:50,520
food

203
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:55,820
a video once a year. Yeah, I can't do that man. You know, it's crazy. It's

204
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,120
like I bet shit is a little bit more toothsome and like I bet you're I bet

205
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,360
smelling it is just a little bit more pleasant. That is such a such a crazy

206
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,480
word to use for

207
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,900
I need nicotine. I'm popping a yeah yeah. You are going. I was like I have to I

208
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,880
can't have normally if I was having a drink. Of course, I'd have nicotine in my

209
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,120
mouth, but I'm not gonna put

210
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,360
and then eat stew. You're gonna eat. You're gonna take a shot of the stew

211
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,200
later or take a bite later in the zen. The residual mint is gonna be still in

212
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,840
your mouth and it's gonna make you vomit. That actually sounds a little

213
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,320
better. Yeah, I feel like you should have spiller completely or you guys are

214
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,380
No, I just dropped one. I just want to say, I mean, no, no disrespect, Caleb.

215
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,980
It was really nice of you to make this, but you watch Ragusea. He always says,

216
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,920
he always says to over season something if it's going to get diluted later.

217
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
And you said you put in a little bit of salt.

218
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,320
Wouldn't it be really nice if it was salt?

219
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,820
Like to over season it?

220
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,920
Like herbs and pepper and chilies.

221
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,420
You should have put like Cajun seasoning in it or something.

222
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,920
Yeah, Old Bay, like something that would actually hit the senses.

223
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,380
I didn't want to dilute the, it's not about the stew, man.

224
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,840
man. Okay, I think we had the alcohol. I don't know. We had a little bit of hot

225
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:10,080
sauce. I think we could stomach all the eating room temperature,

226
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,500
beef,

227
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,640
do it. It's dude for

228
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:20,800
it's dude for hours man. It's dude for hours, by the way, just going going to

229
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,680
the to the liquor store and they have all they have all the vodka's and I have

230
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:27,020
like the raspberry and the and the lime and they're all it's all like you can

231
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,180
see they're all pushed back on the shelter. One was coming in and buying

232
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,160
I did you see the one shelf. It's completely full. It's the

233
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,800
full clip of beef, but all the way down. I did think about bringing a couple. I

234
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
didn't want to spend too much money on this because

235
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,840
it's of what it is, but I thought about maybe buying a bunch of different kinds

236
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,040
of alcohol so that everybody could choose. Oh my God, that would have been

237
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,720
a good idea. It would have been a good idea. Yeah, look at what it looks like.

238
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,920
You know what you know it would have been good. What oh my God, I mean it

239
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,840
already is good, but it looks like they go by.

240
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:05,320
It doesn't look human. It looks like a fish shit. Yeah. You know what would have been

241
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,800
actually good is a couple years ago Arby's made a curly fry seasoned vodka or seasoned

242
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:18,400
fried vodka and I think that that would have been the best, the most viable option here.

243
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,200
I listen, nobody would have liked it if we took a bite of the alcoholic beef stew and

244
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,720
it was good. It's actually pretty good. That's true. But then we would have eaten a lot of

245
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,460
have it and gotten really hammered and all like we're going to be eating it

246
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,860
over the course of the night. You're still going to eat it. Don't worry,

247
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,380
yeah

248
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,740
and over the course of that is

249
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,700
by the way. If you're playing at home, you got to take a bite of beef stew

250
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,580
either a stew. It's a it's not a drinking game. It's a

251
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,260
take it by a spoon full of beef stew. You got to take a full of beef stew

252
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,780
every time that we mention like the and you know guy or the terrifier

253
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:55,860
eating just being like you want to come out. You want to pre game before we go

254
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,280
to party and play an eating game. Yeah, that's what you guys like jello shots.

255
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,040
I hate that shit. You hate jello shots.

256
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,080
I don't like I don't like jello.

257
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,840
Yeah, like jello fans love

258
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:12,320
someone takes a jello shot and says, oh, I should buy a six pack of jello

259
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,760
tomorrow. This actually hits. I know one guy who loves jello shots that I

260
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,480
still don't think we can. I don't want to blow a spot up on the show, but

261
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,880
we're talking about him earlier. I think you know what I'm talking about.

262
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,320
Number one,

263
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:28,640
Jell-O shots, yeah. That's the type of guy who's a Jell-O shot fan, I think.

264
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,680
I mean... Not a Jell-O fan, but a fan of snacks. I have been thinking for a while that they...

265
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,320
I mean, that's what we talked about, actually. That was the origin of beef stew was alcohol

266
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,640
edibles, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's what we were talking about. I think so. And I think

267
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,440
this proves that it's a completely viable business. I mean, I hope to see dispensaries

268
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,320
popping up. They do make... I was looking into it. They do make, like, gummies. Alcohol

269
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,460
like edibles yeah you can like it's champagne and a good bite here so oh my

270
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,460
god pierce you look so scared.

271
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,660
I love you.

272
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:59,660
You do look fucking you look like a kid about to get a shot.

273
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,860
You don't like this at all that's good.

274
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,860
I truly don't drink hard alcohol.

275
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
You've seen my figure.

276
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
Yeah.

277
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,360
It's slim.

278
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:12,860
That's true.

279
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,860
But I got a beer belly.

280
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Because it's only beer.

281
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,860
Yeah.

282
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,860
Yeah.

283
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,800
All right, should we let's dive in dude. Yeah. Wait. Well, what should we do?

284
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Should we dive right in or should yeah, by the way, instead of painting on my art,

285
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,760
my masterpiece was the beef stew. I hope that's pretty clear. I'll be perfectly

286
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:34,080
honest. It does look like Uranus. Mm hmm. A little bit, but not the planet.

287
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:39,400
Dude, chill on me. Chill on me, dude. No fucking don't sound effect me, man.

288
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,680
You know, I'm too far to touch that. The fuck? Sorry. Why haven't you said that

289
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,600
every single time he's done it then.

290
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,640
You know I'm too far to touch that.

291
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,680
You always sit on that side of the table, you've always been too far to touch it.

292
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,040
Yeah, but he...

293
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,040
I'm pointing out a logical fallacy in here.

294
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,840
No, it's not a fallacy.

295
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm gonna touch you after.

296
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,840
When Patrick gets vodka drunk, he turns into fucking Ben Shapiro.

297
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,640
Actually, you've always had that comeback, but you never used it.

298
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,540
What do you want me to say, man? I just thought of it today.

299
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,040
I thought of it a couple hours ago.

300
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,140
Beef time, y'all.

301
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,260
Yeah, okay, try it. Take a beef. Hit a beef. It really is like eating a bull.

302
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,340
My biggest beef, y'all.

303
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,020
Oh, that's the biggest one.

304
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,020
My biggest beef.

305
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
Let's see you take it.

306
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,520
And how's that?

307
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,780
The beef hits. Once you get used to the beef, it's not so hard.

308
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,780
Yeah, beef is fine.

309
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,780
Beef hits.

310
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,780
I've got a letter here.

311
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,780
It doesn't hit anymore.

312
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,420
I've got a letter here from OJ the alien, but I'm going to read it, I guess, after we

313
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
play this song.

314
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,140
What kind of fucking, who's delivering these space letters, man?

315
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,700
I just found it on the front steps.

316
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,700
It's kind of scary.

317
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,420
I found it on the front steps earlier.

318
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,300
So Julio, why don't you play this new song?

319
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
I believe it's called...

320
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,300
I've been loving these tracks by the way, Patrick.

321
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,300
Oh, thank you, Pierce.

322
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,420
And Dr. Dazzle really shined on the last one.

323
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,780
That was two songs ago.

324
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,780
There was another one.

325
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,940
Dr. Dazzle probably would say thank you if he knew you said that just now.

326
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,100
And OJ would also say thanks.

327
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,660
It was called OJ the Alien Floop on Uranus.

328
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
Floop on your Uranus.

329
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Yeah.

330
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:15,660
shit.

331
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,660
Alien bitch with a hat full of Lincoln logs Mailman open up let me see your stinking balls

332
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:37,100
Pussy get wet like a tube down Niagara Falls I don't want that I want mailman stinky balls

333
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:46,180
I just did a drug called "Flute" at my good friend Paul's

334
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,780
Watching new guy, favorite actor, yeah it's DJ Qualls

335
00:17:51,780 --> 00:18:02,180
Paranoia is in, I just inhaled aerosols

336
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,580
I wanna look at my mailman and his big fat stinky balls

337
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:10,140
I need fluke everyday

338
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,860
I don't poop, I got withdrawals

339
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,860
I'm here mailman

340
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,380
Take out your big fat stinky balls

341
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,340
Freaking the fuck out

342
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,020
What the fuck was that?

343
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,020
I did too much fluke and I'm freaking the fuck out

344
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,500
It's a rap outro, they're dated but they still happen

345
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,300
Here's a joke

346
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,420
Oh it's another song

347
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,380
Yeah you thought bitch

348
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,020
Woah

349
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,980
You're an idiot

350
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,740
*laughter*

351
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,240
Hmm

352
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,820
(upbeat music)

353
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:47,740
- That was an interesting one.

354
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,700
- It seems like some kind of drug.

355
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,540
- Yeah, I think that's the end.

356
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,180
- It's not the strongest track by a mile.

357
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,540
- No, I think the drug is really affecting

358
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,380
the quality of his music.

359
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,880
- I think that, yeah, I think something's going on with him.

360
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,340
I got this letter too.

361
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,180
- Yeah, read it.

362
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,000
What does it say?

363
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,300
- There's a notice to cease and desist.

364
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,800
What?

365
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,100
This is a letter.

366
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,540
Just read it. Read out what it says.

367
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,800
Notice to cease and desist.

368
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,860
Dear podcast about list.

369
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,760
This is a letter served upon due to the song

370
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,140
Floop on Your Uranus being played on your YouTube channel.

371
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,640
They sent it before we even played it, man.

372
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,860
I think he didn't want to.

373
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, he's playing 40 chess.

374
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,960
I think he didn't want us to to play and get his signature here.

375
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
I drew an alien.

376
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,100
He didn't want us to.

377
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,500
I love that.

378
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,820
I think he didn't want us to play it and look at his

379
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:40,420
it's notarized because he said

380
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:44,120
why didn't he want us to play it? I don't know. I guess it just because it

381
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,500
was he was all drugged up. Yeah, I think I think he wants to play

382
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,540
something. Yeah, he's talking about he's he's wants to grab his mailman's ball

383
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,740
sack and stuff and

384
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,640
I don't know. I think he probably wants us to play a song that he's

385
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,540
more proud of

386
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
what like

387
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,540
Julio, can you pull this other one up?

388
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,540
- Yeah, two songs? - Let's just play this other...

389
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
- Two songs in one day? - Is this one also about uranus?

390
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,540
Um, maybe.

391
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,540
Whoa, was this... did he send this over email?

392
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,540
I think so.

393
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,540
It's Sojay the alien, y'all.

394
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Oh, his voice is back

395
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
high again. - Oh, okay, good. - He's off the drugs, I guess.

396
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,540
Or maybe he's on the drugs?

397
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

398
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Playing in my bed

399
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,540
I hear the

400
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:33,540
♪ If the clock can't think of you ♪

401
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,700
- All right, that's enough of that.

402
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,540
- Yeah.

403
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,380
- What the fuck is that?

404
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,200
- What?

405
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,460
- I know, what is, that's four minutes long.

406
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,300
- Is that a cover?

407
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
- Can we just scrub through real quick?

408
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,140
- Yeah.

409
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,500
- Can we just, can we scrub through it?

410
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,420
- Yeah, scrub through a little bit.

411
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,060
Maybe turn it up a little louder.

412
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,180
♪ Time after time ♪

413
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:54,180
♪ If you fall I'll catch you up and you'll be waiting ♪

414
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,300
- Can we just keep scrubbing through,

415
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,260
maybe not linger too long on any?

416
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:04,220
I think I get it. Yeah, I think I'm time after time. So why would he do time

417
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:08,420
after time? I think the flu is affecting him because why it makes no sense for

418
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:12,340
him to send a cease and desist and it makes no sense for him

419
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:15,700
to start singing when he's a rapper

420
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,980
and he doesn't have a good singing. It appears OJ the alien has lost the plot.

421
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,300
I think that some things are going wrong in OJ the alien's life. It's such a

422
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,660
it really was really P. He was doing hard and so fast and then fell off. This is

423
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,640
like when I really I just started

424
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,660
doing shows in Croatia. Yeah, I kind of am dreading the news. I'm going to wake

425
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,400
up tomorrow and he's been zapped. Yeah, oh my God, self got in with some bad

426
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,240
about crowd and yeah he got zapped in his in his space. Yeah, he died on the

427
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,460
prober like Dallas. He pulled up at a purple light

428
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:55,180
and they zapped him. Yeah, damn yeah, I just really hope I really hope he can

429
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,980
get his act together. Maybe he needs to go to some intergalactic rehab. This is

430
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,000
his like dark period. I don't wanna see, I don't wanna see the last thing to go

431
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,500
through his head to be his

432
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,420
his green tongue, like

433
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,380
he needs to go to like, he needs to go to

434
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:20,420
Galactaholic. Nice. Yeah, or Flupus, sorry. Unonymous. Galactaholic's

435
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,060
unknown space, not a galactic ononimus. Why didn't they just call it unknown

436
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:26,500
amiss?

437
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,420
We are

438
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,420
known

439
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,540
I'd like to remember my

440
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:40,580
some very fascinating information.

441
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,700
I'd like to voice changer, because I'd like to remain completely unknown to

442
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:52,000
did you say I'm known in this city? No, no, I said whatever you think it's

443
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,460
supposed to be. I said

444
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,480
unknown and my name is

445
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,360
most

446
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,340
why'd you do

447
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,640
there? We go be like on the phone. I forgot that we have a voice changing to

448
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,260
do guys is beef stews kind of hit me hard. I'm not going to yeah, I'm already

449
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,800
drunk, but I think that to it's I don't think I called. I really don't want to

450
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,620
come back for more. I think we're done for until we can have later until we're

451
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,380
done. I'm definitely done until my next bite, no doubt about it. I think the

452
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,700
table, I think it's time to get going. You all must get going, man. I think it's

453
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,820
time to ride. It's thanksgiving, dude. Guess what we fucking do on thanksgiving.

454
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:31,460
We talk about people who like to wear baby stuff for all kinds of reasons, not

455
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,320
just because they want to be a baby fetish wise, but because they might want

456
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,660
to be a baby. Some of them want to be a toddler fetish. Yeah, right. But it's not

457
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,740
always a fetish. Some people just leak. Some people have a leaky pipe. Some

458
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,660
people have some guys. I'm proud. I'm very proud to announce that for the what

459
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:52,400
fourth year running, I have resisted developing this fetish when researching

460
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,980
it. Yep. Every single time I get a little scared that I'm going to be like,

461
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:58,960
"Wait, I actually like this shit." No, it's always you get scared that you're

462
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,560
gonna understand it too much. And then I never have. I never have. Yeah. It's

463
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,560
like if, like if, if, if like Jane Goodall went to live with chimpanzees

464
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,080
at the time.

465
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,680
Stupid monkeys

466
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:21,580
coming back and presenting it be like

467
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:25,580
monkeys eating shit.

468
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:27,260
They fucking

469
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,080
Jane good on today. We're going to be thrown pooping monkeys.

470
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,260
Why are you getting on a flight to Africa to hang out with the fucking

471
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,540
monkeys again just or I guess it's

472
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,720
they're funny. I don't know yeah. I need I need a hobby. You know who is

473
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,540
cooking? You obviously hate hanging out with those. You obviously hate them. No,

474
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,760
I just feel like I need to get

475
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,380
next time I hang out with the apes. I'm going to make alcoholic stew.

476
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,100
It is basically like

477
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,460
fucked up next

478
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,820
so funny. If I got if I got fucked up in the stew is dribbling down my mouth

479
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,820
when I was hanging out with monkeys. Damn, that'd be sick as sometimes I feel

480
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,340
like the only way I can even stand to be around these chimps is being completely

481
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:11,820
off my

482
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:19,060
they don't even speak English. Has she passed away? Yeah, oh God, past

483
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:24,480
past a monkey, past a monkey. Yeah, well, probably on the street. I will say

484
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,000
every time I read the diaper forum posts, I don't I don't get any closer to the

485
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,200
fetish, but I do think it is so weird that we landed on toilets like as a way

486
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,780
as a way to handle our process. There are a lot of people on the on the forums who

487
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,060
are like this is the future, like people don't understand how amazing it is to be

488
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:48,180
able to poop and pee wherever I didn't include it, but I saw a guy on because I

489
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:52,140
did all my stuff is from the ABDL subreddit. Yeah, I'd never looked at that

490
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,420
before and I finally looked at it and I saw a guy who was like, do you I really

491
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:00,620
I don't want that. I was a guy was like, I really think that if we started a

492
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,660
diaper party in the United States, it would get 10% of the vote.

493
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:08,460
And everybody was like, I think it'd be more than 10% because it would be...

494
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,860
It would unlock something in people once they knew that it was okay to do. People

495
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,100
think that everybody has this urge to be a baby. They also have so many posts where

496
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,180
they're like, "I was at a concert and I was looking around and my theory is that,

497
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:25,020
yeah, there were 200 other people there in diapers because I could tell by the way they

498
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,460
were walking." He was just walking up to women with big asses and just like, "No,

499
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,460
no, I'm you got a diaper in there. I'm checking for a diaper. Don't don't no,

500
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,120
no, no walking around Magic City

501
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:38,500
diaper. These women got diapers on Holy shit,

502
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,460
but yeah, okay, I'll go first. I spoiled what I did. Yeah, but did you? Oh,

503
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:43,980
yeah,

504
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:50,500
yeah, I did the ABDL subreddit. Normally, we do the forum, but I had a hard

505
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,980
time searching on the forum and finding out how to search because I'm not very

506
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,100
good at that. The computers kind of stuff, right? That's Cameron's ball game.

507
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,620
Okay, would the ABDL community, we'll go back, would the ABDL community want a

508
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,700
diaper that looks used? Just curious if a diaper that is yellow at the bottom so

509
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,560
it always looks like the baby is in a used diaper would be appealing. Like a

510
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,020
prank gift, like a gag gift? I think it's like a... No, it's like...

511
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,780
You always got it on you. Yeah. Like you never caught lacking. Like you always...

512
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,120
I think it's like, "I always got this thing on me." Always got it on you.

513
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,640
It's so you can't tell. It's like how that... Oh, true. It's like the general

514
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,340
going into war wearing his brown pants.

515
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,540
Yeah.

516
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,940
You know, that's this classic joke.

517
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,840
Is that a classic? I've never heard that. Tell it.

518
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,340
They general goes in, they say, why do you wear a red shirt?

519
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,440
He's like, so if I get shot, my men don't see the gunshot wound

520
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,740
and get demoralized.

521
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,940
I say, oh, then what about the brown pants?

522
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,440
Shit, shit, shit himself.

523
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:43,640
Yeah.

524
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,540
I heard that's a diaper is always yellow.

525
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,840
No one's going to, everyone, no one will look at the baby and say,

526
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,640
oh, the baby peed himself.

527
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,140
They're going to say, oh, it's a diaper.

528
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,040
It's a diaper that's yellow on the bottom.

529
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,740
It's got yellow on the bottom.

530
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,240
And a pee stain shape.

531
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,940
It's very fashionable.

532
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,840
the real reason is because the blood drips down from his shirt and then

533
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,520
obviously when it oxidizes it turns brown. That's why generals wear brown

534
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:04,360
pants in the leg right yeah yeah. I heard generals have to pretend they

535
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,600
didn't get fucking shot. Generals have to pretend that they didn't get shot.

536
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,440
Yes, that's hard to do. That's really going to be the hardest job ever,

537
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,360
yeah, especially when it's on a like part of the body that's visible.

538
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,280
Soldiers have to pretend that they did get shot

539
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,040
true yeah

540
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,200
good job. You can go home.

541
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,640
Okay, next slide, please.

542
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:29,240
This is a comment where it says, How about a brown one as well? The O P says

543
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,040
yeah, maybe LL and then the guy replies again or maybe the front is yellow and

544
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,840
the back of the diapers brown interest. Wow, really good brainstorm designing

545
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,280
some yeah, okay next

546
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:44,740
a B D L and Christianity. I'd never considered this. I know that very few

547
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,980
people in the a B D L community are a Christian. That's a shame, but I figured

548
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,980
I'd make this known anyways. So I had recently spoken with a friend. He's a

549
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
deacon at my local church, and I told him about ABDL, saying how I was confused

550
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,780
on whether or not it violated God's law, and this is what I gathered. ABDL isn't

551
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:04,200
a God, it doesn't directly include idolatry, adultery, or covetousness. It

552
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,580
doesn't harm your neighbor, aka anyone. For any Christians on this subreddit,

553
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,320
single or in a relationship, keep this in mind when partaking in ABDL. Do not

554
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,640
idolize ABDL. Do not covet others' diapers just because you don't have the

555
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:20,040
print they have. And most importantly, do not commit adultery with someone else's

556
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:20,580
baby

557
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:26,380
or themselves and save those thoughts and actions for your spouse and or future

558
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,760
husband slash wife. Lastly, and this might be unnecessary, but but always

559
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:33,940
find time to read the Bible and be with God and then find time to be in your

560
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,640
little space undisturbed adultery with a baby. So that's like an action Bronson

561
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,180
line.

562
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,600
What does God think of someone when they're in their little space? Does he

563
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:48,960
does he hold the same tenderness to that person as he does to real infants? It's

564
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,860
kind of a hack to get into heaven. Yeah, yeah, just when you're when it's time to

565
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,700
die, instead of like thrashing and saying, I don't want to go thrash but go

566
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,840
die, die like a baby, just die. They don't even know. Isn't that the thing

567
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,580
like Mormons, like when they have like the separate kingdoms and like if you

568
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,020
are like before, like if you die before the age of eight, you get to the best

569
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,360
one, you get into the best one. Yeah, maybe that's what maybe some of these

570
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:16,640
ABDL people are Mormons and they would they know they're going to, they're

571
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:21,420
ready to die. It seems like Mormonism would be different from I think a B D

572
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,040
would be not allowed in more. A Mormonism has a lot of just

573
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:28,840
Mormons have special underwear that they wear. Oh yeah, they're wearing.

574
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,940
Yeah, they basically are. Oh my gosh, bullet proof. Wait, what if that's the

575
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:37,040
reason that they're always wearing the special underwear? They're allowed to be

576
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,840
weird. They're only allowed to be weird. Yeah, they only drink soda. Only in a

577
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,000
specific way. If they break outside of that weirdness and start doing odd

578
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,920
things like drinking coffee than they on things like being gay. Well,

579
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,940
or being of a different race than white to them. That might be a little to me.

580
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,620
Those are the two most normal things ever.

581
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,480
Next slide, please.

582
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,280
You're not alone. Thanks for this post. I definitely do tend to covet other

583
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,840
people's diapers. Sometimes, God, that's wrong. Great. Thank you. Diaper Danny

584
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,720
for admitting diaper. Danny Diaper Danny, you gotta go see the diaper. Deacon

585
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,660
confess to this sin. Okay, next one

586
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:14,580
which food

587
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,600
makes the biggest poop

588
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,680
burger.

589
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,260
I didn't include any responses because people were saying

590
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:29,300
cillian husk or something. It is so funny that if you spend time thinking

591
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:33,420
you're a baby and you then go on a community for people who do that, it is

592
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,580
the closest you get to a community for baby.

593
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,580
Baby's going on

594
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:44,160
I have a lot of stuff like that makes the biggest food. I know the food and

595
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,040
poop are related.

596
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:54,260
This next post is would wearing an American flag print diaper be an act of

597
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:54,920
treason?

598
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:00,180
Oh shit, we got to look at the forum here. I mean on one hand people wear

599
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,880
American flag shirts all the time and there's nothing wrong with that, but

600
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,120
also like you're peeing on it and stuff. So does that change it? I need to hear

601
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,300
you're like being on it and

602
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,240
what else doesn't want to say doesn't want to say boom. Yeah, they don't say

603
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,260
poop that's or number three all right next.

604
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:24,420
Oh, I did that one twice. That's awesome next you awesome. Oh, my God, the fiery

605
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,560
pits of hell are no match for this little demon baby. This is just

606
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:32,220
face up themselves on a bonfire burned alive

607
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:36,640
there. You're like a weed shirt, an all over weed print shirt and huff weed

608
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,400
socks and they have a little, a little bafflement. That's why they're going to

609
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,660
hell. See, I don't understand the diaper. It's because of the weed. Yeah, I guess

610
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,680
this answers what

611
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:49,260
we were saying earlier about going to heaven and being like a baby. Yeah, you

612
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,080
just go to hell, but no one fucks

613
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,600
not even the devil.

614
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,800
Well, imagine you

615
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,020
you go to hell, but no one

616
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,620
they don't want to poke you with a pitchfork and the diaper and the

617
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,880
stuff come out yeah and somebody replied to this very kindly and said, even in

618
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,320
hell, your diaper's still soaked. Kind of a come on kind of sounds like a yeah

619
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,460
that sounds like a line from Mad Max Fury Road. Even in hell, your diaper's

620
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:21,560
I don't get it. Why would I leave? Why would you be brought any relief in hell?

621
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:21,920
Well,

622
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:27,440
yeah, you like you want it so so here's what here's what I'm thinking. You like

623
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,720
it soaked, but hell is as hot as an oven, so it would dry it out exactly yeah.

624
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,160
this is this is this is like a saying you're. This is why it's such a great

625
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,540
compliment. There's a the odds be ever in your favor. You did such a powerful

626
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:44,380
wedding that even the flaming brimstone pits of hell could not dry this out

627
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:48,720
right. I wish we could say stuff like that more to each other, like to our

628
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,000
closest friends, like hey, your your ass is so loose that not even the biggest

629
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,040
dicked gargoyle in hell could make you feel it.

630
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:01,280
they'll be kind. We should say yeah, yeah, all right next

631
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:07,380
tip for making nice explosions. I I've already tried both banana and marshmallow

632
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,280
inside and I had some wonderful explosions. What else can I try inside

633
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,000
and the first do very it's oatmeal isn't it do yes, bro.

634
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,920
Next slide, this guy knows his shit next. I call it the oatmeal trick.

635
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,560
We talked about the

636
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,560
three tricks, the marshmallow trick, the oatmeal trick and the banana trick.

637
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:31,740
so oatmeal is great. This guy says eaten or inserted. This guy says inserted or

638
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:36,140
poured into your diaper and then he replies insert it and then double replies

639
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:42,040
again to the first post as inserted inserted like like you put the oatmeal

640
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,880
on and then you pretend fit and you know you or you you feel you can also just

641
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,560
fill your diaper with. I don't have hours to make poop.

642
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,420
I guess

643
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:55,940
you have the money to eat to buy and eat so much food that you explode exactly. I

644
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:02,440
have that kind of money. Just go to Taco Bell or another person and eat as much as you can.

645
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:08,720
Yeah, I just started a ABDL story YouTube channel and I need more of these. I include you. I

646
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,680
included this video. I included this video. I want to watch this video. This is a story

647
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,120
that they that they this is unbreakable. I fucking got in Henry's journey of Oh, wait,

648
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,240
actually, this isn't the one I wanted. Wait, can you go? Well, this might be good, too.

649
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,080
I haven't heard this one, but let's hear.

650
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,540
Little World Journey.

651
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,940
Unbreakable Bonds, Ben and Henry's journey of love and growth.

652
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Time to take a bite.

653
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:36,980
Hello. Hello, Ben and Henry Journey.

654
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,220
We have a great time over these past couple of months.

655
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:44,980
I had to get used to this, but it was smooth.

656
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:51,180
Henry had no problem with giving up control of his own day to day activities.

657
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:58,180
Henry it's time for lunch. It's your favorite mac and cheese with chicken nuggets.

658
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:03,180
I just had to pick him up in his high chair and snapped him in.

659
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:08,180
How are you doing after your nap baby bunny? I asked.

660
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:13,180
To make him feel more like a baby I made up a little nickname for him.

661
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,180
He was very happy for that I had a good nickname for him.

662
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:25,180
As we were getting ready for the first trip, I was thinking about the job was a good thing for me.

663
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:31,180
Baby Bunny and I had a rocky start, but now I would have changed it for the world.

664
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:38,180
There will be a full Baby Bunny playlist to put them in order.

665
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,980
oh my God,

666
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,980
I don't think that this will mean anything to you three, but this is

667
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:48,620
functionally exactly identical to the song Jennifer by pig destroyer. This is

668
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,400
really this

669
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:55,780
could be on. This could be a bunny. Yeah, it's it's a it's a text to speech, a

670
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,300
text to speech fucked up. It's kind of scary man. Yeah, I'm gonna be real.

671
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:05,020
It's really scary out there listening. We'll know that song. Yeah, all right,

672
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,500
next line. This is that

673
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,500
Let's see what do I have here? Oh yeah, yeah, I don't need to hear that again

674
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,300
looking for a BDL gamers that play GTA

675
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:19,600
looking to play GTA with other babies like myself. Let me know if you're

676
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:24,000
interested. I don't even would you there's no room for baby. It's a

677
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,100
make the role the role playing server. It's just you pushing each other and

678
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:31,100
you only get to play as a baby for the moment that your characters ragdolling

679
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,300
on

680
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,500
There's not a more adult acting game that exists in the world, I think.

681
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Well, role playing as babies in GTA, you just don't leave the house.

682
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
You just all are in different houses and you're not allowed to leave.

683
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,500
Yeah, babies don't do anything.

684
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
You know what?

685
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
Babies don't drive cars.

686
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,500
No, you can't open up a door.

687
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,500
They ride carriages.

688
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
You know what game you should be playing?

689
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,500
What's that?

690
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,500
The first two minutes of Fallout 3.

691
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,500
They would love that shit.

692
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
That's all you need.

693
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,500
They would love that shit.

694
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
First two minutes, don't touch the book.

695
00:37:58,500 --> 00:37:59,500
Sitting in the crib, don't do it.

696
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,500
Don't touch the book at all.

697
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Just walk around.

698
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:03,100
around. Just don't do anything

699
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:09,500
don't touch the book. Don't make your special go up. He's just playing it for

700
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,740
for twelve hours and

701
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,880
that's my dad trying to play fall out

702
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,540
games. Not fun. You just plays a fucking baby

703
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:23,240
that you have to touch the book. How the fuck is I supposed to know that

704
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,900
do you think babies used to bark at each other like dogs before we invented

705
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,880
civilization

706
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,500
absolutely probably babies in separate cribs just going and then four minutes

707
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:34,840
later

708
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,500
that's how they talk man yeah. They talk to each other. They go to be a

709
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:42,060
bigum yeah. It is funny when a long johnson

710
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,020
cat says that

711
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:51,660
an adult cat yeah all right. I think I just have a title on here. Daddy is

712
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,980
daddy daddy pissed in my ass. Jaddy deleted

713
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,580
Jaddy

714
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:14,740
this. I really debated about whether or not including the body of this post and I

715
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,700
decided against it because it was truly one of the most repulsive things I've

716
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,980
ever read. You should have put it in sometimes have to draw the line. Yeah,

717
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,620
it was about a woman who comes home and her her husband, who is her daddy,

718
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,060
takes off her diaper and and pissed it in her. I don't know what to tell you

719
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,140
I'll say, oh dear, better left to the imagine. Yeah, you don't want any

720
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,280
we're thinking about it. I mean like it's hard to it's hard to get a good

721
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,980
stream going when you're hard right. Yeah, it must be difficult to piss in

722
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,620
and actually

723
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,340
she said he had the hardest cock I've ever seen and he pissed in my ass and I

724
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,060
was like I call cat. Yeah, I smell cap right now. I know I know what you got

725
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:54,760
sure yeah sure yeah yeah daddy pissed at a hard to your yeah. No, I really

726
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:59,160
believe that no daddy would have had to have a soft a soft cock and he would

727
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,160
have had to spread the anus like a urinal exactly. She leaves the group to

728
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,820
go to the bathroom. I was like she's such a bitch. He's always lying

729
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:15,320
daddy pissed in her ass. I know her well. A lot of people people decides me

730
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,560
smelled cap everybody on here was saying people

731
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,360
people

732
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,360
smelled cap

733
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:28,560
forgot about this stew at the beef.

734
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,400
Caleb don't eat it like that.

735
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,480
You're going to get in trouble. I like it

736
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:42,280
people besides me spelled cap and said take this over to to new news, new

737
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,960
website slash r slash

738
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:52,800
a b d l stories. Oh, and then I discovered a whole nother world. And I

739
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:57,320
think I just have one post from this wife treating me like a baby wife

740
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,240
treating me like a child wife treats me like a baby. Hi everyone. So my wife is

741
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,720
super hot and I love her very much. She's middle aged with two Children of

742
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,600
ours. Wow. And there's no other way of saying it, but she treats me like a baby

743
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,440
literally. For example, the other day we were in a friend's gathering, she

744
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,840
randomly comes up to me, or comes up to squeeze her nose, saying, "Do I need

745
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:21,960
to do a poopy?" At the dinner table, she spat on a tissue and wiped my face

746
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,240
with it. I have to call her "Mummy." She pats my butt in public, uses baby

747
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,880
wipes to wipe my face, calls me a good boy and mommy's boy all the time.

748
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,880
She even threatens to put me in a stroller. Once we were traveling and

749
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,840
there was no space in the car as it was packed with stuff, but the

750
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,300
baby booster car seat was empty. She strapped me in and took the whole ride

751
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:45,000
there with me in it. Now she asked me randomly. Do I need a change and

752
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,920
checking if I do well? I'm sure your have now figured out what she means by

753
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,660
that and what she has got me wearing. Please help. She even bought me a dummy

754
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,960
pacifier. He gets in the in the car to go on the road trip and she just like

755
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:59,620
there's just a bunch of like not even like just clean tissues on the on the

756
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:03,200
passenger seat. She's like oh that looks like there's a mess in here like you

757
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,300
can't sit in the passenger seat. I can't because there's only one spot in the

758
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:10,080
car. You can sit a piece of tissue paper, just a water bottle as well. Yeah,

759
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,200
I

760
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,420
forgot to screenshot him, but he has two comments in this thread where it's clear

761
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:20,240
that he is the only person on the ABL stories. He was not telling a story and

762
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,120
he actually wants help and he's saying help help and does can anybody help me

763
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:27,880
with my situation? He doesn't like this. He doesn't want to be like a baby. No,

764
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,240
they're encouraging it and they're probably like fuck I'm jacking the fuck

765
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,380
off every

766
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:38,320
posting it in character. No, he's looking at his username kind of kinky

767
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,720
twenty twenty two, but he's only kind of kinky.

768
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,800
He wants to become a baby and sit the back seat born in twenty twenty two. Oh

769
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,320
my God,

770
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,400
I'm like a baby. Wait a second. All babies want to be treated like normal

771
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,280
yeah toddlers. My what you mean your mom buddy right? That's a little confused.

772
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,800
Yeah, children do get confused and try to marry their mother. Yeah, it's when

773
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,840
It's like it's like calling your your teacher mom actually calling your mom,

774
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:07,240
your wife, right? Do you ever call your teacher mom accidentally yeah? I never

775
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,280
did that. I think I have missus Iosu.

776
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,600
You mix that up with mom.

777
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,220
Okay,

778
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:17,960
that's cool. All right, so that's all I have all right. Yeah, all right, I'll

779
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:22,080
slip in here. I want to yeah. I mean look minor. Do you how many do you have

780
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,720
because I have like I want light and anticipation of peers having five

781
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,840
hundred. This is how many I have and they're all extremely long, but I'm not

782
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,120
I'm going to read all of them. I didn't even I didn't even it wasn't even worth

783
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:35,320
putting these on a slide, but do you guys remember the guy I read last time who

784
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:40,120
told the story about smooshing with knees while spooning? No, it all blends

785
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:44,480
I pretty much don't remember the last one because I was so drunk. Yeah, good

786
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:48,680
that it blacked I blacked out. Well, this is his name is for taped with with

787
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:53,200
three DS, so I'm just going to read some of these and look I can go and then

788
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:56,360
someone else can go and then you can even come back to me if you like all

789
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,160
I can remember a few years back I was in Walmart riding one of those disabled carts

790
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,320
I was wearing a disc diaper a mega max and I knew I had to poop real bad

791
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,120
But I just needed a few things and the aisle was full of people shopping stocking shelves

792
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,800
But I only needed one or two things and I was out of there

793
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,840
So I rode right up to the deodorant I needed and I was getting off the cart and I just started to shit my diaper hard

794
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,660
It wasn't like I was trying to but it just exploded out of me made lots of noise snapping poping

795
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,260
snapping and pooping that squelch sound as it met resistance against the seat of

796
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,960
my diaper and it blew out one or both of the leg holes, and I was a stinky mess.

797
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,540
I tried to avoid eye contact with people, but I know they were all docking

798
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,440
docking spelled G O C K

799
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,260
at me. I sat down on the seat of the cart and there was a loud squelch. I

800
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:53,860
just wish I had never been in there that day. I have had a few bad accidents in

801
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,720
that store, but I rode to the front paid for my two items, then squished towards

802
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:02,280
the door and my diaper was full and sloppy leaking into my sweat pants. I had

803
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,400
not put my plastic pants on over my diaper that day either. My wife drove me

804
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,280
home with the windows down and she said, believe I had just messed myself like

805
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,680
that in the store. I tried to say it was an accident, but she was just embarrassed.

806
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,040
It happened for me, I guess, but I woke up the next day, so it didn't kill me.

807
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:22,640
Wow.

808
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,640
Beautiful.

809
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:24,640
Wait, so he...

810
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,640
This guy's not an adult baby though, right?

811
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,640
No.

812
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
This guy's just incontinent.

813
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,280
Here, actually, he has a story about how he became like this.

814
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,080
So he blew out the legs of his cotton shorts in a rascal scooter?

815
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,080
Yes.

816
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,120
Oh my God.

817
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:42,400
That might, yeah, that might keep me from ever going outside again if I saw that.

818
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,920
He's just in Walmart, you see a guy...

819
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,880
A guy in a disabled scooter just shitting himself.

820
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,880
Like the airbag prank.

821
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:50,580
like yeah,

822
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:57,860
it's so loud. It's like a trampoline,

823
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:03,760
yeah, and it's you would be walking down the aisle behind him and he would stand

824
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,360
up to grab his deal, yeah, and then it's go up and he was in front of you. As

825
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,460
soon as he started, when we were kids, we saw people walking or riding around

826
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:15,060
in those disabled scooters. We thought that's so unfortunate. I mean, maybe you

827
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:18,380
feel a little bit of like revulsion like that's so lazy. You should be walking

828
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,560
around, but then you were like no, you know what this is not a disgusting

829
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,600
loony tunes volcano

830
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:31,720
and squelches out of their jeans to the point that they're like a whole pop. I

831
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:32,600
should be nice,

832
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,680
not for that,

833
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:42,840
just the image of like, like a fucking air bag going off under the seat,

834
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,560
snapping

835
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,600
wonder thinking someone sneezed on your arm.

836
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,360
The fuck is this

837
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:57,360
okay? This is he has many he's told his story many times, but this is here's

838
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,600
one a short a short version of spark notes. I hated it when I first became

839
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:05,640
incontinent. I true I truly tried to kill myself several times, but for

840
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,760
reasons I can't explain. I just didn't think too deep after that, as I lost

841
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:15,200
everything that I was as a man everything and I was a hard ass patch

842
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:19,840
building biker. I said what I wanted, did what I wanted, took no shit out of any

843
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,000
two people at once, and I felt invincible. Then one day, I got hit on

844
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:26,640
the head on my bike.

845
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:33,920
74 miles per hour. That all had the bells and whistles as far as HP speed,

846
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,760
never been in an accident like this, so now I got nothing. No bike, I would

847
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,480
never ride again, my job, been a teamster, dock worker, union rep,

848
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:46,600
everything and now I have to wear a fucking diaper to boot. I had been to

849
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:51,960
jail, lost very close brothers. I would never see on this earth again. I was a

850
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,660
fucking man, God damn it, and men don't go out like this. I was left only with my

851
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:02,780
wonderful lot wife and my five kids and what am I going to do? I was in a very

852
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,260
dark depression. I wish I was dead and to top it all off, I had to wear diapers to

853
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:11,060
Once latter, I was able to get on the toilet by myself.

854
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,300
And as I said, I lost who I was as a man,

855
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:14,780
and I wasn't ever gonna get that back.

856
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,140
My job, my club, being able to take my wife

857
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:19,000
on a nice vacation, everything.

858
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,180
Then I had a long couple of really deep talks about God.

859
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,580
I had been a Christian for decades,

860
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,540
but I wasn't walking with his cadence.

861
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,600
My health started to go downhill fast.

862
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:28,780
Other shit started to happen.

863
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,860
And somewhere in that time,

864
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,500
I found myself having to wear diapers again.

865
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,360
And that went on for months.

866
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,740
I had been to my doctor, and in a month and a half,

867
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:38,380
I went to see another doctor.

868
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:39,420
They did tests.

869
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,140
I went to another specialist in another month,

870
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:43,820
went by and the months went by and I'm still in diapers

871
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,100
as I go to get up to the toilet,

872
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,860
but I'm pissing and shitting my diaper.

873
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,420
And I was working on my attitude and praying a lot

874
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:50,300
not to get healed.

875
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,760
My left leg was as good as it ever was gonna get,

876
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,140
but I had nerve damage in my back from the wreck.

877
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:57,500
And that had just exacerbated my back.

878
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,660
Now I got nerve damage.

879
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,980
Long story short, I didn't wanna get the surgery done

880
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,220
as it was my back and the doctors really didn't know shit.

881
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,580
So yeah, I was gonna be stuck with the shit.

882
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,100
Yeah, I was gonna be stuck in diapers

883
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,680
and I couldn't tell myself anymore. So I just slowly accepted the fact and I

884
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,720
became impartial to diapers. Then I grew what felt better until I became one of

885
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,980
them and a D L diaper lover. And now I just love how they feel. This is that

886
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:21,780
old saying, you can't beat him like it's insane to me. You hear that story and

887
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:26,960
you think my God, how you could be brought so low, how ignominious of yes,

888
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,860
how horrible yeah, she could just be hit on the head and be dragged into this

889
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,180
world of suffering. How terrible is this and then you realize that this guy is

890
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:41,700
also spends his day posting five hundred post a day on a forum alongside like

891
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,420
he's just chatting with people named like baby kitten one to

892
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,620
I wish you lovely boy and so

893
00:49:48,620 --> 00:49:55,480
wake up every single day. It's bro yeah. This guy, this guy wakes up every day

894
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,860
and he's like I'm going to go on the diaper lovers form and do a full good

895
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,660
Isabella's voice over yeah

896
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,160
here. I'll just finish this. Well, yeah, I've suffered the most horrible fate.

897
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,780
You could possibly suffer and still be alive time to go chat with my my

898
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,040
friends. Yeah, it's not so be a two thousand

899
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,740
I was maybe one one one.

900
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:19,480
Have I been going forever? I can I can read maybe a little bit. I got I got I

901
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,960
can cut you up. Okay, I'll just finish this story.

902
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:26,360
That old saying you can't beat him join him. Well, I join them and every time I

903
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,700
going something the marines, the club, the teamsters, I going hard a hundred

904
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:34,740
percent. So I went from hating life to embracing it and diapers are something I

905
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,820
just had to accept and find a reason to embrace them. That was a long time ago,

906
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:43,900
and I am still here and now I sort of look forward to every soaked, messy

907
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,740
diaper as what else am I supposed to do? I am finding ways to have fun with it,

908
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,380
so I don't get into a funk, which just takes me back to square number one good

909
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,460
enough for yeah get into a funk.

910
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:00,260
Yeah, so I don't get into that. Put me in a fun. Yeah, my life. Yeah, if I

911
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:03,660
get a scooter, I will say we should definitely go pretty long today,

912
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,760
because I think we have twenty minutes up top of us silently eating stew.

913
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,180
Yeah,

914
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:10,260
yeah, I wouldn't worry too much.

915
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:13,420
This isn't my slide show. Mine is

916
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:16,140
it says Patrick Diaper.

917
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:20,300
What is Patrick stinks giving gift? That's from last year from last year.

918
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,340
That's last year show.

919
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,780
Okay, so this first one here.

920
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:27,540
hold on. I get it. Okay. Now I'll be able to read it now.

921
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:31,940
Wondering which celebrities could be good caregivers and which would be good

922
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,780
babies. I think Anne Hathaway would be a perfect mommy for adults. Babies.

923
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:39,940
Alexa Bliss would make a perfect adult baby. That's from baby Joe 698. And

924
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:43,020
then this next one looks so much like a baby. No, he does not look like a

925
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:48,060
baby. He looks like a kid rock. Right now. I could see Taylor Swift as my

926
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:52,580
mommy and Selena Gomez as my AB sibling. Of course, it's a weird,

927
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,320
unobtainable dream. Now this guy looks like a fucking baby. Yeah,

928
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,840
this guy looks a lot like a guy has it figured out even as a

929
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:00,980
mobile. Uh huh.

930
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:04,480
This next slide. What's that? What's I forget on what's on the

931
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,240
next one. Oh, and the governess

932
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:11,080
I don't know, but a resident evil character, nappy to truck

933
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,680
driver, padded truck driver said

934
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:20,840
this next one is the future or of or diapers, which I think was

935
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,880
supposed to be the future of diapers. And this whole thread

936
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,320
was just people explaining just things that they hope for the

937
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:32,020
future of diapers. The baby link nine said, I'll paraphrase

938
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,280
what is next for diapers. What could diapers add? Is there a

939
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,740
feature that you have always hoped for diapers, but have they

940
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:42,540
haven't got it yet or something you think that would be fun.

941
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,640
Diapers could always be upgraded in leak guards or absolutely

942
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,940
their absorbency absorbency. Thank you. But what other things

943
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:55,580
could they possibly need and Marcus P said my idea is to add a pocket of

944
00:52:55,580 --> 00:53:00,300
sorts to the front of the diaper, such that it would allow males to be erect at

945
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:04,100
night and not leak. I've seen a ton of stuff about people complain that they

946
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:07,860
can't get hard. Well, no, when they get when they sleep and they get night wood

947
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:13,060
or morning wood, either their penis is erect up, they tuck it, they tuck it up

948
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:17,800
in the waistband and they pee all over their belly button. Yeah, they it's

949
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:22,520
sucked down owner make some P their boner goes well. They're incontinent, so

950
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:27,700
they P in the bed, but they might get a boner when there's in asleep as well. So

951
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:32,440
if it's down, they say it hurts too bad. It does and a diaper was not. I don't

952
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:36,780
think most diapers were built with boners in mind. Yeah, no, at least not

953
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:42,660
human human boners. Yeah, baby boners. They don't get the or dog bone. They

954
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:46,740
get boners. I don't get you seem to be the expert on that. I'm a fucking expert

955
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:52,480
Yeah, next slide. You don't want to talk about that more. My diaper would be that

956
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:57,140
of the rectangular style diaper with the high capacity of today's diaper. Just

957
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:00,480
like the first style pamper. I do want to go back to 100 and I do think that

958
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,260
they should make a tiny little pocket. Just a tiny one. That's what Marcus P

959
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:08,460
said. So you're stealing his show. Yeah, you're stealing his whole flow. Marcus

960
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:13,080
P. That's who the guy from before the guy in the last slide. Yeah, yeah. But I

961
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:16,220
think that he was saying that he wanted a pocket for his adult erection. Caleb

962
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,220
Caleb was saying a baby erection.

963
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,220
Caleb was saying baby erection.

964
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,220
Like Tom Brady's kid.

965
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,220
Caleb was saying baby erection.

966
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,220
I think that there should be one for a baby erection.

967
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:28,220
I can't admit that my little brother

968
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:30,220
when he was a baby used to walk around

969
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,220
You can't admit, hold on, stop.

970
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,220
I don't know what you finished the sentence with.

971
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:36,220
He used to get a red one.

972
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:38,220
It's like a dog bone.

973
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:40,220
Yeah, he used to get a little red one.

974
00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:42,220
And on the cover it should be a little baby boy going like this.

975
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,220
And it should say with pockets.

976
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,060
it's with front pocket with front pockets for a little red, but I don't want to if

977
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,620
I'm a dad, I don't have to talk that shit. I don't want to think about that

978
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:55,700
talk. My baby's dick into a fucking pocket before he goes to sleep. That's

979
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,060
fucked up, man. You can't explain that to your kid why he's got to put it in

980
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,700
the pocket. Then you got to explain what a is. Yeah, you don't see nothing. He

981
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:06,060
can't be explained. I know, but you know, by the way, you'd never have to

982
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:09,900
explain what a boner is. Nobody ever explained to me what a boner was. I'd

983
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,560
I'd like to see a variety of good ones produced in the US. Instead of China, I

984
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,900
like that shit. I like that shit. This next one, this next slide, did the TSA

985
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:24,180
get better at catching diapers? So I went through really recently with a

986
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,460
diaper and got pulled aside and just patted down. It was extremely

987
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,720
professional. I've always wanted to wear through TSA and it's not bad. I said I

988
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,560
was embarrassed and they said they deal with it all the time. But imagine this

989
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:40,800
crazy. We we have we overlapped so much really would completely different posts,

990
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:43,680
but we have so much of the same. I got to

991
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:49,800
and and new diaper invention. Oh my God, yeah, so holy shit, that's incredible.

992
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,840
We can go deeper into both of those things. I was just imagining like diaper

993
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,920
like I don't know to come and stick a dynamite in the diaper. You're not going

994
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,600
to go past patting you down. Yeah, yeah, I have I mean in my slides. I

995
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,280
discovered the explanation for why this happens, why they get with the diapers.

996
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,640
All right, so what's the next one? I understand that.

997
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,640
Okay, next one. That might be my last slide. Damn.

998
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:19,640
All right, let me do mine fast and then we sorry I was making a song.

999
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:24,720
Here's can do as many as okay, great to end it. Okay, does that sound great?

1000
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:28,880
Sure, okay, is a millimeter wave detection, though, that the rest of your

1001
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,560
too. Did you didn't even finish yours finished the whole thing? Let me see

1002
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,760
sure you want me to show you the inside of my stomach. Show me the bowl. I ate

1003
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:38,640
the bowl to

1004
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:43,400
why do you want some boys to he didn't finish yours. Yeah, I did finish it.

1005
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:43,880
All right,

1006
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:45,280
Caleb,

1007
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:49,480
you're having a tantrum. I'm not you're having a lot. You need your day. You're

1008
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,360
having a lie. I like it when you tell the truth better. Okay, I didn't need

1009
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:53,860
and

1010
00:56:53,860 --> 00:57:00,000
we can skip these first couple slides. We go up to

1011
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,200
skip this first makeshift diaper. Oh, my God, I may use a cut block bag and put

1012
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,520
a lot of paper towels above it. This is this is a

1013
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:10,100
last active

1014
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:15,280
is a close up

1015
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:19,840
putting guns and holsters and then just one

1016
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,120
so I just mostly put this one in because of the subject line, the title

1017
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:30,240
airport security finally got me. Wow next slide, and this is the reason that

1018
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,360
they get people with diapers. I fly all the time and only ever got flagged once

1019
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,600
and it was because my diaper was extremely wet as I was running late. It

1020
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,440
says they let they stop there. They stopped after they pat me down. Let me

1021
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,160
use the room to change as they stepped out wasn't a big deal. The scanner just

1022
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,640
picks up on the wetness. Oh my God, that makes they made me take I really ran to

1023
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:52,180
the airport water in Chicago. I ran to the airport in Chicago and then my hat

1024
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:54,840
had a little bit of sweat on it. They made me take my hat off.

1025
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:58,520
Yeah, I always get I always get clothed right here. Yeah, my sweat they get

1026
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,500
the they get the fluids they're checking to see if you're gonna blow up. Oh my

1027
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:05,800
God, so that's because diaper wetters they cannot help. You know that a diaper

1028
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:09,600
wearer is wedding in the TSA line, but that is the number one place on the

1029
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,800
planet to wet your diaper. They give you that is the one place I would wet my

1030
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:17,000
diaper. Oh yeah, yeah out of fear. Yeah, but do you think do you think that

1031
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,640
there's no a B D O terrorists going through TSA because they're so happy

1032
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,720
with their diapered life that like like I can't imagine being a diaper guy and

1033
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,840
like a mass shooter. What would you crash into to send the perfect message

1034
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,880
about diaper percolation

1035
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:40,360
Yale? Yeah, I was opposite thing possible. Yeah, yeah, I went back to

1036
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:45,720
toilet factory is really good. Yeah, I think yeah, they got diapers there to

1037
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,320
would bring up a good point, though, which is that there's never been an a B D L

1038
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,080
extremist. Well, there was a few like like

1039
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:58,200
die hard communities of which there is no violent crop. Yeah, they should like

1040
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,200
themselves on water.

1041
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,960
There was that you remember that that woman, I think she was like a NASA

1042
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,720
astronaut or something or like there was some thing where it was like a woman

1043
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,400
like kidnapped somebody and then drove across the country in the diaper. I'm

1044
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,640
misremembering all the details. That's just that's pragmatic. Yeah, if you're

1045
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:19,980
going to drive across the country, there is like some story. I don't it was on

1046
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,300
Nancy Grace a bunch. Oh, well, if there's a story, well, if there's a story, then

1047
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,800
tell it perfectly with all the details.

1048
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,900
So the next one is does wearing diapers regularly alter the mind over time? Yes.

1049
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,940
Would you say that wearing diapers becomes addictive, leading to a diaper

1050
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:36,080
dependency over time? I'm specifically aiming this question to those who are not

1051
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,880
currently in content, but nevertheless feel or feel a need or even a compulsion

1052
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,440
to wear a diaper and Roland double oh seven says the fun part in this

1053
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,380
question is that somebody would not notice that thinking is not a linear

1054
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:52,980
path, but thoughts come and go convictions can change memories are made

1055
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,860
and lost. The mind changes all the time. These people convictions will never

1056
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,700
change. They will always be on the record.

1057
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:02,060
This next thing I'm going to read this next ones. I'm going to read the really

1058
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:07,300
fast. These are really making me laugh. This is a post a topic called new app

1059
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,420
Dypestash wow. I saw the post about this on the fucking reddit plain white

1060
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,920
diaper post. I'm excited to see Android users now have an application to use

1061
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,020
like iPhone users. It's called Dypestash. Has anyone used it yet? What

1062
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,320
do you think antenna wearer says or someone says what does it do? I

1063
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,920
literally have next to nothing app wise. I hate cell phones. Lol antenna

1064
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,520
wearer says you're not the only one but trying to get a phone out of the

1065
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:31,420
hands of the youth is like prizing a ray gun out of the hands quote of an

1066
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:35,120
alien. Oh, yeah, even have a plain white diaper says it keeps track of

1067
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:37,520
my inventory. It's as hard as something that doesn't have

1068
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:43,500
it keeps track of your stash. It also tracks usage and helps remind you of

1069
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,080
what you need to order. I also like that you can look through the catalog of

1070
01:00:46,080 --> 01:00:49,980
all the different kinds of diapers was the crinkles app and iphone only app

1071
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,900
yeah, they talked about porting it to android, but I never heard of that

1072
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,940
being completed. Lazy program. I just started using crinkles to track my

1073
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:59,940
stash. It's good. I even set up ios shortcuts to quickly log a change for

1074
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,000
my watch. It's pretty basic, but it does the core functions. Well, I haven't

1075
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:07,980
I've seen dike stash, but it's just like this guy is talking about it. This is

1076
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:12,380
like the this is your apple fan boy Fred from friend from high school who has the

1077
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:16,060
full like workflow set up on his apple watch, but he's got linking he's got his

1078
01:01:16,060 --> 01:01:17,600
diaper linked to his apple.

1079
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:23,540
They need there needs to be like a like a whoop like slap sleep tracker for

1080
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:27,600
diapers and then notification that just is just okay. Well, this is and then

1081
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:31,340
this is the last thing about this is omg three. One says nice app you mentioned

1082
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,780
I'm on iPhone, so using crinkles, which is great, but the

1083
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:36,180
dive stash app looks almost identical. I wonder if it's by

1084
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:38,080
the same person, but under a different name for Android

1085
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,680
users. I do recall many people mentioning that at one point

1086
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:44,080
crinkles let you select if your change was wet, messy, etc,

1087
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,680
but they no longer seem to do that or let you put in notes

1088
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,080
now speaking of crinkles.

1089
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,780
That's true.

1090
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,380
Crinkle noise.

1091
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,380
We got a or Pierce came back with not just the pierogies,

1092
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,080
but also a big brown cake.

1093
01:01:58,080 --> 01:01:59,880
This is this is brown flavor.

1094
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,780
This is not chocolate.

1095
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,480
doesn't taste like chocolate at all.

1096
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,620
And we don't have other forks.

1097
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,620
I've never had a cake that tasted like nothing.

1098
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:05,620
That is just brown.

1099
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:06,740
This is just a brown cake.

1100
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,840
It doesn't taste like a single thing.

1101
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,460
There's clearly ingredients in this.

1102
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:10,860
No.

1103
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,220
Yeah. Look at all the layers of ingredients

1104
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:13,760
right here.

1105
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,400
What are you doing?

1106
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,400
I'm pulling the top off.

1107
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,320
Why are you ruining it? Why are you chopping the top off the

1108
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,220
fucking cake, man?

1109
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:19,340
I'm just lifting up the hood.

1110
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:20,340
But there's no cocoa.

1111
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,460
There's no cocoa.

1112
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:23,660
It looks like to be covered in it, but I guess that is

1113
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,540
flour.

1114
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:27,120
I'm going to have wheat flour.

1115
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,220
Here's the here's dipe tank.

1116
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:32,540
This is diaper users pitching their new ideas for diapers. This is so good.

1117
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:32,900
Okay.

1118
01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:38,700
What diapers do you fantasize about/wish actually existed? I wish I had diapers

1119
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,780
that were covered in fake fur with a tail attached to the back. That's the

1120
01:02:41,780 --> 01:02:45,340
first post. And most people on here, 90% of them are... They just... They say,

1121
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,620
"I want old diapers back. I want the diapers from the '80s." Diapers used

1122
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,500
to be better, they said. They used to be better. They also say,

1123
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:53,840
"I wish that they made baby diapers in adult sizes with the same characters

1124
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,280
on." I wonder why they think that diapers used to be better. Everything

1125
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,280
everything used to be better. I did used to be better. I wonder I wonder there's

1126
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,420
maybe I wonder if there's maybe like a

1127
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:07,320
like a memory that they have as you put in the Tucker's in

1128
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:11,020
maybe one is in so bad, say his name,

1129
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:15,740
but so those are the main things that people say, but some people have a more

1130
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:19,820
interesting ideas that I think we can look into one problem. I was mayhem

1131
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:23,640
whose picture is a guitar yeah that's an eight string guitar. Yeah,

1132
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,700
it's stupid. That's an Ibanez says one problem that I find with the printed

1133
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:32,300
slash ABDL diapers these days is that they aren't really crinkly. We want

1134
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:35,680
crinkle. It would be great to sound like a bag full of leaves when I walk

1135
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:39,880
around my house. Yeah, I wouldn't do everybody to catch you hear you from a

1136
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:44,280
mile away. Buridan says no escape diapers. The tapes are adjustable for

1137
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,780
five minutes after the diaper is put on, then the adhesive sets the tapes

1138
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:51,540
cannot be undone until moisture reaches the top of the wetness indicator. The

1139
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:54,980
weirdly strong plastic is resistant to household scissors. A saw trap. If you

1140
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:58,380
think it sounds like a saw trap now, just wait for this one day they workshop it

1141
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,660
here. I like someone says I like they use the word weirdly to like imagine

1142
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,400
explaining that to the engineer that's like building and make it

1143
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:13,300
use a plastic that's weirdly strong. I love the idea of no escape diapers. I

1144
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:17,040
just got a lockable diaper harness, which is close to that right now I'm

1145
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:20,140
locked into it. Of course I can unlock it whenever I need to. Sometimes I

1146
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,120
pretend that an imaginary daddy has the key and I'm not allowed to unlock it.

1147
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:26,660
Myself might want to look online for a timer lockable container to lock the key

1148
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:29,640
into what vendor did you get your lockable diaper harness from would be

1149
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:32,920
interesting getting one myself. You could try freezing the key in a block

1150
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,240
of ice, no access until the ice melts free timer. That is literally a

1151
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:42,220
satra. Yeah, that's fully frozen. You have to fill your life. You have to P

1152
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:45,500
warm enough you're sitting on the block of ice. You have to P and poop warm

1153
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:49,500
enough that it melts the ice that you can get the key out to unlock. So that's

1154
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:50,840
genius incredible.

1155
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:56,020
Here's someone who wrote a poem about their ideal diaper. Whoa for me, what I

1156
01:04:56,020 --> 01:05:00,020
wear in my dream, anything cute will be the theme thick, so I know it's always

1157
01:05:00,020 --> 01:05:04,140
there discreet, so that no one will stare wow and then covered says this is

1158
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,540
going to sound bizarre, but then I suppose we are all are really one made

1159
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:08,740
from the fake flesh that's

1160
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:17,020
like you're fucking pissing your skin. Yeah, your barbie yeah, you want you

1161
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,700
want like just a new but

1162
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:19,400
right

1163
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:26,860
of the cheek. Here's a scientist nasty. I theorized a diaper with a two layer

1164
01:05:26,860 --> 01:05:27,400
core.

1165
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,480
I don't need to read the

1166
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,920
I fear I do have to read the rest of it. So interesting all the with a base

1167
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:39,300
or that's high sap and a lower sap top layer with a border of high sap. Think

1168
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:43,580
of it like an hour glass shaped inflatable raft filled with fluff theory,

1169
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:47,220
high sap barriers start to repel fluid as they're fully hydrated and push the

1170
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:51,160
fluid back in the low sap core to be wicked to other zones of high sap.

1171
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,920
What's a p? I don't know

1172
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:58,460
absorbency something maybe yeah so maybe that's that stuff that's in a diaper

1173
01:05:58,460 --> 01:05:59,100
solid and

1174
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:03,000
power it shit bits anemone says

1175
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:08,720
I dreamt a couple of nights ago of a new design of pull ups in turn of the

1176
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:12,120
century style featuring many mouse lifting up her long skirt to give an

1177
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:16,600
impressed Mickey a clear view. Also they fit very nicely. I woke up sticky.

1178
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:21,580
I was to say they were pretty good wow and then this is the last idea someone

1179
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:24,980
had or no yeah diaper corsets like this

1180
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:31,860
way and it is a corset with a diaper on the bottom of it. Dude he dropped that

1181
01:06:31,860 --> 01:06:36,420
like it was a complete nuke. He didn't even punctuate diaper corsets like this

1182
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:41,100
for a course. It's like this no never been seen before a diaper course like

1183
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:41,940
oh my God

1184
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:45,800
diaper courses like this like this, you know,

1185
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,100
just like this, a

1186
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:53,180
picture crazy and this is just I just found them floating in the cliffs of

1187
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:58,180
moher yeah. Why is that the background? Yeah, so odd this looks like a sci fi

1188
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:02,480
fantasy graphic yeah, this just looks like an unlockable in the shadow of

1189
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:04,460
more to her. This is a destiny skin

1190
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:09,400
things he likes doing in pooped diapers as a kid and still like doing as an abdl

1191
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,900
as a kid. One of my favorite things to do after filling my diapers was to sit and

1192
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:18,280
slide my butt back and forth on the carpeted living room floor. How do

1193
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:21,360
people remember what they did when they were wearing? He's making it up, he's

1194
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:25,180
lying. Yeah, no, I don't know. I feel like I feel like if you can remember if

1195
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:28,600
you if you became conscious too early in your first memory is you have a baby

1196
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,800
doing some with your shit. I think it makes you might make you an a b d l. All

1197
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:36,640
these people probably developed consciousness way too early. Yeah, okay,

1198
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:40,340
skip ahead to the slide that says your name. This is the other thing

1199
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:45,160
it says Julio. It says your name, okay, your name. Why have you chosen the

1200
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:47,680
foreign name? You have forum name you have, so we have two kind of ends of

1201
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:52,000
the spectrum here. This next one here, this is this guy's name is crazy

1202
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:52,480
smoker

1203
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,840
and it's a picture of

1204
01:07:55,840 --> 01:08:00,240
cigarette. I think it's not a pacify. It's like a cigarette coming out of a

1205
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:04,080
portal. Yeah, it's the ignorance and get knowledge. That's just a signature.

1206
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,800
various forms in the church, and this is the other one. I have who's from a

1207
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:10,120
deleted member, so we don't get to see their username, what their username was

1208
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:14,020
originally, but he says that eon in my name is referencing my belief that I'm

1209
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:18,500
my own God and that I co create my reality. The little not only points to

1210
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:21,960
my age play, but also that I'm still young in my spiritual journey, still

1211
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,380
learning how to hone my skills when it comes to mastering my power to shape my

1212
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:29,320
mind and reality. Also to add eon is a name that comes from a paraphrase quote

1213
01:08:29,320 --> 01:08:33,500
from Heraclitus delivered in a lecture by Terence McKenna, who states the eon

1214
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:38,980
the child at play with colored balls. Imagine believing you are a God, you are

1215
01:08:38,980 --> 01:08:44,780
shaping the universe and you make yourself an adult baby diaper lover. This

1216
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:48,440
is the second coming of Christ. What did you look up to? Oh yeah, you looked up

1217
01:08:48,440 --> 01:08:50,700
name. I thought you were like just looking up anything. I was I think

1218
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,420
you're looking at Terrence McKenna on

1219
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:55,540
I wasn't really excited when

1220
01:08:55,540 --> 01:08:59,340
it's the ending of men in black to right where they're in a marble yeah and it's

1221
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:02,260
an alien playing with the marble, yeah, and the alien is kind of child coded

1222
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,260
right? Yes, it should just shit its diaper in the last moment to

1223
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:09,380
what do you have for us? Yeah, you have some cake camera. I don't know if you

1224
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:12,380
got to eat any while you were reading a little bit a little taste. It went in

1225
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:18,140
my windpipe. Yeah, it really dry cake. I've never had any cake that just is so

1226
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:21,140
man like any. This is literally the most mid cake. I was like give me a slice

1227
01:09:21,140 --> 01:09:24,260
and then I she took it out and I was like that is enough for four guys. Give

1228
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:28,180
me the whole thing. Wow, I don't make this cake. This was eleven dollars. I was

1229
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:31,780
really only going to get a slice to put me over the minimum here. Here's a good

1230
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:35,800
Been there, done that. I have always had a wet spot on the front of my pants.

1231
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:40,800
From the size of a silver dollar to six inches in diameter. And guess what? I couldn't cower to less.

1232
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:45,800
I have been out in public many times in my thick cloth diaper, soaker, and my plastic pants.

1233
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,800
And a huge load in my wet diaper, which I couldn't help.

1234
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,800
But it came out luckily. I was dressed for the occasion.

1235
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,800
But I don't stand there or stay in one place for too long, as I can't smell it for a short time.

1236
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:00,800
And I split outside and look for a place to sit down casually, just to squish it around while it's still warm.

1237
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:09,240
still warm. By the time I get up, my big lump, my big lump has went up my back and

1238
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:13,320
under my balls and I have to wet it real good. And when I can feel the mess up in

1239
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:17,800
the front, I just leave to see if I can poop some more and completely soak the

1240
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:23,200
diaper until it is fully soaked and loaded to my satisfaction. I once get in

1241
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:28,920
my truck, will gulp several 12 ounce bottles, not all at once, but half here,

1242
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:34,380
than just give little pushes until I have one or two little wet farts and then I

1243
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:39,780
push a little amount of wet poop the size of a hot dog into my poopy diaper,

1244
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:45,040
and I will repeat that until there might be four hot dog size poops added to my

1245
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:49,500
mess and my whole diaper is soaked. That's a lot of poop. Yeah, man, and from

1246
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:55,600
my waist long does that all does make me thirsty for hot dog poops for a period

1247
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,820
the time that it's okay to have yeah I'm going to hit I'm going to hit the

1248
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,240
carrot

1249
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:04,300
and my whole diapers here with the cake spoon squishy and from my waist to my

1250
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:09,780
butt that diaper is maxed out warm squelching. If I'm lucky, it won't leak,

1251
01:11:09,780 --> 01:11:15,220
but the belge is huge and I am just starting to get brown crescent marks on

1252
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:19,700
my jeans and the backs of my legs, but now I'm safe at home and I will sit in a

1253
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:23,820
chair on the front porch until it gets sticky and cool, but I might wet again

1254
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:28,900
and warm it up, but the diapers very puffy and I have a little brown puddle of

1255
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:31,100
brown under my body before I wait again.

1256
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:37,220
I have a little brown puddle of brown under my butt and it stinks like ammonia

1257
01:11:37,220 --> 01:11:41,420
and old poop and I go to the backyard to wash up and hose my diaper soaker

1258
01:11:41,420 --> 01:11:45,220
plastic pants as clean as I can in my butt and diapered area. I'm looking over

1259
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,420
the fence at my neighbor doing that

1260
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:51,020
it's been hosed of enough just to wrap a towel around me as all the yucky stuff

1261
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:54,700
gone from my crotch and but then the wet things are picked up and soaked in a

1262
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:58,100
five gal bucket until I get showered up and then during the bucket hose,

1263
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,340
then done all the brown water off everything load the washer with soiled

1264
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:06,460
garments and the clean up is all done. Anybody who has a routine, anybody who

1265
01:12:06,460 --> 01:12:10,380
doesn't work in a factory who has a routine that involves a five gallon

1266
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:15,780
bucket is a serial killer. Yes, he has a five glam bucket dedicated to shit.

1267
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:20,060
Yeah, the shit that he did on purpose. I just had a great idea when I get home.

1268
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:22,640
my wife's probably going to be asleep. I'm going to get home and I'm going to

1269
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,520
walk up and just breathe into her face

1270
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:29,480
guess what the fuck I had for dinner.

1271
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:35,720
I read one more. Maybe I can smell my breath every time I talk. I still I

1272
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:40,320
still maintain. I think the funniest part of alcoholic beef stew is if you

1273
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:43,520
get too fucked up off it and you're really hung over the next day and you

1274
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,160
have to explain to someone I'm sorry man, like I feel like shit. I might be

1275
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:52,320
there. Alcoholic beast, I think I will definitely have a already feel hung

1276
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:55,320
over. I know I feel like shit. I'm having a headache, but I never

1277
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,040
think about. I think we have to call it. Be still,

1278
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:05,320
a couple more posts. We need a couple more posts. Yeah, these are easy.

1279
01:13:05,320 --> 01:13:10,480
My wife knows she helped me when I first had the accident. She helped me by

1280
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,000
changing my wet and shitty diapers for a while and she isn't into changing me

1281
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:19,740
anymore, knows that I wear diapers, but not just where I am with it. Like, she came home,

1282
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:24,420
found me wearing a wet, slightly but a little poop diaper under my PJs or shorts, and patted

1283
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:29,820
my butt or rubbed my butt. If it's full, she lets me know it's time to clean up, huh? And

1284
01:13:29,820 --> 01:13:34,960
she's caught me in a very loaded, soaked diaper in my room, and she makes a face and closes

1285
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:39,620
the door gently. So yes, she knows, but she doesn't want to get involved, and she still

1286
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:40,620
loves me."

1287
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:41,620
- That's a sweet one.

1288
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:42,620
- It is nice. I'm gonna be honest.

1289
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:43,620
- She said something about your daughter.

1290
01:13:43,620 --> 01:13:46,920
it looks like he's going to die right now. I think maybe we should end on such a

1291
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:53,020
pleasant note that you got it. We got to stop it. You look so sick. I really got

1292
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:56,900
to go. You look pale. Yeah, you're normally all of who would have thought

1293
01:13:56,900 --> 01:14:00,420
he'd be the first person to tap out from alcoholic beef. The beast to broke him.

1294
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:04,620
The beast is broken. This man, bro, the stew, the stew has claimed its first

1295
01:14:04,620 --> 01:14:07,900
victim. Okay, how about this? Oh, no, like beef stew has claimed its first

1296
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,220
victim of all time.

1297
01:14:10,460 --> 01:14:12,700
Oh no, oh no, here comes seconds, wave,

1298
01:14:12,700 --> 01:14:14,380
and this hot shit is just reloading

1299
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,260
and overloading my diaper as a large, steady,

1300
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:18,900
thick stream of wet, hot, even stinkier mush

1301
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,660
is just pouring out of my butthole,

1302
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,820
and that has just made a huge, thick puddle of piss

1303
01:14:22,820 --> 01:14:25,980
and slimy shit on the floor, on my legs feet,

1304
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,380
and I'm 15 away feet from the bathroom,

1305
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,020
or I'm six feet from the porch door

1306
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,900
as I walk stiff leg to the door.

1307
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:34,220
The mud slide of my diaper is just hanging on

1308
01:14:34,220 --> 01:14:35,400
as I open the door.

1309
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,320
The mess is starting to ooze out of my leg holes again.

1310
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:41,520
This is by far the biggest poop I have ever just had.

1311
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,180
Just show up in my waiting diaper.

1312
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:46,560
I am lucky as not to drop,

1313
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:49,280
falls out of my diaper and gets in the door jam.

1314
01:14:49,280 --> 01:14:50,760
But as I stepped down onto the garage floor,

1315
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,000
I can hear it splattering on the concrete floor.

1316
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,440
Just imagine that sound.

1317
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,880
- Oh, like you're starting to paint the garage.

1318
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,560
- Yes, but now just steps away from the backyard

1319
01:14:59,560 --> 01:15:01,640
and the hose, finally make it to the hose.

1320
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:02,480
And now as I stripped down,

1321
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:03,760
I can see the mess from the end.

1322
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,440
Yes, every square inch is covered in an inch

1323
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,840
of now just stinking shit and mixed with piss

1324
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,680
as the aroma of an outhouse.

1325
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:13,840
I get the hose going and slowly slide my shorts down

1326
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,620
and I can see that shit is caked to the crotch of my shorts

1327
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,000
and down both legs.

1328
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,360
So much shit.

1329
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,320
They are just covered in slimy brown shit,

1330
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,120
but I got them off and rinsed all the shit

1331
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,160
out of my shorts.

1332
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,040
What a mess.

1333
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,520
Then I grabbed the lawn chair and go back

1334
01:15:27,520 --> 01:15:29,720
where nobody can see me and sit down with a big squelch

1335
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:32,160
and poop comes out over the top of my diaper

1336
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:33,400
and out the leg holes.

1337
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:35,440
Now I can really smell myself, yuck.

1338
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,520
but I am very smelly. Now it's a combo of ammonia and very stink has Matt waste

1339
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,400
poop and then somehow salvage my plastic pants. I'm half thing. I'm just throwing

1340
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:48,120
him out, but I stick my fingers in the waistband and my whole diapered area is

1341
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:51,800
dark brown slimy mess, but I just don't stop.

1342
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:57,960
I'll stop there, though. Oh my God, you ended you almost ended on such a nice

1343
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,600
and then you just read that you really made me feel like I was going to throw

1344
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:02,200
up yeah man.

1345
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:07,120
this is the worst one we've ever done.

1346
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:13,580
I might be also be broken. That was I feel like I feel horrible. I literally

1347
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:18,420
feel so dehydrated. I feel like someone has this is the first time that I felt

1348
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:21,640
like someone has plucked water out of me like an airbender. I think it's a

1349
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:27,320
combination of the salt and I think it might be the beef stew in the out. Yeah,

1350
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:31,320
I think maybe there's a reason you don't make how calling. Oh God, well, we

1351
01:16:31,340 --> 01:16:34,980
learn something important this year, because what we are, we are nothing. If

1352
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:36,540
we're not scientists,

1353
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:42,000
experimenters, yeah, American test kitchen, that's this happy Stinks giving

1354
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,620
happy Stinks giving everybody we'll see you next year. Five weeks of planets

1355
01:16:45,620 --> 01:16:48,220
will resume. Oh, I have a quick planet rhyme,

1356
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:51,900
because I thought maybe I was going to get on the verse, but it's a guy. It's

1357
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:55,060
a guy who doesn't want his cock sucked. He just wants his ass eaten okay, and he

1358
01:16:55,060 --> 01:17:00,300
says you're sick of dick. Well, I'm curing this. Don't suck my cock girl.

1359
01:17:00,340 --> 01:17:01,340
That's where the urine is.

1360
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,340
Yo!

1361
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,340
Holy fuck, drop a bomb on that.

1362
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:04,340
Thank you.

1363
01:17:04,340 --> 01:17:05,340
Thank you Pierce for being here.

1364
01:17:05,340 --> 01:17:06,340
I love you guys.

1365
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:07,340
I love you too.

1366
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:08,340
Thanks for the cake.

1367
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:09,340
Can I have a Zen?

1368
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,340
Yeah man.

1369
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:11,340
Alright.

1370
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,340
Bye bye.

1371
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,340
It's normal for a penis to turn blue.

1372
01:17:13,340 --> 01:17:14,340
You guys, enough of this cock talk.

1373
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:15,340
Let's talk planets.

1374
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,340
Okay.

1375
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,340
Let's talk Saturn.

1376
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:18,340
Let's go through the outfits here.

1377
01:17:18,340 --> 01:17:19,340
Let's start with Caleb because you have an interesting outfit on.

1378
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,340
Alright, I feel like I'm going to be the first one to go.

1379
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:21,340
I'm going to be the first one to go.

1380
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:22,340
I'm going to be the first one to go.

1381
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:23,340
I'm going to be the first one to go.

1382
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,340
I'm going to be the first one to go.

1383
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,940
Saturn let's go through the outfits.

1384
01:17:25,940 --> 01:17:27,140
Let's start with Caleb

1385
01:17:27,140 --> 01:17:29,140
because you have an interesting outfit on.

1386
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:31,740
Alright, I flopped you flopped.

1387
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:33,440
I think I yeah, I think I flopped.

1388
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:35,440
I couldn't think of any things I dressed up

1389
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,540
like the ring because there's a ring on

1390
01:17:37,540 --> 01:17:39,040
Saturn multiple.

1391
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:41,040
I think we may be all flopped today.

1392
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:44,340
Well, I'm dressed at I think that none of us own

1393
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:45,440
any Saturn clothes.

1394
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,240
I'm gathering.

1395
01:17:46,240 --> 01:17:48,840
Yeah, I just want to play.

1396
01:17:48,840 --> 01:17:50,640
We could dress up like cars.

1397
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,440
Oh like a Saturn.

1398
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,960
I was maybe gonna, I was gonna,

1399
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,640
'cause Saturn is kinda like brownish, beige-ish color,

1400
01:17:57,640 --> 01:17:58,680
I feel like, so I was gonna maybe,

1401
01:17:58,680 --> 01:18:01,000
I did, if I had a shirt that was that color,

1402
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,440
I was gonna wear that and then put like a duct tape ring

1403
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,280
around my stomach, but I didn't even have a shirt

1404
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:08,320
that was that color, so I'm just dressed as the rings.

1405
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,800
'Cause they're, in one picture I looked,

1406
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:11,280
they were kinda blue and green and stuff.

1407
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:13,040
- I'm kinda dressed like the rings, too.

1408
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,200
- Yeah, I think we-- - Show us here at Walkin' Through.

1409
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,760
- And you're dressed as the ring, one of the rings.

1410
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,320
- And then I went to the barber shop this morning,

1411
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,520
and I don't know, I think he got--

1412
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:22,520
I don't know. I think he got...

1413
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,520
I think my shit got fucked up.

1414
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,520
(laughter)

1415
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:28,520
I don't know.

1416
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,520
(laughter)

1417
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,520
It looks good. What did you ask him for?

1418
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:34,520
I asked him for the ring of Saturn.

1419
01:18:34,520 --> 01:18:36,520
And they did this?

1420
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,520
Damn. What is up with our barbers

1421
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,520
and being interested in planets this month?

1422
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,520
I know. It's really surprising.

1423
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:44,520
These guys are really, really, like, knowledgeable

1424
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:46,520
too. Like, they knew what a ring was.

1425
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,520
I mean, look at this.

1426
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:50,520
This shit is too fire.

1427
01:18:50,520 --> 01:18:53,520
So for our audio listeners, Patrick has a

1428
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,520
completely bald except for a ring of hair

1429
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:57,520
around the top of his head.

1430
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,520
And I think that honestly, now that I'm seeing it on camera,

1431
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,520
you'd like it.

1432
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:04,520
I think that this is going to catch on as a hairstyle.

1433
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,520
It looks really good.

1434
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,520
I was so excited because when I walked in

1435
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:11,520
and saw you on the computer, I did see through the back of your hat.

1436
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:12,520
I could see the line.

1437
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,520
God damn it.

1438
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,520
I should have worn a fitted head set.

1439
