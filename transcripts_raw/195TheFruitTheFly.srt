1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
*outro music*

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
You don't have to clap.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yep. That's right. We still don't have an SD card in the thing.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Cameron leaves and now all of our shit is so fucked up.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Everything's ruined man. Yeah.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This is how it is.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's completely fucked.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You and me, we are two of the least competent people in the world I would say.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah. I mean you haven't, you haven't scheduled trash pickup at all.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Nope.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
have a fruit fly problem because of Caleb's actions.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,680
Not because of my actions, you're the fruit.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,800
I'm not the fruit.

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,840
You're the fruit that's being attractively attractive to a fly.

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,280
I had to become fly Hitler and make a...

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,280
You did not have to.

17
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,640
You wanted to become fly Hitler.

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,680
I made a... it's soap and apple cider vinegar.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,760
I hate being an animal Hitler.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,760
Me too.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,560
way too many times as a man. As a man, there are 40 to 50 times in your life,

22
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,560
when I'm probably at time 15, where you have to be a Hitler to a group of

23
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,760
animals. You know, ants, flies, cockroaches, wasps, mice.

24
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:17,480
Mice is a bad one. Yeah, you had a lot of mice. I had the Hitler mice for a long time.

25
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,640
That's why when I got Moe, Mouse Problem, my old place, the fucking

26
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,680
building that was constantly falling apart and covered in rats. I

27
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,260
remember that. Rats weren't a problem though. He did play with a, Alex sent me a video one

28
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,020
time of Moe just playing a little floor hockey with a cockroach. He just sent you a video?

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,760
Sent me a video of Moe playing floor hockey with a cockroach and I was like, did you get

30
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,760
the cockroach out of his hand? He said no. And he said no, I wasn't going to touch it.

31
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:51,000
Dude, Phil will, anytime that there's like, you know sometimes there's a bunch of dead

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,680
worms on the ground somewhere. No, but go on. We live in different neighborhoods. We live

33
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,480
We live in the same neighborhood.

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Well, I live 10 blocks away from you.

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,680
Sometimes there are a bundle of worms that have all spontaneously died and been smashed

36
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,960
at the exact same time and Phil will walk up to them and he rolls in it trying to, like

37
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,440
he's putting on cologne.

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,560
Yeah, he wants to make himself smell better than other dogs.

39
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,360
I do not like that at all.

40
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,360
Yeah, I get that.

41
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
I don't like that.

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:31,600
Speaking of bugs, Mo eats a lot of bugs. Pet talk. We should have a new theme song. I don't

43
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,840
even understand how to put my pet on. What if it's just a popular song but it's done

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:48,760
with meows and woofs. And that's our theme song for pet talk. Meow meow woof woof woof.

45
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,760
good. Yeah, that'll work. But so when Mo was a baby, like two months in, he was never a

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:59,960
baby. He was a kitten. Well, he was still a kitten. He's he's turns one this month. But

47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,240
he was like, maybe the size of my palms. Yep. And he ate a spotted lanternfly and was like

48
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,600
acting really sick for a couple of minutes. And I was like, oh, shit. This is like when

49
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,240
after I had to like watch him for I had to like monitor him and make sure he didn't die

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:22,240
of panleukopenia and then he threw up a bunch of red stuff and I was like, "Oh God, this

51
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:30,080
is it. This is it. I have to take him to the emergency vet." And then I looked at it closer,

52
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,920
whole spotted lanternfly. He caught it and then ate it and then it was sitting in his

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,840
stomach and he was just going like...

54
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,160
Which by the way, these emergency vets, it's not... You think based on the name, you think

55
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:52,160
that it's going to be a scene in the Godfather where someone gets shot and they're rushed

56
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:56,280
down a big long hallway and they have tubes all in them. It's just a vet that's open 24

57
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
hours a day.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,480
Most of the time all the animals in there it's just like, "Oh, my dog ate a bee."

59
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:06,200
Yeah, exactly. And you still have to wait two hours sometimes.

60
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,560
Yeah, there's really no rush.

61
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,560
And that's Shoe.

62
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
That's Shoe?

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Yeah, you haven't heard this?

64
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,340
you ever heard this? Is it one of your notes that you said you had? No, just something

65
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:24,360
that I heard. Yeah? Yeah. What's shoe? It's like the op, you know cap is like lie. Shoe

66
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,520
is like the truth. Oh yeah, because it's so true that you'll stand your ground on it.

67
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,800
Exactly. Wow. So you can say, like instead of saying like, you could even say, like if

68
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,760
somebody says the truth, you say like that's shoe. But if someone says a lie, instead of

69
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,760
saying that's cap, you say that's reverse shoe. No shoes. No, that's no shoe. Shoeless.

70
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:52,560
Shoeless Joe Jackson. That's shoeless. Exactly. So yeah, and I mean, Jubio knows about this.

71
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
Yeah. He also has been hearing about it recently. Did you come up with this? Is this something

72
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,400
that you... No, somebody, some random kids that I heard on the street came up with this

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,680
and people were talking about it and I just kinda, I keep my ear low to the ground. I

74
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,680
keep my head on a swivel.

75
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,820
Well, it's like near the shoes.

76
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,720
Near the shoes, and that's shoe, you know?

77
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,560
I'm getting a text from Jubio.

78
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,560
What's he saying?

79
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,560
Is he saying shoe?

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Maybe.

81
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,320
He says his power went out.

82
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,480
His power went out right now?

83
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,240
Yeah, I don't know if he's still...

84
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,640
Well, I mean, it's recording on...

85
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

86
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,240
He'll come back when he gets a chance.

87
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,240
Yeah, well...

88
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,840
But that does mean that I do not have any backup.

89
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,560
Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna...

90
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,560
I'm not even...

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,160
You're not even a little bit skeptical about shoe.

92
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,700
No, I think that maybe you made it up and this is you trying to plant the seeds.

93
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,240
That is no shoe. That is reverse shoe that you're saying. I did not make it up and that's

94
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,660
shoe.

95
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,420
Maybe Jubio or Rex made it up?

96
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,820
Nobody that I know made it up, man. I'm telling you, I was just walking by.

97
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,820
You're planting the seeds?

98
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,220
I was walking by a perfect kind of like Taco Bell commercial group of people, you know,

99
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,620
who were like all sitting there having a fun time, fourth meal style. And they were saying,

100
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,420
Oh, this is complete shoe.

101
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,020
Maybe they're saying bull shoe.

102
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,020
No, no, no.

103
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:09,020
Bull shoe.

104
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,020
Maybe they're saying shoot.

105
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
No, that doesn't make any sense.

106
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,460
I think it was shoe because it makes sense.

107
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,460
Cap is lie.

108
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,460
Shoe is the truth.

109
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,780
It's a bottom up system.

110
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,440
What would be like pants or belt?

111
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,660
Pants or belt is like a half truth.

112
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:30,540
So it's like if you misremember something, you would say like...

113
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,980
And then when something's above belt.

114
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,980
Yes.

115
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,500
That's like being above board.

116
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,920
You know, when people say above belt.

117
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Above your belt.

118
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,780
I've heard that in my life.

119
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,260
Yes, people have said that.

120
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,940
Now that I think about it, I've heard that too.

121
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,900
I've heard that maybe more than cap and shoe.

122
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,860
Yeah, people say that's above belt.

123
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
Because that's more than half the truth.

124
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
Or below the belt.

125
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,820
Below the belt means more than half a lie.

126
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,340
But when someone says something's below the belt, that means that it's like, oh, that's

127
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,000
a cheap shot. Yeah, but that's in a different context. Yeah, if you're talking about truths

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,220
and lies, as many many men in America often are, you say, Oh, that's that's more than

129
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:17,280
below the belt. That's it. That's knee pads. And then if you go up, you say, that's a cummerbund.

130
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,360
You know, that's like above the belt kind of mid riff area, you know, or that's a bra

131
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,400
that's a sports bra. That's a necklace, you know, so it's all it's kind of a gradient.

132
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,400
But shoe and cap are the two ends of it, I would say.

133
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Okay, so it's a full spectrum.

134
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Yeah, of truths and lies.

135
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Because I'm sick of, or not I'm sick of,

136
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
these random people that I heard say this,

137
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,400
this amazingly diverse group of people

138
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
of all different ages,

139
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
and races, and religions, creeds, and well...

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,400
You know what? I'm fine with every race,

141
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
fine with every religion,

142
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
but I'm not fine with every creed.

143
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Creeds are, you know,

144
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
it's a slippery slope once you start

145
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,400
letting people with different creeds...

146
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,200
different creeds. There are certain creeds that I do not want in this country. No, absolutely

147
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:09,000
samurai. I would want them for our army. Samurai do not want to be a part of an army that is

148
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,840
not completely 100% samurai. Yeah, samurai want a fully samurai. They want to see every

149
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,620
they want to open their eyes and see all they don't want to do. They don't want like a like,

150
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,560
you know, like really extremely diverse army. No assassins. That's a creed that I don't want

151
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,940
Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no.

152
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,100
Because I mean, look what happened.

153
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,100
We'll get to happen to our president, McKinley.

154
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:34,980
Look what happened to Bethlehem in the in the year like 100.

155
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,440
Yeah, that was not going so well.

156
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,980
There's some crazy lunatic walking around with a knife hand. Yeah.

157
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,820
That's not bad. Huh?

158
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,440
Which I thought the assassins created that this took place in Italy.

159
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,540
Not the one of them is like Bible times.

160
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,460
Yeah, if I remember correctly, it's kind of cool.

161
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,460
It is kind of cool. Those games are fun.

162
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,960
I didn't play the pirate one, though, but I really know my brother.

163
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,160
my brother's really into those games. The Black Pearl. The Black Sails or something. The Black

164
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:04,200
Pearl. It's not called the Black Pearl. If you were on... You're conflating Pirates of

165
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:11,320
the Caribbean. Caribbean. Yeah, why do people say Caribbean? Why don't people say Caribbean?

166
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:15,480
They say Caribbean unless it's Pirates. Yeah, and then they say Caribbean. That used to

167
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,880
really bother me when I was a child. I kind of grew out of that. Because then people would

168
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,640
like, you know, like your uncle reads the DVD case and he's like, oh, Pirates of the

169
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,240
the Caribbean, you're like, "It's not Caribbean, it's Caribbean."

170
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,640
It's actually the Caribbean now for this one movie, asshole.

171
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Yeah.

172
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,780
That's cool that they made that movie and then were like, "Oh, then we should start

173
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,240
making the other rides."

174
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,680
Oh, yeah, they made...

175
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
Haunted Mansion.

176
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,000
Haunted Mansion, and then they just remade it.

177
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yeah.

178
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
With...

179
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,440
LaKeith Stanfield and Danny DeVito.

180
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,600
I almost went and saw it, but I saw Talk to Me.

181
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Talk to Me.

182
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,600
Talk to Me.

183
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:58,120
But I wish that I'd seen a hundred man she gives that actually looks funny as fuck you think it looks amazing

184
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,440
It's got a son menage in it. Oh, yeah, whoa. Yeah, and he plays a

185
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,960
Sarcastic asshole damn

186
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:10,320
So it's basically my kind of movie. Yeah, yeah, it's got movies. I like I was reading I was reading online

187
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,880
Something that's gone viral on the Twitter verse what?

188
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,160
Something that's gone viral on X. What's gone viral on X's?

189
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,120
was

190
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,120
people complaining that there's too much product placement in the movie.

191
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,120
Of Haunted Mansion?

192
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,120
Yeah.

193
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
There's like a scene where...

194
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
For a ghostly specter?

195
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
Well, if there was product placement for maybe like ghost busting services,

196
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,120
I don't think that that would be a problem.

197
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,120
That would not be a problem at all.

198
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,120
But I guess there's a scene where Lakeith Stanfield is describing

199
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:45,120
the way his wife passed away.

200
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,120
And he's talking, he's got this big long speech,

201
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,480
speech and he's like, she wanted to stop it. Baskin Robbins.

202
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,360
And it's so clear that it was an ADR.

203
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,520
Like they threw like Baskin Robbins in.

204
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,640
Just so they'd be like, yeah. That's awesome.

205
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
But also like that's the funniest fucking product placement.

206
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,280
Like, I guess it makes a little bit of sense. Like,

207
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,480
I don't care too much when they like talk about like,

208
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,920
there's like product placement in a movie. Cause it's like, yeah, like it's like,

209
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,800
like when you talk in like conversations, like, Oh,

210
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,160
I'm going to go to fucking McDonald's or something.

211
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,000
Yeah.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,840
You know, like that's normal.

213
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,800
That's realistic.

214
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,280
But like, I don't know.

215
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,800
Like when a scene takes,

216
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,000
like when somebody works at like Baskin Robbins

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,880
or something like an Ant-Man,

218
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,320
I think that's kind of egregious.

219
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,020
But like saying it in conversation like that,

220
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,080
I don't think that's too bad.

221
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,100
I think that these brands need to realize

222
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,440
that the only way that you can do a product placement

223
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,880
in a movie and get away with it

224
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,000
is that you need to be subtly poking fun at your brand in a hilarious manner.

225
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,960
So if they work at Baskin Robbins...

226
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,840
Well, that's what, yeah, I mean that's how it is in the movie.

227
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,840
In Ant-Man?

228
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,560
Yeah, and Greg Turkington is the manager.

229
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Where, at where?

230
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,560
Baskin Robbins.

231
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,560
It is a Baskin Robbins?

232
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,560
Yeah.

233
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,560
So does he...

234
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,640
Ant-Man works at Baskin Robbins and he gets fired for not being a good employee.

235
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,600
Does he say, so because he's not a good employee, does he say something, he looks at, let me

236
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,920
guess, he looks at the Rocky Road and he says like, "What's this, poop ice cream?"

237
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
Yeah.

238
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:10,920
Something like that?

239
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
Basically it's stuff like that.

240
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,920
And he goes through every single, all 32.

241
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
And he says, "This looks like jizz. This looks like piss."

242
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:24,920
The white one is jizz, the lemon one is piss, the chocolate is poop, chocolate chip is jizz with poop in it.

243
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:28,920
Pistachio is a vitamin B piss.

244
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,920
Rocky Road, again, that's poop with chunks of poop.

245
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,920
That's chili poop.

246
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Chili poop.

247
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Okay, and then what is...

248
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
Strawberry is a period jizz.

249
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,180
(laughing)

250
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,460
Okay, and what about Superman?

251
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,720
Superman, what's that?

252
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,560
Is that a Baskin?

253
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,240
I've really never been to Baskin Robbins.

254
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,100
Did you just say, "What is Superman ice cream?"

255
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,400
I've really never been to Baskin Robbins.

256
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,280
Superman ice cream.

257
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,400
I'm realizing now, I've been to, I'm a Dairy Queen.

258
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,240
Wait, you'll see this when you see it

259
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,680
when you show a photo of it right now.

260
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,640
I'm a Dairy Queen boy.

261
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,960
Superman ice cream is this.

262
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,520
What would Ant-Man say about this shit?

263
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,960
Oh, buddy.

264
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,880
I mean, he'd have endless quips about this.

265
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,880
This looks like period jizz with pee and blue.

266
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,200
- Oh, God. - Blue crap.

267
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,840
- So let me guess, Greg Turkington fires him.

268
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,680
- Yeah.

269
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,500
- Wow.

270
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,520
Does he fire him in kind of a dry way?

271
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,360
- Yes, a very dry way.

272
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,280
- Oh, I love that.

273
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,760
Or does he do his guy?

274
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,720
- He does his guy.

275
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,840
- His character guy.

276
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,680
- Not Neil Hamburger.

277
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,800
- He doesn't do Neil Hamburger?

278
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,640
- That would have taken me out of the movie.

279
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,880
- Get out of my ice cream store.

280
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,380
Why? Why are you such a bad employee?

281
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Yeah, and then he told him...

282
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:47,880
Because you called the ice cream period more of just vitamin BP.

283
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,880
That would... they should have done that.

284
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Yeah, they should have had Neil Hamburger in it.

285
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,380
But he already had a movie, Entertain Me.

286
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,380
Where I hear that it actually has emotions.

287
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,380
It does. I actually love that movie so much.

288
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,380
I've never seen that movie.

289
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,380
Yeah, it's really good.

290
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,380
I saw the comedy.

291
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,880
Comedy is also so good.

292
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,380
I thought it was really good, yeah.

293
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,700
It was a little weird.

294
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,060
But as I get older, I'm starting to like strange stuff.

295
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,460
It's a little weird, but I expect that from Heidecker.

296
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:19,100
Yeah, you know what I called it?

297
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,660
You know what I said?

298
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,740
I watched it with my wife, and you know what I said right afterwards?

299
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,580
I said, "That was Heideckercore."

300
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,220
Yeah.

301
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:24,700
Yeah.

302
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,380
This is giving me Tim and Eric vibes.

303
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,580
This is Heideckercore.

304
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:27,900
Yeah.

305
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,660
And then, turns out I was right.

306
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,620
He's in the movie.

307
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,300
You didn't even know that while I was watching it.

308
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,660
I thought that it was just kind of...

309
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,660
I couldn't recognize him because he's got a beard.

310
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
I thought it was Ryan Reynolds.

311
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Yeah.

312
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
But apparently it was.

313
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
He does.

314
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,660
He looks so good in that movie.

315
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,660
Tim Heidecker.

316
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,220
He's a really good looking guy.

317
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,220
Yeah.

318
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,100
He's like skinny as hell now though.

319
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,900
I'm worried he's on the Aussie.

320
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
You think he's on Aussie?

321
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
Yeah.

322
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
Should we get on Ozympic?

323
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:58,340
I don't think that people would like me if I was skinny.

324
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,700
You think people wouldn't like you?

325
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,260
If you were skinny?

326
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Really?

327
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:04,260
No, I think I would just look so...

328
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
too threatening because you're good looking?

329
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
I think it is.

330
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,980
If you were like shredded it would be a really big problem?

331
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:10,980
Maybe.

332
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:11,980
And people would be like fuck.

333
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,220
Like you know when you see the pictures of Post Malone where it's like clear that he's

334
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,220
been doing Aussie.

335
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,020
Oh and he's scratching his arms.

336
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Yeah.

337
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Yeah.

338
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,020
It's clear.

339
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,020
I don't know.

340
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,020
I think it would change me too much.

341
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,500
You think it would change you too much?

342
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Yeah.

343
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
To be skinny?

344
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,140
I used to be rail thin.

345
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,900
It'd make you good at skateboarding though.

346
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
Yeah.

347
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:34,100
You'd be able to do ollies and nollies higher.

348
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,900
I think... What's better, an Ollie or a Nollie? A Nollie is a bit more impressive. Wow. Speaking

349
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:48,180
of, Tim Pool. Oh yeah. I already got... You got flamed for this. And I agree. I agree with

350
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:54,220
the flamers. I... You... Okay, for people who don't know, Patrick went after Tim Pool in

351
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:01,340
what can only be called kind of an Aspergic rage that you kind of dipped into. Yeah. Where

352
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,140
you all you could think about was how this was not an impressive trick that he was doing.

353
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:13,420
It's not that it's not that it's not impressive. It's just like shut up. It's it's the type

354
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,800
of trick that like you do if you're the guy trying to like you're like the old guy trying

355
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,940
to impress young kids at the skate. So it's like the thing where you do the you put one

356
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,900
foot under one foot over on an upside down skateboard and then you flip it and you end

357
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,400
No, no, it's not a strawberry milkshake.

358
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,100
Is that what that's called?

359
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,300
Yeah, that's what that's called.

360
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,700
It's not like that.

361
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:37,340
It's like, I don't know, it's just one of those fucking stupid,

362
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,140
like technical tricks.

363
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,240
The reason that I fucking hate that thing,

364
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,800
the full name of that trick that he does is a hang ten pressure

365
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,700
inward, inward heel flip.

366
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,840
OK. Late flip.

367
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,800
Why is that? Hang ten pressure, inward heel flip, late flip.

368
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,540
That sounds like it would be an amazing combo on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

369
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,400
Well, that's no. Why? Because it would have it should have a cooler name. One.

370
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:06,260
All right. The Tim flip about the Tim flip. Yeah, I guess it's the Tim flip

371
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:10,540
the pull drop. Yeah, but I don't know. That was just like it's like what?

372
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,180
Like somebody who's never seen skateboarding.

373
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,520
That's amazing. No.

374
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,720
What is making you so mad, bro?

375
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,160
You don't like him because he's bald.

376
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,060
Look, he even does the thing that skaters do where they bitch and moan

377
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,020
because they fell over.

378
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,220
It's just so fucking kooky, dude.

379
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,840
I there's no way that I could.

380
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,520
The thing that I was like mad about is like I can't explain why that sucks to

381
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,060
people.

382
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,140
Then it doesn't suck.

383
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,900
I can't explain why that that why that is the fucking worst thing that you can do.

384
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,320
It's not the worst thing you can do.

385
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,900
It's the worst thing you can do on a skateboard.

386
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,600
You can't do that.

387
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,080
No, I wouldn't want to.

388
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,380
Yeah, that shit, those, it's like a thing that like a YouTuber does.

389
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,900
It's not like... He's a YouTuber.

390
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,140
Yeah. You know what... What are you expecting from fucking Tim Pool, man?

391
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:03,420
Dude, if he posted literally just like

392
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,380
Kickflip 50/50, something like that, something simple.

393
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:11,420
Uh-huh. It would show that he has an actual like

394
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,940
understanding of like what makes skateboarding like good,

395
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,500
what people like, like about it.

396
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,060
But people like that. I like that.

397
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,380
I don't even know what this guy...

398
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,020
I just know he's a classical liberal.

399
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,900
I don't know anything about this fucking guy.

400
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:27,580
Right. And this made you a big fan of his?

401
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:28,820
Dude, he's the man.

402
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,940
The best game wearer I've ever seen.

403
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,260
Are you kidding me?

404
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,860
I don't know.

405
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,900
Even if he just posted just like him doing a fucking like wall ride or something,

406
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,620
that's like way cooler.

407
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,900
That's way, that's way sicker.

408
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,780
It's about it's about looking cool.

409
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,660
I mean, I will say, you would rather like.

410
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,420
Like what it's like, how fucking like Michael Jordan is like really good at

411
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,460
like what's the thing that everyone talks about him for?

412
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:54,820
Basketball, he's really good at basketball.

413
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:57,940
It's not that he like, it's just like the way that he did like dunks and stuff.

414
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,380
He's a high flying acrobatic finisher, greatest finisher of all time.

415
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:09,940
Exactly, so that's like the equivalent of just doing like one really good like lofty kickflip.

416
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,180
Okay, and so what's the basket, make me understand.

417
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:20,980
So the basketball equivalent of that is just like just being really good at like

418
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,580
sinking like a free throws all the time.

419
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,700
So if you can do a bunch of tricks

420
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:32,500
and you can't figure out a way to like make them look good.

421
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,000
Uh huh. There's no fucking point of that.

422
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,040
There's like no point like like the tricks are like, yeah, cool.

423
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,420
You like you can do fucking tricks like you can do tricks in your mom's backyard.

424
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,960
So you're saying that was not you can't take it to the streets

425
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,180
or the parks or whatever.

426
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,220
It's fucking bullshit.

427
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:53,420
Okay, so this is the equivalent of like maybe shoot like shooting half court

428
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,740
shots or something. And okay, all right, that's what it is. It's a half court

429
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,260
shot. Yeah, because guys will go to the white guys will go to the basketball

430
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,860
court when there's nobody there and shoot half court shots and make one out

431
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:08,620
of five and be like exactly and post a video of it. You know, Tommy, Tommy

432
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,660
Bear, Tommy Bear did that.

433
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:14,300
Tommy, we got your fucking ass.

434
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,300
But then if you go and you're playing 5 on 5

435
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
He also skates

436
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,300
Yeah, so he should understand this

437
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,300
And yet here he is posting half court shot videos

438
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:30,300
But anyway, it's the difference between doing that and then going and playing a game

439
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
And you have to do real stuff

440
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Alright, I kind of understand that

441
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
That's why it sucks so much shit

442
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Alright, you convinced me

443
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
I mean I'm still going to have to do a little more research

444
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:43,000
and watch maybe 40 or 50 ten pool videos

445
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,900
and kind of see what else you got going on.

446
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,260
I hear he's a rocker too.

447
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,560
- Yeah, he is a complete rocker.

448
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,400
- He looks like a rocker.

449
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,060
He's got a rock star hair.

450
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,900
I like that.

451
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,140
He looks good, man.

452
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,540
- Yeah, I'm gonna look like that in a couple years.

453
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:59,380
Yeah, I'm gonna look like that in a couple years.

454
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,540
- You kind of have the same eyes.

455
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,460
- We kind of have the same thing.

456
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,660
It is making me think.

457
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,100
- It kind of looks just like him, the more I look at it.

458
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:06,980
- It's kind of making me think

459
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,860
that I maybe should start hitting the gym or something.

460
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
You have a little better of a beard than he does though.

461
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,360
Yeah, he's got a shit beard.

462
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
Yeah, he's got a really bad one.

463
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,860
Shaving this off is maybe the worst decision I've ever made.

464
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
Shaving the mustache off.

465
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,360
It grew back in like four days.

466
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,360
Yeah, but it wasn't as... I looked at a photo of it from like...

467
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,860
the... like two weeks before I shaved it.

468
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:30,860
Dude, I had like... I almost was able to... I could have done the twirls.

469
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,360
You need to do a mustache competition.

470
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,860
Mm-hmm.

471
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,860
You need to do that.

472
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,860
We gotta do Movemba.

473
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,860
We need to do Movemba.

474
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,360
Hopefully it'll be back to where it was by then.

475
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,360
I'll do Movember this year. I won't shave my head or my face.

476
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:42,860
Yeah.

477
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,360
See what happens.

478
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,360
Well, I'm not going to shave. This is like, I think that that's an institution on my face now.

479
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:49,860
Wow.

480
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:50,360
I think that it's...

481
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,360
I do agree. I think that you, your face works much better with a mustache.

482
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Oh, absolutely. It matches my eyebrows.

483
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,360
They're the same.

484
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,360
It's symmetry down here and there.

485
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,360
It's not really symmetry.

486
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,360
It's symmetrical if I have it like this.

487
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,360
You're, if you, this is not any, this is not anything.

488
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,960
I get surgery to look like this?

489
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,760
You kind of look like animalistic muskrat like.

490
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,440
So yeah, that'd be good.

491
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:28,760
Would you ever get those surgeries that that Mormon guy gets?

492
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,760
The blood boy?

493
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,240
He has a blood boy?

494
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,840
Does he get surgery?

495
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,520
gets like, well he's taking Brian, Brian, fuck, Callan.

496
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,520
No. Yeah, I would get surgery to look exactly like Brian. Yeah.

497
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,400
Yeah. Just walking into a fighter and the kid trying to just like

498
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,920
can convince them to start it up again. Yeah. Hey, well, he works

499
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,840
for Steven Crowder now. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah. Oh my god.

500
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Shob or Callan? Callan works for Steven Crow. Oh, wow. Pretty awesome, right? Yeah. You remember

501
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:11,560
it was Brian Callan, Will Sasso, and Chris D'Elia had a podcast. I remember. Yeah. I never

502
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,720
watched it. They were all big on Vine. Chris D'Elia's Vine account was just him filming

503
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:23,680
people in public and going, "Um, excuse me, sir. You look weird." Yeah. And that, dude,

504
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:28,220
he blew up from that. Didn't he make that one that was like him on the stairs and someone

505
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,280
walks by and he records it. I don't even remember what he says but it's like some lady on the

506
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:39,440
phone. I think that's Chris D'Elia. Oh the guy on the stairs and the lady says they were

507
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:48,060
roommates? No that's not Chris D'Elia. Who's that? He was like some photographer. His Vine

508
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:55,780
account was crazy. He was like... Oh yeah that's not him. It kind of looked like him though.

509
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:00,360
Kind of could have been crystal. Yeah, I can see that. But that dude's vine account was

510
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,680
just all videos of him like giving like little kids tasers and shit. That's funny. Yeah. He's

511
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,680
a photographer. Yeah, he's just like a terrorist more than a think he maybe was a terrorist.

512
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,880
Well, he maybe wasn't me. I think now that I'm thinking about it, I think he was an active

513
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,140
member of ISIL. It was ISIL at the time. I remember this when they turned ISIS to ISIL

514
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,720
and I had an English teacher. It was my freshman year of college.

515
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,340
I'm still calling him Isis.

516
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,140
Not English? Yeah, dude. Fuck it.

517
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,680
I had an English 103 teacher.

518
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,560
Yeah.

519
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,760
Because I was in advanced English, just so you guys know.

520
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,940
Place 10 to it.

521
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,940
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

522
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,980
A plus, by the way.

523
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,440
But I was in advanced English.

524
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,700
Got an amazing grade, right?

525
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,700
What is the point of the story?

526
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,500
What was I talking about?

527
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,700
ISIL. ISIL.

528
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,860
ISIL versus ISIS.

529
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,160
So amazing grades, great writer.

530
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:54,340
and then we had this professor who was it was like the day where they were like

531
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,580
it's called ISIL now and he basically cried. No, he was like he was like

532
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,700
the one teacher who was obsessed with ISIL.

533
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:06,900
He was like

534
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,500
first of all, I remember him saying like

535
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,580
this is like when Jefferson Airplane turned to Jefferson Starship and I was

536
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:18,220
like that's that's fire. I'll remember that for the rest of my life.

537
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:28,940
But then he also said that ISIL means in some language, I don't know what the language mostly.

538
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,460
I think you should, I think you should, I leave.

539
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:37,100
I sink, I sink, I leave.

540
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,340
There we go.

541
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,740
That's me on the pool table.

542
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:47,020
But he basically explained that the word ISIL sounds like a word in their language.

543
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:50,020
No, it sounds like a word in English, the asshole.

544
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:54,040
Well, yes, but he explained that it sounds like a word in their language that basically

545
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:57,340
means like gay bastard.

546
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:01,220
So that was, it was done as a way to kind of clown them and it worked.

547
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,540
You don't hear much about ISIL anymore.

548
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,580
No, the CIA stopped them.

549
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,580
Really?

550
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,580
Yeah, they were like, uh.

551
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,020
I don't really know what they became.

552
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Yeah.

553
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,540
Well, there's people who believe that the CIA created ISIS.

554
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
I don't know.

555
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
I don't care.

556
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,540
I don't know if I, yeah.

557
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:21,060
is if the CIA controls fucking everything, I can't do anything about that, man. I'm not

558
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,560
even going to try to think about it.

559
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:27,920
We're going to podcast so people know the truth. No, we don't. Who's listening to us?

560
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,880
The people who are obsessed with that kind of stuff are basically the same people who

561
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,880
make four-hour YouTube videos about Warhammer 40,000 lore. It doesn't matter. Who gives

562
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,440
a shit?

563
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,440
That's exactly they are making too lazy to try videos about like Epstein.

564
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,440
You've been obsessed with too lazy to try huh?

565
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,440
Oh yeah.

566
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,440
That guy makes great videos.

567
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,940
Dude that Jay Moore Bert Kreischer beef video.

568
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:53,940
So funny dude.

569
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,940
So good.

570
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,440
That whole fucking story is so...

571
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,040
It's so funny to make up a story and then have it stolen from you and be like well...

572
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,440
I was lying the whole time.

573
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
It's actually my story.

574
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,440
Making up a story about Tracy Morgan too.

575
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,540
Who is just another guy who is also in your same line of work that you're going to run

576
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,180
and then two all the time and make up a story that makes him seem fucking crazy.

577
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,740
And he smoked PCP.

578
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,740
Whoa.

579
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:22,020
Yeah, okay, you're just telling everyone that fucking Tracy Morgan smokes PCP at a strip

580
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,020
club.

581
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Burt Crusher.

582
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,820
Burt Crusher, this you burn notice.

583
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,420
We're gonna take you out, fool.

584
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
I've been saying this for fucking years.

585
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,780
I've been stealing the machine from you.

586
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,340
He literally has.

587
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,980
I'm not kidding, he's been doing the machine on stage.

588
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,700
I have been doing the machine on stage.

589
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,900
It doesn't do very well.

590
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,900
It bombs every time.

591
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:38,900
It bombs.

592
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,900
Nobody knows what he's talking about.

593
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,180
No one knows what I'm talking about. I'm doing the machine and it's not working.

594
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,900
You pay your audience to make that work.

595
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,400
And also, you should have come up with a better story.

596
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,400
If you're going to make up a story, put a dragon in it, asshole.

597
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,400
Well, he put a machine.

598
00:27:55,400 --> 00:28:00,900
The best thing you can come up with is that you hung out in Russia on a train.

599
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,400
You know who hangs out in Russia on trains? Upskirters.

600
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
That's right.

601
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:12,100
Yeah. You know what the real story of the machine was, Bert? You were on a train. You had mirrors

602
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:22,180
on your shoes. And the lady or whoever, the train conductor or somebody was like, "Blah

603
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:27,440
blah blah." And he said, "I'm in the mafia!" "I'm a machine! I'm a machine! He's covered

604
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,500
in mirrors." "I'm a machine mafia!" "He's covered in mirrors." He's trying to say he

605
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,860
He is the Tin Man.

606
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:38,100
Yeah, he's trying to say he's the Tin Man so that he stops getting caught upskirting.

607
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,520
So they're like, "Oh, he has no sexual desire because he's a machine.

608
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
He's a robot.

609
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,380
Robots think in the only ones and zeros.

610
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:52,460
And that's not the penis and vaginas."

611
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:56,300
When they think of ones and zeros, they're not thinking about putting a one in the zero

612
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,300
in the hole.

613
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,300
That might be if Andy Warhol was still with us, may he rest in peace.

614
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,300
I think that's maybe an art piece he would do.

615
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,300
Yeah.

616
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,300
A penis, a vagina.

617
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
A one going into a zero.

618
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
Well no, just a bunch of, like a line of code.

619
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,300
Uh huh.

620
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Or a line of binary.

621
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,180
A line of code that looks like sex.

622
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,540
That's all ones and zeros.

623
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,540
Yeah.

624
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,900
But it's penises and maybe even, I mean he would probably do asshole.

625
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,820
And then there's two ones touching and then two zeros touching to represent gays and lesbians

626
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,700
and then other people who have those parts or whatever.

627
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,300
And then a zero with a one strapped to it.

628
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,800
(laughter)

629
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,960
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

630
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,960
(laughter)

631
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,420
That's an amazing idea.

632
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,500
Maybe a one with two zeros underneath.

633
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,980
- Yeah. - Balls style.

634
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:44,860
- Dick and balls.

635
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,960
- Balls style is what they would call that.

636
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,020
That's pretty much all the permutations.

637
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,860
- Yeah, that's all you could do.

638
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,300
I mean, yeah, 'cause it's all numbers.

639
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:57,100
You can't really represent every single person.

640
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,600
I'm thinking about the zero with the one strapped onto it.

641
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:03,500
And this is becoming one of the best ideas I've ever heard.

642
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,140
And I think that you need to draw this.

643
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,380
- Yeah, I could draw it right.

644
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,500
I got a pencil.

645
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,340
I'll draw it on the table.

646
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,660
- That's only half the battle, buddy.

647
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,500
- I'll draw it on the table.

648
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,600
- The table is not paper.

649
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,440
No, you don't need to draw.

650
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,260
- I can get a piece of paper.

651
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,100
- No, no, no, you're leaving me?

652
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,020
Just fucking do it later.

653
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,980
I wanna see like an Adobe Illustrator version of this.

654
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,620
- I gotta make the sketch first.

655
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,540
So it's just.

656
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,660
- So it's a zero, okay.

657
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,000
And the zero is pink. It's going to be pink.

658
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,720
See, that's just got to be like a, that kind of just looks like Rick and Morty.

659
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,620
There's another zero here.

660
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:42,780
Wait, why? Oh, okay. And then I guess you need like a belt buckle strap.

661
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,620
Yeah. It's going to go up the zero. Okay.

662
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,340
And then the strap underneath to support. Uh-huh. And there we go.

663
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,580
What was it called again?

664
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,860
I don't even remember how we got here.

665
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,020
We were talking about ones and zeros, it would be penises.

666
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,580
Oh yeah, this is a zero with a one strapped to it.

667
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,580
Hey, I have a question for you.

668
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,580
I've been asking everybody this question.

669
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,140
I think you might have a pretty insightful answer.

670
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
Okay.

671
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
Here's the hypothetical.

672
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,140
Got it.

673
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,500
Okay.

674
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,260
You are, you die, right?

675
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,260
Oh.

676
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,620
Just let that sit.

677
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,940
That's pretty powerful stuff already.

678
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,380
You die.

679
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,380
You go to heaven.

680
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,380
Actually, I have two.

681
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,380
Okay.

682
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,980
I'll tell you the one that I just thought of now.

683
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,580
Okay, well tell me after the first one, because then I can see how you got to the second one.

684
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,700
No, no, I'll tell you this one first, because I realize the other one doesn't have anything

685
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,060
to do with dying or what happened.

686
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,460
But this is also not a hypothetical, this is a what if.

687
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,780
A what if is our hypothetical.

688
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,060
I like trap, but it's not a question, it's just a what if.

689
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,600
What if you got to, my cousin told me this, my cousin Matthew that you met, he brought

690
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,600
this up one day.

691
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,900
He wrote Vanilla Ice Cream.

692
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:52,660
He's also a Vanilla Ice Cream guy.

693
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:58,260
He said, "What if you got to heaven," this blew my mind, "What if you got to heaven

694
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:05,200
and the clouds part to reveal God, and instead of God being a human man, a big human man,

695
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:15,140
God is like a Ford F-150, and God reveals to you that actually cars were the people

696
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:21,100
the whole time and people were just cars, and they just needed us to turn them on to

697
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,560
get them around. But in reality, we don't have any souls. We don't even barely exist.

698
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,180
We're just a vessel to make cars move.

699
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:33,940
We are just vessels that need to get gas and put gas in the cars and we need to make the

700
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,980
cars.

701
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,540
We need to invent the car.

702
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,300
So that's the other thing. It's an alternate history. Well, before cars...

703
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
This is Transformers.

704
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:49,260
No, but no. No. Before cars were people, horses were people.

705
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:54,100
And then before horses, it didn't even exist. The world wasn't even, it's all made up.

706
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,100
Yeah.

707
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
But really cars were just people.

708
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,700
Before horses it was fish with legs.

709
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,140
Yeah, we'll say that. Yeah, before horses it was fish with legs.

710
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,140
And so on and so forth.

711
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:06,540
But so, is that not, does that not make you think about this, all this global warming

712
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,540
bullshit a little differently?

713
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,460
Well, I don't drive. I don't know how to drive.

714
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:14,940
Yeah, so you are like basically the bottom, most useless kind of thing.

715
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:15,940
I'm not going to heaven.

716
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,940
Yeah, I'm not going to heaven at all.

717
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
Because cars, you have never helped a car.

718
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,380
I've turned my mom's car on when I was younger to get the AC started.

719
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,820
Okay, that's actually fine then.

720
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,820
Yeah.

721
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:26,820
That's actually, that's a helpful good deed.

722
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,500
I mean, I know how to turn a car on.

723
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,660
I know how to back it up, but I mean, once you get me on the road, I don't, I can't.

724
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:35,140
You know how to back up a car but not make it go forward?

725
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,140
No.

726
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,300
You need to be driving in backwards, reverse vision.

727
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,020
Maybe I gotta get a reverse car.

728
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,540
It's just an idea.

729
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,540
Yeah.

730
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
But that's the first what if.

731
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:51,100
hypothetical is this, would you rather be a hand or a foot, but you don't get to pick

732
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:56,180
whose hand or foot you are. So you don't get to be like Dua Lipa's foot. You have to say,

733
00:33:56,180 --> 00:34:01,580
I'm going to be a hand or I'm going to be a foot. I just made up a name. Is that a person?

734
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
Yeah.

735
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,920
Well, I didn't fucking know.

736
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:11,900
From what I know, from what I don't know much about her, I think that she is maybe like the

737
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:24,900
prime minister of Albania. Let's see who's this? Dua Lipa's feet. Yeah, those are pretty

738
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:32,240
ugly I'm going to be honest. Her feet kind of look like she has, they look like a very

739
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:39,180
overweight person's feet. Does that make sense? Can you lose weight in your feet? You know

740
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:43,060
You know how people say your face is the last thing that gets skinny when you lose weight?

741
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,740
You know what, when I was like, I mean maybe I just, no, you know what I'm thinking?

742
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,540
I think maybe I just grew.

743
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:58,500
But I was a size 10 and a half in shoes until I got to college and I gained a bunch of weight.

744
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,060
Now I'm up to like an 11, 11 and a half.

745
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,740
Ok, back to my question.

746
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,580
Would you rather be a foot or a hand?

747
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,740
No choice on who's hand or foot.

748
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:13,740
Probably a hand because I could pick up pencils. I could get all up in them guys.

749
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:22,740
Here's the thing, you are just sitting there. It's basically you're a face where everything

750
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,260
just gets shoved into your face.

751
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,260
Like I'm a vegetable.

752
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,340
You are not in control.

753
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,820
So it's like I'm completely awake.

754
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:36,220
Yes, you're a sentient hand attached to a person.

755
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,540
the person controls my every move. So if you're a hand, you already chose hands so you're locked

756
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,580
in. Yeah, but feet, feet you're in. You're a wiping ass and buddy, I've wiped my asshole

757
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:49,620
before and I've missed, the toilet paper's in the wrong place, poop on my finger. I've

758
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:53,940
picked up every disgusting fucking thing in the world. Yeah, that's true. I've touched

759
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:00,580
the tongues of tons of animals at zoos that have been eating disgusting slop. Yeah. Right?

760
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:07,580
I jack my off. I jack my off. Every other day I jack my off. I touch my bees. I touch them.

761
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:17,900
I touch my bees and I jack my off. Every other day at least. I sit on the couch, right? I

762
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,900
sit on the couch, I rewatch Girls, I hold my bees.

763
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,700
So you just front of the pants?

764
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,300
I grab them from the back. I go around. So here's the problem, if you're my height, I

765
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,580
go through.

766
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:33,420
but you're not you're not just touching you're touching the the tea as well as

767
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,460
the bees. I credit card through my cheeks

768
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,780
above my tea,

769
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:41,060
grab the bees.

770
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,340
No pee. No pee, can't even reach the pee. I don't have enough arm slack to

771
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:49,900
reach the pee at that point, but I've credit carded all the way through my

772
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:55,100
bee and my tea to grab my double bees. Yeah. So that's the argument against

773
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,860
the hand. Okay, but then shoe

774
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,180
is a big part of the equation.

775
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,740
What kind of shoe is it?

776
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,940
What's the thing?

777
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,640
What's the job?

778
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,940
Sometimes it's work shoes.

779
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,840
Sometimes you get a real uncomfortable pair of loafers.

780
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,440
Most people just immediately say hand,

781
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,840
but you start thinking about this.

782
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,240
Yeah.

783
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,140
And it's a really hard fucking question.

784
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,340
At least with shoes,

785
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,040
you know,

786
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,840
I mean, have you ever broken a toe?

787
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,140
The thing is about breaking a toe

788
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,840
is that I think I've broken my toe,

789
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,340
but it's I feel like

790
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,240
If you go to the hospital for a broken toe, you're a baby.

791
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,080
- Yeah.

792
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,700
- So I don't actually know.

793
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:34,740
- Did I ever show you, I broke my toe skating.

794
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,080
I was out like skating all day.

795
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,780
Was like, oh, that's weird.

796
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,260
It's weird that my like toe hurts.

797
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:45,460
Walked around on it all day, was kind of limping.

798
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:50,460
And then went to a party,

799
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:54,620
like an event for the Jenkum magazine.

800
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:57,860
I was on a dance floor, people were stepping on my feet.

801
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,700
- Okay.

802
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,380
- I went home, my toe was completely purple.

803
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,380
- You had a purple toe.

804
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,020
- Do you remember my purple toe?

805
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,860
- No.

806
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,500
- Do you remember I was limping for a while?

807
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,860
- You have been limping at various,

808
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,520
probably every six months you limp for a couple weeks.

809
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,360
- Yeah.

810
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,540
- Since I've known you.

811
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,380
- Yeah, that's true.

812
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,140
- You hurt yourself pretty often.

813
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,740
- Yeah.

814
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:21,520
But usually it's minor hurts.

815
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,360
- Yeah.

816
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,220
- I was thinking of it, like since I lost my healthcare,

817
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,480
I've been thinking about my mortality a lot more.

818
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,320
- Yeah.

819
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,160
- I've been thinking about just like--

820
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,780
- It's so scary to die.

821
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:36,780
- Dude, I have been going through life with just like,

822
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,000
like, oh, fuck it, I got healthcare, I'll fucking, yeah,

823
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,460
I'll just go to the doctor.

824
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,000
I can't go to the doctor now.

825
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,680
- You can't, you also, the doctor can't save you.

826
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,360
- No, I can't do shit.

827
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,520
I used to, I fucking, I fall down,

828
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,080
sprain my wrist or something.

829
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,080
I go to a doctor, pay them $600 to say, put ice on it.

830
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,960
Put it above your head.

831
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,600
So the swelling goes down.

832
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,600
I used to pay them $600 even after co-pay.

833
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,660
Even after the--

834
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,080
- And now it'd be a couple grand at least.

835
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,800
- Yeah, they're already covering,

836
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,360
the insurance is already covering

837
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:17,120
the $3,000 of the $36,000.

838
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,480
I haven't had insurance in a very long time.

839
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,480
Yeah.

840
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,480
Yeah.

841
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,080
I had it for six months and then I lost it again.

842
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
Yeah.

843
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,080
Yeah.

844
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,000
I used to have a very bad healthcare plan.

845
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Really?

846
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,440
My very bad dental plan.

847
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,720
That's why my teeth are so fucked up.

848
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,400
I think I'm going to get on Obamacare.

849
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:40,000
But the problem with the ACA is you Google Obamacare and every single page is just like

850
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,720
Trying to get an old person to click on it.

851
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,000
So that you go...

852
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
It's like Obamacare free iPhone.

853
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
And I'm not smart, so I say, "Oh, you get a free iPhone for signing up."

854
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,500
"Oh my God, an iPhone 3G!"

855
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,000
One of these Obama phones.

856
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Yeah, exactly. And then I sign up and now I...

857
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I have two emails that I can't even use them anymore.

858
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Because there's so many Obamacare things.

859
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Obamacare things and they're also sending you free Sony camcorder.

860
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah, exactly.

861
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
It's like, "Oh my God, this Obamacare..."

862
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I'm going to buy every single time. I'm going to buy every fucking time.

863
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:18,680
I had an old email when I was younger that I used specifically to try and sign up for

864
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:25,520
those things because I thought like, well, what if it goes through? What if I do get

865
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,360
my free Sony HD camcorder that shoots in 720p?

866
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,040
Oh my God, Sony Handycam? Dream.

867
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:36,640
if I do get it, then I can start my YouTube career.

868
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:44,640
You're right man. I really wish now that I had been a probably a famous YouTuber.

869
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,640
Yeah. Like a Ryan Higa?

870
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,640
Could have been Ryan Higa, could have been Kev Jumba.

871
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,640
Could have been Timothy DeLaGhetto.

872
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Wasn't motivated enough to be Timothy DeLaGhetto.

873
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,640
Yeah.

874
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,940
As a kid I would film videos and never edit them. They would just sit there on my computer

875
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:09,340
forever raw footage of me and my little brother making fart noises or whatever. And that was

876
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
it man.

877
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,660
I got a couple of the old YouTube sketches I made when I was like 15.

878
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,700
Yes, I've seen these actually.

879
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,140
Yeah, I got a couple of old ones sitting around.

880
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,180
Yeah, you got to get those off the computer. Yeah, they come up when you search your name.

881
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,180
Really?

882
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Yeah.

883
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,180
Oh no.

884
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,180
They have comments from people who listen to the podcast.

885
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:30,340
Oh, I haven't looked at it. I don't look at it ever.

886
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,820
It's pretty funny.

887
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:38,580
Yeah, yeah, how which ones the one where you are running for president? Oh Jesus that one has some

888
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,380
That one has some

889
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,480
Pretty good. Hey pretty good editing for a 17 year old

890
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,260
Actually, I was yeah, 17 year old is one year away from being a full-grown adult. So yeah, it's fine

891
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:57,360
There it is at the year ahead with dr. Patrick Doran and Gary Wilson Gary Wilson this singer

892
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,380
I don't think so. I would imagine not the singer this guy looks nothing like me

893
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:04,180
Okay, final answer, hand or foot?

894
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,180
Probably foot because I'm into that.

895
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:15,180
Okay, would you rather be... that's fine, that's a completely okay answer.

896
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,180
Would you rather be hair?

897
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,980
Would I rather be hair and then the rest of my body is a person?

898
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,580
No, we're not doing reverse person.

899
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,460
Would you rather be hair or food?

900
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,460
Hair.

901
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,300
Okay, would you rather be hair?

902
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,040
Well, because even if you shave, they're still like, like if I'm like hair on like

903
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,280
I would, I would be the hair above the ear because unless the person,

904
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,280
oh, so every, my whole body is hair.

905
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,160
Whole body hair.

906
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,240
Okay. Then yeah, because I mean, you can, you, it's not like they're the person

907
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,040
who...

908
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,320
But you go through it, but...

909
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,720
You go through a lot of changes.

910
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:49,200
You experience great pain.

911
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,520
Yeah. But food, you get food, you're around for like, you have the life cycle of a

912
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,080
fly. You're around for a week.

913
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,320
Yeah, so this is the argument for food.

914
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,360
Food, you have a short life, but you're beautiful,

915
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,720
you're appreciated.

916
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,560
Hair--

917
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,380
- Hair, you're also appreciated.

918
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:07,060
- You're getting constantly,

919
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,040
depends on the person.

920
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,600
Hair, you're getting constantly--

921
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,120
- Oh wait, a woman's hair.

922
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,080
And not like a--

923
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,320
- And a woman's food.

924
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,840
- Okay, I'm a woman's hair versus a woman's food.

925
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,200
- So they only eat half of it.

926
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,640
- Yeah.

927
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,200
So I'm like a can of sardines.

928
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,640
- Yeah, something like that.

929
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,040
Some almonds, four or five almonds.

930
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,240
Four or five almonds, a can of sardines, some of these like...

931
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,640
But with hair you experience intense, great pain.

932
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:33,140
Yeah.

933
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,240
Off... Okay, here's another one.

934
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,040
Would you rather be food or a human?

935
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,240
What kind of human?

936
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:43,240
Just any... I mean you, yourself.

937
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,440
Yeah. Would I rather be food or myself?

938
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,440
Would you rather be food or would you want nothing to change in your life at all right now?

939
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,340
What kind of food?

940
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,740
It's random.

941
00:43:55,740 --> 00:44:00,740
Is that like a type of fish?

942
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:01,740
It is random.

943
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:02,740
Okay.

944
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,740
So you could be Indian food.

945
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:06,740
So okay, if I was, okay, yeah, so I'm a meal.

946
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:08,740
Would you rather be Indian food or you?

947
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:11,740
What dish?

948
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,740
Am I like a chicken dildar?

949
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,740
Am I like a...

950
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:16,740
Don't go for a deep cut when you're...

951
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,740
Don't say chicken dildar.

952
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,740
Say chicken tikka masala, say butter chicken.

953
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:23,740
That's all you can say.

954
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,460
can say. Okay, I like Chicken Dildar the best though. That's my favorite Indian dish. Fuck

955
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:32,300
you. It's got pineapples in it. Sounds good. Yeah, it's actually. Is there pineapples in

956
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,380
India? Well, I think this is maybe an American dish. Oh, God. An Indian-American dish. I

957
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:42,700
hate Americanized things. Ah, some of them. General Tso. Okay, here's the thing that I

958
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:49,060
learned. What? About. Apparently, well, I've been calling it General Gow's my whole life.

959
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,060
Oh, it's grown abundantly. I've been calling it General Gow's my whole life. I call it

960
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:59,060
General Joes. General Joes, okay. Shout out Trader. General Gow, apparently local to, like,

961
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:04,380
that's a thing people in New England say because I was like, oh yeah, can I, I was talking to

962
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,860
my girlfriend, I was like, oh can I just get like a, we were doing an Uber Eats, can I

963
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,700
just get like a thing of General Gows? Yeah, I've never heard of General Gows. She was

964
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:15,220
like, what the fuck are you saying? Everyone else calls it General So's. Yeah. Do you know

965
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:20,060
why it's called General Gows? No, and I looked it up, the only answer was, you're probably

966
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:25,660
some fucking idiot from New England who says that. And I was like, huh, let me get one

967
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,660
of those.

968
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:29,260
Last one. My lucky. You can't take my luckies in.

969
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:34,780
I know, I'm not taking your luckies in. But yeah, I didn't know that that's a regional

970
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,220
thing. Also, it's just the stupidest regional thing because it's... I don't even think that's

971
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,740
pronounced that way.

972
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:43,420
What, General Gal?

973
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:44,420
Yeah. T-S-O?

974
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:48,040
ESO? No, it's definitely, no, no, no. This means that some,

975
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,940
there's gotta be some chain. My guess is some chain in New England.

976
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:55,040
Maybe Kowloon? Maybe Kowloon or something like that.

977
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,160
Cause my dad's called it that his whole life. My mom's called it that his whole life.

978
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,680
And I've heard... My mom works at a Chinese restaurant. They call it that.

979
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,360
Yeah. I've, I've definitely heard that before. Uh,

980
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,640
but I've never ordered it and I always assumed it was a different thing.

981
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,920
But my guess is that there was some chain that was,

982
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,360
they called it General Gow's.

983
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,040
- Yeah, like back in the 50s when Chinese food

984
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,880
was starting to pop off.

985
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,120
- Yeah, it was probably called like Mr. Gow's or whatever,

986
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:21,840
so they named it after the mascot.

987
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:22,680
- Yeah.

988
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,560
- And then everybody just started calling it that shit.

989
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,400
- In New England only.

990
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,360
- In New England only, yeah.

991
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,520
- But I've like said, like, oh, can I get General Gow's

992
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,520
at like places around here?

993
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,720
And they still give it to me.

994
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,560
- Wait, maybe you're more authentic.

995
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,400
Maybe it actually is originally General Gow's.

996
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,480
maybe the rest of the world got tricked

997
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:45,040
and New England is the only bastion of hope for the truth here.

998
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,740
New England is the only bastion of hope for Chinese people.

999
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:55,640
Especially Boston. Boston is one of the most Chinese friendly places in the world.

1000
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:01,060
Oh yeah, people in Boston, are you kidding me? The most open and accepting people.

1001
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,080
They actually are. Yeah, they did have gay marriage first.

1002
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:12,640
Yeah, Boston is kind of, for better or for worse, become essentially the woke capital

1003
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:13,640
of America.

1004
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:14,640
Yeah.

1005
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,640
Tied with San Francisco, of course.

1006
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:18,380
Two cities that I do like.

1007
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:19,380
I was a block away.

1008
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,380
You like San Francisco?

1009
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:25,040
Well, I went back after, the first time we went there, we were only there for 24 hours.

1010
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,240
I went to visit my girlfriend when she was out there.

1011
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,880
And it was actually fucking sick.

1012
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,280
Yeah, it's beautiful.

1013
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,280
It's so...

1014
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,280
It's very great.

1015
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:39,320
why those tech people really wanted to fucking destroy that city with their stupid little

1016
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,320
like self-driving cars and shit. I almost got hit by one of those.

1017
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,480
Yeah, it was the tech people and not the drug addicts, Patrick.

1018
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,200
I support drug addicts.

1019
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,200
What?

1020
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,680
And I support graffiti and skateboarding.

1021
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:59,040
What? The fuck are you talking about? No, a city should be grey buildings with big,

1022
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,040
big...

1023
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,040
Brutalist architecture?

1024
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
Big windows.

1025
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,040
Uh-uh.

1026
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:07,760
little windows. Yeah, little window, big gray concrete buildings, little tiny

1027
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,920
windows, central air, right? Okay. I think that we can both agree on that.

1028
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:16,660
Central air is amazing. Central air, so good. There should be, and I don't want

1029
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:22,240
to have a key for my door. I want the entire... I want an RFID chip in my wrist

1030
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:27,000
that I go, "Peep!" Or I want a code that if I forget, I have to move. Yeah. This

1031
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,720
is not my house anymore because I forgot my code. And you can't ask the landlord

1032
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:35,400
for the code. I don't he doesn't know it. Because yeah you made the code. Yeah exactly. And you

1033
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,160
were like I'm going to make it. I lost my password wallet. I'm going to make it funny.

1034
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:42,400
I'm going to make a funny number. Yep I made it funny. I made it funny because when you

1035
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,920
look at the code upside down. Which you can't because you'd have to turn the entire door

1036
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:52,600
upside down or the world upside down. Do you ever sit and look at the stars? No I don't

1037
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:58,680
do that. Never. No. Not my thing. Have you ever done that? I honestly. You ever lay down

1038
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,680
in the grass and looked up at the stars?

1039
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,400
I like the city more. I like to look at a building.

1040
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,120
You'd rather look at a building than the stars?

1041
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,120
Yeah.

1042
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:09,120
Well here, I'm about to change your mind.

1043
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,120
Okay.

1044
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:11,120
I'm about to blow your mind.

1045
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,120
Stars are the buildings of the sky?

1046
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,240
Well, just next time you should go lay down on the ground and look up at the stars and

1047
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,200
think about how the world, the entire earth is moving so fast through space and it's kind

1048
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,040
of like you're on the front of it, right? And you're like kind of holding on and you

1049
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:30,300
be like, "Ahhhh!" and you're like shooting through. Is that kind of fun?

1050
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,300
It is fun. It is good.

1051
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:37,060
Huh? Well, I can't do it. Yeah, do it right now. Pretend that you're like looking, like

1052
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:42,560
you're holding on to the front of a semi-truck in a Mad Max movie. "Ahhhh!" Yeah, so you

1053
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:43,560
go and you do that.

1054
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,560
That's pretty good.

1055
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:45,560
And it's kind of fun.

1056
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,560
Yeah.

1057
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,560
I would highly recommend that.

1058
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:48,840
Yeah, it's not bad. That's not a bad thing to do.

1059
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,840
You're not a stargazer.

1060
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,840
No.

1061
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:51,840
Hmm.

1062
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,620
I like to look at, I don't know.

1063
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,620
I don't know what I, there's...

1064
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:59,300
What's the most beautiful nature you've ever seen?

1065
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,160
Have you ever seen anything beautiful?

1066
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,160
I did.

1067
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
Have you ever been touched?

1068
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,160
You know what it was?

1069
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,560
The Grand Canyon, yeah.

1070
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:07,920
That was like a...

1071
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,440
We just talked last week about how you didn't care about it.

1072
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:11,440
Well, no.

1073
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,800
I saw, like seeing the people, like enjoy it, made me enjoy it.

1074
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,800
Yeah.

1075
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,360
a really tall part of San Francisco and I like that too.

1076
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,680
The tall part of San Francisco?

1077
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,680
The tall part.

1078
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,680
There was this one spot we went to that overlooked the whole city and I was like oh shit that's

1079
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,680
cool.

1080
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:30,680
Yeah.

1081
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:31,840
I was touched by that.

1082
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:32,840
You were touched by that?

1083
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:36,360
That's still a city right?

1084
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:39,840
It makes me mad thinking about how I could never live there.

1085
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:40,840
In San Francisco?

1086
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,280
It's so nice there.

1087
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,040
Dude, it's not nice.

1088
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,040
It's really nice.

1089
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,040
It's insanely expensive.

1090
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,480
expensive. Well, that's the thing. If it was cheap, they have the craziest homeless people

1091
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,040
in America. Yeah, I could get along with them. You could not get along with them. I get it.

1092
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,060
Remember when we were in Portland and there was the guy walking down the street swinging

1093
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:04,120
chains? Yes. That's like every and we went we crossed the street. But the guy who said

1094
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,400
you ever seen someone get fucked up by a machete. That was a different guy. That's what I mean.

1095
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,040
Oh yeah. Those are two different guys. I don't remember the chain man. There's a guy walking

1096
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:14,500
down the bridge swinging chains like this.

1097
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,000
Was he walking towards us?

1098
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, and then we crossed the street and we thought it would be kind of funny if he was

1099
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,840
like, "Whoa dude, you guys crossed the street?"

1100
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,840
What the fuck is that?

1101
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:24,840
Kind of racist.

1102
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,680
I forgot about the chain, man.

1103
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:31,840
Yeah, he was like swinging chains, shirtless guy, tattered clothes.

1104
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:32,840
Battered bros.

1105
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,840
Yeah, swinging chains.

1106
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,320
That's what every day, as far as I know.

1107
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,720
I mean I've been watching my favorite skateboarder Tim Pool talking about San Francisco.

1108
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:49,960
The thing that I remember the most about Portland was, I mean we were just day drunk the whole

1109
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:50,960
time we were there.

1110
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,800
Oh yeah, I'm doing, people who listen to beers we drink know that I'm doing groggless ogless.

1111
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,200
Oh, ok.

1112
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,200
No grog.

1113
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,200
No grog at all?

1114
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,200
No grog at all this og.

1115
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,200
Uh huh.

1116
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,800
That's why I didn't go to the bar last night, no grog.

1117
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,800
Wow.

1118
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,920
They have an A, they have a hoppy refresher there.

1119
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,120
I love that thing!

1120
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,560
That's my favorite thing to drink.

1121
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,280
When I was sober for six months, that's what I would drink all the time.

1122
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,280
Poppy refresher, that thing's good.

1123
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,360
I would be drinking, I was still drinking like the same amount of beer.

1124
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,040
You're binge drinking NA beers.

1125
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,560
That's what I was doing, yeah.

1126
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,560
And I was...

1127
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:27,200
I'll have a six pack of NA beers, it's like 500 calories.

1128
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,720
What are they putting in Heineken Zero?

1129
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,920
They're putting just X-Lax in that.

1130
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,920
That does make you, well that means...

1131
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:37,840
It makes you shit like green...

1132
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:39,840
Does normal beer make you shit green goo?

1133
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,840
Depends.

1134
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:41,840
Depends on the type.

1135
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:45,080
I mean if I have like a bunch of Narragansetts, yeah.

1136
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:51,400
I would love to get to become a part of your gut microbiome.

1137
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Yeah?

1138
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,400
You want to see what goes on in there?

1139
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,720
I bet it looks like the day after tomorrow.

1140
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:03,120
In the city that is your gut, everything's on fire, tornadoes are ripping everything

1141
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,600
out of the place.

1142
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,600
You need to do an elimination diet.

1143
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,640
that where you eliminate all food.

1144
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:12,600
Oh, and I just do juice like, uh, no.

1145
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,240
Remember when 50 Cent did that?

1146
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,680
He went on a completely liquid diet for that movie about that dude with cancer.

1147
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:20,760
He got really skinny and nobody liked the fucking movie.

1148
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:20,880
Yeah.

1149
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:21,880
The movie was bad.

1150
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,680
That would suck so bad.

1151
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,640
You're sitting there.

1152
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,600
That photo, imagine you gained 300 pounds to play a part.

1153
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:31,720
And then you're just like sitting there watching the reviews come in.

1154
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:34,720
It's like, you're wearing a CPAP machine while you're awake.

1155
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:39,680
in every review. It's got a 44 on Rotten Tomatoes. It's just like...

1156
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,800
Well, that's kind of good.

1157
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,400
Three out of ten, three out of ten, three out of ten, five out of ten.

1158
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,760
That's just remarkably average.

1159
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,320
See, but then you don't even get the fun.

1160
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,520
I'm saying like a two and a half.

1161
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,000
But if you get one of the greatest bombs of all time, that even has a novelty to it.

1162
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:53,640
Yeah, that's true.

1163
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:54,440
I'm like, "Oh, that's funny."

1164
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,040
Or just like the most mid movie.

1165
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,240
Yeah, just a shitty movie.

1166
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,400
And you're like, "Oh, I gained like a bajillion pounds."

1167
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,600
Yeah, that's got to suck, man.

1168
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,880
I gained a bajillion pounds so that I could play Norbit's brother.

1169
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:09,280
You see the thing that Mack from Always Sunny did where he would drink ice cream to gain

1170
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,280
weight?

1171
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:11,280
You were doing something like that.

1172
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,280
Well I do that already.

1173
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,280
Something that ruins ice cream for you?

1174
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:14,400
You drink ice cream?

1175
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,400
I drink ice cream.

1176
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:21,600
I will say when I get a bowl of ice cream, I swirl it around and make it melt a little

1177
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,600
bit.

1178
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,600
Not all the way.

1179
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,080
Yeah, it's got to be a little soft.

1180
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,800
Yeah, I don't want hard ice cream dude.

1181
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,360
I'm not a penguin.

1182
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,560
I don't like ice like that.

1183
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,560
Penguins I don't think eat ice.

1184
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,560
What do penguins eat?

1185
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:35,060
Do you know anything about animals?

1186
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:38,000
Do I know anything about it?

1187
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,740
Do you know anything about penguins specifically?

1188
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:41,580
Because I had a very important question.

1189
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,500
Ask me a question.

1190
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:43,740
What do penguins eat?

1191
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,340
Fish.

1192
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:44,880
Oh, they do.

1193
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:45,840
Yeah. You know what?

1194
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,080
They can fucking swim.

1195
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,780
And they sit and they do the they feed their kids like

1196
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,540
they vomit into their kids mouths.

1197
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:55,520
Hmm. And they eat little silver fish.

1198
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,520
Yeah. All right.

1199
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,560
Well, that answers that question.

1200
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,520
Any other animal facts that you'd like to know?

1201
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:05,400
But I'm more, I know about raccoons.

1202
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,240
Yeah.

1203
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,180
And possums.

1204
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:08,580
They like hot dogs.

1205
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:09,940
Raccoons like hot dogs.

1206
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,100
According to one video I've seen.

1207
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,660
They have weird opposable thumbs.

1208
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:13,740
Possums.

1209
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:18,280
I think, I mean you can own, how long do raccoons live?

1210
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,340
I think they live.

1211
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:20,340
They live like pretty long.

1212
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:21,220
They live much longer.

1213
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:23,100
Possums only live about 18 months.

1214
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:25,060
Yeah, possums are born to die.

1215
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:25,900
Yeah.

1216
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,720
That's kind of sick.

1217
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,820
It's kind of crazy 'cause they're so,

1218
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:31,740
rats are like that too, they die really young.

1219
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,940
Raccoons, I'm going to guess, oh, three years, that's it?

1220
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,040
Oh, in the wild.

1221
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,780
In captivity, a raccoon can live up to 20 years.

1222
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,400
Wow.

1223
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,940
Why does anything have to die?

1224
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,900
That's a good question.

1225
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,340
What about why can't we just live forever?

1226
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,240
Wait, wait, wait, go back.

1227
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:48,100
How long has Pinch Raccoon been around?

1228
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:48,900
How old is this one?

1229
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:52,100
How old is this raccoon?

1230
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,140
When were they?

1231
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,600
I think this raccoon is maybe pretty young.

1232
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,440
Well, she's the same age as Jelly Otter.

1233
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:00,580
OK, well, how old is Jelly Otter, I guess?

1234
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,740
That's a good. It is so crazy how Oh, Universal Orlando. You're not buying

1235
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:10,180
tickets to Orlando. Well, hold on now. Listen, do I want to go? Yes, it is

1236
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:15,100
crazy that if you want to go on like the Disney wiki or like any of these

1237
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:21,520
wiki is just just a billion ads. Yeah, they should. They should be running the

1238
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:26,860
same. If you have a wiki, you have a wiki about one on one. If you have a

1239
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:27,380
wiki,

1240
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,060
Same operation as Jimmy Wales.

1241
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,780
You got to be asking for donations.

1242
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:34,980
Why does Wikipedia not?

1243
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:37,320
I would rather have fucking ads on Wikipedia

1244
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,400
than have this fucking big sob story every three months.

1245
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,700
Yeah. Shut the fuck up.

1246
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,980
Jimmy Wales. Shut up, bro.

1247
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,900
I don't care. Yeah.

1248
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,080
You have backed.

1249
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,960
I'm sorry that you backed yourself into this corner

1250
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,460
where everybody depends on your website so, so much.

1251
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:56,340
You can't even keep it up that you can't keep it up.

1252
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:00,740
like there's so much traffic going to it that you can't keep it up, you can't pay for it.

1253
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:04,420
That's not my fucking problem, right? I want to read about...

1254
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:08,540
I'm taking my ass to Encyclopedia if you don't knock it off.

1255
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:13,780
Exactly, yeah. I'm trying to read the behind the scenes section of the Brown Bunny Wikipedia.

1256
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:21,020
I don't care about you need me to pay you $2. And also why is... the options go way too

1257
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,020
high.

1258
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,020
Uh-huh.

1259
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,020
The options go down...

1260
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,020
One thousand?

1261
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,020
Yeah. Who's giving $1,000 to Wikipedia?

1262
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,340
Probably the editors.

1263
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,340
Because they work there?

1264
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:30,340
Would you give a thousand dollars to your job?

1265
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,340
No.

1266
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,340
No.

1267
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,340
No.

1268
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:35,340
No, I would not give this fucking place a thousand dollars.

1269
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:36,340
No.

1270
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,340
I don't want to do that.

1271
00:57:37,340 --> 00:57:38,340
Me neither.

1272
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:39,340
No.

1273
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,340
There's no world where I'd do that.

1274
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:47,420
I was reading the director of Brown Bunny, Vincent Gallo, held such a grudge over Roger

1275
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:49,940
Ebert saying that Buffalo 66 or Brown Bunny...

1276
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,780
But they secretly liked each other, I heard.

1277
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:52,780
Yeah?

1278
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,780
Yeah.

1279
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,780
They had a mutual respect.

1280
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:57,980
but when he died he said some crazy shit. I wish I remembered exactly what it was.

1281
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,180
But that was just him being funny.

1282
00:57:59,180 --> 00:57:59,680
Yeah.

1283
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,180
Yeah.

1284
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,180
Well that's nice.

1285
00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:03,180
It's actually nice.

1286
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,680
It's nice that he said that you died with no jaw you gay bitch or something.

1287
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,180
It was something along those lines.

1288
00:58:08,180 --> 00:58:08,680
Yeah.

1289
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,180
I will say...

1290
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:13,180
That's what Bam Margera... when Roger Ebert died, Bam Margera went crazy on him.

1291
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:14,180
Dude, if I just...

1292
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:18,180
A lot of people! A lot of people went crazy on Ebert once he died.

1293
00:58:18,180 --> 00:58:20,180
Tough talk once a man's dead.

1294
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:20,680
Yeah.

1295
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,180
Because I bet you couldn't look him in the face and say that.

1296
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:23,680
You'd laugh.

1297
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,780
but yeah, you look, you look Roger Ebert in his face. He looked back at you like

1298
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:28,080
this,

1299
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:33,700
like, "Oh my God, he's so surprised at what I said." At least close his mouth,

1300
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,000
bro.

1301
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,360
Like, just fucking, why does it have to be fucking open? I don't understand.

1302
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:43,520
Why do you have to... He's got this little jelly jaw, just fucking sit

1303
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,180
there just like...

1304
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:50,120
He doesn't need to be in a permanent state of awe. Yeah. You do not need to

1305
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,960
have him be... They could have put a piece of tape that...

1306
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,880
like, you know, connected his bottom lip to the top one.

1307
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:56,880
Just do that, man.

1308
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:57,880
Just tape it.

1309
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,880
Don't let that motherfucker hang like that.

1310
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,440
That is disgusting.

1311
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,080
If I, yeah, man, if I'm ever in that situation, man.

1312
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:10,000
If I lose my whole jaw to cancer.

1313
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,000
I just want to die.

1314
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,400
Just, yeah, it's a flat, or at least do that so it'll look, I can go like this.

1315
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,400
Yeah.

1316
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
And it'll look funny.

1317
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:20,160
Give me a permanently, don't make me look scary, man.

1318
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,640
Yeah, make me look funny.

1319
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:28,640
Oh God, they really, I mean that must have been some kind of experimental surgery.

1320
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,640
He would wear turtlenecks all the time too.

1321
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,640
That's not helping.

1322
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:33,640
Yeah, it doesn't help at all.

1323
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:35,640
You ever seen that show, Spitting Image?

1324
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:36,640
Uh-uh.

1325
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:37,640
Oh yes, yeah.

1326
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,640
The British thing, yeah.

1327
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:42,640
No, fucking, God damn it dude.

1328
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:43,640
What, British comedy?

1329
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,640
Leo made fun of me so hard for that.

1330
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,640
Because you're an Anglo comedy fan?

1331
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:48,640
Yeah.

1332
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,640
Yeah, you do know all the Anglo comedy.

1333
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:54,840
You made fun of me because I know the co-creator of Mr. Bean's name.

1334
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,740
That is crazy. That is actually crazy.

1335
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,440
What? It's like, you know, like Mr. Bean's funny.

1336
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:09,540
You'll know this. What was the one special they did where it was like a ghost thing and they pretended it was real?

1337
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:12,240
What are you talking about? Mr. Bean?

1338
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,840
No, not Mr. Bean, man.

1339
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,640
It was like a channel 4 or whatever.

1340
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:25,840
They did like a real ghost investigation special and pretended it was live.

1341
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:26,640
Back in the day?

1342
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,140
Yeah.

1343
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:28,640
How long ago?

1344
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,040
In like 2000, late 90s.

1345
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:33,040
Probably don't know it.

1346
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,340
But it was actually really scary as fuck.

1347
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,640
And they got like a bunch of people calling the police and saying ghosts were real.

1348
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,940
Was it a comedy program?

1349
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:41,440
No.

1350
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,540
Then I don't know it.

1351
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:45,600
It was supposed to be mildly satirical.

1352
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,920
Have you ever seen any, you know how they do those,

1353
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,040
they do like the mentalist specials in the UK?

1354
01:00:52,040 --> 01:00:54,040
Where they'll have a guy who like,

1355
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,240
- Who points at something and is like,

1356
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,360
"I know your father."

1357
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,440
- It's kind of stuff like that.

1358
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,720
- "Your father's trying to talk to you."

1359
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,520
- They do stuff like that, but then they also do like,

1360
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:03,640
there's one where a guy plays Russian roulette on live TV.

1361
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:04,320
- No way.

1362
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:04,960
- It's cool.

1363
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,800
They do way cooler TV in the UK, man,

1364
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:08,920
because they don't have any money.

1365
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,800
- Well, all they have is fucking quiz programs.

1366
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,260
Yeah, they don't have the big mouth writers.

1367
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:17,500
It must be so easy to be a fucking comedian in England.

1368
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:24,660
OK, that must be so that's that's absurd.

1369
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,860
Why do you say this?

1370
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:29,060
There's four TV channels.

1371
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,560
Right. If you don't get your show on one, that's the other three.

1372
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,600
But that there's no programs.

1373
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,000
There's nothing going on.

1374
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,200
That is kind of true.

1375
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,360
Yeah, it's not like that.

1376
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:44,720
You don't have the TV real estate being taken up by shows that have been on the air for 40

1377
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,760
seasons, because they only ever do three.

1378
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:47,760
Yeah.

1379
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,400
Six episodes, three seasons.

1380
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,280
It's mostly specials and stuff.

1381
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,800
Stuart Lee, old Stuart Lee.

1382
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,080
Oh, well he's Scottish, isn't he?

1383
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:56,080
No.

1384
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,520
He made fun of Scottish people.

1385
01:01:57,520 --> 01:01:59,440
Isn't Scotland part of the UK?

1386
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:03,200
Well, it is, but they don't want to be.

1387
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,200
What?

1388
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:05,200
Stuart?

1389
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,200
That's Stuart Little.

1390
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,200
You're thinking of Stuart Little.

1391
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,560
We're talking about Stuart Lee. He's a dry comedian from a different foreign land.

1392
01:02:13,560 --> 01:02:15,560
He does a lot of crowd work.

1393
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,560
Yeah, so he'll look at somebody and say...

1394
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,560
He's exactly like Matt Rife.

1395
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,560
He's basically Matt Rife in the UK.

1396
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:23,560
This is not him, man. He's not this fucking...

1397
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:25,560
No, you're thinking of a different...

1398
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,560
I know that you're thinking of Stuart Little.

1399
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:32,560
Here's a fun fact. The dad was on A Bit of Fry and Laurie.

1400
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,560
Really?

1401
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:36,560
Because he was Hugh Laurie.

1402
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:44,000
British comedy program. It was a program that ran for a couple of seasons. It was a good

1403
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,080
show. I've actually never seen it. It's one of those things where it's probably good at

1404
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:55,240
the time but I watch it now and it's like, I don't fucking get it. What are they talking

1405
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,360
about? The Chuckle Brothers. Oh a pensioner. Shut up. We watched the Chuckle Brothers and

1406
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:06,240
none of that made any sense. They were saying shit that just made no sense at all. To me,

1407
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:12,640
you. What is that man? I don't know. Those are beloved characters over there. You could

1408
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:17,640
not you would be you'd be castrated if you if you try that shit down on. Well yeah that

1409
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,540
but if you talk down on the Chuckle Brothers you go you talk shit about the Chuckle Brothers

1410
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:25,480
over there they're fucking they are they are dragging you through the street. The Bobbies

1411
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:30,320
are going to look away. The Bobbies are the people you the only you want to get a red

1412
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:37,320
head coat guard at the palace to break. Don't try to tell them, "Hickory dickory dock,"

1413
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:46,240
the whatever. Don't do dice clay jokes to them. Say, "The Chuckle Brothers aren't funny."

1414
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:53,240
"The Chuckle Brothers are a couple of nonces." They're going to hit you with the bayonet.

1415
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,400
Stab, stab, stab. Shoot you while the bayonet's in your body.

1416
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,400
Gears of War style.

1417
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,400
Gears of War, they're going to do Gears of War fatalities.

1418
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,400
They're going to sneak up behind you, Modern Warfare,

1419
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,400
the new Modern Warfare game.

1420
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,400
MI6, if you even think, they know,

1421
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:11,400
they, like, as soon as you go over to the UK,

1422
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:15,400
MI6 is like, they have your phone tapped,

1423
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,400
you have a new SIM card they put in,

1424
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,400
you have to get a SIM card at the airport once you get over there.

1425
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:23,400
On that SIM card, there's a program

1426
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,400
that if you even text somebody and say like,

1427
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,400
"I'm going to go say that the Chuckle Brothers are..."

1428
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,400
I'm going to go say the Chuckle Brothers aren't funny.

1429
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,400
Your phone explodes.

1430
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:37,400
It'll blow up in your hand.

1431
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:39,400
Blow your hand off.

1432
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:41,400
Like that movie...

1433
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:43,400
Agent Cody Banks with the Mentos.

1434
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,400
The movie with Jamie Foxx and the guy from 300.

1435
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,400
That I don't remember what it's called.

1436
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:50,400
Do you know what I'm talking about?

1437
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:51,400
The one where...

1438
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:56,360
real gritty movies. Yeah. Remember that era of like 2006 to 2011 where every

1439
01:04:56,360 --> 01:05:03,200
every movie was about a guy in prison. Yeah. Trying to get like like he's

1440
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,280
talking to a cop who's like, you need to tell us where the bodies are. And he's

1441
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:11,520
like, well, I'm not I'm not telling you where it's not. Gamer is an amazing

1442
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:14,840
movie, but it's not. Gamer has that Bollywood style dance at the end. Gamer

1443
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:20,760
has boobs in it, too. Oh, snap. But every movie it was like a smoke smoke and

1444
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:27,760
Smokin' Aces. Yeah, Smokin' Aces. Every movie in 2007 had that grainy, brownish tinge to

1445
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,380
them. It looks like shit. Yeah, they all look really bad. Color grading back then was fucking

1446
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:37,760
insane. It was like bad digital cameras they were shooting on. Yeah, everything looks terrible.

1447
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:44,520
Smokin' Aces, Lucky Number Slevin. Yes, Lucky Number Slevin, exactly. We've talked about

1448
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:50,740
this before. It's like movies that we watched at that age because we were like, "Oh, I watched

1449
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:53,940
like adult movies. I get to watch R-rated movies. I watch R-rated movies. And they were just

1450
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:57,860
fucking terrible. And it's just, yeah, just the most blank, kind of boring, I mean some

1451
01:05:57,860 --> 01:06:05,860
of them are sick. My Bloody Valentine 3D. Yeah, like that one. Slither. Slither. Stuff

1452
01:06:05,860 --> 01:06:15,140
like that. Fucking, what's the, Smokin' 8, no it was 21 is the one with Kevin Spacey

1453
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:21,780
and that dude from across the universe. It's color graded terribly. It looks bad. All of

1454
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:28,380
those movies look so bad. They put the poop filter on it. Yeah. 2007 they were putting

1455
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:34,580
poop filters on everything because guess what? The recession. The world was going to shit.

1456
01:06:34,580 --> 01:06:37,980
They couldn't afford it. That's why the Hurt Locker is so brown. Yeah. Well it's brown because

1457
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:43,180
of the desert. It's actually quite a bright movie. They were outside for most of it. Well

1458
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,580
I didn't see it, I'm going to be honest.

1459
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,580
I just saw stuff making fun of it.

1460
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:47,580
I just saw stuff making fun of it.

1461
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:48,580
My elbow done.

1462
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:49,580
Is that Jeremy Renner?

1463
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:50,580
Yes.

1464
01:06:50,580 --> 01:06:51,580
Well, good luck to him.

1465
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,580
Good luck.

1466
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:53,580
He's been hurt.

1467
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,380
He has been in a completely catatonic, vegetative state.

1468
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:57,380
It's actually sad.

1469
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:01,180
He's on, Jeremy Renner, we know that you are on life support right now.

1470
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:02,180
Yep.

1471
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:03,180
You're hooked up.

1472
01:07:03,180 --> 01:07:04,180
You're barely holding on, buddy.

1473
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:09,060
You're barely, I mean, I'm worried because there was supposed to be a Hawkeye series and

1474
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:11,460
now I don't think that that is ever going to happen.

1475
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:16,740
I think that Jeremy Renner is not currently knocking on death's door.

1476
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:17,740
Not long for this world.

1477
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:18,740
Same with Jamie Foxx.

1478
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:22,860
They tried to weaken at Bernie's Jamie Foxx and put out a video of him singing, but I'm

1479
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:23,860
not falling for it.

1480
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:24,860
He's dead.

1481
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:25,860
He is dead.

1482
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:26,860
He has passed away.

1483
01:07:26,860 --> 01:07:32,780
The fucking conspiracy theories about that though, where it's like his face shape has

1484
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:36,620
totally changed and they're showing like red carpet photos where like the camera is like

1485
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:38,260
really far away.

1486
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:39,980
He's bigger.

1487
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,780
His head is way smaller there.

1488
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:46,980
And they put chemicals in his head to make his head big.

1489
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:47,980
Look at how big his head is.

1490
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:48,980
I believe this.

1491
01:07:48,980 --> 01:07:49,980
It's like the phone is right here.

1492
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,080
It's like, "Hey guys, I'm doing completely okay."

1493
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,740
His head is fucking huge here.

1494
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:56,740
And look at this.

1495
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:57,740
I got him, man.

1496
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:01,020
This is him in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.

1497
01:08:01,020 --> 01:08:02,700
He's got a weird comb over there.

1498
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:03,940
They changed his hair.

1499
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:05,060
They changed his hair.

1500
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:06,700
They changed Jamie Foxx's hair.

1501
01:08:06,700 --> 01:08:07,700
I believe this shit.

1502
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:10,100
Look at him in Jango, he's wearing a blue suit.

1503
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:11,900
Uh-huh, where's his blue suit now?

1504
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:14,500
Wait, he changed clothes too?

1505
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:17,300
I'm starting to stop believing that he's passed on.

1506
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,700
He's dead, they cloned him like Gucci Mane.

1507
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:22,800
They didn't even clone him. They barely made an effort.

1508
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,500
Wait, did they clone Gucci Mane?

1509
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:27,100
No, no, Jamie Foxx. They definitely did clone Gucci Mane.

1510
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,100
Yeah, Gucci Mane was cloned.

1511
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,100
They cloned him in prison.

1512
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:29,600
Yeah.

1513
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,900
The real Gucci is stuck in a vat somewhere.

1514
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,600
They put him in a vat like Snoke.

1515
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,100
There's no doubt in my mind.

1516
01:08:36,100 --> 01:08:37,500
Put him in a vat like Snoke.

1517
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:43,180
Well guys, at the end of the month I'm going to be in DC with old Adam Friedland.

1518
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:44,380
And I mean old.

1519
01:08:44,380 --> 01:08:45,380
Yeah, he's very old.

1520
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:46,780
This guy is pushing 50.

1521
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:47,780
He is.

1522
01:08:47,780 --> 01:08:50,220
It is crazy how old he is.

1523
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:51,420
No one talks about it.

1524
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:54,360
He is 50 or 60 years old.

1525
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,140
He looks young, he acts young, don't fall for it.

1526
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:01,340
Good for him how young he looks because he is like fucking decrepit.

1527
01:09:01,340 --> 01:09:03,540
He's literally, his fingers fall off sometimes.

1528
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:04,540
Yeah.

1529
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,140
Yeah, when we're sitting in the hotel.

1530
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,220
August 24th through the 26th, we're going to be in DC.

1531
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:10,060
Go to his website for some details.

1532
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:11,580
- Do you have any other,

1533
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,020
oh, we haven't planned the shareholders meeting.

1534
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:16,300
- We'll figure that out.

1535
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:19,980
- Yeah, I have no standup dates.

1536
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,660
- Big surprise.

1537
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:23,100
- Well, last month I did.

1538
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,260
- Last month you did.

1539
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:25,220
- Mm-hmm.

1540
01:09:25,220 --> 01:09:30,220
I'm going to start, you can see me at the skate park.

1541
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:31,980
I'm getting back into it.

1542
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:32,820
- What skate park's you going to?

1543
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,340
- Probably Blue Park.

1544
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:35,180
You can see me at Blue Park.

1545
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,180
What days do you usually go?

1546
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:39,180
Pretty much every day in the week.

1547
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:40,180
Are you going to go today?

1548
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:42,180
Maybe, no it's going to rain.

1549
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:45,180
It's going to be 10% rain all day, you can skate through that.

1550
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:48,180
Maybe, but I don't want to get my new board wet.

1551
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:49,180
I also bought new bearings.

1552
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:51,180
Pussy.

1553
01:09:51,180 --> 01:09:53,180
Buy you a waterproof board.

1554
01:09:53,180 --> 01:09:54,180
That's a good idea.

1555
01:09:54,180 --> 01:09:55,180
Get a surfboard.

1556
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:57,180
That's a good idea, I should be doing that.

1557
01:09:57,180 --> 01:09:58,180
Not a problem.

1558
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,180
Alright, bye.

1559
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:00,180
Bye.
