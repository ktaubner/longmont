No, but I love reggae too much and he was ruining reggae.

00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,800
You think that he ruined reggae with that song? How about Bob Marley ruined it with drugs?

That's true. You ever think about that?

These reggae guys gotta stop smoking weed. Imagine how good the music would be then.

Yeah, if they didn't fucking fall asleep in the middle of every song,

have their bongo guy pick up the slack. Come on, dude.

He took one hit of a joint and got cancer.

Weed actually gives you, it's the purest form of cancer, of lung cancer you can get.

It's actually the most dangerous kind.

76

That's why it looks like a little green blob like that.

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,320
That's what a tumor looks like.

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,440
Why would you smoke, it's called a cannabinoid.

79
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Why would you smoke anything that ends with -oid?

80
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Right?

81
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,440

93
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,480
- Thunder's gonna wake up the monster.

94
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,880
- No, thunder is-- - Wake up the monster

95
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,720
within me.

96
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,960
You're thinking lightning. - Lightning is the sound.

97
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,400
- The animal within me.

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
Are you kidding me?

100
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,480
- No, lightning is the sound.

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,120
A thunder, a bolt of thunder.

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,040
- What are you fucking saying?

103
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,200
A sound bolt? - Lightning is blue.

104
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,680
- A sound bolt. - Thunder is yellow.

105
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,800
- Light is the sound, of course.

106
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,240
- Lightning is not blue.

107
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,320
- Yeah, lightning is blue and thunder is the yellow.

108
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,120
Anytime you see a blue bulb, that's lightning.

109
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,120
- Thunder is the cloud, and lightning is what happens

110
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,160
when a thunder hits something.

111
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
- Oh no, wait.

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,400
I'm thinking of the hurricanes.

113
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,560
- I think that might actually be true.

114
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,400
- Yeah.

115
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,160
- Lightning is fire, and thunder is air.

116
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,760
- Everybody else knows that thunder is just

117
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
a yellow lightning.

118
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,080
This is like how you guys call the stores

119
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,880
a racial slur in Boston.

120
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,280
- That's true, the liquor store is a racial slur.

121
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,400
It's not a racial slur 'cause it's spelled differently.

122
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,760
- It's true. - It's short for package store.

123
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,040
- Do you get packages there?

124
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,880
- Yeah. - You get packages of liquor.

125
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,920

You call a bottle a package?

129

- You can't even say the word pen right.

130
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,520
- Dude, you're not one to be talking.

131
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,960
- Pen.

132

- Here, see I'm stupid like you guys.

- Hey, let me get a pen real quick.

138
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,200
sound like Griffin McElroy. I actually don't sound anything like Griffin McElroy.

139
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh I have a very straight voice. I don't sound like either of those two fucking dumbasses. I sound really normal and like myself.

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,760
back to your normal voice. Oh, dude, I hate this. I think COVID is affecting my voice.

141
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,160
I'm actually COVID free. I'm negative. Really? Oh, nice. Are you like immune or something?

142
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,320
Dude, I think that I can't get it. I think I might be immune too. I think I'm protected

143
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,480
by God's grace or something because it's impossible for me to get COVID-19 apparently. Because

144
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:02,480
I've been, you know, I've been living with this, with a monster. Yeah. Who has the virus.

145
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I've been living with the--

146
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,480
Maybe you'll get it like right when she's done having it.

147
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Yeah.

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
That would be so funny.

149
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,400
And then we just trade back and forth for the rest of our lives, saying, "Yes, say yes."

150
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,480
It's a good song, dude.

151
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,200
Oh man, I can't-- what did you say, April 6th is when everyone can get vaccinated in

152
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
the state?

153
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
Yeah, dude.

154
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,360
I can't wait to put that fucking chip in me.

155
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,560
I'm so sick of wearing my mask.

156
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:35,800
I mean I haven't been wearing it when I skate but like when I leave the skate park or something

157
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:41,960
or I leave the skate spot when I'm by myself I'm not I can't wear it because I'm gonna

158
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
sweat.

159
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,960
Patrick I want you to wait I want before you keep saying what you're gonna say I want you

160
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,320
to know that no matter how distraught you are when you text me after the episode and

161
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,880
ask if I can cut out that part where you mentioned the mask so you people don't get mad at you

162
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
I'm not gonna do it.

163
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
Okay no no.

164
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,240
Now you can keep saying what you're gonna say just want to let that caveat out.

166
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,240
He's been shooting spitballs at people.

167
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,240
No, I just, I don't wear it when I skate, but then I'll put it back on

168
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,240
and then I just have like the sweat on my face

169
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,240
seeping into the mask. I don't care, I don't care, like,

170
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
you're not gonna wear it while you're like riding a bike or something, like.

171
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,240
I did.

172
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,240
You did?

173
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,240
Kind of what you're supposed to do, yeah.

174
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
Are you supposed to, I don't know.

175
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I mean, I didn't always, but yeah, you definitely are supposed to wear it.

176
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,240
You on a skateboard is a far cry from someone on a bike also.

177
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Yeah.

178
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
You spend a lot of time, I've seen you skate,

179
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,160
you spend a lot of time kinda just sitting there.

180
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,080
Yeah.

181
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,920
Yep.

182
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,560
I know, I think it's definitely much harder,

183
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,520
if you don't have a mask that's made for athletic stuff,

184
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,200
it really sucks to wear one when you're on a bike

185
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,800
and you're running and shit, you can't breathe.

186
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,600
I got one for athletic stuff, so I might start wearing that.

187
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,360
But just like, just wearing like the shit that I have now, like the paper ones

188
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,700
It's just like

189
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,400
I'm also sure the people that you're like hanging out with at the skate park probably have far worse diseases

190
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,560
Like eating away at their minds or whatever, so

191
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,820
I don't think it's that big a deal

192
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,100
I pulled up and like nobody's fucking wearing them

193
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
So I was just like, well I don't wanna be a pussy and

194
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,360
You, oh my god dude

195
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,680
Masks are fucking knee pads to you

196
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
They're knee pads and helmets

197
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,520
You just get there and you're like, oh I guess it's gay to be wearing a mask here

198
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,040
because all the skaters will think I'm a I'm a new jack so I'll fucking put on a

199
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:30,320
I will take off my mask and give them all my diseases I'm fine I I don't go near

200
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,200
me no no one goes near anybody it's all look I don't the coolest the coolest

201
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:44,120
thing is what I did to my head really bad the coolest mask thing is when you

202
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,720
like walk by a really old person who's holding a mask like in their hand like

203
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,000
just like holding on to it and whenever they walk by somebody they just kind of

204
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,560
like move it around in their hand like to look like they're about to like put it

205
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,920
on to walk by you but it's just like they do it every time they walk by

206
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,960
somebody so there's just them like just turning it over in their hands a bunch

207
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:05,200
of times right you can just leave it at home nobody's gonna yell at you you're

208
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,200
80 years old I'll wear it yeah you're the one who's gonna I don't care if you

209
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,720
don't if you're over 60 and you don't wear a mask yeah you don't have to be

210
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,720
like a sleight-of-hand thing whenever you walk by me I'm not gonna like deck

211
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,480
you yeah I'll wear it in like a store or whatever like yeah I'll wear it like if

212
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,400
it's like a big public thing or like a fight like I was like going into a store

213
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,720
or whatever I'll wear it I don't care if an old person's not wearing it around me

214
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,720
yeah I mean I'll wear it if I'm within one inch of someone else otherwise right

215
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,800
never never I will never wear mine and I'm I got a wet mouth let me tell you I

216
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,680
I'm just I'm shooting particles everywhere Jesus I can't wait to just

217
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:49,160
pour my spit onto other people again. My shit's like an aloe vera plant dude.

218
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,320
I have a camelback pouch that I spit into and then it sprays back out on the people around

219
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,640
me like the fire hose in Mario Sunshine. What's that thing called?

220
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,640
The flood. The flood, yeah.

221
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,100
I got one of those but it's filled with my spit.

222
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,320
And does it talk to you? Nope.

223
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,900
- Hello, Gameron.

224
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,980
- No, it doesn't do that.

225
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,820
- Hello. - It doesn't even--

226
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,900
- Stop! - I love you, Gameron.

227
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,980
- The flood didn't talk like that.

228
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,100
The flood was just like--

229
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:19,940
- I love yours. - Wait, wait, wait,

230
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,900
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

231
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,020
- No, uh-uh.

232
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:22,860
- Yeah, it did.

233
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
- Not in the cut scenes?

234
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,100
- I think you maybe bought a foreign version

235
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,940
of the game, Patrick.

236
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
- No, I'm thinking of Professor E. Gadd

237
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,780
from Luigi's Mansion.

238
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,380
- Yeah, remember it speaks in Chinese in the game?

239
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,900
- No. (laughing)

240
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,180
- Remember that?

241
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,820
- No, I'm thinking of Professor E. Gadd.

242
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,660
All Professor E. Gadd says--

243
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,380
- The Flood had a beautiful voice.

244
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,340
The Flood was the only talking character in that game.

245
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,740
- Yeah, Professor E. Gadd, all he said was, "Oi!"

246
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,060
- Except for the beginning where Peach goes, "Mario!"

247
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,260
- Whoa, oh my God.

248
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,100
- Wow.

249
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,920
- Sorry.

250
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,760
- Princess Peach.

251
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,600
- Yeah.

252
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,420
- Hey, hey.

253
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,260
- Oh my God.

254
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,100
- She doesn't say that.

255
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:53,920
- Princess Peach entered game as well.

256
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,340
- Hey, hey Mario.

257
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,560
Hey, Papi Mario.

258
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,580
- Nah, she doesn't sound like that.

259
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,420
- No, not at all.

260
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,660
That's what Toad sounds like.

261
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,420
- Yeah, you're right.

262
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,580
- Toad's like,

263
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,960
(screeching)

264
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,120
- You clipped.

265
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,300
(laughing)

266
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,260
- No, that was just my voice.

267
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,380
- Wow, dude.

268
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,220
Wow, you really sound like you.

269
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,860
- I can see the recording right here, I didn't clip.

270
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,140
- You did Jack Black reverse singing.

271
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,380
- What's that? - That's impressive.

272
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,860
(singing)

273
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,660
- Oh no, that wasn't an in-tail, that was an exhale.

274
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,180
- Oh, sheesh.

275
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,260
- You guys will never, never nail me down.

276
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,480
I'm too good.

277
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,320
- Not too good in my house.

278
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,020
- You'll never figure out how I made that noise.

279
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,460
- I'm nailing you down so fast.

280
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,300
Do you think when they open up the vaccine thing

281
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,780
New York we're gonna have to wait like a year maybe probably right that's what I

282
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,580
want Carolina you can you can literally it doesn't matter how old you are you

283
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,100
just ask for extras cuz there's like nobody getting vaccinated here it's like

284
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,660
every like I know so many people who should not be getting the vaccine who've

285
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,180
got vaccinated like they just have like rich parents or whatever which is like

286
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,820
fine but it's like if you guys are already like managing to trick the

287
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,560
system when you'd like you're supposed to either be like 70 years old or have

288
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,840
like two life-threatening conditions like once it like loosens up more there's no

289
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:13,160
way I'm ever getting it like everyone's gonna go nice right oh yeah yeah it's

290
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,640
gotta be absolutely yeah I think I need to we need to argue the podcasters

291
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:22,600
should be on the absolutely dude yeah we bring so much more joy to people's lives

292
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,480
than a fucking like nurse or school teacher those people bring negativity

293
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,560
everywhere they go yeah also also weed addicts both of them yeah nobody likes a

294
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,480
CBD gummy more than a nurse, you know?

295
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,400
Yep. They're just wasteful.

296
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,480
Because they'll have back pain.

297
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,880
Nurses are just, they're a drag on society.

298
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:47,840
It would be funny to get it like as soon as the vaccines start opening up to the public.

299
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,680
Just get it immediately?

300
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,000
Yeah, just like the day of.

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,320
I mean, that's kind of exactly what Jana did.

302
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:52,560
Yeah.

303
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,320
They opened in one week and Jana got it a week ago.

304
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,800
and she's just asleep with YouTube. She can't even like stop the YouTube autoplay.

305
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,400
It's just like playing in my living room. She's like, "I'm watching it."

306
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:11,920
See, now I feel like I've had it. Like every time that somebody describes like COVID, it's like,

307
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,160
"Oh, yeah."

308
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,120
You're just tired.

309
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,960
Yeah, you've had like two bad days in a row.

310
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:16,320
Yeah.

311
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,120
Yeah, that's probably what you had.

312
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,400
It lasts two weeks, you know.

313
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,640
Yeah. It lasts two weeks and you go--

314
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,560
I had it for six months then.

315
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,520
I've been just she falls asleep and I'm just like a weekend at Bernie's using her body to make me lunch.

316
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:36,240
Just walking around the house making her do her normal chores that I give her every day.

317
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,520
Just making sure they get done. Hey listen bitch I'm not doing that shit. No excuses.

318
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:44,720
It's great to finally put that pulley system to use.

319
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,480
Like exactly yeah I got the marionette.

320
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,680
In case of something like this.

321
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,360
I got the marionette the human marionette system installed in my apartment

322
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,640
just for stuff like this, you know what I mean? And it's coming in handy, finally.

323
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,000
Yeah.

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,920
There goes all three of my stimulus checks were spent on a giant marionette pulley system that

325
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,440
can support a human who weighs 120 pounds.

326
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,360
I used to use it so I could go pee in the night without having to wake up and get out of bed,

327
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,960
but it's nice to repurpose it.

328
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,760
Yeah, I would pre-program it for shit.

329
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,000
Yeah.

330
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,680
For anyone at home who wants to pick up this pulley system,

331
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,600
go to daddysausage.com.

332
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,440
(laughing)

333
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,280
- Exactly.

334
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,580
- That's right, you can pick this pulley system up.

335
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,420
Is that a website?

336
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,260
Let's see what--

337
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,080
- Daddy Sausage.

338
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,080
Don't go to daddysausage.com, dude.

339
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,920
You have no brain.

340
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,360
- No, guys, we have to see what's on this website.

341
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,200
- We have to check just for no reason.

342
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,680
- Wait, just for laughs, though.

343
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,600
- Daddy Sausage has to be a website, right?

344
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,040
- BigDaddySausage.com.

345
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,520
This site cannot be reached.

346
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,840
DaddySausage.com.

347
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,040
- Let's just see what happens if we search Daddy's Sausage

348
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,080
on X videos.

349
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,920
Let's just see if something comes up.

350
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,340
- Daddy's Sausage dot com is a,

351
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:57,560
it's like someone's sitting on the domain.

352
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,900
Let me see, Daddy's Sausage.

353
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,100
Daddy's Sausage and Peppers recipe.

354
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,680
(laughing)

355
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,520
- No.

356
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,740
- That article is a, you're gonna click on that article

357
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,620
and it's gonna take you somewhere dark.

358
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,920
- Nobody would click on that article

359
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,200
unless they're looking for something evil.

360
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,220
- Step one, slice each sausage link into five pieces,

361
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,700
heat one tablespoon of oil in a large skillet

362
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,540
over medium high heat.

363
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,380
- That's dirty.

364
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,980
- I thought you said eat one tablespoon of oil.

365
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:27,820
(laughing)

366
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,780
- It's delicious, dude.

367
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:31,340
Now, if I get COVID, I'm going full FDR.

368
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,340
You guys will never know.

369
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,180
- Yeah?

370
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,180
- Yeah.

371
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,780
You guys will have no idea.

372
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,300
It'll be like--

373
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:38,980
- So you already have it then.

374
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,060
- It is funny that they,

375
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,860
how long did they do that with FDR?

376
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,300
- Probably like a week.

377
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:50,220
I think they did it for a while dude. Can you imagine just like FDR like a

378
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:58,220
Yankees game or whatever in the in the 1700s? And now I'll rise for the

381
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,780

398
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:46,780
embrace a stew that I'm eating right before I die here's an article and

399
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,340
atheists and believers have different moral compasses yeah millions of dead

400
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:59,180
jellyfish are washing up around the world the blob could be to blame the blob

401
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:04,020
what this I know I honestly I don't need to know about the I don't need another

402
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,900
thing I get on my plate right now do not tell me about anything about the blob is

403
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,380
real I don't want to know dude this is the best kind of website the website

404
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,820
where it's like branded is like oh this is like Neil deGrasse Tyson's website

405
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,020
but it's just like clickbait for for 13 year olds who think that the world is

406
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:28,020
actually changing around them they don't realize what's important yet mm-hmm like

407
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:34,300
they read about the blob and they're like mom dad did you hear about the blob do

408
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:39,980
you think FDR had to take the presidential fitness test this article

409
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,420
could humans ever be venomous humans have what it takes to make venom but it may

410
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:51,480
not be worth the trouble wait what okay that I want to know yeah if I wait if I

411
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,960
have what it takes to make venom this article is definitely poppus I could do

412
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,400
so much cool shit with venom dude are you kidding me yeah here I would rob a bank

413
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,320
essentially my mouth all the building blocks in play every guy now it's up to

414
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:13,160
evolution to take us there shut up fuck if I if I had the power of venom I

415
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:19,600
probably just like it depends on what type of like is it like a brundle fly

416
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,020
venom like that kind of shit it's human venom yeah but I'm thinking of like the

417
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,340
closest does it being to like human venom which would probably be like probably

418
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:35,020
be well a platypus it has has mammal venom also you probably wouldn't be able

419
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,020
to kill other humans with it I'm thinking you probably be immune to it

420
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:44,940
yeah you would only be able to like put your dog down with your teeth yeah that

421
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:47,820
would be the main you know it's I'm going with the platypus model I think

422
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,740
you're gonna have little like spikes on your legs that you know that's like

423
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,060
- Stomach acid, right? - You kinda kick into someone.

424
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,100
- The brundle fly, he spits up like stomach acid

425
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,940
to break out. - Yeah, that's like acid.

426
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,260
That's like a-- - Yeah, that's a lot different

427
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,540
for venom. - 'Cause that's what flies do.

428
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,420
- Yeah, 'cause there's like a huge--

429
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,740
- Venom, I think, congeals blood.

430
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,340
- Right, venom is like poison.

431
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,180
I'm, goddammit, I'm so fucking stupid.

432
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,220
I'm so fucking dumb. - No, venom,

433
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,740
poison you eat, and venom gets injected into you.

434
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:13,780
- Yeah, okay. - That's the difference.

435
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,460
- Yeah, I mean, it's a very confusing topic for me.

436
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:19,540
- It's really confusing. - I don't have to deal

437
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,620
with venom often.

438
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,620
No, thank God.

439
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,620
Luckily Patrick doesn't have venom.

440
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:29,620
Imagine if my side job was just like a snake tamer.

441
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,620
Just the worst snake tamer of all time.

442
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,620
You just always walk around puffed up in red, full of holes.

443
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,620
Yeah, I got bit again today.

444
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,620
Shouldn't have been fucking with him.

445
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,620
Oh, here we go.

446
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,620
Another mammal with venom is dead.

447
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,620
I was trying to reason with the snakes today.

448
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,620
See if we had anything in common.

449
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,620
I was trying to make a song with a rattlesnake.

450
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,620
I don't see the problem.

451
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,300
you would get in trouble. You would be like the guy at the snake handling place

452
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:03,860
who like feeds them human food. Yeah. Yeah. I let him have a lick of my giant jawbreaker I always have on me.

453
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:08,100
I wanted to see a hamburger outline in a ball python.

454
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:15,380
Yeah. There's just forever there's snakes at McDonald's now because the snakes told each other about it.

455
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:22,240
I ran the snakes out of the observatory and now they all fled to McDonald's.

456
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,240
It's called a serpentarium.

457
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,240
Okay.

458
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,220
I think it's called a herp- Much like my ancestor St. Patrick.

459
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,060
There was a serpentarium in Wilmington, North Carolina.

460
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
A herpitarium is reptiles.

461
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:37,060
I've talked about this, but the owner got shot in the head.

462
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,860
I've heard of this.

463
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,860
Pretty fucking cool, dude.

464
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:43,900
I used to see him fucking feed his Komodo dragon.

465
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:51,660
It was sick dude. I don't know why a person owning a Komodo dragon is very funny. He kept

466
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:58,220
a giant Komodo dragon in a room about the size of like a storage box. Like something you

467
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,020
would like pack your clothes in when you move. And he was like, yeah he loves it in here dude.

468
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:07,900
Look, there's this painting of a tree that he thinks is a real tree. Fucking asshole.

469
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:13,140
Here I'm gonna feed him a rabbit. Those things are so scary. Dude they eat fucking goats and

470
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,140
Yeah, he would eat them.

471
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,140
No, they don't.

472
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,140
What?

473
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Yes, they do.

474
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,140
What are you talking about?

475
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Yeah.

476
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,140
Komodo dragons are fucking crazy, dude.

477
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,140
I thought they were like vegetarians.

478
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
They have bacteria.

479
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
What is?

480
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,140
Are you the stupidest guy on earth?

481
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,140
Look at that fucking thing.

482
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,640
You think there's a vegetarian dragon?

483
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,820
Are you brain dead?

484
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,820
I thought that was the trade-off.

485
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
No, Komodo dragons are fucking...

486
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,820
We got to have dragons, but they were vegetarian.

487
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,820
You're thinking of like a bearded dragon, which I don't think is vegetarian either.

488
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,820
Oh, yeah.

489
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
It's a lizard.

490
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,820
It eats roaches.

491
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:39,820
I used to have to feed one.

492
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,860
But Komodo dragons, they have bacteria in their saliva.

493
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:51,260
So what they do is they bite a really big animal, they just bite it once and then they just

494
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:56,560
wait near it for it to die because the bacteria poisons its bloodstream and it just decays

495
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,520
and dies over the next few days.

496
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,480
That's what I do to a crunch rat, supreme.

497
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,200
Take one bite and just wait for it to die?

498
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
I wait for the heartburn to go away.

499
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,800
From one bite, take another bite.

500
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,680
I take one bite of a Crunchwrap Supreme and then wait for me to die.

501
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:21,240
Dude, putting, bringing a Crunchwrap Supreme into the apartment is like the

502
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,280
scene in Jurassic Park when the Tyrannosaurus eats a goat for Patrick.

503
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:31,920
He just comes like, the whole house starts shaking, he's walking out of his

504
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,920
room.

505
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,200
Just towards the Taco Bell that's on the counter.

506
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,720
Alright, so these are the 11 surprising uses for pee and poop by

507
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,800
by Mindy Weisberger.

508
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,760
- Okay, when most animal bodies process--

509
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,260
- By Fred Fredberger.

510
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,040
- Are you done?

511
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,480
- What, what did you even say?

512
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,080
- I watched that episode of Billy and Mandy again recently.

513
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,960
Remember the Fred Fredberger episode?

514
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,800
- No, I'm an adult.

515
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,080
- I remember the guy.

516
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,120
- Yeah, that was a good episode.

517
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,440
- When most animal bodies process nutrients,

518
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,880
they expel waste in the form of liquids and solids,

519
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:06,080
generally referred to as urine and feces.

520
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,240
Oh, come on.

521
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,400
Waste is usually smelly and unappetizing,

522
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,520
for people at least.

523
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,700
but it can also be surprisingly beneficial.

524
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,120
- Some people like to eat it though.

525
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,320
- Yeah dude, fly people.

526
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,520
Pee and poo have a wide range of applications,

527
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,560
providing nutrients for diverse ecosystems,

528
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,360
serving as a foundation for expensive perfumes,

529
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,320
what the hell, or even fueling robots.

530
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,120
- So this is just spoilers right there.

531
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,280
- Yeah I'm already ripped in.

532
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,800
Yeah my bad.

533
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,200
Here are just a few of their unexpected uses.

534
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,820
- There's a lot, I mean, having like a poop eating fetish,

535
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:38,700
that's a lot of work.

536
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,320
- Someone I know recently--

537
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,320
That's way less work than eating any other kind of food.

538
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,560
It doesn't cost money and you don't have to prepare it.

539
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,400
It just comes out of you.

540
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,240
What do you mean?

541
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,200
What do you mean that's way?

542
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,680
You gotta go make a sandwich.

543
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,560
Either, okay, either you have to stand up,

544
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,400
you go make a sandwich,

545
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,640
you have to make sure you have all the ingredients

546
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,920
and everything, all right?

547
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,600
Are you rationalizing eating poop?

548
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,960
No, I'm saying it's easier.

549
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,080
Just think about it.

550
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,400
You don't have to rationalize anything,

551
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,400
it just makes sense.

552
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,520
It just makes sense!

553
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,760
It just makes sense, you eat your own poop!

554
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,600
It just makes sense!

555
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,460
If you had a mini fridge stuck in your stomach,

556
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,540
Would you take the food out of it?

557
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,380
Yes.

558
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,220
(laughing)

559
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
You'd eat the food.

560
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,260
- Are you really trying to tell me

561
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,260
it's less work to cook dinner than to go poop?

562
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:23,700
- I'm just picturing a guy with like a door on his belly

563
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,340
just like taking poop out.

564
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,100
- Jerry Seinfeld just like slowly body modding himself

565
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,860
into like a cyborg monster to make his life more efficient.

566
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,940
- My hands are forks, it just makes sense.

567
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,380
Never have to pick up a fork again.

568
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,700
- I got one hand that's a fork,

569
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,840
I got one hand that's a knife.

570
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,200
I can fucking eat my food.

571
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,920
- What's the deal with that?

572
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,220
- Yeah, I think he should get into futurism.

573
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,060
I think he'll be like a Walt Disney style.

574
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,440
- What's the deal with phones nowadays?

575
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,800
They don't work with your fork and knife hands.

576
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,160
(laughing)

577
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,600
You can't press the screen.

578
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,280
- Keep breaking my damn screen.

579
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,120
- I can't use the face ID on my phone

580
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,400
'cause I turned my eyebrows into salt and pepper shakers.

581
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,680
What's the deal with that?

582
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,840
(laughing)

583
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,760
- You ever notice that your left hand has four fingers

584
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
And your right hand has no fingers?

585
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,760
What's the deal with that?

586
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,760
I shake my head over my food

587
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,760
I turn my hair into spaghetti

588
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,760
I'm a food monster

589
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
I never go hungry again

590
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:24,760
It just makes sense

591
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
I replaced my legs with a table.

592
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,760
I can sit down and eat whenever I want.

593
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
Never have to look for a picnic table ever again.

594
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,760
My ass is a soft serve machine.

595
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
I have to serve whenever I want.

596
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
I'm like a penis on a hot dog.

597
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:56,760
What's the deal with dogs?

598
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
Why are they always barking around me?

599
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,760
Why are they trying to get into my pants?

600
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Isn't it the worst?

601
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,080
Isn't it the worst when you get on a plane and dog starts eating your spaghetti hair?

602
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,080
at the worst fucking Seinfeld

603
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:14,540
Strangers are so rude sometimes. I'll ask for my salt and pepper eyebrows

604
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:23,600
Do you have any pepper I say yes no for you it's in my eyebrows just makes

605
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,440
Okay

606
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,600
From poop to perfume a

607
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,140
Yellowish gray rock found on a beach in the UK was greasy and smelled terrible and no wonder

608
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,640
That's the most interesting news story of all time

609
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:50,500
That's what news is in the UK is this they found a greasy rock that smelled terrible

610
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,440
Fucking beach

611
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,920
At first I thought it was my mum but it wasn't my mum.

612
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,920
I was rubbing my tolja in some sand.

613
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:09,560
I walked up to the rock and I said "hey mum, what are you doing here?"

614
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:12,640
And it did respond so I knew then it was my mum.

615
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,640
It was a rock.

616
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,560
Mum, you've been quite odd today, you're not talking to me, you're icing me out.

617
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,160
You're quite greasy and smell bad.

618
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,480
It looked like my mum, it smelled like my mum but it wasn't my mum.

619
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
- Some kind of damn... - Does your skin feel like my mom's?

620
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
Some kind of damn rock.

621
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,480
And that's why I called the news.

622
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
That's the reporter, yeah.

623
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,480
That's not an interviewee, that's just the guy with the microphone.

624
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,480
So I'm here doing an investigative report on...

625
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Back to you, Nigel. Back to you.

626
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
Back to me. Back to me.

627
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Thank you so much, Adam Curtis.

628
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Thank you.

629
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,480
We have Adam Curtis in the field, talking to a rock.

630
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,480
I say, "Hey, Mum, when is dinner gonna be ready?"

631
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,480
And she said, "Oh," she didn't say anything.

632
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,480
I started talking for her.

633
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,480
"And we'll be right back after I take a break to love a child."

634
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,480
That's what they're like in the damn UK.

635
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,480
And no wonder, as it originated in the guts of a sperm whale.

636
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,480
"Hey, what the? What kind of whale?"

637
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
"Sperm whale?"

638
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
"The slick, malodorous, like-it-eat."

639
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,520
I want to put my whale sperm in your guts, Pat.

640
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:29,020
*laughter*

641
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,520
The slick-

642
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,020
No! No!

643
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,520
I'm gonna make a yellowish-gray rock inside you.

644
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
I knew this was gonna be a nasty-

645
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,520
I wanna put my grease- my greasy rock-

646
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,520
I knew this was gonna be a nasty episode, what with the poop and the pee,

647
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
but does it have to be gay too?

648
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,520
*laughter*

649
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
Can we just pick one?

650
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,020
Well yeah man, you're on it.

651
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:50,500
The slick Malodorous lump was a sizable chunk of

652
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:54,300
ambergris a very ambergris fuck off

653
00:30:54,300 --> 00:31:00,780
This fatty substance thought to form in whales digestive tracts around sharp objects

654
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:04,200
Objects fuck god damn it such as squid beaks

655
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,080
You're a sharp object fuck you

656
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,820
whales then poop out the ambergris

657
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:17,540
Which is right which is highly prized by humans as an ingredient a practice you keep talking about ambergris

658
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,720
Just know that you're the man for me

659
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:24,560
And

660
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,260
I think that you have a pricey fragrance too and I would estimate you to be worth at least

661
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:34,120
$68,000 and possibly as much as a hundred and eighty thousand dollars. All right popcorn Cameron

662
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,320
The love found on the beach was estimated to be worth at least sixty eight thousand dollars and possibly as much as a hundred and eighty thousand

663
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,160
dollars

664
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,060
Recommended videos for you live science. That's how we should do the rest of the episode

665
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:57,820
No

666
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:04,880
Okay, that's a really bad. That's true. Caleb never had to be in a class. I never did popcorn reading. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

667
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:13,360
I never died for to die this is number two a die for 1500 year old Byzantine copy

668
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,920
of the New Testament known as the codex purpureus resenatus okay fuck you dude

669
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,200
it's printed on purple pages and researchers recently uncovered the

670
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,080
long-held secret behind the parchments vivid color urine the thing about all

671
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,600
what names like that where they name it like codex whatever is like that's I

672
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,200
think just Latin for book so like literally like it's just that they

673
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,720
called the book like this is my purple book and then the researchers were like

674
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,040
oh my god we've uncovered the Kodak's perpureus. We've uncovered the Omnitrix Diabolico.

675
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:55,240
Yeah it's called like my favorite story. Cool stories with with Joe. Analysis of

676
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,800
the tome revealed, you don't have to call it, it's a book dude, revealed that the pages

677
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:03,760
derived their purple hue from orcyon a dye extracted from the fungus rocalla

678
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,800
ting blah blah blah and then processed with fermented urine the manuscript which

679
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:15,720
is about half complete is written in gold and silver ink on 18... 188. I fucking read

680
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:27,640
that. And likely originated in Syria between... I just gave up too, you thought halfway through the number. I saw that I said 18 to start saying

681
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,200
1800 and then immediately I was like I'm just gonna it doesn't matter. It's like accidentally

682
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:38,920
walking into the closet instead of the bathroom and just staying in the bathroom.

683
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:46,680
Yeah dude sometimes my brain invents an extra digit it happens dude whatever they should die

684
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,560
more books with pee. They should. I should say. What makes you think they don't you ever notice how old

685
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:56,200
book pages turn yellow? Also have you ever had to pee on a road trip and you have like a copy of

686
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,760
infinite jest in the car yeah that'll soak up a whole fucking piss dude big

687
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,660
book like that have you have you ever done the tea bagging thing with old but

688
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,400
paper to make it look old yeah yeah and then you put it in a bottle and then put

689
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,160
it in like a like a puddle outside your house you can like a pirate's gonna find that

690
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:18,840
thing yeah yeah the uh that with my tax return

691
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:28,040
running with a quill yeah the irs pops it open they're like

692
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,320
why does it smell like wood oh my god is in this is a tax return from the 1800s

693
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,240
this man is gonna get a million dollars here's what you here's what you do right

694
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,800
is yeah you you get your paycheck from your boss

695
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,080
you do that you like do all that stuff to it you bring it to the bank you're like

696
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,280
Well this was $300 from 1600 so who knows how much that's worth today.

697
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:48,840
That's a good point.

698
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:49,080
Yeah.

699
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,120
Because that's how this works.

700
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:53,480
Can you imagine how much black beardos and back taxes did?

701
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,200
Right.

702
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,640
Just like all that all that gold never paid a dime on it.

703
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:05,320
It says here it says here that this Popeye's fucking this Popeye's pay stub is from 1688.

704
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:09,000
Yep it's the first Popeye's actually.

705
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,000
works at the bank and then you you do it to a Domino's coupon you like hey I found

706
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,600
a coupon for a free pizza from 1500 that's gotta be worth probably it's got

707
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:23,080
to be like a hundred pizzas now like that right the pizza exchange rate like a

708
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:30,920
pizza back there was also way harder to find so that's hook a brother up tastes

709
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:38,600
like oh no oh no no researchers in Japan recently bought brought a

710
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,600
stomach-turning offering to the table

711
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:46,040
recently bought something really cool

712
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,280
it's called a game boy and you can play

713
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,360
Mario on it they have Lego Star Wars 2

714
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,360
by transforming human feces into steak

715
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,640
what the hell at the request of Tokyo

716
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:06,960
sewage let's do it Tokyo sewage is just

717
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,040
like the name of like a band yeah yeah yeah this is on their rider they were

718
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:23,040
like wait we will not fucking play if we don't have a poop fine ed penis we get

719
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,340
scientists investigated practical uses for XX sewage and discovered that they

720
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,000
could isolate proteins for bacteria and human waste combined with carbohydrates

721
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
fats, the result could be served as a meat-like substance.

722
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,040
See, the reason that they could do this in Japan is because they already have a whole

723
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:43,080
crafting system set up over there.

724
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,320
True.

725
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,160
They can just, they can easily craft it.

726
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,080
It's like a Pokemon typing thing, right?

727
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,960
Like steak and poop are the same type.

728
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Brown.

729
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
The brown things.

730
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

731
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,800
I'm excited to see Guga Foods make an A5 Wagyu poop.

732
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,080
Today we have a beautiful A5 Japanese Wagyu poop.

733
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,880
Dry-aged.

734
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Let's do it.

735
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:13,000
Angel, Angel, what do you think of the poop?

736
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,080
- Tastes like poop, man.

737
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:14,920
What the fuck?

738
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,160
(laughing)

739
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:20,260
- Drink up.

740
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,440
Oh no.

741
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,960
- I'm not gonna drink poop.

742
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,800
- Me neither.

743
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,880
- Again.

744
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,800
- Eating poop?

745
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:28,480
- Eating poop, that makes sense.

746
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,520
(laughing)

747
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,360
- Bless me.

748
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:36,560
Who's reading it?

749
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,000
I read the one before the last one.

750
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,280
Don't want to eat steak made from poop?

751
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,780
How about eating, I mean Patrick, all I'm going to say is if you say drink up, I was

752
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:47,520
expecting you to be the one reading it, but I can go ahead and keep going.

753
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,240
I can't read this without bumping into you.

754
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,600
I don't want to eat steak made from poop?

755
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,920
How about drinking a nice glass of water that used to be poop?

756
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,320
An innovative processing system called the OmniProcessor heats sewage sludge, separating

757
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,080
the liquid as water vapor that is then treated to make it suitable for drinking. I have to

758
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,900
say turning poop into water is not that interesting to me. I would rather them find a way to turn

759
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:14,240
water into poop. I want to go on a liquid diet and still poop.

760
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,320
Yeah, that is a really good point. Can Bill Gates drink the poop water?

761
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,880
Turn poop to wine, you know? Or like something better, like orange juice.

762
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,320
Yeah, exactly. Would you drink a poop milk?

763
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,980
What I will say though is that you turn the poop into water, drink the water, turn the

764
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,540
water to pee that's a poop to pee pipeline right there that is pretty

765
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,180
impressive that is very impressive actually if you can figure out a way to

766
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:43,580
turn poop to pee or that's like a that's like a Jesus style miracle mm-hmm

767
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,980
exactly

768
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:51,260
building blocks okay oh I thought we were just skipping how long have we been

769
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:55,260
doing this fucking podcast and we can't get this down right now we can't figure

770
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:00,260
out who has to read this one doesn't have numbers on it it's throwing me off

771
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:05,460
Yeah, we're professionals dude. We're professionals when there's numbers, but I don't fucking see any

772
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,560
Yeah, we work best with numbers. That's one thing about us. We're really good. Oh, yes, you know me. I'm fucking

773
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,100
I'm the math genius

774
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,500
Okay building blocks

775
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,780
Bricks made from urine could one day service cheap sustainable building materials for homes and other structures

776
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,020
But how do you turn P into a brick and that's a link link?

777
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:31,360
It's a link and it brings you to a page that says very carefully it takes you to a page that says

778
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:37,460
It takes you to a page that says how to pee a brick and help save the planet while you do it

779
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,440
Wow, I just see that watch this if you'll pee bricks

780
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:48,820
Scientists mixed wait scientists mixed with fresh urine with lime

781
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:55,980
So there's a very big ingredient that they left out which is scientists

782
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:04,220
So you need a scientist you need and you need some limes the scientist is like a

783
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,280
bay leaf you know he's not in the final product but I used to be in there a

784
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:17,340
whole scientist yeah yeah you guys need to sit in this giant bath full of pee and

785
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:21,420
then just you just gotta finish all the scientists go home and he just turns it

786
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,540
into a brick easily. Yeah guys you did it. He pulls a brick out from under the

787
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:32,740
table. Great job you guys. And remember I need to take plenty of pictures and videos to

788
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:38,100
document my research. As the bricks are setting they do exude. I think your lab coat

789
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:42,060
and boxers are contaminating the mixture.

790
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,300
It says as the bricks are setting they do exude an unpleasant urine aroma though

791
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:53,220
the smell subsides in about 48 hours. There's no way that you smell, you like

792
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,620
get up close and you smell and it doesn't smell like piss.

793
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,380
Yeah, imagine if it gets hot in summer. Welcome to my beautiful home. What the fuck is that smell?

794
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,780
Well, my house is made of pee. If it starts like raining, I'm sure that

795
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:07,980
there's just pee is just gonna run off your walls, right? Your outside walls.

796
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:15,380
Yeah, I think we're being haunted by a pee ghost. There's pee everywhere. Also that

797
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,420
That feels more expensive than making normal bricks.

798
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,420
Yeah, because what, you have to give people water?

799
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,420
Who wants to do that?

800
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:23,420
Exactly.

801
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:24,420
To make the pee?

802
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,420
Uh, Poop-aroni.

803
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
Okay.

804
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:32,300
That's one where they started at the name and worked backwards.

805
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,060
Poop sausage may not sound like a tasty treat.

806
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,340
Oh dude, oh fuck, wait, no, keep reading!

807
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,660
But scientists have figured out how to use bacteria from baby poop.

808
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,480
It's the baby poop thing came to life, dude!

809
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,480
Would you rather eat poop or baby poop?

810
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
It's real!

811
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,800
You can either eat steak made from adult poop or sausage made from baby poop.

812
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,580
Make sausages that are both delicious and healthy.

813
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,100
Microbes are already harnessed to produce delicacies like cheese, wine, and beer, and

814
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,100
fermented sausages.

815
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,180
Why does it have to be baby poop?

816
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:11,120
And baby poop is chock full of microbes, particularly lactobacillus and bifidobacterium, which are

817
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,640
used in probiotics.

818
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,720
bacteria is cultured from poop in baby's diapers.

819
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,680
Researchers made a type of Spanish fermented pork sausage called "fit" and they claimed

820
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
that it tasted "very good."

821
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,000
Scientists seem to be locked away forever.

822
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,520
That's way worse than like making Frankenstein or whatever the evil scientists do.

823
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:36,280
Yeah, honestly, cloning is more morally like...

824
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,760
I can morally defend cloning more than I can defend eating baby poop.

825
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:43,680
There's an interview with a scientist and he just has a giant clothespin on his nose.

826
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,960
It actually tastes pretty normal.

827
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,000
It tastes like normal sausage actually.

828
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,040
It's very surprising.

829
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,640
The fact that they take it from diapers too.

830
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:53,640
Right.

831
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,640
Ugh.

832
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,160
There's gotta be something in the diaper that's making it.

833
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,040
Do you get like paid for the diapers?

834
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:04,040
If this continues, is there gonna be like people walking around New York City like going

835
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,560
through trash cans for diapers?

836
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,320
There, I mean there are.

837
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:08,320
The one- You do it, right?

838
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
Yeah, you.

839
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,640
i said it first the one where they turned into a mistake it's like the sewage

840
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,520
company asked them to like find something to do with poop

841
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:19,160
but i just want to say evil scientists were like i want to see if i can make

842
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,840
the man had to make a baby poop sausage

843
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:27,200
the mad scientist who makes baby poop sausage this mad scientist makes baby

844
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,800
poop sausage and he's and we stand this king

845
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,480
you know i hate how the media is always doing fluff pieces on mad baby poop

846
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,520
scientists so annoying so irritating to see on now this yeah dr. Heinrich baby

847
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,040
pooping

848
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:55,480
urine therapy and no you know you're in therapy in India cow urine has been used

849
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,320
for therapeutic purposes for at least 5,000 years and a Hindu group that

850
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,240
promotes drinking cow urine for its health benefits recently claimed that

851
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:06,640
the liquid offers a cure for around 70 to 80 incurable diseases like diabetes

852
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,160
according to Om Prakash of the cow protection department for the Hindu sect

853
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,000
RSS yeah I'm gonna trust the the cow protection guy

854
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,240
on like

855
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,480
fucking cow piss curing diabetes right yeah yeah my job my job is that I'm

856
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,760
obsessed with cows I love them I would do absolutely anything to be close to a

857
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:31,720
cow or even just like to live with it or or understand how it lives. I need to make sure there's as many

858
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,000
cows as possible and also it's their drinking their pee is actually really

859
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:44,920
good for you yeah for you you Michael because you are depressed yeah Michael

860
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,400
you're depressed Michael but just ask like a there's no way that this guy

861
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:58,520
knows Michael Roberts of of come on give me a place Portland Maine Portland Maine

862
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:07,440
yep all days on a 1843 suck my dick ass yeah Michael stay away from parking lots

863
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:17,120
yeah and me I'm coming for you Michael I'm gonna fucking kill you Michael

864
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:22,960
Michael Michael Roberts a second paragraph in the in the cow urine thing

865
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,760
is so great however health experts have questioned the effect of this of remedies

866
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,860
containing cow urine particularly when it is purported to treat or prevent cancer

867
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,860
yeah dude of course

868
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,860
that guy is like yeah dude I'm the guy who's like entire thing is protecting cows

869
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:43,860
cow piss is great cow shit is a you can use it like a condom cow fucking hair is

870
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:48,960
good to use as a seasoning my passion my passion for the protection of cows as a

871
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,120
species borders on erotic and I have to tell you you're gonna love drinking

872
00:45:53,120 --> 00:46:03,880
there we have found we have found a fifth udder on cows and it cures cancer mm-hmm

873
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,760
it's called stinky milk we have found a fifth element and it is a cow's piss you

874
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,960
look look these cows out of their fifth udders they're producing this thing

875
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,640
there's like a Gatorade and we need to get that shit need to get that shit in

876
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,320
in giant containers being poured on NCAA coaches and I've got an idea we'll call

877
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,320
it Gatorade Propel. Zero sugar.

878
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Robot fuel.

879
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,320
What the hell? The pumping action of an artificial heart sends

880
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:38,320
urine coursing over a microbial fuel cell in a device that could power

881
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,320
pollution monitoring robots, dubbed "eco-bots." These

882
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,320
p-powered bots represent technology that recycles waste into electricity.

883
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:50,320
Their fuel cells harness living microbes such as those that colonize the human gut and

884
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,240
sewage treatment plants. It's like the most like educational episode we've ever done.

885
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,280
Who cares? Yeah. Okay so there's robots that run on pee. Okay that's, just say that then.

886
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,560
Right. Just say there's a robot that runs on pee. Spare me the details. I don't care

887
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:07,000
that they help the environment. I do think it's funny that they're called pee

888
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,240
robots. Look if you saw how the poop sausage was made you'd

889
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:16,120
never eat poop sausage again. Yeah. Also, the old saying. This means that you have

890
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,500
to you cannot develop artificial intelligence because if these robots

891
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:28,140
find out about gasoline they're gonna be so mad you made us run on P you had

892
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:33,380
gasoline this entire time oh my god a guest appearance from Ray William

893
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:38,200
Johnson I have one robot voice dude sue me it also says urine isn't the nastiest

894
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,440
fuel source these robots have used previous versions ran on energy

895
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,440
extracted from sludge, waste water, dead flies, and rotting produce.

896
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,440
Sludge?

897
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,880
Yeah, do you guys think sludge is grosser than urine?

898
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,040
Also, sludge is like... isn't that like a... like sludge can be like anything, right?

899
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,200
Yeah, it's a slime.

900
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,200
It's just...

901
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,720
Sludge could be pee.

902
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,160
There's not like a natural... there's not like a byproduct of a thing called sludge, right?

903
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:05,960
Yeah, sludge is like... it's like an ice cream treat.

904
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,960
Exactly.

905
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,960
Ice cream sludgy?

906
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:09,960
Yeah.

907
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,460
- Worm towers.

908
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,840
- Worm towers. - Pat, you have to read this.

909
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,880
- Okay.

910
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,400
Giant soil mounds in the grasslands of Columbia

911
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,600
and Venezuela alternate with deep pits in the ground,

912
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,200
and the mounds were formerly thought to be the result

913
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,840
of erosion or termite activity,

914
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:30,100
but scientists recently discovered that they were made

915
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,060
of piles and piles of worm poop,

916
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,080
collecting in locations that the worms

917
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,080
would visit for generations.

918
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,720
Worms measuring up to three feet in length--

919
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,560
- What the fuck?

920
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,240
eat and digest dirt, excreting pellets known as casts.

921
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,180
Over time, the mounds can grow wider than 16 feet

922
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,460
in diameter, and groups of them form

923
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,680
in impressive landscape features

924
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,940
called surale, which is also found in Uganda,

925
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,120
New Guinea, and South Africa.

926
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,520
- If a worm-- - So when you said

927
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,740
three foot worm, I googled longest worm.

928
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,360
Do you wanna guess how long the longest worm is?

929
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,780
- Five inches. - 10 feet.

930
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,200
180 feet.

931
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,200
Whoa.

932
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,200
Wait, where?

933
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
A lineus longissimus.

934
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,600
How are you going to hide a worm that big from me?

935
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,600
I think it's probably not.

936
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,600
How have I not seen it?

937
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
The boot lace worm.

938
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:21,600
I think it's in the water.

939
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,600
I think it's a water worm.

940
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:23,600
Longest worm.

941
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,600
Buddy.

942
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,800
It also has a, it has a neurotoxin too.

943
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,800
Whoa.

944
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,800
Dog, that is a snake.

945
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,800
Yeah.

946
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
At that point it's a fucking snake.

947
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,360
It's called a boot, it's called a boot lace worm.

948
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:35,180
And its mucus is highly toxic.

949
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,180
This thing looks like shit.

950
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,180
Yeah, I hate looking at that.

951
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:41,980
not a that is not a handsome worm I found a list of the most nightmarish worms do

952
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,500
you think other worms look at this where I look at the worm like it's like like

953
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,780
Robert Wadlow or whoever that tall guy was like they're like oh he looks so

954
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:57,100
crazy right I think he's in the Wormley's believe it or not museum and a

955
00:49:57,100 --> 00:50:02,020
big statue Wormley's believe it or worm

956
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:08,580
Wormley's I am a worm you will not believe what this caterpillar turned into

957
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:15,060
just I don't like it yeah no I again like that is not a worm making a worm

958
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,780
that long is one thing but then making it poisonous is too far yeah God you

959
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:24,860
fucked this one up so bad mm-hmm yeah yeah everybody's good you must have

960
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:28,380
must have let Jesus handle that one I bet that's what it was yeah this is you

961
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:31,060
He was like, yeah, you can handle the worms.

962
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,060
And he was like, okay, dad.

963
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,900
(laughing)

964
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,780
- And now I'll make a long one.

965
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,900
- Now I'm gonna make the biggest worm ever,

966
00:50:38,900 --> 00:50:41,300
you fucking asshole, dad.

967
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,820
Fuck you, pussy.

968
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,020
- Yeah.

969
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:45,840
- Yeah.

970
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:46,680
- Poop biotics.

971
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,660
- It would be okay if maybe there was like one of them.

972
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:48,820
Okay, I'm done, sorry.

973
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,300
Shh.

974
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:54,420
Say the poop biotics thing.

975
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,620
- Read it.

976
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,780
- I need a clean take.

977
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,620
- Okay, all right, all right.

978
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:03,580
I'm giving it to you right poop biotics god damn it Caleb Caleb can't remember

979
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:09,100
which one of us is which mm-hmm I'm bald poop by odd read this this is your

980
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,820
favorite thing no it's not my favorite thing and it's also redundant we've

981
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:17,980
already got this read it could a path toward a better hell could a path toward

982
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:30,340
fucking god damn it could a path toward better health begin with a baby's diaper

983
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:45,100
yeah you wish baby poop specifically the microbes inhabiting baby's guts no I

984
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:51,740
I don't could one day produce a biotic pedophiles inhabiting babies guts such

985
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:58,660
as Patrick Doran shut up why did I agree to read this one I should have fucking

986
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:02,500
you didn't you didn't agree you just yeah I wanted to I saw you I saw you

987
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:08,200
drooling the second you saw I was not drooling baby poop it's not funny to say

988
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:14,540
that about me what do you like baby poop yes you do you do like baby poop no yes

989
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:15,380
- Yes!

990
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,200
- No!

991
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,460
(laughing)

992
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,220
- He turned his mic off.

993
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,380
- Oh, he turned his microphone off.

994
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,060
- He just said, what is that?

995
00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:25,560
Oh, don't say, don't.

996
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,640
- No, I didn't say anything when the mic was turned off.

997
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,780
I was just trying to make Cameron mad.

998
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:30,600
- You said something crazy.

999
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,660
- Why would I be mad that you're not talking?

1000
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,220
- Yeah, that was like, I was so sublime for a moment.

1001
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,380
It's back to the old days.

1002
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:39,220
- You wanna get sublime?

1003
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,700
- No, that's too close to Reagan.

1004
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,820
- You wanna get Bradley Noel in here?

1005
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,300
you want me to go Bradley Noel? You will not go Bradley Noel on me. I'm gonna go

1006
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:54,140
Bradley Noel on myself. Don't do, do not start fucking, what did he do? I don't, did

1007
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:57,780
he kill himself? I don't know who that is. I think he overdosed. Yeah well he killed himself with

1008
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:02,660
something, it wasn't on purpose. Yeah. What's so special about baby poo

1009
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:07,980
microbes? Some types of microorganisms in baby poop promote the production of

1010
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:15,360
molecules called short fatty short chain fatty acid short fatty chain fatty chain

1011
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:20,420
acids fatty chains which are associated with the healthy gut. Dude, fatty chains would be a good nickname.

1012
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:28,240
Short chain, I'm a short chain fatty asshole. Short chain fatty spins. Okay, all right.

1013
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:35,100
That's kind of cool. Yeah. How about you keep reading bud. Which are associated

1014
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,980
with a healthy gut. Fecal transplants with these microbes could help to correct imbalances

1015
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:40,980
in the gulp.

1016
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:41,980
Fuck.

1017
00:53:41,980 --> 00:53:42,980
In the gulp.

1018
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:45,100
Gulp? Where the fuck did the L come from?

1019
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,100
You took it.

1020
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,100
Oh, I took it.

1021
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,780
Yeah, you knew there was an L coming.

1022
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:54,740
Promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and protecting against disease.

1023
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:57,700
Why'd you bother reading that whole one? We already talked about it.

1024
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,700

1025
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,500

You are doing badly, don't do it.

1027
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,860
We asked you not to read that one.

1028
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:03,860
You're high right now.

00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,100

1034
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:34,720

00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:55,120
really we're all addicts yep I drink sugar-free Red Thunder guess what two of

1039
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,560
them in 30 minutes. That's what kind of shit I'm on. Let's fucking go dude. There's a last

1040
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,960
entry here. Don't drink your energy drink and try and brag.

1041
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:10,420
Ocean fertilizer. Whales are among the largest living creatures on earth. As such, they generate

1042
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:15,280
enormous quantities of pee and poop. And that's a good thing, as their waste provides critical

1043
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,720
nutrients for a variety of marine creatures. Whales typically relieve themselves at the

1044
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:24,260
sea surface before they dive, leaving behind a fluffy effluvia plume. This

1045
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:28,780
fecal feast releases nutrients that originated in ocean depths and nourish

1046
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:32,740
phytoplankton, tiny marine plants which live close to the surface and play an

1047
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:36,820
important part in ocean food webs. Imagine God fucks you so bad where he's like,

1048
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,460
"All right, you're gonna be so small that people can't even see you. You are gonna

1049
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:44,700
live in the ocean. You don't get to go do anything in the cool stuff on land." And

1050
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:50,820
get this you can only eat a cloud of poop from a giant whale yeah phytoplankton

1051
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,780
yeah I'd like to fight out plankton stop trying to get that damn secret recipe

1052
00:55:54,780 --> 00:56:00,000
plankton where I might fight oh you dude was plankton eating poop that whole time

1053
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,980
he was eating pearls poop what if yeah what if that's in the fucking with that's

1054
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:10,280
a secret that's a fan theory right there yeah cuz pearl and mr. Krabs live

1055
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,900
together so mr. Krabs was collecting and that's why I've planked in like the

1056
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:19,460
recipe so much it all comes together mm-hmm and Sandy was a squirrel who

1057
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:28,580
lived underwater and spongebob is a happy yellow friend breaking the theme song

1058
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:35,900
was great breaking news what just Lane Maxwell has been charged with sex

1059
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:42,620
trafficking a 14 year old girl oh just now you heard it here first on this

1060
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:57,100

wow that's crazy you know could could that not have waited maybe five minutes

1067
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:36,220
I thought the episode was ending I didn't realize we were- I thought it said 57.

1068
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:40,820
Okay so back to fucking whale shit. Yeah I can't remember you know exactly what the

1069
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:45,260
joke we were doing was unfortunately. Ocean fertilizer I'm gonna turn Pat into ocean

1070
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:49,180
fertilizer mafia style after that. Let's try to get back into the joke now. Whales they're

1071
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:53,980
peeing poop I can't do it. Oh yeah Spongebob sex traffic- no that's not the-

1072
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:57,780
see I'm getting my wires crossed right now and it's because of you. I thought

1073
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,160
that it would be special if we broke the news we people have known this for days

1074
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:09,220
now yeah it's not I forgot the news I I forgot that there's a schedule a

1075
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:15,540
schedule you thought that this was live-streamed for a little bit that look

1076
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:21,820
everything bleeds together now I don't know what which way is up that's a

1077
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,540
different thing that's directional that doesn't have to do with time all right

1078
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,380
You know what?

1079
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,720
