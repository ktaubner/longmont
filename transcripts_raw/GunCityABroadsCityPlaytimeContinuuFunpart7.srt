[MUSIC]

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Last time on Gun City, A Broad City, Playtime, Continue Fun.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Patrick Yoda went totally rockstar in Janet Blowjob's room.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
He'd been invited as a guest of hers to Lera Fax,

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the underground or under-space station headquarters of Huge-Ass Fax,

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
the gangster who knows everything.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Because of intel he had on Captain Gumby Superior's intentions for the undercity.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,200
Yep, Caleb turned it the wrong way.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
Patrick heard.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
No, that's worse.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,520
I sound like I'm inside of a small bowl.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,320
Patrick heard something very strange come from the other room while playing Xbox's Shrades

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,320
with Baby Gadd.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,320
The sound of metal scraping against metal.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,560
I forgot about the Shrades.

16
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,640
I didn't.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,440
So he burst into Janet's room and began to investigate.

18
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,840
He also met a cool little robot, nanobot, named Scooter, who is now on the team, who tried

19
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:16,800
to help him out as much as his programming would allow.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,800
Meanwhile, Ray and Blotas left the room.

21
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Uh oh.

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
He's getting a new cover for the mic.

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,800
Meanwhile, Ray and Blotas defeated a ho-ass tentacle monster.

24
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:39,800
Deep in the guts of the space station, with a greech.

25
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,800
A person corrupted by the poor air and water quality in the depths of the pleasure palace,

26
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:52,800
palace attached by the crotch, the base of the crotch of this creature. So you guys fell

27
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
down the...

28
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,800
Creature's crotch.

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,200
Creature's crotch. Afterwards, a Seamus, the leprechaun they rescued from the royal guard

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,960
in the first session, met them in the guts and led them to the Boglands, the home of

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,200
the leprechauns. The home the leprechauns made for themselves outside the slave courts.

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,120
Lotas and Ray also huffed some gas to get +1 on rolls.

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,840
The Leprechauns struggle with fending off the Greeches, and more threats.

34
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,600
Plus now Sullivan has arrived after working out in the gym so he could lift the snake.

35
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,160
Now Ashamus brings them to meet Bear McGinnis, leader of the Leprechaun people on the Pleasure

36
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,720
Palace.

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,120
Tearing apart the room, Patrick Yoda managed to find very little.

38
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,080
Though he discovered an odd panel behind Blowjob's bed, and after rolling a 1 while trying to

39
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
trying to pry it open, his hoverboard was firmly lodged in the wall.

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,080
A furious baby gad tried to yank the board out of the wall, but it remains to be seen

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
if he was able to, because Patrick Yoda soon fell asleep, and a strange dream

42
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,080
that gave him a sense of where New Sullivan is. Still, what is with the toys

43
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:00,080
they discovered from the victims of playtime? And who sent

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,080
Lotas and Rey down the chute to the guts?

45
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
And does Gumby Superior really know where New Sullivan is? Well, we know who sent us down the chute.

46
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,320
- Ready, that guy, ready.

47
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,800
- We already know that one.

48
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,840
So can you come up with a different second one?

49
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,680
- Sure.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,160
And who really is Bear McGinnis,

51
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,680
the leader of the leprechauns?

52
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,200
- The leader of the leprechauns, I just answered it.

53
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,920
- But who is he really?

54
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,720
- So, okay, so you just gave us a hint

55
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,200
that he's a different guy.

56
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,040
- Nah, he's not really.

57
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,520
- Play time.

58
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,160
- Well, just continue, you suck.

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,360
- And what of huge ass facts?

60
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,200
That's my last one.

61
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,960
What of it? What of?

62
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,960
What of him?

63
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,960
What of him?

64
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,960
Look, okay, what he is-

65
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Yeah, wait, what of him?

66
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,480
Wait a second, I didn't consider that before.

67
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,600
That's an interesting thought.

68
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:51,760
Here's what we're gonna do, fuckers.

69
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,000
I wanna make sure we, like, 'cause it's been a little bit, 'cause I got sickies.

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,320
Yeah, you gotta remind me what the vision was that I saw.

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,720
Yeah, I'm gonna do a little bit of a-

72
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,720
You just did a whole recap.

73
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,720
You were drawing a circle.

74
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,720
You were drawing a circle.

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,720
I drew a face.

76
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,640
- You're drawing a face. - Drew Patches again.

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,880
- You need to stop with this. - He's trying to draw me again.

78
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,320
- He's trying ugly me again.

79
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,880
- Well no, no, no, he didn't say what I saw in the vision.

80
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,240
- Yeah, I'll do that. - Of in my dream.

81
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,160
- We're gonna do not just that, we're also--

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
- So it's not that I wasn't paying attention.

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,240
- It was that, but you just were.

84
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,520
- No, it's not I was paying attention.

85
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
- No, no, no, he's right, I didn't say

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,120
what was in the vision, we'll do that.

87
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,200
But also-- - I'm right.

88
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,400
- But also, I wanna do a little bit of--

89
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,640
- I don't think you can be right while you're--

90
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,600
- Yeah, no, that's what I was saying,

91
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,580
is it just cuz he doesn't didn't say what you're looking for doesn't mean you

92
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,840
were paying attention I was paying attention you guys are in the bog you

93
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:56,760
guys know what mr. snitch did or whatever and I was trying and I'm trying to do he

94
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,840
- He hated my last portrait on the back of this,

95
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,440
so I'm trying to make it more realistic.

96
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,800
- Pretend you're in a play right now.

97
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,040
- Pretend I'm in school?

98
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,880
- Yeah. - Okay, here's what I used

99
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,720
to do when I used to practice drawing.

100
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,540
- No, not in school.

101
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,600
- You were pretending you were in school.

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,000
You need to pretend that you're playing a game.

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,560
- Pretend you're skateboarding right now.

104
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,520
- Yeah.

105
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,240
- Why is he pretending to play a game?

106
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
- 'Cause I don't know what I'm doing.

107
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,880
- I'm making art for my friend

108
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,560
and I want him to think it's beautiful.

109
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,560
- So here's the thing, what we're gonna do,

110
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,280
we're definitely gonna recap your dream,

111
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,320
But also, I'm gonna do a little bit of just like

112
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,360
general character, like faction recap,

113
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,700
'cause it's been a little bit.

114
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,980
I feel like I was like, as I was writing this session out,

115
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,000
I was like, there's a lot of characters,

116
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,440
I always introduce so many characters.

117
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,520
- State of the Union.

118
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,800
- Yeah, pretty much.

119
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,240
So, let's start with like--

120
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,880
- State of the Dungeon.

121
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,920
- State of the Dungeon.

122
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,480
- State of the Dungeon, go ahead.

123
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,260
- You're on the Pleasure Palace, right,

124
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,520
which is Leo the Collector's space station.

125
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,480
- Okay, you don't have to go this--

126
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,520
- Yeah, that's way too far. - We know that we're--

127
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,360
- No, no, no, don't worry, don't worry.

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,120
I'm not recapping the whole story, don't worry.

129
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,960
I'm just, I'm going faction by faction, right?

130
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,320
So it's Leo the Collector's space station.

131
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,920
He's the king of the New England Empire,

132
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:12,400
the only kind of nation that's really rivaling Gunn City

133
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,080
besides Transylvania, which already had a war

134
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,640
with Gunn City a while ago.

135
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,760
- We all know the facts.

136
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,040
- So under him, as far as like,

137
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,700

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,700
(laughing)

158
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,540
- Sounds like this bitch can't take a hint.

159
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,740
- That doesn't sound like something that would happen.

160
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,780

171
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,680
- And so, yes.

172
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,660
- No, that's my character says that.

173
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,860
I would never say that.

174
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,700
- Tard.

175
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,540
(laughing)

176
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,700
- It's funny that Lizard and Libtard rhyme

177
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
'cause they're both reptiles.

178
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,540
- Shit.

179
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,700
- You are basically like a fucking Nostradamus.

180
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,860
- You are based at Igli and Frog Hogs.

181
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,060
- Yeah.

182
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,500
- Gumby Superior is the like,

183
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,020
captain of the space station.

184
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,660
He was a general in the Gun City Army who's retired.

185
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,540
Under him is Michael Quinn,

186
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,700
is like a lieutenant, is like first mate,

187
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,860
who led you guys,

188
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,260
you to to the guts to meet with the scientist who was ebony's ricky

189
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,700
and his assistant

190
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,180
and who was ebony's ricky

191
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,780
yeah and uh...

192
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:01,460

193
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,620

194
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,620
name is Ebenezer Keish. Put the paper away fuck stick. What are you drawing?

195
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:15,620
Oh no! Come on.

196
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:19,620
It's even better. I tried my best to drop

197
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:23,620
patches. You know what would have been actually funny Patrick? It looked like Barret Harkonnen.

198
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,620
If you, after this first one sucked so bad, you can't just do another ugly one. This needed

199
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,620
to be a photorealistic, beautiful portrait. This was

200
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,620
photorealistic. Alright put the paper away. I don't want to ever see you do this again.

201
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,020
- A cousin of Carl from Aqua Teen.

202
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,500
Is that what I look like to you?

203
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
- No!

204
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,100
- No, not to him, that's objective.

205
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,120
- Yeah, right, yeah, that is me.

206
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,460
So then, there's Reddy, also the assistant,

207
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,420
who pushed you to-- - Who, yeah.

208
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,740
- The bad, bad motherfucker.

209
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,700
- The bad motherfucker. - Oh, okay, see,

210
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,540
I thought that maybe it was-- - Who we think is in league

211
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,660
with, yeah. - I thought it was Ebenezer Kish,

212
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,140
maybe. - Maybe, that's what you guys--

213
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,300
- 'Cause we didn't see any, we were just looking

214
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,460
of the whole right? A guy like me he's Ebenezer Creep. So what was it? You guys assumed it was

215
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:13,700
ready. Ready. All right well now I'm ready to get to the bottom. So that's

216
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:24,340
and that's sort of the like crew slash scientist kind of group that's like working the ship but

217
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:28,660
isn't explicitly aligned with the Royal Guard but is insofar as that they do run the ship.

218
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,160
Okay.

219
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:36,980
Perform stuff on it. Now, let's look at the sort of the under city groups, right?

220
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:43,140
So we have Huge-Ass Facts, who you guys have not met yet, who you're supposed to

221
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,780
meet soon, who is like the head of the under city group.

222
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:52,880
Yeah, he was going to meet, no, Janet Blowjob.

223
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,760
Yeah, you were gonna meet with him through Janet Blowjob.

224
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,680
Janet Blowjob being his right-hand person.

225
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,520
- Yeah.

226
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,480
- And then--

227
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,320
- Man?

228
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,560
- Well, woman, I guess.

229
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,120
But I was trying to be super inclusive.

230
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,080
- So you went with person.

231
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,680
- I sure did.

232
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,720
Look, I work in corporate America.

233
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,840
He just slips sometimes.

234
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,680
- Dox him.

235
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,640
- Don't dox me.

236
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,800
Please don't dox me.

237
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,640
- Matching Mike vibes.

238
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,480
- Ruined my life.

239
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,300
- Just realized.

240
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,040
- Then there's

241
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,720
Oh, that character you didn't meet.

242
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,360
Oh no, go ahead.

243
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,600
No, since we're listing every, just list every single name in the world.

244
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,360
This will be the, this will be the characters episode.

245
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,120
Where we list every single character that's going to show up or has gone up.

246
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,200
His name's just Resort Manager Eagle Ramirez.

247
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,240
I just thought of a character named Paint Can Peter.

248
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,720
Okay, describe him.

249
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,440
Yeah, because this is about as important as what the fuck he's talking about.

250
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,160
And a paintbrush and Oh paintbrush Paul

251
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:06,820
Paint can Peter and paintbrush Paul, so they're a team so so let's let's so the painting partners. So let's just restart

252
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:13,880
Janet blowjob who works under him Kenan Thompson

253
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,040
Who's Janet blowjobs like assistant?

254
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,400
- Speaking of blowjobs, that guy's leaning over on my penis.

255
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,000
- He sure does seem like he is.

256
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,200
He's really trying to push this in here.

257
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,400
Okay, cool, this seems good.

258
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,100
I see why you were doing this now.

259
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,500
And then there's Scooter,

260
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,600
who's one of Janet Blowjob's nanobots.

261
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,680
- Isn't there two nanobots?

262
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,520
- Oh, there's like--

263
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,240
- There was two in the room, right?

264
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,440
- There's like 15 nanobots in her room,

265
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,440
but that was the one that you--

266
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,360
- I thought that I talked to another one.

267
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,800
- No, you were trying to get behind the bed

268
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,840
and then you sucked at it.

269
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,000
- Yeah.

270
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,560
- I mean, it was a hard check.

271
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,800
I didn't expect him to roll a one,

272
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,840
trying to lodge it out though.

273
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,080
- Yeah, pretty good.

274
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,520
- Then, oh, one more thing also underneath Belinda

275
00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:00,520
is Shark Eyes, her sort of like bodyguard guy

276
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,960
who you guys don't know much about.

277
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
- Oh, and then the two--

278
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:05,360
- I know, there's Keep Calm and Chive On,

279
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,120
who are also in the Huge Ass Facts group.

280
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:07,960
- And then there--

281
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,440
- And then there's Baby Gat as well,

282
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,680
who's sort of like in that, and then there's,

283
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,920
fuck, what's his name, O'Neal.

284
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,080
O'Neal, who was like the shopkeeper who almost got killed.

285
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,560
- Who got almost killed, and we--

286
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,600
- Who you guys saved.

287
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
- Yep.

288
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,260
- So--

289
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,200
- Saved his hunky ass.

290
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:27,520
- Now, lastly, let's just talk about,

291
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,240
our last group is just the leprechauns,

292
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,360
that you, at least of the groups you know.

293
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Which, there's a Seamus, who is sort of the

294
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,760
friendly leprechaun who you guys saved

295
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,400
in the zippy loop train earlier.

296
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,320
And then there's Bear McGinnis,

297
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,720
who you do, who you're gonna meet,

298
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,400
excuse me, meet soon.

299
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,480
- Burp City up in here.

300
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,120
- And then there's Bear McInnes' girlfriend,

301
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,280
Millie Shamrock, who you'll meet as well,

302
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,120
who also works with him.

303
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,160
- Oh, like Millie Rock?

304
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,560
- Mm-hmm, that's right.

305
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,100
Yeah, got the reference I just made.

306
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,320
And then, yeah, I mean, that's,

307
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,240
and then of course there's Playtime, right,

308
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,080
who, we don't know who that is.

309
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,160
- Who's a rapist.

310
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,640
- (laughs) Not a rapist.

311
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,240
- Not yet. - I can tell you right now.

312
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
- I mean, there's also, I will also say--

313
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,240
- He hurts people, like it's not that crazy to also say--

314
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,120
- Yeah, I guess he could be a rapist.

315
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,920
There's three other characters, sorry.

316
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:22,760
- I think he chews his gum with his mouth open.

317
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,600
- John Carlo the Bull--

318
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,640
- And he cheats on his girlfriend.

319
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,480
- What?

320
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,320
- John Carlo the Bullfrog.

321
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,040
- Can we not have a character that does that?

322
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:29,860
- We'll get rid of that.

323
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,700
- Thank you.

324
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,520
- John Carlo the Bullfrog,

325
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,140
who is the head of Papi Chuka's Techno Slime,

326
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,280
who is also here.

327
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,100
Sullivan the Frog, who is nothing.

328
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,940
And then, anytime.

329
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,920
And then--

330
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,940
What else about Sullivan?

331
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:47,220
He's like, also, he's a pedophile.

332
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,300
No, I won't--

333
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,340
What's up with you today?

334
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,060
--blue tonight.

335
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,560
Yeah.

336
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,300
What's up with you?

337
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,260
Blue on white.

338
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,700
Blue screen, blue Patrick.

339
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,940
Saying, this guy's a rapist.

340
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,260
This guy's a pedophile.

341
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,300
You would think this is--

342
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,620
And Caleb's saying that looking in the mirror.

343
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,540
No, I literally just said that.

344
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,100
And then you--

345
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,540
I couldn't hear you.

346
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,180
I got distracted.

347
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,900
Stealing flopper.

348
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,380
He couldn't.

349
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,540
He is a stealing flopper.

350
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,300
Stealing flopper.

351
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:08,800
Continue.

352
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,220
That's what I was saying.

353
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,920
- Yeah, sorry, I don't remember the third character.

354
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,700
(laughing)

355
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,540
- Okay.

356
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,780
- I don't know who the third character was in the end.

357
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,100
- We're gonna start playing.

358
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,940
- Yeah, sorry.

359
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,700
- I'm getting, I need him to,

360
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,740
I need, we need a different route from him.

361
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:23,580
- I understand, I understand.

362
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,500
- Maybe cutting back and forth.

363
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,460
- So, here's where we're gonna start from.

364
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,340
We're starting from, you guys are back in the Boglands.

365
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:34,500
So, you, last we left off, you guys ran into Sullivan,

366
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,380
who said he went to the gym, so now he's really strong.

367
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,700
Patrick is not in the Boglands.

368
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,540
- Thank God.

369
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,260
and said he's really strong now

370
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,420
'cause you told him to go to the gym

371
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,460
so we could lift the snake.

372
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,700
He asked you where the snake was.

373
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,420
You guys accosted him.

374
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,580
And now a Seamus was gonna lead you to

375
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,620
where Bear McInnes is.

376
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,060
He was gonna have him meet you guys

377
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,260
to see if he could help you find your son.

378
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
That was the third, last person actually I realized,

379
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,100
knew Sullivan.

380
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,220
- Yeah, who says what?

381
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,220
Oh yeah.

382
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,280
- I just feel bad 'cause he's not here.

383
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,580
- Wait, can you, what would he,

384
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,180
so he's off in some other room.

385
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,340
How would he say oh yeah if he was being tortured

386
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,860
by a demon spirit?

387
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,820
- I'm not gonna do that.

388
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,660
I love him. - Don't we get--

389
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:24,380
- Oh yeah!

390
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,580
- That didn't sound anything like him.

391
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,300
- No, there was some quality that was missing.

392
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,300
- Yeah. - Yeah.

393
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,100
- If somebody could like repeat that maybe,

394
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,460
then maybe make it sound good.

395
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,180
- Somebody older and wiser.

396
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,940
(laughing)

397
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,020
- If only there was someone in the room.

398
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,580
So I'm not gonna do him being tortured.

399
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,420
I like him.

400
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,180
- Yeah, you should never do somebody

401
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,580
while they're being tortured.

402
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,420
Unless they ask you to.

403
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,340
- Being dude is torture enough.

404
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,460
- I hate being dude.

405
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,780
- If somebody does me--

406
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,020
- He dude-ed dude.

407
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,100
- Yeah, I bet he did.

408
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,940
- If you understand the word, but--

409
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,780
- If somebody does me,

410
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,580
I don't also need torture on top of that.

411
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:58,700
I'll already give up my secrets.

412
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,180
- What you guys had seen when you guys entered the Bog Land

413
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:06,580
was like a massive, let's pound that out.

414
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,420
Let's pound that out, it is about Luger.

415
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,740
- What is up with him?

416
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,100
- This guy's obsessed with rape.

417
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,700
- Yeah, I don't know what is going on.

418
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,540
- I can't stop talking about rape right now.

419
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,380
- Literally you're obsessed.

420
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,200
- What the fuck is happening?

421
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,260
- He may have stopped drawing and his mind started to wander.

422
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,100
- Yeah, God.

423
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,580
- You have to, you're obsessed with rape.

424
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,780
- You literally are obsessed with it.

425
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,620
- No.

426
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,460
- So this was--

427
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,280
- People don't like that.

428
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,700
- Yeah, nobody wants to hear that.

429
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,540
- Nobody wants to hear about that.

430
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,660
- I thought he was talking about S&M.

431
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,500
It's about power dynamics.

432
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,860
- So this was sort of like,

433
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,940
this is like representing like the Boglands,

434
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,700
like the swamp in the middle,

435
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,100
the little village, little town.

436
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Back here, over here, is like a big submarine

437
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,620
that was, or like submarine-like structures,

438
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,200
kind of just like some sort of cobbled together

439
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,700
metal structure with these like circular windows in it,

440
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,380
and that's where Bear McGuiness and his Leprechaun group are.

441
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,720
So, Ashamus leads you to--

442
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,980
- I'm so sorry, I hate interrupting.

443
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,820
- No.

444
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,940
- I just want you to know, when you said submarine,

445
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,340
I had such a like, I like had a gulping physical reaction

446
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,820
'cause I got so scared that it was gonna be fucking Taffy

447
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,380
or whatever his character was.

448
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,220
(laughing)

449
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,580
- Chuggy. - Yeah.

450
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,420
So I'm sorry.

451
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,060
- No, it's fine. - I have to snap out of it.

452
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,340
- It's not Chuggy.

453
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,860
Chuggy's gone. - It's Taffy!

454
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,180
(laughing)

455
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,020
- No.

456
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:32,620
So let's have you guys over here now.

457
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
- Chucky's brother.

458
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:38,200
- He's not even in this universe.

459
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
- Well, that was in the past.

460
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
- That wasn't the past.

461
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,520
- So we're gonna pretend I never said anything.

462
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,360
- Yes.

463
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,200
- We're just gonna move on.

464
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,760
- I'm just gonna piss him off.

465
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,360
- Frodo!

466
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,440
- Yo!

467
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,400
- This guy's made of straight up cum.

468
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,720
- You say that every time I bring these guys out.

469
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,240
- This guy's made of boogers.

470
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,840
(laughing)

471
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,960
- Ew, yuck.

472
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,680
- Yuck, I have a gross army.

473
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,040
- It's the Jism twins and their booger brothers.

474
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,880
- This guy's made of--

475
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,560
(laughing)

476
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,360
Can these be the Jism brothers and this is the booger?

477
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,200
- No, these are all leprechauns.

478
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
- The Jism twins and the booger brothers.

479
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,520
- These are all leprechauns.

480
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,800
Can you stand that one up?

481
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,640
God damn it.

482
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,880
- Leprechauns. - Just talk your talk.

483
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,720
- I will talk my talk, I apologize.

484
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,920
Right, nobody's watching this.

485
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,080
Everyone's listening to it, I know, I know.

486
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,560
So yeah, you guys arrive at,

487
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,040
and you see Bear McGinnis there.

488
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,280
And yeah, he's a impressive looking leprechaun

489
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,960
as far as that can go, roughly a half inch taller

490
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,800
than all the other leprechauns.

491
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,520
- I thought he was a half inch tall.

492
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,600
- No, he's a half inch taller than all the leprechauns.

493
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,800
- So all the leprechauns are five feet?

494
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,920
- No, all the leprechauns are like three, five.

495
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,760
- Okay.

496
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,680
- And arriving on the other side,

497
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,960
so you see the makings of an army,

498
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,840
it's far more prepared than anything

499
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,000
Gummy Superior had intimated when he was talking about,

500
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,200
like, oh, the leprechauns, like, you know,

501
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,560
they're also trouble, but you know, yada, yada, yada.

502
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,960
This looks like a real militia,

503
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,720
like a real trained militia. - The IRA.

504
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,460
- Something like that.

505
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,560
They're all armed with makeshift shillelaghs

506
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,620
that induce stun and some kind of chemical reaction

507
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,060
along with slingshots that hold glowing yellow pellets

508
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,800
that explode on impact.

509
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,280
So they're like genuinely outfitted.

510
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,280
Hunched over a modest desk looking at analog battle plans

511
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,200
is a leprechaun who is, without a doubt,

512
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,960
exactly one half inch taller than any leprechauns you've seen.

513
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,700
As he approaches desk, he lifts up his furrowed

514
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,340
auburn brow and takes you in.

515
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,620
Without missing a beat, his hand glides over his plans

516
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,340
and they vanish from the table.

517
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,840
So he does kind of like a little bit of trickery.

518
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,860
In tune with their apparent leader,

519
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,840
the leprechauns stop running combat drills

520
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,140
and turn their attention towards all of you.

521
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,500
As the Seamus makes apologetic gestures in their direction,

522
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,100
Bear McGinnis' wild hair more matted nest

523
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,820
than anything gently sort of bounces as he talks.

524
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,440
He's dressed head to toe in dark green armor,

525
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,460
fitted to his stocky frame.

526
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,020
In lieu of bare feet,

527
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,820
most of the leprechauns have just bare feet,

528
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,240
he wears black boots made of solid lead.

529
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,060
As he adjusts himself,

530
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,920
you hear the considerable thud each movement makes.

531
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,580
And he says, "Shamus, who are these three?"

532
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,980
'Cause Sullivan is here too.

533
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,140
- He's not like Liam Neeson.

534
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,340
- He might look a little bit like Liam Neeson.

535
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,980
These were the guys I was telling you about.

536
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:28,380
They're real nice.

537
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,220
I threatened one of the Royal Guards on my behalf

538
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,500
when I was riding the Zippy Loop,

539
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,120
which I know I shouldn't be doing,

540
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,960
drawing attention and all,

541
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,740
but they de-escalated everything real fast,

542
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,540
and they just killed one of the Greech monsters,

543
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,740
and I wanted to make sure that they could rest up,

544
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,900
plus they're real handy in a fight,

545
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,340
and maybe they could,

546
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,860
- Bear McGinnis is like, "Enough, enough, this is, stop."

547
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,140
And he sort of looks to you two,

548
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,740
and like, kinda like gestures, like,

549
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,700
like, "Who are you?

550
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,300
Like, introduce yourselves."

551
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:03,700
Yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo yo

552
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:09,420
yo yo yo my name is Ray and I'm here to say that the fucking I hate these guys

553
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,820
are made of boogers and these two are gay they're made of cum and jizz and a

554
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:17,900
penis too and a motherfucking Frodo motherfuck you too man fuck this place

555
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,260
you got tanks and and guns and your bombs and your bombs and your bombs in

556
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,260
in your head, in your head, they are fighting

557
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,100
I fucking hate war

558
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:35,100
and my name is Blotas Piss and I also want to say this

559
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,060
and I gestured to whatever he was saying

560
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,420
in your head, in your head, they are fighting

561
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,260
it's in your head

562
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:45,660
let me handle this Blotas, don't worry about it

563
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:50,780
it's in your head, zombie

564
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,620
What?

565
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:52,460
Nat 20 performance.

566
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,280
Oh my God.

567
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,940
And by the way, wait, show me the Patches cam real quick.

568
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,540
Nat 20 performance, right?

569
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,540
And I think as the people were hearing me sing,

570
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,980
I got that in real life too.

571
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,820
Yeah.

572
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:05,620
God, whoever, whatever fucking Aztec God

573
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:08,420
controls my real body, just rolled a perfect 20

574
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,060
when I was singing "Zombie" right then.

575
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,660
'Cause I have in-ear monitors now.

576
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,620
Bear McInnes crosses his arms and nods.

577
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,980
Normally I hate that hip hop crap.

578
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,220
(laughing)

579
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:27,500
- But yo, yo, yo.

580
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,340
- That was exquisite.

581
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:31,180
- You gotta admit that shit was fresh, huh?

582
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,500
- Was like a limerick of old.

583
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,700
- They should do a--

584
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,260
- That's what this guy, he's Lime Rick.

585
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,100
That's what they should call him.

586
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,140
- A remix of Hip Hop Rick and the Gizmo Twins.

587
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,420
- Lime Rick and the Gizmo Twins.

588
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,700
Y'all could be a new hip hop trio.

589
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,700
- You see them considering it thoughtfully.

590
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,460
They're like, oh maybe we could be.

591
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,260
I do look like I'm made of jizz.

592
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:54,260
Like, um, all right, a Seamus.

593
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,660
Normally I'd be pretty disappointed in you

594
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,860
bringing two strangers to our secret stronghold,

595
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,860
but these ones can rap.

596
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:08,780
Okay, thank you for saving our friend Seamus here.

597
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:12,220
We appreciate that and taking care of that Greech monster.

598
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,380
There's not much we can offer in terms of help.

599
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:18,740
just being as we're a militia

600
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,740
and trying to fight our own battles,

601
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:24,860
but perhaps we could provide some assistance

602
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,360
if you do one more thing for us.

603
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,200
- We already did one more thing.

604
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,760
We had this conversation yesterday.

605
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,380
And then we got, we saved Seamus.

606
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,220
- What?

607
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,220
- I'm gonna go and roll.

608
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,620
- What do you mean, what do you mean yesterday?

609
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,740
- That's an 11.

610
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,980
- What's your deception, two?

611
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,180
- Three, so it's 14.

612
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,540
- Okay, it's pretty good.

613
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,540
Let's do his insight. He's pretty, unfortunately, pretty crafty.

614
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,540
There's no way I can beat that.

615
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,540
If he gets a one.

616
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:53,540
Yeah, he got, yeah, he got 18.

617
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,540
I'm sorry, I thought, um...

618
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,540
I was still rapping.

619
00:24:57,540 --> 00:24:59,540
We got taken to a different secret stockhold yesterday.

620
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,540
Art of storytelling.

621
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,540
I understand, I understand.

622
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
I was just rapping.

623
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
And I'm terminally ill.

624
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,540
I'm mumble rapping.

625
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,540
Alright, well, I know that's a lie. You don't even have to roll.

626
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
What the fuck do you want us to do?

627
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:16,180
Because if you don't say something right now, I'm gonna keep freestyling about all this bullshit you got over here.

628
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,180
I need you to kill the Greech Queen.

629
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,180
Yeah, we got dice, these are nice.

630
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,060
Wait, what? The Greech King? Queen?

631
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,260
Queen.

632
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,260
Oh, okay, that guy. I won't kill a king.

633
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:31,780
The Greech Queen? Oh, do you think they could do it?

634
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:38,340
If everything you said and their rhyming skills are true, that they don't take no crap from no one, I think they could do it.

635
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,700
Does the Greech Queen die from hip-hop freestyling?

636
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:45,140
Can we do like a "Parepa the Rapa" style battle?

637
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,140
Who?

638
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,740
It's the voice again!

639
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,740
He's getting scared.

640
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,740
Um, no.

641
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,740
Yeah, we'll do that shit.

642
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,340
The Queen of the Greeches sounds like a mean creature.

643
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,340
Yep.

644
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
Now you keep going.

645
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,340
Now you do the rest.

646
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,020
The Queen of the Greeches, yeah, I got one speech for you right now.

647
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,340
I'm gonna make her black and blue right now.

648
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
Yeah!

649
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,940
And then throw her in the sewer now.

650
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,940
Kapow!

651
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:11,140
Blau Blau Blau Blau Blau Blau Blau Blau Blau

652
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,140
Do do do do

653
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,140
Can I come? Can I come? I'm really strong now

654
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,140
Yeah you can come into these two's room

655
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,140
It'll blend right in because come is their race

656
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
Go ahead

657
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
Wait hold on, can I come or not?

658
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,140
Hey little frog, you're not part of this song

659
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,140
So do not speak while we wrap this week

660
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
You're worse than a dog

661
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
I guess dogs are pretty okay in this world

662
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
If we're already talking to a fucking frog

663
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:44,220
Yeah, I'm still, I feel, I guess it's definitely insulting what's coming my way, which is hard

664
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,220
to make a big...

665
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,500
What's coming your way, is that your day?

666
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,140
Damn, drop the pencil on that one.

667
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,700
Alright, yeah, that one I get.

668
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,260
I've heard that before.

669
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:58,580
Alright, you can come up, but only on one, there's one caveat to you coming.

670
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
One condition.

671
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,580
You got it.

672
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,540
I get to tie you to my body like a bulletproof vest.

673
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,540
Okay!

674
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,540
Yep.

675
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,540
(silence)

676
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
Okay, let's do it.

677
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,540
Okay, so you tie Sullivan to your body.

678
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
He's very...

679
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
I'd also like to add...

680
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,540
He's so excited.

681
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,540
Do you guys have any cork or duct tape?

682
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,540
Uh, yeah, of course we do.

683
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,540
We're Irish.

684
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
Okay, give me some cork.

685
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:25,540
Go ahead and break some bottles of fuckin' whatever and give me some cork, you fuckin' drunk piece of shit.

686
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,540
I like you. I like the coat of your jib, computer demon.

687
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,540
Thank you. You're an orangutan to me.

688
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
(laughter)

689
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,540
Okay, he gives you cork and duct tape.

690
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:39,740
Okay, I'd like to stuff the cork into Sullivan's mouth because I see this being a serious problem of being so close to me

691
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:45,880
And then I will duct tape on top of the cork and I'm gonna duct tape his nose, too

692
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,780
Because I think frogs can breathe through their skin they can so

693
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:56,900
Yeah, I thought maybe they could they so I'm gonna do that. So now he's fine

694
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,460
That's enough though. You're going into like you might as well be hibernating. You're basically just a piece of wood

695
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:11,640
You're basically just a piece of wood better than nothing how did you say that I hear another layer

696
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,420
Yeah as much as possible

697
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:18,620
What I will say

698
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,260
mummify him

699
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:24,220
What I will say is that before you go you should definitely rest

700
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:28,180
If you're gonna go to the Greech lair, and we'll discuss plans tomorrow

701
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,900
You're gonna need to sleep. You're gonna need potentially

702
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,020
some more assistance as well as in I would

703
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:42,220
Try to contact Patrick before you do this quest because you will you will die with just the two of you

704
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,020
Fuck him

705
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:51,380
Okay, call me. I would decline the quest you decline the car. You know what I

706
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,780
call I

707
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,780
Call him at the same time and our

708
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,800
- The exact same time.

709
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,300
- We cut two, Patrick, your PSP is off.

710
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,800
You are--

711
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,800
- Get your buddy out.

712
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,940
- Oh, blood.

713
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:12,640
- Oh, blood.

714
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,320
- That's how D&D players cuss.

715
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,160
- Oh, blood.

716
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,160
- Oh, you gods.

717
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:20,800
- Your PSP is off, but, sorry.

718
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,920
- We have a timer here as well.

719
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:22,960
- Oh yeah, sorry, I'm making sure.

720
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,080
Oh, is it over there?

721
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,080
- Yeah, bottom right.

722
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,200
- I'm a silly goober.

723
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,320
- Oh wow, I timed it perfectly.

724
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,160
I'm proud of myself.

725
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,120
- What do you mean the time?

726
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,360
- You press start when we started?

727
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,200
- Yeah.

728
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,020
(laughing)

729
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:34,860
- Well it's like to the second, you know what I mean?

730
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,400
- You know what, if you want a compliment, yes.

731
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,040
- I didn't want a compliment.

732
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:39,880
I was happy.

733
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,680
- You're the perfect timer.

734
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,640
- All right, now I feel like it's a bad thing.

735
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,560
- If you had timed it perfectly with your brain,

736
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,740
that would have been pretty impressive,

737
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,160
but you just used another timer.

738
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,000
(laughing)

739
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,160
- If you said we're at 30.09 right then,

740
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,280
I would have been like, damn.

741
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,760
- Yeah, I guess that's true.

742
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,640
- Human timer.

743
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,280
- I was just, it's stupid, you know what, I'm stupid.

744
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,240
- You're not stupid.

745
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,940
- We're cutting, we're cutting to Patrick.

746
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:09,040
It is dark where you are, you try to move and you can't.

747
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,920
- Oh my God, I must be at the movies.

748
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:17,120
It's dark where I am and I can't move.

749
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,420
I must be at the movies.

750
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:25,400
- It all seemed too good to be true, you hear a voice.

751
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Very convenient intel about a guy we've been worried about for some time.

752
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,600
Confirming our worst fears.

753
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,200
Oh, is this Janet? This is Janet.

754
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,400
And so all you had to do was fall into your trap.

755
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,900
But you slipped up and you got greedy and you see her appear in the light.

756
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,400
I knew it was you, bitch!

757
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,100
You working for someone besides Belinda?

758
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,800
You working for Gumby Superior?

759
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,600
I honestly don't care who both of those are.

760
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,100
[laughter]

761
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,740
All I wanted to do was get a bunch of money and then find my nephew.

762
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,620
Then why'd you go into my room?

763
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,620
I was bored!

764
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,620
What?

765
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,620
Yeah!

766
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,140
She's gonna roll insight on you.

767
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
Roll persuasion.

768
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,140
Six.

769
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,140
That's your persuasion.

770
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,900
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

771
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,260
So I got an eight.

772
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,140
I mean she's like, "You were bored?"

773
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,720
You had charades for Xbox.

774
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,680
It's the only game we had.

775
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,480
Have you tried to play that?

776
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,540
That doesn't explain why you were so dogged about the whole thing.

777
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,540
Jamming your skateboard in there.

778
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,540
What does that mean?

779
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,680
It means you were pursuing it.

780
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:38,760
You were just keep, kept doing it over and over again.

781
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,140
You kept going for it.

782
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,040
You jammed your skateboard in there.

783
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:51,040
Oh, I was bored and I kept doing something over and over again so that I could actually

784
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,560
not be bored anymore. Have you ever played with a, like, a ball on the ceiling and you

785
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,520
keep throwing it over and over again?

786
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,800
No, I've never been to prison. What are you talking about?

787
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,820
I've been to prison twice.

788
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:07,000
You have been to prison at least once, that is true.

789
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,840
Twice- one time before that.

790
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,520
You did? Okay.

791
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
On Suckafuckabob.

792
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,160
And they gave you a ball?

793
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:20,520
I made the ball. Who is that? Who asked me that?

794
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,520
I need to know.

795
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Who is it? Is there another guy in here?

796
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
You need to tell me everything you know.

797
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Chris?

798
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,520
You need to tell me everything you know.

799
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,520
Wait, Chris Craig is in here!

800
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,520
No, no, no, don't even look at me.

801
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Chris Craig! I haven't seen you since high school!

802
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,520
It's not a big deal, I work on the ship now.

803
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Just leave me alone.

804
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
You're doing something.

805
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
Chris! Chris, can you get the fuck out of here?

806
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,520
I am... listen, I'm gone.

807
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,520
Oh my god, I'm interrogating you.

808
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,160
- Janitor, Chris Craig the janitor.

809
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,000
- Don't talk to the help.

810
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,200
- He's still a janitor, just like you know.

811
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,680
- Stuff didn't go so well for me.

812
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,520
I'm gonna go clean the room next door.

813
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,120
- Chris, get out.

814
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,680
- I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry.

815
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,520
- You should be sorry. - Wait Chris,

816
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,340
do you remember this?

817
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,180
Wait, wait, wait.

818
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,840
(imitates a dog)

819
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,160
- If you do that again, I'm gonna kill you.

820
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,000
- I'm out, bye.

821
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,080
I'll see you Patrick.

822
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,640
- Get out of here, Chris Craig.

823
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,040
- Let's also get you on the interrogation table.

824
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,300
- Chris Craig, who's Chris Craig?

825
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,220
Who's Chris Craig?

826
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,940
- Chris Craig is somebody else.

827
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,580
- No, which character is he?

828
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,540
Oh, here he is.

829
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,800
(laughing)

830
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,640
He's leaving.

831
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,580
- Bye Chris.

832
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,040
- And Patrick, as she moves closer,

833
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,700
you see that she's not pleased up.

834
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,780
Come on, don't do, all right.

835
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,180
As she moves closer, you see that--

836
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,780
- She's gonna suffocate me with her butt?

837
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,780
- You see that she--

838
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,620
- Good way to go for a guy like me.

839
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,180
She has, which you didn't notice before,

840
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,100
'cause before she just kinda looked like Fran Drescher.

841
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,900
- Yeah. - But now she's got freckles.

842
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,460
- She's Sans Dresser right now.

843
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,740
- Oh, fuck. - Yeah, fuck, that was good.

844
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,540
- Oh! - No, no.

845
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,060
Why'd you throw my-- - Just him.

846
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,660
- What was that? - I was going for your hand

847
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,500
and I missed it. - It's rude,

848
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,380
you weren't gonna get it.

849
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,220
All right, continue the scene, I'll pick my dice up.

850
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:08,100
- And now she has freckles,

851
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,900
and what looks like, in the dark,

852
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,920
from what you can tell, reddish hair.

853
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:16,140
- She looks a little different from what you're used to.

854
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,060
And from what you can also see,

855
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,820
now that you're like getting yourself

856
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,900
a little bit more oriented,

857
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:26,260
you're not in the guest room, you're not in her room.

858
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:29,180
- Oh, I'm down in the swamp with the other guys.

859
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,820
- If you look out the window,

860
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,260
you can kinda see space a little bit.

861
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:36,520
But what you would've seen where you were before,

862
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,660
but you just know that you're not where you were previously.

863
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,060
- Here on the moon.

864
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,900
- And so--

865
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
No fucking way.

866
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,900
Sorry, I'll leave again.

867
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,900
I was just playing a joke.

868
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,900
You're not on the moon.

869
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,900
Okay, bye.

870
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,900
Classic fucking Chris Craig, dude.

871
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,900
This moon joke.

872
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:57,900
I used to do it all the time in high school.

873
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I used to kill people.

874
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,900
And if someone said, "Where am I?" I said, "You're on the moon."

875
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
Classic Chris Craig.

876
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,900
My bad.

877
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
You need to tell me everything you know right now.

878
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,900
Okay.

879
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,580
- Four plus four is... - Hold on.

880
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,420
- Yeah, wait.

881
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,240
(laughing)

882
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,320
- Is it gonna be a short list?

883
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,160
(laughing)

884
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,000
- Just, uh, just careful how you phrase that.

885
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,020
- Four times four is 16.

886
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:18,860
- Stop.

887
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,600
- First of all, I'm proud of you.

888
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,440
(laughing)

889
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,260
I didn't think you'd pull off the multiply.

890
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,020
- Seven times seven is 49.

891
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,100
- Okay, all right.

892
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,060
- 12 times 12 is 144.

893
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,900
- Ooh, all right.

894
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,940
- Now do 13 times 13.

895
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,500
- Is 162.

896
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,420
(laughing)

897
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,400
- Now 100 times 100.

898
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,140
- I can't, Chris, get outta here.

899
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,980
(laughing)

900
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,340
- Oh, that's not my strong suit.

901
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,760
- Look, I just wanted to,

902
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,100
are you in league?

903
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,180
- Are you one of these Irish leprechauns?

904
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,280
- I'm not.

905
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,020
- Your red hair and your red skin freckles.

906
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,060
- Fuck!

907
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,700
I'm not a leprechaun.

908
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,540
Just.

909
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,540
- I'm a leprechaun-vict.

910
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:58,980
Music.

911
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,820
- Look, I just.

912
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,500
- And you already know.

913
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,180
- Why did you go into my room?

914
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,020
- Bored.

915
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,700
- You really were just bored, weren't you?

916
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,540
- Yep.

917
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:12,540
God, you are something else.

918
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,380
Uh-huh.

919
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,320
All right, and she frees you from the interrogation.

920
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,980
And you're free to, I'm sorry, I was just--

921
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,080
Where's the bathroom?

922
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,100
It's--

923
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,500
Is his PSP still off?

924
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,640
It is still off, he can turn,

925
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,700
she gives it back to him, you know.

926
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,540
It's over there.

927
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,580
I turn it on and I go on my phone

928
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,700
'cause I'm going to the bathroom.

929
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,760
Okay, yeah.

930
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,760
you can see a missed calls but you have a missed call you get ten thousand

931
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,560
dollars and white that hasn't text from me that are awful

932
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,760
the role it's a family except for the

933
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,360

934
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,600
the sway all those of the way like one of those like nice job

935
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,200

936
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,280

937
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,480
which is a hundred coming up with his creative

938
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,280
but the

939
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,920

940
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:02,800
who's not looking at the just on the toilet just hitting the book that night

941
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,560
- I'm not even sending them on Instagram,

942
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,900
I'm texting it to you, I'm copying the link

943
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,740
and texting it to you.

944
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,400
- It's a screenshot and he can see you have a notification

945
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,480
from like the doctor.

946
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,000
- She knocks on the door, she's like, Patrick.

947
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,840
- Occupied!

948
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,260
- Oh my God.

949
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:23,560
Okay.

950
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,400
- Housekeeping?

951
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,000
- Do that and I'll let you in.

952
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,680
- I don't wanna go in the bathroom,

953
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,160
I want you to go out.

954
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
(laughter)

955
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
(laughter)

956
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,160
(laughter)

957
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160

959
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Pat, you need to do housekeeping.

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Oh, I open, so I say it.

961
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
He opens the door,

962
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
says housekeeping, his pants are down.

963
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
(laughter)

964
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
(laughter)

965
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,160
Oh yeah, you're right, I need to do it.

966
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Oh yeah, you're right.

967
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Housekeeping.

968
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,160

969
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,160
(laughter)

970
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,160
(laughter)

971
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,160
(laughter)

972
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,160
(laughter)

973
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
(laughter)

974
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
(laughter)

975
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
(laughter)

976
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
(laughter)

977
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
(laughter)

978
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
(laughter)

979
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
(laughter)

980
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
(laughter)

981
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
(laughter)

982
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
(laughter)

983
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:40,160
she starts doing it to like appease me and just be like "alright fine, i'll hook you up with an eye opener"

984
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,160
and we both say it at the same time and my dick is out

985
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:51,160
and your dick is up on top of the toes that you're peeing onto the floor

986
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,160
that's what that's meant

987
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,160
husky bank!

988
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,420
(laughing)

989
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,480
- All right, what do I gotta do?

990
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,320
- All that happens.

991
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
- What the hell am I walking into?

992
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,640
- Chris, you've been in here the whole time

993
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,680
you told me to do it.

994
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,840
- Oh yeah, that was funny as shit.

995
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,680
Okay, bye.

996
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,320
- Okay, all right, okay.

997
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,640
So all that happens.

998
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,880
(laughing)

999
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,760
She says that was one of the worst experiences in my life.

1000
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,800
Glad it's over.

1001
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Look, all you need to do now is go talk to Huge-Ass Facts

1002
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,340
and tell him what you learned.

1003
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,480
- Oh, I have his phone number, I'll call him right now.

1004
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,920
- No, you don't have his phone number.

1005
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,760
Nobody has his phone number.

1006
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,600
- Ah, rats. - You don't even

1007
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,980
have his phone number.

1008
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,980
And just forget what you saw here.

1009
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,840
I'm sorry, I didn't trust you.

1010
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:52,080
I just thought that somebody doing that would've been,

1011
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,920
they would've had a good reason for it, but--

1012
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,960
- Well, clearly after you've seen everything

1013
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:02,880
I totally understand your whole thing. You know I may have some kind of mental disability. You're sort of a savant. I understand now.

1014
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,600
What is he good at?

1015
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:11,000
Fighting and killing. Oh yeah. Speaking of fighting and killing, how about you get your sorry ass over here and help us?

1016
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,240
Yeah, oh wait.

1017
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,240
My phone's not like, been on the phone. You're on call with me.

1018
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
I can hear it in my pocket.

1019
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Patrick, come on.

1020
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Oh, oh snap.

1021
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,240
What the flip? Let me check my phone.

1022
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,240
We have to fight the gleech. Wait, wait.

1023
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,240
What can you tell your friends?

1024
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
Where, where?

1025
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
Hold on, I'll give the phone to you.

1026
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
Where are you guys?

1027
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
Housekeeping.

1028
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Janet Blowjob.

1029
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,240
I'm naked.

1030
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,240
Oh my god.

1031
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:39,240
They're all like this.

1032
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
Where are you guys right now?

1033
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,240
Oh wait, okay. And I pull my pants down.

1034
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Ewww!

1035
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
Wait, housekeeping, housekeeping.

1036
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,240
This is our joke.

1037
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
Okay, wait.

1038
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
She sort of looks around.

1039
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,080
- And she looks around.

1040
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,760
- I was keeping, I was keeping.

1041
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,360
- She sort of looks around the room you're in

1042
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,800
and she goes, okay, she turns to Patrick.

1043
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,220
She goes, I can get you there.

1044
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,040
If you talk to Huge-Ass Facts,

1045
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,720
I can get you there right after, I promise.

1046
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,900
- All right.

1047
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,640
- Okay.

1048
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:13,960
She looks at the phone again.

1049
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,400
You guys are just naked, I guess.

1050
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,920
- Me and Bullet Joss are like,

1051
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:21,720
just touching our fingertips together like this.

1052
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:26,160
She just says, "Did you guys talk to Bam McGinnis?"

1053
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,640
Who?

1054
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,680
Bam McGinnis.

1055
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,760
Oh yeah, who were you talking about?

1056
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,760
No, but we have to kill some hoe.

1057
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,200
I'm with some hoe.

1058
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,400
Wait, let me handle this.

1059
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,240
Let me handle this.

1060
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,060
Go ahead.

1061
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:38,900
What of it?

1062
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,440
So you did talk to Bam McGinnis.

1063
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,040
I don't know who, what of him.

1064
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,800
What was your name again?

1065
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,000
Both of you rolled a seven.

1066
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,280
Would you say your name is Gleek Queen?

1067
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,040
- Was that a roll?

1068
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,860
- No, that's not a roll.

1069
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,700
- Here, I need a 20 'cause he dropped my d20.

1070
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,440
- It was an accident with my drop.

1071
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,280
- 11.

1072
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,680
- Okay, I had your deception.

1073
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,240
- 14, motherfucker.

1074
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,640
- Mine is 11.

1075
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,000
- I'm sorry?

1076
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,040
- 11 with what?

1077
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,880
- 11.

1078
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,880
- Altogether?

1079
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,720
Oh, okay.

1080
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,560
Can you give me a d20?

1081
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,680
- Yeah.

1082
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,080
- You definitely have one.

1083
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,280
- Yeah, she got 20 on her insight.

1084
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,320
- Damn!

1085
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,160
- Bloody hell.

1086
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,240
- She knows.

1087
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,120
- You should've waited a roll.

1088
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,960
- You're right.

1089
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:20,780
- A roll, gods would've blessed you.

1090
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,340
- You guys don't know that she knows, but she goes,

1091
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,060
okay, you guys, all right.

1092
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,100
- Dumb bitch doesn't realize a thing.

1093
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,300
- So-- - She's as stupid as a--

1094
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,500
- Hey guys, she can't even tell you're lying.

1095
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,780
(laughing)

1096
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,020
- Yeah, look at how big my dick is.

1097
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:35,860
- Damn!

1098
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,700
- She probably thinks it's actually big.

1099
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,500
- It's so red!

1100
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,740
- Pull that up to the phone.

1101
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,580
- Okay.

1102
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:41,500
- Okay, I mean, I didn't--

1103
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
- Stop happening.

1104
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,420
- I'm putting the memoji on it,

1105
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:46,820
I'm making it look like a chicken.

1106
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:48,380
(laughing)

1107
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,340
- Whoa, what the fuck?

1108
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,540
- Wait, wait, keep it like that.

1109
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,380
- Wait.

1110
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,220
- Here, I'll get it.

1111
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:55,500
- Oh, my fucking cock!

1112
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,060
- Oh, I thought it was real, I'm sorry.

1113
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:59,140
- Oh wait, I didn't remember it on the computer on the back.

1114
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,140
- She hangs up the PSP, hands it back to you.

1115
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,140
- We're still on the call with each other.

1116
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:10,420
- She leads you to a pod, like a circular pod.

1117
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:15,480
You both go in it.

1118
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,300
- Am I meeting huge ass facts right now?

1119
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,420
- You shoot through space.

1120
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:22,420
We're on the moon pause and suddenly we're on the moon

1121
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:25,060
While you're shooting through space

1122
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,460
you're shooting towards the other end of the

1123
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:31,140
pleasure palace

1124
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,020
The end that you were originally at you were on

1125
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:40,380
The bottom you went back to where they're from the bottom where they were now now you're going

1126
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,740
Well actually you were back or the way. I had drawn the map you were at the top

1127
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:49,460
So I'm was I was here you were there when you were at a fax layer

1128
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:52,680
Then you were there and now you're going back down, okay?

1129
00:43:52,680 --> 00:44:00,580
So okay, so up then I'm down so this is where the Royal Guard or whatever is no the Royal Guard sort of in the butt

1130
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:05,500
Area the back the back the fuck the Royal Guard is like there here

1131
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:10,300
We're gonna hear the Royal Guard is like over here the royal the royal shit touching his tip

1132
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,740
This is where stop this is where you were

1133
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,100
Over here just now

1134
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:18,420
We're going down here. Yes fax is over here, so I go down here

1135
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,580
So you were just now here, and you're shooting back down the huge ass facts and while you're inside this pod

1136
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,140
You watch as a

1137
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:33,100
Bunch of little robotic hands similar to the nanobots pop out and start doing

1138
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:40,460
Janet blowjobs makeup and dying her hair do mine too and making her look like mine after Janet blowjob again

1139
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,260
You go and move in the way, and you get the same

1140
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:51,480
It's a you both just look like Fred drescher, and she's like oh god and

1141
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,760
And you come back I start taking selfies on my phone

1142
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,660
Wait, we got a center

1143
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:33,100
Really close to the camera you go like a hundred feet away and look be under it like you're holding it up

1144
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:37,220
Okay, I said it to her

1145
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,700
I pull up my phone and I just show her,

1146
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,740
look what I did.

1147
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,100
(laughing)

1148
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,360
I got my friends to send me their cocks.

1149
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,260
- That's awesome.

1150
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,100
- 'Cause I'm a pretty woman now.

1151
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:52,480
- So you land in the,

1152
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,540
back in that part of the Pleasure Palace,

1153
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,820
and you ride on like a conveyor belt,

1154
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:04,420
and you pop out through the panel.

1155
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,860
- And when I pop out through the panel,

1156
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,700
the hair gets caught.

1157
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:08,900
- Your weave gets caught.

1158
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:11,980
- The whole mask just fucking rips.

1159
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:13,300
- So you just look like you again.

1160
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,140
- Yeah.

1161
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:15,580
- And you get out and you're back

1162
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,240
in Janet Blowjob's bedroom.

1163
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:21,380
And she sort of like dusts herself off,

1164
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:25,140
pushes down her leopard print dress,

1165
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:28,500
and then she goes over, knocks on the guest room door,

1166
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,180
and says, "Baby guy, wake up,

1167
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,220
"it's time to meet huge-ass facts."

1168
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,460
And he gets out, baby guy gets out,

1169
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,380
He's like, "All right, let's do it then."

1170
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,100
And he looks at you, and he like glares at you

1171
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:43,500
because you had been fucking with the panel before,

1172
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,860
but he sees that like you guys seem cool,

1173
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,260
and so he like kind of forgets it.

1174
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,260
And so she leads you to--

1175
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:50,660
- Wait, what happened?

1176
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:51,900
- Baby Gat was-- - Nothing happened

1177
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,980
to Baby Gat 'cause didn't I leave the room

1178
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:54,820
and then just like go to bed?

1179
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:57,740
- Well, he was freaking out that you had done something

1180
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,860
to her room. - So nothing happened,

1181
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,820
so didn't she catch him in the bedroom and then I left?

1182
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,940
- Well, you don't know if she caught him in the bedroom.

1183
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:05,200
- He might have just given up,

1184
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,060
and then she abducted you at some point.

1185
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,780
- I assumed that I left him to get the shit kicked out of him

1186
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,340
by her security guards.

1187
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,460
- Um, that's, well, so, and then you see,

1188
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:18,140
you also see Scooter, and he waves to you

1189
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,060
as you walk behind. - I wave over,

1190
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:20,380
I say, "Get over here."

1191
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,720
- Okay, yeah, he sort of like,

1192
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,960
he hops up and lands inside your robe pocket.

1193
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,740
And then you guys go into-- - I got a pet.

1194
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:28,780
- The elevator.

1195
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:31,900
Kenan Thompson is already in there.

1196
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:36,660
he does a little bit of like an extra thing

1197
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,500
with the like putting his finger down

1198
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:42,100
the Harry Potter ass kinda like thing with the elevator.

1199
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:43,860
And the elevator moves inward.

1200
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:47,500
Excuse me, sorry, I've got a whole thing

1201
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
written for this part.

1202
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,780
I promise it won't be too much,

1203
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,380
but it will be a lot actually.

1204
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:56,580
Where am I going here?

1205
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,640
(humming)

1206
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,480
There we go.

1207
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,760
Yeah, this time after pushing out horizontally,

1208
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,700
rather than continuing up or down, it keeps going.

1209
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,500
So where the elevator last time was going up and down

1210
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,660
and then hers, it took you to a secret room,

1211
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:16,340
this time it goes forward and it just keeps going.

1212
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,060
- It totally is the Great Glass Elevator.

1213
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:21,820
- Don't even say Wonka Vader, that scared the shit out of me.

1214
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,140
- I did not even consider.

1215
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,500
- Wonka Vader, idea for later.

1216
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,340
- Rather than continuing down or up--

1217
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:28,340
- Charlie Bucket, I am your grandfather, Joe.

1218
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,300
though it keeps going.

1219
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,140
- Oh yeah, he would be.

1220
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,020
- And as you move through the opaque elevator,

1221
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,460
like you can't see anything outside of it,

1222
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,260
the chatter of members of Facts Gang

1223
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,260
and the occasional crackle and pop of machinery

1224
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,420
and rushing of some kind of liquid you can hear

1225
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,220
around you as the elevator is moving through,

1226
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,960
but you can't see, excuse me, anything.

1227
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,920
It goes right for a bit, then down,

1228
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,460
then makes three more rights, then down again,

1229
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:54,260
then one final right that pushes it further and further in.

1230
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:56,660
- On the back of my phone I drew a crude map.

1231
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,500
- Yeah, yeah.

1232
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:58,900
- I'm about to get here.

1233
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:02,380
- And then down again, then one,

1234
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,780
you know what actually, roll,

1235
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:07,540
I guess, let's just roll like a general--

1236
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:08,980
- Roll intelligence. - Intelligence, yeah.

1237
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,080
It's really just a general intelligence check.

1238
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,580
Oh, not bad. - 18.

1239
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,860
- Oh, that's good. - Plus or minus what?

1240
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,820
- Minus one.

1241
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,560
Or was it the number on top?

1242
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,860
- Yeah, yeah, the minus one, yeah.

1243
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,340
So, all right, cool.

1244
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,660
So that's 17, that's very good.

1245
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:23,400
So I will,

1246
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,100
I will show you kind of what you drew later.

1247
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,860
- Okay. - Like, I will remember,

1248
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,060
I'm gonna write a note just to remember

1249
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,780
that you drew this well.

1250
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,840
- I drew it well 'cause I was bored again.

1251
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,300
The elevator was taking too long.

1252
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,300
- Yeah, after where the huge-ass fax lair is from.

1253
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:44,620
- That's my savant, that's my savant.

1254
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:47,060
- Yeah, one of your savant drawings when you're bored.

1255
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,180
- I'm really good at drawing a map to somewhere.

1256
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:53,620
- So when you, it goes right for a bit,

1257
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,340
then down, makes three more rights, then stops.

1258
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,400
Kenan Thompson then runs his fingers along the elevator panel

1259
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,620
and the yellow doors open and reveals a dark chamber

1260
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,180
safe for a luminescent yellow pus bulbs

1261
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,060
that jut from the bruised, knotted flesh

1262
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,220
you saw outside of the fax layer.

1263
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,300
So you remember those from outside the layer.

1264
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,380
So let's get you all the way over here.

1265
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:15,500
- I'm looking at a pus bowl right now.

1266
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,320
- Let's get up her skirt.

1267
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,660
- Oh, gross bro. - Look at my characters.

1268
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,780
Look at my characters.

1269
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,460
- That is her God-given dribbler

1270
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,980
and you'll refer to it with respect.

1271
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,420
Okay, I'm looking at her pus filled dribbler. Thank you

1272
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:34,260
Do you mind lining lining this with guys just line the sides with guys as many as you can?

1273
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:38,200
Wants to get up in a guy's intestinal lining. I don't want to stop saying that

1274
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:47,220
So a dark chamber safe for the luminescent yellow pus bulbs a jet from the bruised knotted flesh that you saw outside a fax layer

1275
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:49,220
and in your dream

1276
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,420
Yeah, your dreams. Oh

1277
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,200
It's though those bulbs that you would saw so when you went to first see huge ass faxes layer

1278
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,460
It looked like a like discarded like engine of a alien ship

1279
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:06,960
Yeah with these yellow pus bulbs, and it was like just over a hole so that way

1280
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,980
That's what I saw in the dream. This is in real life that it was like this kind of giant structure

1281
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:17,780
That underneath it was a hole that led down into huge ass fax layer

1282
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:24,140
Yeah, and so you're seeing those yellow bulbs again now the ones from my dream. They were also in your dream

1283
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,180
Yeah, but they were in like you're seeing them there. You're seeing them here as well

1284
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:32,000
And if you also remember before your dream happened

1285
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,140
Your video game console you thought was like flickering

1286
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:44,260
Yeah, like and like losing power almost like why as you were falling asleep, so just make painting some pictures here for you

1287
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:48,020
- Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase.

1288
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,420
- Yeah, it's pretty much that kind of movie.

1289
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:50,620
- These bulbs--

1290
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,740
- Can we do a Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase one next?

1291
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:54,740
- We kind of did.

1292
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,700
We've done Scooby-Doo and we've kind of done a Cyber Chase.

1293
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,620
But maybe a combination of both.

1294
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:00,440
- We could do a combination of both.

1295
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,540
- Can we do it both together?

1296
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:02,380
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1297
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:03,440
- Can we do exactly Scooby-Doo, Cyber Chase,

1298
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,140
and no plot points change from the movie at all?

1299
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:07,780
- Yeah, that's fine, we could do that.

1300
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:08,620
- I like this.

1301
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,180
- And we're just saying the script.

1302
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:11,420
- I like this.

1303
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:12,260
- These bulbs light a room of--

1304
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,540
- That movie is awesome.

1305
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,380
- Clean white tile.

1306
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,060
- The live action version. - Yeah.

1307
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:18,060
- That gives way to a glass encasing

1308
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:19,780
below which you can see one of the glowing

1309
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:21,260
power cores of the ship.

1310
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,060
Similar to what Blotoss and Ray had seen

1311
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:26,180
in the upper guts in, I think it was two sessions ago maybe.

1312
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,780
When you guys were in the scientist lab

1313
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,900
and you saw the power core below you,

1314
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,560
there's a power core here as well.

1315
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:32,700
(laughs)

1316
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,520
There's a power core here as well.

1317
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,660
So it's like on one end of the ship there was a power core

1318
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:39,540
and the other end of the ship there was a power core, okay?

1319
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:44,920
So, and you can see it below these sort of glass encasings.

1320
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,580
Where everything about the lair

1321
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,820
had been clean and bureaucratic,

1322
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,740
this chamber has an ancient flair.

1323
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,460
The bulbs like sort of roomy abscissions.

1324
00:52:55,460 --> 00:53:00,980
It's like they're like these old, old things,

1325
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:02,780
like ancient looking things.

1326
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,980
Sitting beneath the bulbs, watching you,

1327
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:08,780
Gad and Janet, watching you, Gad and Janet,

1328
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,060
as you walk across the chamber are a number of factoids.

1329
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:15,860
Factoids are elite agents in service of huge ass facts.

1330
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:18,800
They're dressed casually, they're all manner of races,

1331
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,060
ape, clown, goblin two, fungoid.

1332
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:24,100
The difference being that their eyes glow

1333
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,380
with an eerie yellow.

1334
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:27,540
- Cough much?

1335
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,540
- Excuse me, yes.

1336
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:30,160
That is, damn dude.

1337
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,260
- Had that locked and loaded since the last cough.

1338
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:34,100
- I know.

1339
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,220
Their eyes are yellow though,

1340
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:37,220
these people that they're watching.

1341
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,820
Yellow eyes, what are they, the lava monster

1342
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:40,660
from Hercules, the animated movie?

1343
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,540
No, the yellow, that's not the,

1344
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:43,380
that's the first thing that has yellow eyes.

1345
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,940
It's not really as good as Koffmuch, but whatever.

1346
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,940
Their eyes are yellow and matching the luminescent bulbs

1347
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:50,980
as well. Are they staring at me?

1348
00:53:50,980 --> 00:53:52,940
They are watching you guys as you're walking through.

1349
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,980
You're flipping them off, that's pretty cool.

1350
00:53:54,980 --> 00:53:58,300
Take a picture to last longer, bitch.

1351
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,280
Yeah, the dark eerie sinewy walkway gives way

1352
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:04,620
to a cool steel platform at the end of the chamber.

1353
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:08,120
So it's like this white tile, these weird bulbs,

1354
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,500
and these guys on the other side with the yellow eyes,

1355
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:14,020
and the bulbs and the fleshy shit

1356
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,940
that looks like the alien ship with the clear white tile.

1357
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,780
And then at the very end is sort of this raised platform.

1358
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:21,500
And you see,

1359
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:25,680
beyond that is a large bay window.

1360
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,500
So there's a large bay window

1361
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,460
that is looking out at planet E-Bomb as well.

1362
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:35,060
Atop this is a modern minimalist desk

1363
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:37,300
and the back of a large segmented chair behind it.

1364
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:38,140
So one of those like--

1365
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,980
- The elusive man.

1366
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,820
- Sort of.

1367
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:44,380
That's kind of what I'm looking for here, yeah.

1368
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,620
So, and, so beyond this,

1369
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:48,740
similar to that, the command center that Blotas and Ray,

1370
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:51,740
so similar to the command center that you guys saw

1371
00:54:51,740 --> 00:54:54,020
with that bay window, this kind of like mirrors that,

1372
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,540
but it's on the bottom of the ship now.

1373
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,380
- Dope.

1374
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,300
Where we put the black folder up, that place.

1375
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,880
- Yes, yeah, that place.

1376
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,220
but it's where instead behind this chair is Hugh J. Fax.

1377
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:07,040
And what you can see is less of Gunn City

1378
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,240
and more of the white fog of the uninhabitable sea bomb

1379
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,020
that sort of surrounds Gunn City.

1380
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:15,480
- I point at it and I say, "Blow that up."

1381
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,360
- You also see minority report like holograms

1382
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,080
kind of flashing along the windows,

1383
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,980
them like swiping back and forth.

1384
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,640
And the segmented chair spins around

1385
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,200
revealing a pudgy bulldog of a man

1386
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,440
of some 40 odd years with slick black hair and a goatee.

1387
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:34,440
- Oh, that was supposed to be Chris Craig.

1388
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,960
- And mesmerizing eyes.

1389
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:38,920
- Here he is, bulldog of a man.

1390
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:40,960
- Holy crap, it's Chris Craig.

1391
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:43,140
- No, it's not Chris Craig, it's this guy.

1392
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:44,540
- Yeah, it could be that guy.

1393
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:50,120
As his gaze settles on, sorry, sorry, yeah.

1394
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:51,640
- You think gays should settle?

1395
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,480
- No, hold on.

1396
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,320
- They should settle down with their husbands?

1397
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,520
- They should settle down with their husbands

1398
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,560
- I think things could be a whole lot better.

1399
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,320
- His eyes also seem to like--

1400
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,160
- Where those guys eyes are--

1401
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,720
- Straits could be slaves.

1402
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,280
- Where those guys eyes are yellow,

1403
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,600
his eyes seem to like shift along the spectrum.

1404
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,320
Like as you look at them from different angles,

1405
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,860
it's like they kinda like keep shifting.

1406
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:13,600
He wears a sleek gray Zhongshan suit,

1407
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,880
sort of like a Chinese suit.

1408
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,000
- You wanna try that again?

1409
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,280
- Zhongshan.

1410
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,880
- You wanna explain what the fuck you're talking about?

1411
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,720
- He's wearing a Zhongshan suit.

1412
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,600
- A Zhongshan is like sort of like,

1413
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:24,160
it's like kind of like a Mandarin collar,

1414
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,000
kinda Mao--

1415
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,820
- And it's made by P. Diddy.

1416
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:26,660
- Yeah, you're thinking he did it.

1417
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,500
- It's like a Mao suit.

1418
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:29,060
- You're thinking John John.

1419
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,900
- Sean John.

1420
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,720
- No, Zhang Xiong.

1421
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:32,820
- You're thinking John.

1422
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,460
- Jubio, can you pull up Zhang Xiong?

1423
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,300
- Big Sean.

1424
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,120
- Z-H-O-N-G.

1425
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:36,960
- Sean.

1426
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:38,180
- Oh God.

1427
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,020
- S-H-A-N.

1428
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,580
- Guys, we're moving on.

1429
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,420
- Okay.

1430
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,060
(laughing)

1431
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,940
With a gold bulbous pin sitting at the top of his collar.

1432
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,420
As his gaze settles on Janet,

1433
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,460
his eyes kind of settle a little bit in a light brown.

1434
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,700
I mean, his eyes flicker towards you, Patrick.

1435
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:58,900
And his stony face slackens just enough to speak.

1436
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,600
As he speaks, the bulbs in the room

1437
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,700
pulse in time with his voice.

1438
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:07,980
- Janet, you've deemed this diversion important enough

1439
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,420
to take time away from data collection.

1440
00:57:10,420 --> 00:57:13,240
- Do you have peanut butter in your mouth, bitch?

1441
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,560
- Excuse me?

1442
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:17,300
- Sorry, I have Tourette's.

1443
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:23,100
- Well, Mr. Fax,

1444
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,440
(clears throat)

1445
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:30,440
Patrick Yoda, who's this loud gentleman here,

1446
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:34,120
and Baby Gadd discovered something very interesting

1447
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,700
while conversing with our friend Gumby Superior.

1448
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,480
Patrick, play what's on your PSP.

1449
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,700
- I was already playing with it.

1450
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,540
- No, no.

1451
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,680
(laughing)

1452
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,640
- Picture of my giant red dick.

1453
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,960
(laughing)

1454
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,560
- No, Patrick, the recording.

1455
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:51,400
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1456
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,220
- He's right by the table.

1457
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:54,220
recording me going "uh, uh, uh"

1458
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:56,220
*laughter*

1459
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:58,220
Do you have a recording of your friend

1460
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,220
making those noises? Oh I have a recording of my

1461
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,220
friend and it's a video of him and it's like him

1462
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:04,220
with like, the camera below

1463
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:06,220
is nuts. No they should have to use the picture of

1464
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,220
me with the big red dick to figure out where

1465
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,220
they are.

1466
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,220
Yeah you're just scrolling through all the text that you've got

1467
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:14,220
since we think that you're the woman with makeup

1468
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:16,220
and it's like me fucking my shoe.

1469
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:18,220
*laughter*

1470
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:20,220
Go to your audio, give me your PSP.

1471
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:23,460
- She takes your PSP from you.

1472
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:24,560
She finds the audio recording,

1473
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:26,780
she almost throws up in her mouth

1474
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,860
as she looks at the audio recording.

1475
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:30,540
She finds it, she plays it,

1476
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,980
it's Gummy Superior's speech about

1477
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:36,800
how he's gonna try to basically destroy the undercity

1478
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,980
and he wants your guys' help and yada yada yada

1479
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,480
and those are his plans for it.

1480
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,180
And he says,

1481
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:49,620
- It is difficult to get intel from the command center.

1482
00:58:49,620 --> 00:58:54,620
And this is vital information if he means to kill us all.

1483
00:58:54,620 --> 00:59:01,620
It's shrouded in too much doublespeak to use it against him, but this changes things.

1484
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:04,620
A fact I had not known.

1485
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:09,620
As he says this, he raises his right hand and holds his palm towards the sky.

1486
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:12,620
One of the bulbs near to him pushes out of the wall.

1487
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:16,620
So it's a bulb, it like pushes out of the wall like on a stalk.

1488
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,420
He's like, (slurping)

1489
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,380
like that kind of noise, you know what I'm saying?

1490
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:21,220
- Do it again.

1491
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,060
(slurping)

1492
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:22,900
- Oh, God. - You know what I'm saying?

1493
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,720
- Do it again.

1494
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:25,380
(clearing throat)

1495
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:26,220
- Cough much?

1496
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,900
- And it careens towards his hand,

1497
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,300
and Fax places his mouth on the bulb.

1498
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,400
When he pulls his mouth away,

1499
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:35,560
he wipes yellow liquid from his lips.

1500
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:36,580
- Let me get a bite.

1501
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:39,300
- Oh, you can't have any of this.

1502
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:41,060
- I don't actually want it.

1503
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:43,580
I'm just saying everything that comes into my mind.

1504
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:53,340
"Gad, expect a generous cash infusion in your business, continued support and protection.

1505
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:57,740
The twins, nor anyone else in my command, shall bother you any longer,

1506
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,500
and you are dismissed."

1507
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:02,420
And you see two factoids come around

1508
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,660
to escort Gad out. Gad's like,

1509
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:05,780
"Woo! Yes!

1510
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:07,380
Okay, I owe you big time, Pat!

1511
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:10,500
You can come by any time, you can do whatever you want, don't fuck up with this game."

1512
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:13,220
"Smack him. Smack him right now." "I owe you big time, man."

1513
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:13,720
Smack him.

1514
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,220
You know what? Fuck you too!

1515
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,220
Fuck you too! I could have done this without you!

1516
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:19,220
No, I was flipping out the other guy!

1517
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:23,220
And just kidding! And I love you and thank you so much and fuck you!

1518
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,220
No, again I was flipping out the other guy!

1519
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:27,220
You're being very confusing!

1520
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:31,220
And then he starts, you hear him like cheering and getting all excited as he leaves.

1521
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:33,220
He does that skip where he taps both of his feet together.

1522
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:35,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he does that.

1523
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,220
Wait.

1524
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,220
That's the number one way to do that is figurine.

1525
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:41,220
Yeah.

1526
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,460
(laughing)

1527
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,300
- And he leaves.

1528
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,220
- SpongeBob ass.

1529
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,060
- Yeah.

1530
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:50,300
- You, Yoda.

1531
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,840
- Do you know where my nephew is?

1532
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:53,540
I'm gonna be point blank.

1533
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,140
I'm just gonna ask.

1534
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:56,700
- That's what I wanted to hear.

1535
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,340
- That's what you wanted to hear?

1536
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:02,820
- Because you want something more than just money.

1537
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:03,660
I would give you--

1538
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,420
- No, wait, hold on.

1539
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:06,240
- Oh.

1540
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,580
- I want two things at once.

1541
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,740
(laughing)

1542
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,660
- No, no, no, no, I said more than just money.

1543
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,380
you will be compensated for what you've done today.

1544
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,380
- I'll get three things?

1545
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:17,060
- You're going to get 25,000 tokens from me.

1546
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:22,260
(imitating game sounds)

1547
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:26,340
But, if you want to find your precious nephew.

1548
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,180
- Drop it low.

1549
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:29,420
(laughing)

1550
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:34,180
- Just like, crumping.

1551
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:38,220
Doing a Fortnite dance.

1552
01:01:38,220 --> 01:01:41,140
(laughing)

1553
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,700
If you want to find your precious nephew,

1554
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,460
everything Gumby Superior said, he's a,

1555
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,700
how do I, he's arrogant.

1556
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:49,820
- A bitch.

1557
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:53,180
- And a bitch as well, that's well said.

1558
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:55,140
- You don't have to put the filter on on me.

1559
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,180
You know I'm not PC.

1560
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,780
- I can very much tell this.

1561
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:05,300
I will not just offer you my most precious gift,

1562
01:02:05,300 --> 01:02:06,860
information

1563
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,840
i will offer you power

1564
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,980
insight and network

1565
01:02:10,980 --> 01:02:12,980
late on me

1566
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:16,340
and i don't care if there's a catch just do it i'm lost

1567
01:02:16,340 --> 01:02:22,140
let me tell you the catch though you will want to hear this car right then

1568
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:24,980
once i tell you what i want you to do

1569
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:26,940
if you do not fall through with it

1570
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,900
or you choose not to follow through with it

1571
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:33,100
i'm afraid i will have to monitor everything you do for the rest of your

1572
01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:34,460
life

1573
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,260
until...

1574
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:36,760
Oh, there's already someone doing that.

1575
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,760
[laughter]

1576
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,760
I've already got a few people who do that.

1577
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,960
And if you step somewhat out of line in that instance, unfortunately,

1578
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,760
I will have to kill you.

1579
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,560
But, if you do what I ask you to do again,

1580
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,660
you will have access to my network,

1581
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,060
and in 24 hours I will find your nephew.

1582
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:58,060
[laughter]

1583
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:58,860
It's kinda hard.

1584
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,860
That is pretty sick.

1585
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,360
yeah i'm a do it i don't care

1586
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,940
his which and if i ask him to kill us

1587
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:11,920
well wait

1588
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:13,240
no

1589
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,780
you should do it i think it is a good idea

1590
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,980
better ideas whatever you're going to say that it was going to go on a quest

1591
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:22,080
you have to find a treasure

1592
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:24,120
uh... i don't think you know you

1593
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,520
it

1594
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,680
it is like you have to kill a dragon to find a treasure

1595
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,800
You have to find the jade monkey.

1596
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,800
You have to level up three times.

1597
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,280
You have to raise your acrobatic stat by jumping up in place.

1598
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,480
You have to collect 15 turtle shells.

1599
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:46,480
There are seven puzzle pieces.

1600
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,480
When you collect them, you'll get to the next level.

1601
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,480
Find the location of this painting.

1602
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:54,480
Find where in the game this photograph was taken from.

1603
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:57,480
Spot six differences in this photo.

1604
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,780
Like seven daffodils so you can make a new potion.

1605
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:01,780
Here's what it is.

1606
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,280
Here's what you'll need to do.

1607
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,780
In two days time,

1608
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,280
Leo's Thunderland opens once again.

1609
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:13,280
There will be a celebration of sorts.

1610
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,780
And there will be an address made by Gumby.

1611
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:19,280
You will kill him in front of everyone.

1612
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,780
I will have Patrick Yoda, member of Sullivan's Angels,

1613
01:04:22,780 --> 01:04:26,780
murder a war hero in front of the entire space station.

1614
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,680
You will then be brought to the brig. You will be put up for execution

1615
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,560
And it is here that I will free you

1616
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:36,900
Grant you immunity. Oh if I'm free then yeah, I don't care

1617
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:41,760
And since my research will be concluded by then I will reveal the location of your nephew

1618
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,140
Okay done

1619
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,140
Okay, you trust me?

1620
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:50,400
No, but I'm gonna do it anyway cuz I'm bored of your talking I

1621
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,520
respect that and

1622
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:58,760
And next time, we will have you go join up with the guys

1623
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,100
with your new mission of murdering a general

1624
01:05:01,100 --> 01:05:02,880
in front of everyone.

1625
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:03,860
- And it will be easy.

1626
01:05:03,860 --> 01:05:06,640
- And you guys will enter the Greech's glare.

1627
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,480
- The Greech's glare.

1628
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,740
- The dojo.

1629
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:09,580
- Greech's green.

1630
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:10,840
- Yeah.

1631
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:11,680
- Okay.

1632
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,420
- The snake pit.

1633
01:05:13,420 --> 01:05:14,260
- Cool.

1634
01:05:14,260 --> 01:05:15,080
- Okay, bye.

1635
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:15,920
- Bye.

1636
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:16,760
- Bye.

1637
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,340
(upbeat music)

1638
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,920
(upbeat music)

1639
