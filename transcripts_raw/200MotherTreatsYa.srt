1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:11,800
Get a clap this Patrick isn't here

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:18,520
Your fail blog moment was caught in 4k my friend was not even caught on camera

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,760
It was a bit caught you slipped and you fell I tripped I tripped over a cord because there's the cable management here

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,200
It leaves much to be desired

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,200
That is actually true as fuck.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,200
Guys, we've solved the sinking issue.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
We had it solved when you were gone.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
We had the exact same solution.

10
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,200
And it was fine. We just rolled along.

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,200
We paid Jubio to play video games for an hour.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,200
He needs to get a pay cut in his paycheck.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
I agree.

14
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
I agree.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,200
I think we are going to, I think, maybe shave off

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Just get rid of him.

17
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,200
shave off 33% of his income.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,980
income. I asked him the other day, I was like, what are you going to do one day when you're

19
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,500
not the editor of our podcast or our medium sized podcast? And he said, I'm just going

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,780
to not think about that. I was like, that's probably a really good way to abuse your brain

21
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,340
and think about your life. Guys, it's our 200th. It's our 200th premium. But more than

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:18,700
that, I'm in the best mood of my life. I'm glad that we kind of set up. We had a little

23
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,100
arc setting up to the 200th premium where we're all different combinations of each other. And

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,060
We're all separate and lonely and now that we're all back together it kind of feels triumphant

25
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,060
and brand new.

26
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,060
It feels good.

27
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,300
We haven't been all three of us together in so fucking long, man.

28
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,300
It's been a minute.

29
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,540
Feels so good to be with you guys.

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,500
Especially because I just did a sold out show in Mansfield, Pennsylvania.

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Oh yeah.

32
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,980
At Commonwealth University of Mansfield.

33
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:44,420
Guys, this was one of the best.

34
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,900
If you were thinking of doing stand up comedy, I recommend a great place to get started is

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,180
is the hut at the Commonwealth University at Mansfield. This is one of the greatest venues

36
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,800
I've ever been to in my life. Yeah, this was an amazing show and I remember I texted you

37
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,020
guys. I said there's only four people here. There's four people for freshman people just

38
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,900
came in because it's the first week of class and they don't know what to do with their

39
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:11,780
time. I thought it was a class, but then the classes must have got out or something because

40
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,800
here came on one more person who ran it, and so there was five people. It was five freshmen

41
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,660
and I was we were doing comedy for five people in a giant room. Yeah, and I was realizing

42
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:30,120
like oh, I remember stuff like this the my first week of college that I just will remember

43
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,580
forever. So these five kids basically high schoolers the rest of their lives. I'll be

44
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,680
like yeah with my first week of college. I saw a show. I was the only person in the audience

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,760
at a stand-up show that ball guy kept trying to do crowd work with me for 30 minutes straight.

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,100
Yeah, what if you do crap? Well, they're younger than me. So I asked him if they liked fortnight

47
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,840
and they clapped. I asked them if they like germ and one of them was like one

48
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,800
of them was like, Oh, yeah, the streamer

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
and I was like, yeah, yeah, the streamer guys.

50
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,600
Oh, no, it was really awesome and then so we thought what we thought that it

51
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,360
was five people who came by their own on their own volition and then afterwards

52
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,840
one of the guys was like, Hey, can I take a photo of you guys for the school

53
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,800
paper and we were like wait, did you just come because you got a school paper

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,320
assignment? He said yeah,

55
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,120
yeah, I really didn't want to come

56
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,480
Was he a fan, though? Did you make a fan out of him?

57
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,040
I think I made a fan out of all five of these people.

58
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,040
That's great.

59
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,040
I think this was --

60
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
Maybe they're listening right now.

61
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,160
Maybe they found you. They found the Patreon. They went up.

62
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,160
Immediately subscribed.

63
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,320
Immediately subscribed. I need to see more of this guy.

64
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,320
I mean, they loved me.

65
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,720
I've consumed all 300 episodes of the free stuff in this past week.

66
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,720
Yeah.

67
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,720
I need in. Let me in.

68
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,080
Neil did say something crazy after the show.

69
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080
Yeah.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,600
He said to me, he said, "You had a really good set."

71
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
that.

72
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:50,700
What are you talking about, man? Yeah, there was it was just me. It was a

73
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,300
dinner party. Yeah. Did you guys have dinner together? We tried to. We tried to

74
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:56,720
go to Lambs Creek, the

75
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,480
restaurant across from the hotel. Where I've never- I wish Julio was here just

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,240
to show us what- It's near Scranton. You don't know Lambs Creek? Okay. Lambs

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:09,960
Creek is a restaurant across from the Quentin Inn in Mansfield, Pennsylvania,

78
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,440
And we got a reverse recommendation because the guy said that Hannibal Buress went there

79
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,720
and he really didn't like the chicken wings. And apparently he did some whole rant about

80
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,720
the chicken wings.

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,720
Oh, it's famous.

82
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,560
Lamb's Creek, some famous rant.

83
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,160
They have a printout of the standup shot on the wall.

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,280
Yes, yeah. Right there at Lamb's Creek. And so we went over to Lamb's Creek and we were

85
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,480
like, well, let's have a delicious meal at Lamb's Creek and maybe some funny chicken

86
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,160
wings. Guys, Lamb's Creek closes at 8 p.m.

87
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,320
Jesus. Yep. Lamb this whole city shuts down. We ended up going to a sheets.

88
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Jesus Christ. And apparently in Pennsylvania, they have a problem with

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,680
drinking in Pennsylvania. So you can only buy one. You know, only by one six

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,400
pack of beer at a time. But me and Neil wanted two different kinds of beers. So

91
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,440
I bought one and the guy said, these got to be in separate transactions. And I

92
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,640
was like, what? Okay, so I just walked back in with the I left one six pack

93
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,920
there and walked back in line with the other six pack. And I get the friends

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,320
he's like, "Listen, you have to take the beer out of the store. It's not my rule.

95
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,420
It's some fucking gay law." I was like, "What?" He's like, "Yeah, it's just gay

96
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,420
ass law they passed."

97
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,880
I'm like, "Pennsylvania's awesome, man." Yeah, dude. I was in Pittsburgh, and

98
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,280
there was... Pittsburgh is sick. I love Pittsburgh. We stopped in, I think it

99
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,720
was on the way there, we stopped and I think it was called Hamburger. It was

100
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,640
either Hamburger or Harrisburg. There was a burg in it. There's a Harrisburg,

101
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,400
for that. It was not Harrisburg. He knew it wasn't hamburger. No, no, no, no,

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,760
making this up. It was not

103
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,400
let me guess. It was next to hot dog. It was not. It was not Harrisburg.

104
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,080
Harrisburg is close in a bun to I was in bun

105
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:56,100
Philadelphia. I was in lettuce, PA doing a show. I'm pretty sure it was

106
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,700
Hamburg. So you stopped in there. There's a gas station, their gas station,

107
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,700
some of them, this gas station, full slot machines in the back. Yeah, every

108
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:12,160
developed state has slot machines and gas stations, except for this fucking, these bumfuck northern

109
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,420
states. These bumfuck northern states don't have gas stations. Like New York City doesn't

110
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,560
have any gas stations. I've never seen a gas station in New York City. I've never seen

111
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,280
one. Guys, we have in the south, everybody has their favorite gas station. For me, it's

112
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,580
kangaroo now called that's an animal.

113
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,780
Nope.

114
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,580
No, no, no.

115
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,780
It's called kangaroo.

116
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,880
It's a gas station.

117
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,360
I also like love love gas station just because that's an

118
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,180
amazing name.

119
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,480
Sheets is way up there.

120
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,480
Sheets is good.

121
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,460
Sheets is just wah-wah, but it doesn't have the reverse

122
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,880
feng shui that Cameron doesn't like about wah-wah.

123
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,860
Well, it's well, you know, there's a novelty to being able

124
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,460
to go into a place that with a name that everyone talks about

125
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:56,980
but yeah, you don't want to be stressed while you do it.

126
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,280
and it's called Wawa. Talking about Wawa? Yeah. Yeah, Wawa does have something

127
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,000
really, really wrong with it. And it's called Wawa. Yeah, I think my favorite

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,160
gas station is probably Shell.

129
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,760
Shell is good.

130
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:12,800
Shell has... There's not much food in there. The thing that I do... No, that's

131
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,880
why I like it. The thing that sucks... I like the gas. The hungry type.

132
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,360
The gas is maybe a better price. Yeah. The thing that sucks about living in

133
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,120
New York City is we don't get those combination... Like gas station...

134
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,720
combination the gas stations aren't restaurants here like they are down

135
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,880
south. We have more restaurants yeah, but I would trade. I would trade any

136
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,200
fuck

137
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,560
anyone, but okay, fucking bodega, the New York boat is the gas stations are

138
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
going to get in the south.

139
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,880
Yeah, the gas station for a human because you need food fooled yeah, but

140
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,720
you don't they don't have the soda machines in the bodega. They don't have

141
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,040
like the frost because they have them on tap yeah, man. I want soda on tap

142
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,280
and every bodega

143
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,280
I want the big gulp machines. Every single 7-Eleven in New York is in

144
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,880
like Manhattan or something. Actually there's one a little bit down the road.

145
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:08,480
I should start going there more. I was in Boston and I went to Salisbury Beach

146
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,180
and a man died. Wait what? You didn't tell us about this. This is like him

147
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,480
getting hit by a car and he didn't tell me. Who died? Some man. I wasn't hit by a

148
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,680
car. I was hit by an Uber Eats driver. So we're pulling up to the beach and

149
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,460
and it's pretty it's a hot day Labor Day weekend. You know, it's where like oh, it's going to

150
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:29,240
be packed. Yeah, we're pulling up. There's no traffic pulling into the beach, but going

151
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,640
out its bumper to bumper for like a mile and we're going what the heck do they close the

152
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:37,840
beach we get there the beach isn't closed. We go in and we're about to swim in the water

153
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,480
and the lifeguard comes over and blows her whistle at us. You can't go in the water.

154
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,860
Yes, the waves are too big. The waves are pretty big. He died from a wave. So we go

155
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,640
back up to the beach. We're sitting around for a while. Then this other lifeguard, you

156
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,740
you know, they drive their cars across the beach. Sometimes, yes, the prime

157
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,320
lifeguards, they're so smug bosses. They go across the beach in the car. He pulls

158
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,040
over in the car.

159
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,320
My mom goes over to talk to him. We'll be like, what's going on? And she's

160
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,080
talking to him. She's like, why aren't you letting people in the water? And

161
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:07,880
he's like, yeah, we had a pretty serious incident actually just very recently. A

162
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:12,320
man went into the water and he went under a wave and his heart stopped. Oh,

163
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,280
don't blame the man and then he said, and then he went like this. Oh, I

164
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,480
shouldn't have told you that. Whoa. And you got told this by an elite lifeguard?

165
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,160
Yeah, one of the car lifeguards. One of the elites. You know, he was feeling

166
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,480
left out that he couldn't blow the whistle like everyone else was. He probably

167
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,520
feels bad that it was his fault. He didn't get to blow the whistle, so he's

168
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,760
just going around just for the attention. Yeah, they didn't save the guy.

169
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,520
For the attention. He was just going up to people like, "Yeah, no, apparently

170
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,840
one of these waves killed this..." Yeah. Oh, no. Apparently some vaccinated man

171
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,640
went into the ocean and immediately had a heart attack and died. Yeah, it's

172
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,840
it's funny to be driving up to a beach and see a big crowd of people be like,

173
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,080
oh man, they must have closed in front of everybody in that line. So somebody

174
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,360
die

175
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,600
yeah, you guys ever seen somebody die right in front of you, watch the life,

176
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,080
leave their face. No, I thought I did a couple of times, but I think they were

177
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:06,160
alive. I mean, I thought I thought I did a homeless guy sleep dead. Yeah, I've

178
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,760
seen so I've seen some guys around New York who are asleep with their head on

179
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,320
a rock as a pillow. Yeah, and I think that guy has to be dead, but I come back

180
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,400
thing he's gone. He's just a got cleaned up or he

181
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:22,960
talked to got clean. He's a sin. I was New York is full of these cynics

182
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:26,440
walking around cynics. I don't care. I would say they're imagineers. They're

183
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,780
kind of one of the Disney type, but they're having a big imagine. They're

184
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,880
imagining pillows that they're like. Oh, let me let me roll over in my big

185
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,020
puffy bed. There is a guy bed. The four posters of my bed are these four

186
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,680
skyscrapers. Have you seen the four billboards of times square? The biggest

187
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,880
bed in the world. Have you seen my room is the world? Have you seen the guy

188
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,640
who's the old guy who sometimes he's out here in a hospital gown? Yes, and he

189
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,160
just babbles to himself all day. Yes, he just goes like he I saw him getting an

190
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,360
arm hangs out around my house, the air the other day over there in Ridgewood.

191
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,200
He was going to air of Ridgewood, the air is the air in Ridgewood. You should be

192
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,360
careful. It's very rude

193
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,600
and he speaks simlish is his first language and he's like screaming and

194
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
doing karate at the air and stuff, and I walk by these people and I say I like

195
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,640
living here. Yeah, this is a good thing to have. It gives me a sense of

196
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
perspective on

197
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,280
on my magic in the world. Yeah, well, this guy's right. There's so much magic

198
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,600
in the world, and some people have

199
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,520
have had a curse befall upon them. Yeah, some people have been bewitched. This

200
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:35,000
guy was actually bewitched. This guy is bewitched. His tongue. I think he was a

201
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,540
doctor. You think he was a doctor because he wears scrubs sometimes?

202
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,600
I think he gets taken to the hospital and then leaves. When I first saw him, I thought,

203
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:49,120
"Oh, he's pretending to be a doctor." I thought he was walking around the neighborhood

204
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,480
pretending to be a doctor. Buddy, you are as sharp as any tool in the shed. When I see

205
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,240
people in scrubs and they're on the train going to or from work, I'm like, "Get a fucking

206
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,680
hold of yourself and change when you get to work and change before you leave work." I

207
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,180
I don't give a fuck, man.

208
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,360
Oh, you want me to put, what am I supposed to put a blue, a purple heart on your lapel?

209
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,520
You mop up brain juice from the ground?

210
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,140
The people who wear the scrubs.

211
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:14,480
You wouldn't be wearing scrubs if you were a doctor.

212
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,500
If you wear the scrubs on the train,

213
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,200
if you wear scrubs on the train, guess what?

214
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,220
I'm going to scrub you.

215
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,580
Yeah, they're going to have to scrub me off of you.

216
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm going to be on you like germs.

217
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,760
They're going to have to scrub my brains off of you,

218
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,860
because I'm going to blow my head off in your direction and ruin your day.

219
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,820
the reason they call them scrubs. Yeah, because scrubs wear them that oh that's

220
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,920
right. Yeah, they call them grunts yeah, and that's why they call them lab goats

221
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,500
yeah, because only the goats wear them. So yeah, two or three scrubs. I mean

222
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:47,040
there's J D and Turk. I think they're heard to me that's turd and turd and D

223
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,840
D D do

224
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,800
and smelly it

225
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,160
and a janitor yeah and and

226
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,920
fartla. My doctor did another bad thing. Your doctor did another doctor did

227
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,880
another bad thing. I need to know tell me about this bad. I got an email that

228
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,320
says you you have an appointment for a new test.

229
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,280
I didn't make this appointment. God yeah, I never was told about I don't

230
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,400
even know what it's for. It was a it's a heart test. I don't need a heart test.

231
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,820
I'm tickers fine. I'm seventeen years old. Yeah, I have a I have a healthy

232
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:26,260
heart rate and low blood pressure. Yep, very low blood pressure and a very low

233
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:30,200
heart rate. I don't need a stress test. I get this email that says you've been

234
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:34,500
struggling stress, scheduled for a stress test. I messaged my doctor on my

235
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,200
chart. I say what the hell is this? Well, I don't what the hell is this all,

236
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,060
but said what I was pretty rude. I was like excuse me. I did not make this

237
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:44,740
appointment. I was never told about it. Please explain what this is and why I

238
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,100
need it, and she said there's a stress test and it's scheduled for this day and

239
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,400
this time. You know you don't have to go. I know I cancelled it, but I just it

240
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,820
pissed me off man. You don't have to charge me a bunch of money for not

241
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:59,820
showing up to yeah. It's so fucked yeah. Why would you schedule me and then

242
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,500
don't even explain what it is yeah. I got a message from my dentist that said

243
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,020
the headline was use it or lose it. You got a newspaper from your headline. It

244
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:16,160
was our subject. I mean and the headline the headline of the thing they're

245
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,920
interchangeable. It doesn't make any difference. Use it or lose it.

246
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,260
And then it said that I had a coupon from them. And then I realized,

247
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,900
like, "Oh, yeah, that's why they wanted to put a fucking crown and do a

248
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,220
root canal so quick."

249
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,500
These doctors, they're thinking about money every second of their life.

250
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,060
Dentists actually do. Dentists and doctors. Well, doctors too.

251
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,740
Someone will tell you, someone who's in your life who lives with you will

252
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,200
tell you something. When you're complaining about your doctor giving you

253
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:48,340
test for no reason. Some random person who lives with you, who you spend your

254
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:51,480
life with, will tell you things like, "The doctor doesn't think about money. It's

255
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,360
not their responsibility. You have to ask them about the money." This is what?

256
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,260
No, the doctor's trying to drain my wallet. The doctor literally only cares

257
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:01,780
about the money. My weird insurance is listed in the doctor's system as no

258
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,280
insurance, and the insurance pays for it, most of it. I still have to pay a lot

259
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,180
of money when I do this stuff, but I know the doctor's going into my file and

260
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,940
pulling up and see, "Oh, here's someone with no insurance. Let me schedule them

261
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:14,660
a test on a day that they can't do, well, that they could do, but they are saying

262
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,080
that they can't do to suspect the doctor. I need you to be listen.

263
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:22,020
You're popping off on doctors. I need you to turn it up to eleven. These

264
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,200
doctors, these doctors are not getting it hard enough for me and my friend

265
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,580
stand it man. I really you could treat this. You could treat this episode and

266
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:33,960
every other episode. I've talked about my doctor as evidence in court yeah in

267
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,660
the future, and you know what they would probably that's a hard. I'm going to go

268
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,160
there. I'm going to use it as evidence because you're going to kill you. I've

269
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,500
been thinking about this shit with your and I've been I've been listen. I've

270
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm fighting back against my doctor in the only ways I know how which are

271
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,480
skewering, cancelling appointments, skewering on my podcast,

272
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,000
being slightly rude in the exam room, yeah,

273
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,560
not giving her my vaccine records for months and months, no and saying I have

274
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,400
them somewhere. I have to find them and she says okay, you need to bring those

275
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,920
and I say okay, I'll bring them next time, not and then I don't even look for

276
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,120
no no who cares where these are. No, these doctors need to be in prison, but

277
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,760
yes, here's how sneaky these doctors are. They know legal loopholes, because what

278
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:16,600
do doctors, what are all of if you if there's a group of people and half of

279
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,320
them are doctors, what are the other half patients very close crap pieces

280
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:28,000
very well, yes, receptionist, lawyers, oh shit guys, there is nobody worse than

281
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,880
lawyers, lawyers and blondes are at the very, very bottom of my pyramid. Yep,

282
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,280
he's not really blonde, he's got like a dirty blonde. I'm not blonde at all.

283
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,620
he's got you guys only think I'm blonde because I was M and M in my life when

284
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:40,760
you

285
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,120
yeah, you're not blind even a little bit. I'm not even close to

286
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,480
hair. You guys always

287
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,920
I think of you as a beautiful blonde. I think of beautiful blonde with my

288
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,120
eyebrow was turning blonde. Yeah, that you should go to the doctor. I got it

289
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,720
late in life. All right, here's here's my problem with lawyers. Okay, what

290
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,760
I go man. Oh, you might actually have been I might actually have late in

291
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,760
life. What happens late in life, end of life, you might have your adult onset.

292
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,440
I googled blondness and eyebrow and there's no results. I'm telling you

293
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,960
ocean. Yeah, I'm not going to get a blonde splotches on my skin. I don't

294
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,080
want to be blonde skinned. Yeah, you have blonde. Vito Lago would not show

295
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,680
up on your body. Not yours. You have whiteness. No, no, you I don't think

296
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,600
you have to let go at all. Now that I'm thinking about it, the thing with

297
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,160
lawyers. Okay, is that they have invented... Have you been dealing with

298
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,080
one lately? What's going on? No, no, maybe I should. I thought you were

299
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,440
going to. Yeah, I know. For our war. For our trash war. Oh, right, yeah.

300
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,580
Guys, if you know of a lawyer who works completely free... Trash law. To

301
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,740
help in trash law,

302
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,500
let me know.

303
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Because we have a trash lawsuit on our hands. We have a huge trash law

304
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,380
problem. It's gonna be... It's gonna go to the Supreme Court. Have they been

305
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,420
calling you? No, they said they were gonna talk to me and they never called

306
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,160
me. There's so much that has happened in the past couple of weeks that we

307
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,040
have not been together to talk about. I know it's very upsetting. It is very crazy. But

308
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:09,040
here's a lobster roll. And it was expensive I bet, market price. Yeah, I bet it was close

309
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:15,360
to $24. My mom's treat. Whoa! Apparently. Mother's treat. Mother's treat. Mother's treat-treat-sa.

310
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:24,320
Wow! Oh my God. Lobster roll, mother's treat. Mother-treat-sa. Okay. Mother treats. Mother

311
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,960
treats. Mother is treats ya. Mother treats ya. Poorly. Mother treats ya. That was easy.

312
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,800
treats a kid poorly does not buy him any. Is it true that Mother Teresa is very

313
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,800
swordly? Is it true that Mother Teresa took all the blood out of people? Yes.

314
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,840
And made them eat their own shit? She would make people see she thought she

315
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,520
was a scientist towards the ends of her life. Is it true that she did

316
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,680
experiments on twins? Yes. She would pray experiments? The experiments would be

317
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,320
though she would pray for one of the kids. Did you guys have a lot of...

318
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,560
Here's a question I have. Do you guys, this is something I was talking about

319
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,400
about with my family while I was home. Did you guys have a bunch of twins in

320
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,280
your school? Yeah. How many? I had like... Probably around five.

321
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:07,660
Two pairs. Yeah, 'cause I feel like we had an abnormally high... Is that

322
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,720
normal to have five pairs of twins? We had triplets and twins. That's hella...

323
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,120
How many? Triplets? There were one group of triplets and then probably...

324
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,260
And then I think four to five to six groups of twins. Yeah, there was...

325
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,600
And by groups, I mean pairs. Yeah, that's around the same

326
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,440
as my school, so maybe... I don't know, yeah, but...

327
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,440
(burp)

328
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,440
Excuse me?

329
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,720
So I'm just curious of everyone how many twins they knew growing up.

330
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,480
Put a twins counter in the comments.

331
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,620
I knew one pair, Heather and Hunter.

332
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,940
And they were two blonde bombshells who loved surfing.

333
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,680
I wish I could tell you about the funny ass twins that went to my school without...

334
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,920
Completely doxing them?

335
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,760
Yeah, because the funny thing about them is their first and last names.

336
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,280
They were called...

337
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,800
Thing 1 and Thing 2, guys.

338
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,160
I swear to God.

339
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:59,620
Wow, well, the why would you name your first name, but different last names

340
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:04,660
that is really fucking scary. I told you guys about it. There's two two separate

341
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:11,660
students in my high school who were both named Seamus Rio. Whoa, really and in the

342
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:17,600
in the year book, they had to Rio Rio Rio, and they had to differentiate them by

343
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,240
their middle. They were French and Irish, Irish from and they weren't related at

344
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,240
No, not even people would ask them.

345
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,240
But did they look like twins?

346
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,240
No, they didn't look alike at all. One of them was like really small.

347
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,240
That size has no impact on look.

348
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,240
And then in the facial area they were completely different.

349
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,240
But why would they be twins if they had the same first name?

350
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Wasn't that show that was about little people called My Little Life or whatever?

351
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
Little People Big World.

352
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Wasn't there a set of twins where one of them was a giant football player and one of them was a small one?

353
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,440
yes, that twins can be anything different. They don't even have to be

354
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,480
related. It's called fraternal. Yeah, there can be even be for parents if

355
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,920
they're close.

356
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:01,480
If you're close enough friends and you have a half brother,

357
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,520
there's a kid that I just convinced myself was my cousin that I was good

358
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,760
friends with and I because he said that he had an aunt in Florida and I said,

359
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,680
"I have an aunt in Florida," and we decided it was the same aunt.

360
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:16,160
I never believed when kids at school said that they were cousins. Yeah.

361
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,320
My cousin... I was like, "You guys are fucking lying. You just have the

362
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:25,320
same last name. I grew up next to both of my cousins and my cousin was like, my cousin

363
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:32,920
who is now a police officer was a star football player and then my other cousin, my cousin

364
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:39,960
Rob was, my cousin Robby is 6 foot 5, my cousin Tim is 6 foot 8 and no one believed that we

365
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,960
were related at all. I bet the police cousin has a problem with this guy, his name is Rob.

366
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:54,080
actually fucked up. Yeah, one guy named cop and one named Rob way. Yeah, two guys

367
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,280
said they were cousins and then someone's like, you know, they're not

368
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,440
actually cousins. I think people would say that

369
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,120
people would be like, I don't believe that gossip about people would gossip

370
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,360
about the same last name, though. These two guys, we did last night. We didn't

371
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,080
have the same. Are these guys handsome to who? My cousin? Yeah, I mean, they're

372
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,840
my cousins. I'm not going to talk bad about them. So they're ugly. So they're

373
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,840
They're not heads, they're weird.

374
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,840
They're fucking ugly.

375
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,840
I can't believe you opened with I'm not going to talk bad about them.

376
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,840
You just said they're tall.

377
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
You said they're ugly tall guys.

378
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,840
You said their names.

379
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,840
He called them troll ogre cyclopses.

380
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
They're hulking over me and it scares me.

381
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,840
The Hulk is not known for his good looks.

382
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,840
One for me is a nerd and one for me is a giant monster.

383
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,840
He's the wrong color.

384
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,840
Why am I talking shit about my cousin's looks?

385
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,840
I don't know.

386
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,840
I thought that would be funny and it wasn't.

387
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,040
But yeah, I've never seen these guys. I never will.

388
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
I think you have.

389
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,040
I'm going to see them.

390
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,040
I've never seen these fools.

391
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,040
I'm seeing them this weekend.

392
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,040
You've never met them. You could meet them. I don't think I've met you.

393
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
I'm working on meeting them.

394
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:57,400
Guys, I learned... Okay. So back to law. I learned about something called a plea deal.

395
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
Do you know about plea deals?

396
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Yes.

397
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
It's what we're asked to be free.

398
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,000
How is this a part of our legal system? A plea deal?

399
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Wait, what is it?

400
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
A plea deal is...

401
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Explain it.

402
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,240
Watching the Tory Lanez case, is that what this is?

403
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,100
I just saw a news story about that. Yeah. And I was like, "Wait, this plea deal shit

404
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,500
it makes no sense. Say you murder somebody and they're like can I go?

405
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,580
Well, it's literally you're like you're like yeah, I murder or they're like you

406
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,300
murdered this person and you say no and they say okay life in prison, but if you

407
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:27,740
murder them and they say you murder this person, you go yep. I murdered him. They

408
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:33,260
go fifteen years, fifteen years, and then you can say please can I have

409
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:37,060
you're being honest actually, please yeah. Why is honesty? Why is the best

410
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,500
policy half of a

411
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,540
I already answered right there. Honesty is the best policy and our

412
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:46,040
country's policies are all the best.

413
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,340
I don't understand why this makes any sense at all.

414
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,640
I think we kind of need to tear down the whole legal system and

415
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,940
rebuild it from the ground up.

416
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,440
Or at least get rid of this plea deal shit, man.

417
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,940
Yeah, maybe we just get rid of that actually.

418
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,640
And there's no way you're saving so much money on like the court

419
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,740
case or whatever that it's like somehow squaring out.

420
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,940
I mean, I think we can cut the jury. Twelve people.

421
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,340
one guy. One guy. Yeah, because if you think about how many people are

422
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,780
getting jury duty, they're getting live, their lives ruined. They have to

423
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,220
take time off work, which they like doing. They can't go to see this

424
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,780
stand up show, which is probably why your show was so poorly attended.

425
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,740
Those kids probably all... Everyone turned 18 and had to go to jury duty.

426
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:27,240
I got a jury duty notice when I turned 18, basically, right after.

427
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,780
Did you go? No, I completely ignored it. I didn't even go. And I went

428
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,940
in there, it was

429
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,900
a case about a child being molested.

430
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,900
So how did you get out of it? They didn't let me.

431
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,100
just one look at you. They let me you

432
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,440
you

433
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,540
said, sorry, wait, no, I was waiting there all day. They come out. They say

434
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,400
Cameron Fetter go home. You walked in and they were the

435
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,660
start for two weeks.

436
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,980
No, they just had I said

437
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,420
you were the

438
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,540
listen. I'll tell you and I listen. Maybe this is related. Maybe I'm going

439
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,180
to be completely honest with you right now. I was sitting there six hours

440
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:10,620
waiting all day for them to see me like a so I could plead my case or plead my

441
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,920
case to be that on the jury. You wanted to be on the door to put this piece of

442
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,080
shit away. It sounds like you got quitted for child molestation. The way

443
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,140
you're telling this, I got acquitted. I wouldn't be dancing around it. I'd be

444
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,920
proud. You'd be very proud.

445
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,600
That's a good point sitting there all day and that court courthouse and I was

446
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:32,780
sticking it to them. Yeah, you know how oh yeah, I was head. I had open. I got

447
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:37,820
my phone out. I got his phone out and he he you know I have my ear buds in it was

448
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,120
like I beer, but it was

449
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,060
the camera has called

450
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:46,060
ear buds in and he comes out of it.

451
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,140
From the

452
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,380
comes out

453
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:56,660
chopo trap house wow. So they said we ordered episode. Oh, they said this

454
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:00,880
left the weight out of here. I was probably the episode in advance. That's

455
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,060
smart listen to it all at the

456
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,260
courthouse. I was going to say

457
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,300
you downloaded that episode on

458
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,640
the Wi-Fi and immediately they

459
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,140
were like, okay, we've said

460
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,700
we've detected a download.

461
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,620
That's what I'm saying. They

462
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,580
were looking over my shoulder.

463
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,820
They said this guy knows all

464
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:13,860
the tricks. This guy thinks

465
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,620
he's going to run circles

466
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,740
around. This is he's he's too

467
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,020
big of a genius to be in this

468
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,540
jury. He's going to outsmart

469
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,860
everybody. The whole case.

470
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,620
This guy's so genius he thinks

471
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,620
the CIA is bad. No, I really I

472
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,940
did get to jury duty and I was

473
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,980
so like, okay, this could be

474
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,980
inter, like, you know, it's not

475
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,300
like I'm doing anything with my

476
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:33,700
time right now. It'll be fun to be on a case and see how this works and

477
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,040
whatever, and I get into you know like oh yeah, it's a part of the jury. Wow

478
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,780
I'm a child, I'm barely an adult.

479
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,360
It's a brave new world and I get in there and it's a guy sitting there and

480
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,520
they're like so this case is this guy had molested a child. It's like oh yeah,

481
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,840
I want to go home yeah. I don't really want to be here anymore. Yeah, you

482
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,600
just started crying. You dress you dress. I just remember just being

483
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,700
completely like wow, this is crazy. I'm really here. This is so weird. Oh,

484
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,340
it's actually crime is actually

485
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:09,700
does not pay. I'm completely racist. Excuse me from I think that then I

486
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,240
think that actually works. I think yeah, we'll do that all the time. I was

487
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,780
gonna do that. I was gonna do the thing because I at that point I didn't. I was

488
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:20,020
gonna say like yeah, he's I can't abide a child molester and he's completely

489
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,060
guilty in my eyes, even without the fact yeah, have you? I feel I would not

490
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,260
listen to any single. What I would say I would say yeah, honestly, I already made

491
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,640
my mind up if you yeah. If you want to get out of jury duty, there's a million

492
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,840
ways you can do that. It's everyone always has with racist, but what if you

493
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,840
go the opposite way? How do you get? How do you? I can't wait to learn the fact

494
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,340
maybe dress up like Sherlock Holmes. Yeah, you're like yeah, you say I know

495
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,820
the whole point is you're not supposed to even be able to think about if you

496
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:49,440
could be guilty or innocent before the trial begins. So you don't want to be

497
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,000
Sherlock Holmes because they'll be like this guy already knows, but if you're

498
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,100
finding clues, well, that's you're not supposed to get out of it. They don't

499
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,820
want you to find clues. Why they don't want to see my literally why they want

500
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:04,280
you to be a blob who looks at who follows along with the lawyer and thinks,

501
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:08,860
oh, I like this lawyer. I like this lawyer, yeah, so it's a way that our

502
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:13,320
system works is it's literally the olympics. It is the olympics for lawyers

503
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,160
and was to hold on. Yes or no on your little card. Yes, he molested the kid.

504
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,360
No, the kid's lying. No, this four year old's lying. Yeah, yeah, four year old

505
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,440
he's learned about lying in Bible school. He said I'm going to do that to a very

506
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,060
I'm going to mail man. He said I want to sin yeah yeah this is I'm going to sin

507
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:34,540
against this weird looking strange fifty year old man with long limbs next to me

508
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:39,180
yep. I'm going to I remember exactly how this guy looked yeah. I mean you don't

509
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:41,660
forget a face like no, I don't I never forget a child.

510
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:47,780
Just in case, well, except for this, did you see this guy? No yeah, I remember

511
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,300
his face. I remember exactly what he looks like. He looked like this like

512
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,980
he was kind of like this. Oh, he was kind of an ass. He was ry. He had a ry smile,

513
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:59,820
yeah he was he was also laughing, but not

514
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:06,060
that's the worst yeah, but everyone always goes in to try and get out of jury

515
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,060
duty to be they're like oh, I should I should be racist. I should you know that

516
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:14,220
I think that'll get me out immediately, buddy, you got to try the exact opposite.

517
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:19,540
You got to say I love every single race and every single person unequivocally,

518
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,400
and I would not be able to find any single person guilty because I don't

519
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:23,620
think

520
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,260
I think we're just all one consciousness. Yeah. Do you think you could get out of

521
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,420
jury duty, but you know how they do like have you ever seen this person before?

522
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,420
Do you know this person? Can you be like, oh, this is crazy, but I actually

523
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,060
dreamed about this guy last night. Oh, that's Chris for my dream. Oh my God,

524
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,540
I dreamed about this guy in my dream. He killed me and his name was Chris.

525
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,540
I guess he can. His name is Brian. That's what you just say that you just say

526
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,740
yeah, that's that guy molested me. Yeah, yeah, and then you're there like,

527
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,840
well, that's but then that's the problem, because you know you see what

528
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,140
if it's not in real life and it's a case. Oh yeah, that fucking

529
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,980
well, that sets up a whole not trial speeding to molest me.

530
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:01,580
He was really late to the point. You have to be careful as you say,

531
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,920
you say molested you, they're going to start a whole nother court case that

532
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,640
you're going to have to be there the whole time, whether you're on the jury

533
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,480
or not. So what you have to say is actually I do know this guy. He

534
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,520
molested me and I don't want to press charges. He molested me and I didn't

535
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,480
care. Yeah, it didn't bother me. I didn't care. It changed my taste in

536
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,380
music. That's basically the only thing that it affected me. I like certain

537
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,480
type of movies now and I was weird characters. Also, I was eighteen yep,

538
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,420
so fully eighteen. It wasn't crazy enough to change my whole psyche and it

539
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,320
was really just we actually know I am crazy because of it. I'm crazy, sir.

540
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,840
I'm crazy. I'm sorry I can't do the job. I'm completely crazy. Oh yeah, I

541
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:39,220
guess that's what I do. Are you fit any reason you're not

542
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,320
fit to serve on the jury be like jury. This is McDonald's

543
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:52,240
McDonald's right now. Or they say, "Are you fit to serve on the jury?" You say, "Yeah,

544
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:58,440
circles a shape." And they say, "What?" And you say, "You said fit." "Yeah, I'm in shape.

545
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,480
Circles a shape." And then maybe they'd go... And I run marathons on Netflix. Do you want

546
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,640
to do warm-up for the jury? You go, "Yeah." And then you have a great job. Oh, yeah. You

547
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,320
just do a warm-up comic. You go out, you do warm-up, you're throwing out gift bags and

548
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,320
the jury. They call you so there's the bailiff and then there's also the

549
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,160
goody bag man. Yeah, that's

550
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:19,280
those are the two people in

551
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,600
first jury. Is this people go? Yeah,

552
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,560
oh my God. All right, so this man is a complete

553
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,160
bad person. Yeah,

554
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,960
I'm just kidding. I'm not allowed to say that shit. I can't say that you

555
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,260
doesn't have to be your chair. It's handcuffs. Yeah, you get to arrest him

556
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:44,000
yourself. You get to arrest. I don't want to be a police officer, but I would love

557
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,480
to arrest somebody. I'm going to be honest. Yeah, you can citizens arrest,

558
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,200
but I don't think that works. No, you can just walk away from a citizen's arrest.

559
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,320
Yeah, just say, well, that's why you get down on them.

560
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:57,840
Go down, get down on them. Just get a boogie down on these four.

561
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,160
Yeah, I'm not boogie and down.

562
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,640
There is no crime on earth that is heinous enough to warrant me boogieing down.

563
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
No, no, no.

564
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,360
Nobody wants to see my cracker ass dance.

565
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,880
Oh yeah, I'm doing the two step.

566
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,600
Maybe they'll use your dancing in Guantanamo Bay.

567
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,400
Yeah, I would get a kill for that.

568
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,280
They would show all these terrorist guys your dancing and they would confess to not living

569
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
in shit.

570
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:31,280
recently learned about this Abu Grabe situation. Guys, this was some bad news, guys.

571
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:33,280
Why?

572
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:42,280
They basically did unconsensual jackass to 50 guys who were just driver taxis.

573
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
They dressed guys up as scary things.

574
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,280
Yeah, they said, "Let's do a haunted house and let's scare ourselves."

575
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,280
So they made everybody dress up like a scarecrow.

576
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:58,120
are so crazy. Those photos of that woman who's got her thumb up next to a guy and he's got

577
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,080
jumper cables on his nutsack or something.

578
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,880
It honestly just makes you think if that's how a woman is reacting to that stuff, how

579
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:06,880
are the men?

580
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:10,280
Because men keep their emotions in.

581
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,280
Yeah, or even they like stuff like that more than women.

582
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,280
Oh yeah, true.

583
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,080
So they probably are smiling even more.

584
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,280
Yeah, you wouldn't even be able to fit the smiles in a photo.

585
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,780
The Smilers of Abu Ghraib. Yeah, it's actually really scary. It's the lady who

586
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,880
did the thumbs up. She there was like a letter that she sent her friend where

587
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,720
she was like, I basically don't even know why I'm doing all this crap. It's

588
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,880
actually really disgusting having to electric shock people's poop and then

589
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,440
she just kept doing it. Apparently, she didn't even know where she was and she

590
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,880
thought she was watching TV. Yeah, that's what I heard. Oh, that's actually a

591
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,780
pretty good excuse when you're on some kind of high, high trial. Listen,

592
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,260
they've tried all the defense they did were just following orders. It didn't

593
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,380
work. You still get in trouble. So you were say you thought you were watching

594
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:01,100
tv. We were making tv. We are making a pilot for mtv speaking of a true bass. I

595
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,700
thought we were doing a jury duty kind of thing and we these guys they didn't

596
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:09,580
know but they were about to become famous. Every single person in this room

597
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:15,020
has been is a trained actor except for the victims and james marzian comes

598
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:18,100
through and starts putting clamps on people's balls.

599
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,420
He's killing them.

600
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,100
And they're like, they don't even know who this guy is, they're from a different country,

601
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,100
they never saw Enchanted.

602
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:28,020
Well, they maybe have seen Sonic.

603
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,020
Maybe they saw Sonic.

604
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
I think good chance they've seen Sonic.

605
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,940
It's possible they saw Sonic with a watermark.

606
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,320
I wish that they took firing squads and they kept them and they kept that as the main way

607
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,300
of killing people in America, but they automated it.

608
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,380
And there was robots that did it.

609
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,380
Speaking of automated...

610
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,380
A wall of pure bullet.

611
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,380
I'm thinking of like the robots from Robocop

612
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,380
that aren't Robocop.

613
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,380
Like those things come out.

614
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,380
Speaking of automated, I learned this recently.

615
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,380
All the news channels,

616
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,380
all the news stations,

617
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,380
automated TV cameras.

618
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,380
You already told me this.

619
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,380
Why didn't you tell him? I'm telling him.

620
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,380
He listens to every episode.

621
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,380
I didn't listen to it, but I don't want to hear about the news from you.

622
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,380
Ok, then do you want to hear...

623
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:16,020
you want to okay. Did you I was in the newspaper as a kid, anyway, when for

624
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:20,540
what two days before I went on the news? No, you that's good. You weren't in the

625
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,020
newspaper.

626
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:27,780
That is not fucking. I said kid gets the most delicious cake ever on his. That

627
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:32,600
was the headline. That's pretty cool. July 4th, 19, September 11, 2001

628
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,900
kid gets most amazing birthday cake

629
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,260
for having

630
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:47,500
make a story. Wait, a little boy just had the most amazing birthday party and the cake had

631
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:53,340
three layers. Spider-Man showed up and they drew his photo on the cake. There was a man

632
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:58,140
who got his face painted as a tiger. This is a developing story coming in right now.

633
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,100
The cake from Cameron's 11th birthday party turns out to be an ice cream cake. That's

634
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:10,300
right. Wow. Fudgy the Whale made an appearance. I never had a Fudgy the Whale until recently.

635
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:13,500
we didn't have carvel down in North Carolina. We didn't have cold stone

636
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,060
creamery. We also had a very clean and these cold stone cakes, guys. I don't

637
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,460
give a fuck about that cake. I like those little cones with the chocolate

638
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,060
that are on top of the cake. That's the and the icing. Did you hear

639
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:30,980
mix ins? Did you hear dairy queen has completely? I like the mix ins do.

640
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,900
That's the only thing. Queen has completely

641
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,500
by the mix and very clean, remove the ice cream

642
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,940
cherry dip cone. Well, honestly, if they did do that recently, it didn't hurt them

643
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,960
at all because I saw a line around the block for a DQ when I was in really

644
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:50,940
really. Yeah, I thought I was a very Queen grill and chill so much. There's

645
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,980
DQs north. I wasn't in Boston. I thought Boston was a was or

646
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:00,900
Massachusetts. I know it's Baskin Robbins. No, that was really yeah. Baskin

647
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,300
Robbins was fairly recent. That was but I remember because growing up, it was

648
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,680
I remember when all the Dunkin Donuts turned into a combination of Baskin Robbins.

649
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,760
They have DQ and Stoneham and Amesbury and Haverhill.

650
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,600
Hudson, New Hampshire, Dairy Queen, Grill & Chill.

651
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:21,800
They made some really good chicken tenders with the white gravy and the toast on the

652
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,440
side.

653
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,160
The Grill & Chill is underrated.

654
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,480
I guess I just never went to an ice cream chain as a kid.

655
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,840
I just went to all the local stores.

656
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,160
I didn't go to DQ as a kid.

657
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,160
They didn't have a DQ near me. They were all more far away.

658
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Did you ever go to Moo's in Derry, New Hampshire?

659
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
No.

660
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
Oh, that was a huge...

661
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
Did you ever go to Lizzie's in Harvard Square?

662
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
Yes, I did.

663
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,160
Did you guys ever go to Coles Custard in Wilmington, North Carolina?

664
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
No.

665
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,160
Where a man found a finger in his ice cream?

666
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
No, I didn't go there.

667
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Found a finger?

668
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,160
We grew up near each other, though, so these actually make sense.

669
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,160
Mine made sense.

670
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,160
They found a finger in a man's armpit at the arcade and he was being tickled.

671
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,600
during laser tag during laser tag. You remember we went to jungle rapids. We

672
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,420
played laser tag. Yeah, I was just talking about that the to someone the

673
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,720
other day. I don't remember who, but that was you know. I think that's the

674
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,100
second time I've ever played laser tag in my life. Really was just the three of

675
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:19,180
us and we are what I was trying to remember is that we had was it just the

676
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,160
three of us. It was pierced there. It was just us three of us and it was we

677
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,580
each got code names and it was like the destroyer, the demolisher and then like

678
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,300
was the princess or some yeah. I was like or like the I think I got the

679
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:37,680
weakest one yeah. You did get a weak. I'm pretty sure it was the wizard or

680
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:42,340
something later versus the with yeah. I clapped you all up man. You did I

681
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,220
clapped you, but I was I knew the map completely was cheating. He was spawn

682
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,700
camping. I had mass knowledge. He spawned camp. I'm not going to run

683
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:54,260
around. I'm going to follow you until the the cool off. It was that makes it

684
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:58,300
we wasted money. It wasn't not wasted. Our money had way less fun. We

685
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,900
went in there twice. There was fog. Yeah, but when you're getting

686
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,500
followed by your friend to home base, it was like buddy, ask any woman

687
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,800
that lives in a major city. It's no fun to be followed. Yep, and if

688
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,600
you think differently, if you think differently, the feminists would

689
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,900
like to have a word with you. Well, I wouldn't like to have a

690
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,900
word with the feminist. I'll tell you that much. I'll have a word

691
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,500
with them. Shut up.

692
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,740
(laughter)

693
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,280
That's good.

694
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,340
S-A-D-D-A-P.

695
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,040
Shut up.

696
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:30,680
That's, to all the feminazis out there, shut up.

697
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,880
To all the feminazis, I've got a Billy Madison impression I want to do for you.

698
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,580
(laughter)

699
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,380
I want to go, "Shut up!"

700
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,380
Yep, so bad.

701
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,080
I have a couple of Cartman words that I could say to you.

702
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,880
Respect my authority.

703
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,880
I'm going to do that to you.

704
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:43,880
I'm going to do respect my authority.

705
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,580
Check this one out.

706
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,380
Check this one out.

707
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:45,880
What?

708
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,380
You are the weakest link.

709
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:47,880
(laughter)

710
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,880
That would work really well against a feminist.

711
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,280
(laughter)

712
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,040
that would be really funny, maybe some Monty Python stuff. It's not really

713
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:55,780
applicable, but

714
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:01,200
it's a silly ideology. We won't believe it. So they start saying just a

715
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,680
flesh wound. They start saying something to you. And now for something completely

716
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,400
different. I was just going to say they're trying to tell you something

717
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:10,760
about the patriarchal, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's why they don't shave

718
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,560
their freaking armpits and shave their hair blue. Yeah, they shave their hair

719
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,520
and it turns blue. They use blue shavers. I've seen this. They use blue shavers,

720
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,200
and then you look at them. You look towards the camera that you've invented

721
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,480
in your head and you say and now for something completely different.

722
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,120
And feminists, they chew too much gum.

723
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:25,920
They chew a lot of tobacco.

724
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,560
And they blow in bubbles with their gum.

725
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,680
Stop, man.

726
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,280
I'm sick of going to these parties where a feminist is there and I go to pick up

727
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,400
my drink and I take one sip, dip spit in it immediately.

728
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,480
Oh, my God.

729
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,360
It's so disgusting.

730
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:41,440
These feminists need to stop chewing Cope snuff.

731
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,760
They always want to go to the mall.

732
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,200
They're always wearing these 12 inch pumps, walking around with a little handbag

733
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,720
and a tiny purple dress.

734
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,400
shut the hell up. You're being annoying and you're chewing tobacco. Yeah, leave

735
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,380
your car at home. You don't need to drive everywhere. Yeah, these gas goes

736
00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:01,280
your guzzling. I'm sick of them guzzling up all this fucking gas with their

737
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,840
diesel powered cars, Subaru's that they're driving around. These fucking

738
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,440
fema Nazis are driving around. They're rolling coal. They're chewing tobacco

739
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,640
and catalytic converters there for a reason. And how come they always live

740
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,000
either on the east coast or the west coast or in the middle of the country

741
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,240
or another country or the Midwest. Yeah, the middle of the country. Yeah, that's

742
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,680
completely and the Midwest and then the southeast Mexico. I was getting so mad

743
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,880
earlier driving back from Pennsylvania. Five hour drive. I did today because we

744
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,320
hit traffic and I was just looking around feminist, feminist, feminist,

745
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:36,560
these giant semi trucks, there was completely destroying the environment.

746
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,840
Hey, feminists enough with the freon in your trucks. Drop them. I don't care

747
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,800
that you need to keep the produce cold and get that freon at the fucking truck.

748
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,400
We don't need the crystal meth. Keep it cold with ice. You don't have to stay up so that you can read Gloria Steinem.

749
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,900
And the hypocrisy of these feminazis where they go to these lots and they look for their little lizards.

750
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,700
Yeah. Yeah. Just get a normal pet. Get a dog. Why are you so obsessed with those lizards?

751
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,500
Why are you so obsessed with these lizards? It doesn't make any sense. It makes no goddamn sense.

752
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:12,300
When I was in Boston, we went to... Have you been on the USS Constitution? That old ship?

753
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,300
Oh, yeah. The like Navy Yard? Yeah, yeah. I just shipped my pants.

754
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:23,540
No, you didn't. Target. No. Target ad that I watched eight years ago. Oh, okay. And we

755
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:28,580
were in this guy who's giving us a tour and he's like a Navy guy in the uniform. And it's

756
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:35,220
like a, he was, he was not a Navy SEAL. I'm blue, dab it, come on. Yeah, so it's all like

757
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:41,080
a, it's an old ship, an old frigate, and there's also a battleship there. And it's an operating

758
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,580
Navy yard, so it's all people and you have to go through security. It's all operated

759
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:48,600
by like the navy. There's a people in military pretty good deal. It's pretty

760
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,540
cool. It's fun. If you're going to join the navy, you want to be stationed at a

761
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:55,760
museum, so we go. This guy is giving the tour of the of the ship and he takes us

762
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:00,400
below decks, and this is the I just imagining this. I mean this is so he was

763
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,280
he was giving the ship the tour of the ship and he was just getting like way

764
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:09,160
way too into it. Yeah, it's like and then the the British were like Huzzah

765
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:13,840
she has iron sides and he was like yelling and doing voices and stuff and

766
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,520
I was like, Oh, my God, you imagine awesome you go join the military and

767
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,560
this is and you're a reactor. Yeah, yeah, you're a yeah, you're they station

768
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,600
you here to and he's for he was from he had a Boston accent. He's like I'm

769
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,380
from Southie, so it's actually a huge honor

770
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:33,480
to be stationed here and be given the toys sick. That's amazing. I mean dude

771
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,400
he's getting health care to play games all day. It's great. It was dude. He

772
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,240
yelled so loud. It was like startled me like he was like he was like the guns,

773
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
the guns

774
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,780
like baby.

775
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:48,880
He that you know a real war was breaking out yeah. Have you guys seen those ads

776
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,300
that you get sometimes on like if you watch like a video game video on

777
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,480
YouTube or like a twitch stream where it's like the US Army? They're like we

778
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,800
need gamers now. Oh yeah, I love I used to love the

779
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,760
is that where they're putting force aim high as I always would think it says I

780
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,480
am high. That was speaking of some funny, funny shit. I didn't tell him.

781
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,440
I think that

782
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,340
yeah, I just didn't tell you guys completely about it. I told him in the

783
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,360
car the other night.

784
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,540
You guys were taking car rides. We were taking a car ride somewhere. I was

785
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:23,540
riding my bike home. We were test driving a new fucking C class, okay. It

786
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:26,120
was, yeah, we were getting a G wagon for the business. Yeah.

787
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:32,040
That'd be awesome. Why do we need a G wagon? We're getting a PPP loan.

788
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:34,560
Actually, it doesn't know cars. We're getting a PPP loan so that we can get

789
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,800
a bright blue G wagon that has an airbrushed... Why do we need a PPP loan?

790
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,520
This guy can't even spell things.

791
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:43,520
Jesus Christ.

792
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,520
They're called initials Cameron F.

793
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:47,520
Cameron F?

794
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,520
You're a fool.

795
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
Yeah, that's what the F stands for, is fool.

796
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Foolish bastard.

797
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,520
Idiot.

798
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,520
I don't have to take this.

799
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,520
You do have to take it.

800
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,520
We were driving, I think we were at

801
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,520
Neil's show.

802
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,520
We were at Neil's show on Saturday.

803
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,520
We were in the car and I casually

804
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,520
something that I thought I had told you guys immediately, but apparently didn't.

805
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:16,520
I was hit by a joyriding Uber Eats driver who had just bought an e-bike.

806
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:20,520
This is like the craziest story ever and you didn't tell me this.

807
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,520
You just mentioned this earlier and I just assumed that it was something that happened years ago.

808
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,520
No, no, no.

809
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,520
It happened weeks ago.

810
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,520
No, this happened...

811
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,520
He got hit by somebody on an e-bike and then tell the crazy part of it.

812
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,520
Oh, he was watching YouTube on his phone.

813
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:33,520
That's not the crazy deal.

814
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,520
Didn't you hear the end of the story?

815
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:40,160
The end, oh the end, okay, so he was pretending to be paralyzed in the middle of the street,

816
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,600
found out that I had no insurance, then stepped out of the ambulance, shook my hand and said,

817
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:48,040
"It's okay, bro. This has happened to me five times this year."

818
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:52,480
That's fucking, this guy tried to do insurance fraud to Patrick and he did, so it wasn't

819
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,520
just he got hit by an e-bike.

820
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,880
He got hit by me because I was making a left turn and I didn't know that he was like speeding,

821
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,040
I was on Broadway, so I didn't know he was speeding behind me.

822
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,120
He was also on a bike?

823
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,120
He was on an e-bike, yeah.

824
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,120
He was on a normal bike.

825
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,580
I don't think he was an Uber Eats driver.

826
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,580
And you hit him with enough force to send him sprawling.

827
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,580
But he was on an Eats bike.

828
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,580
To potentially paralyze him.

829
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,580
To paralyze him.

830
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,420
And then your handshake cured him.

831
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,420
Well, no.

832
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,420
He got out of the ambulance and then went out.

833
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:20,380
So once he found out that nothing was wrong with his bike and I didn't have an insurance.

834
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,380
So he called 911?

835
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,380
Yeah.

836
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,380
No, no, no, no.

837
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:24,380
They were waiting.

838
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,380
It was all a whole scam.

839
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,380
Somebody...

840
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,380
Oh my God, the ambulance was in on it.

841
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:30,740
Well, okay, now that I'm thinking about it, there was an undercover who was directly behind

842
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:31,740
us.

843
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,060
An undercover who was directly behind us and he was directing traffic.

844
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,060
An undercover what?

845
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:40,360
I saw him do this with his jacket and I saw the badge and I went like, "Oh, thank God

846
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:46,500
you're a police officer." And he went, "No, I'm a cop, but I just got off of work. I don't

847
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:52,180
want to be dealing with this right now." And then I had to move the other guy's bike and

848
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:56,860
then he said, I found out he had YouTube on his phone because I was on the --

849
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:57,860
It's pretty rare.

850
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:58,860
He was on YouTube.

851
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,860
Don't assume me, man. Look, we both have YouTube on our phone.

852
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,860
We both have similar interests. We both like videos.

853
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:09,700
like videos. He had YouTube open, so he's like laying on the ground and he says,

854
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:13,640
"You need to get my phone and you need to call my wife. You need to say

855
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:15,640
FaceTime Precious." And so

856
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,900
his wife's name was Precious. Her name and his phone. Yeah. And

857
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:25,700
I pick up his phone and, dude, it's like he's watching like Vsauce or something,

858
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,260
and I was like, "Were you-" Claims another life. "Were you watching, were

859
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,200
you watching, like, YouTube?" And he went,

860
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:39,620
YouTube music. Listening to Vsauce. Yeah, because there's no way that that was an ad

861
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:44,500
playing. An ad for Vsauce? No, I don't think so. It's a bald man with a beard talking.

862
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:51,460
I didn't see Skip Ad anywhere on the screen. See, you should have just turned heel and

863
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,780
ran for the hills because you're dealing with a genius. This guy's watching Veritasium and

864
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,620
Vsauce. He's watching Vsauce, how to do insurance fraud. My bike is fine, which is good. The

865
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:03,120
the only thing true secret behind and my bike is fine. His bike is fine.

866
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:07,360
Nothing really happened. We don't kind of paralyzed. He was pretending to be

867
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,700
paralyzed. I tried to pick up. How did the ambulance get there? The ambulance

868
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:13,920
got there because a woman who was on the side of the street called

869
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,060
and fuck also the cop called and then

870
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:23,240
yeah, then the ambulance, they got there pretty quick, which is making me think

871
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,300
maybe I was maybe the city hates bikers so much. And let me ask you a question.

872
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:33,120
trap me. Did I hear you say pray tell a little earlier that the exact words left

873
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,780
your lips. Thank God you're a police officer

874
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:41,680
in today's society. You said that. Well, I said that because then I wouldn't have

875
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:47,440
to call 911 and which you were going to do, planning to call 911.

876
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,720
The I don't wanna ever call 911. I had to call 911. We don't call the cops

877
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,300
around here. If I get hit by a car, I fucking die and kill. Leave me in this

878
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,380
We don't call the fucking cops around here, boy.

879
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:03,420
But I was I thought that I texted it to you guys and then you started reading

880
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,420
through.

881
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,880
Oh, yeah, we me and Pat read through our text for about an hour.

882
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:08,900
Yeah.

883
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,780
I mean, it's all it's all stuff that I, you know, it's all kind of shit.

884
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,860
He texts us, which I think we should get into.

885
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:18,740
I think we should get into these questions.

886
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:20,020
It's the 200th episode.

887
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,060
I think that you're reading.

888
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,060
OK, I read.

889
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:23,860
I think I forgot to read any of your questions.

890
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,020
You're let me I will say you got to you.

891
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,920
but you usually have some good ones. The ones you asked me to read the other day

892
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:33,320
were bad. What are you talking about? Read these ones. What are you talking

893
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,120
about? I like your questions and I and it's okay because I have such discerning

894
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:40,680
taste that I can tell you that I thought those ones were bad. Would you rather

895
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:48,860
would you rather meet Mugatu from Zoolander or have an OnlyFans that makes

896
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:55,500
$1000 a month? And you said I said Mugatu and then I said because I because I was

897
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,240
I don't really want to ask the follow up. What time was that at?

898
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,240
That was at 1.31pm.

899
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,240
Okay, I was probably eating lunch.

900
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,240
You were busy.

901
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:02,240
Yeah.

902
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,960
But I didn't want to ask the follow up because I was going to, I mean it hinges on do I have

903
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:07,280
to be nude for the OnlyFans?

904
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,280
Yeah.

905
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,920
I was like I guess if I even have one that it's going to be a perception that maybe I'm

906
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:11,920
nude.

907
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,120
It's also going to be a job. You're basically asking do you want a job.

908
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,120
Well, I'll just have one.

909
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,120
But a job where you're hard working.

910
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:18,840
Do you want the hardest job in the world?

911
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,560
Or just to meet Mugatu for five seconds?

912
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:23,960
A thousand dollars a month is not worth having an OnlyFans.

913
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:24,960
Definitely not.

914
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,560
Well, would you rather make a video with iDubbbz or have the most popular OnlyFans in the account?

915
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:31,560
And you said?

916
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,560
He said iFubx.

917
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,560
iFubX.

918
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:42,200
And I want to make clear that this was at 6.50am.

919
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,200
And when did I reply?

920
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,200
8.40am.

921
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:48,760
So that's probably the first thing I did when I woke up.

922
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:49,760
Most likely the first thing I did.

923
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,440
And then I asked some more questions immediately after.

924
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,440
These are the ones that I ignore.

925
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,240
So these ones are bad, you're saying?

926
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:58,000
if I remember it, let me see here. If you were running for press, I think I

927
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,780
would you rather have to be honest as you're running mate

928
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:03,740
Brendan Schaub or Ethan Klein,

929
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:10,920
you gotta say Brendan Schaub. Well, let's let's hear what Cameron says. I

930
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,940
completely was asleep for that. I said, I said, I'll ask Caleb. Oh yeah,

931
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:17,340
because this was these are questions. Oh no, you were telling me to ask these

932
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:21,660
to Caleb. Yes, for the because I was gone for the episode. Here's the kind

933
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:27,080
he texted me, "Imagine getting sloppy steaks with the driving crooner in a Dan Flashes

934
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,760
shirt." That's what he said.

935
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,480
And playing the long -- he knows eventually all these texts are going to get read out.

936
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:40,160
Yeah. And then before that, he said, "Does I look like the driving crooner?" And sent

937
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,160
a picture of him in a hat.

938
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,480
I was at a party where they had hats, and I thought I looked like the driving crooner.

939
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:50,460
Would you rather be forced to be the driving crooner for the rest of your life or go to

940
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:52,060
to prison for sexual assault.

941
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:56,660
And I said driving.

942
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:01,760
I asked him some questions on the question. He wouldn't even

943
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,860
answer. What was it? What question?

944
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,860
I answer every single hypothetical. We send to each

945
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,060
other. You did not you did not answer. What was this one?

946
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:13,160
Dark humor or absurdist humor? I said it's absurdism for me.

947
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,660
Can you say wait? No fuck. Don't do this to me, bro. Can you

948
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,360
say that? What is that?

949
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,120
you didn't answer. Can you send me a video of you saying Livvy rizzed up

950
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:23,840
baby gronk in Trump voice?

951
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,960
Big Chungus says trans rights.

952
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,120
Timmy Turner, dad and Dinka Berg was on site.

953
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Timmy Turner, dad and Dinka Berg was on... Is Mrs. Puff doable?

954
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,920
He sent me, "When I'm in a meme war and my opponent is a Death Grips fan

955
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,000
and a gift of Kevin McAllister and then two days ago or three days ago. He sent

956
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,240
me this question is mumble rap ghetto

957
00:52:54,240 --> 00:53:00,040
blue face and Creshan were toxic as F for each other.

958
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:05,180
He asked me this one to who has better style, Alex or Joe, that's a real

959
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,060
question. Is it should be answered? Is it still ghetto to sag your pants? If

960
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,040
they're skinny jeans

961
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:14,780
is random dancing cringe. Most of the...

962
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:17,780
You sent me fingering or normal penetration with penis.

963
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:20,780
(Laughter)

964
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,780
Shit, I start a street wear brand called

965
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,780
Hummingbird Fresh. And I said, kind of ripping

966
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:29,780
off H3H3. He said, how? I said, animal plus

967
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,780
fresh. He said, Teddy is not an animal. I

968
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:35,780
said, it's a bear. And he said, nah, it's not a bear.

969
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:38,780
It's a type of stuffed animal. It's not a real

970
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:43,420
animal. But if I did start a streetwear brand called Hummingbird Fresh, would you guys be

971
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,660
in the lookbook?

972
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:49,700
Can I get notes on something? I said, yeah. He sent me a self-made stand-up shot that

973
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:55,180
says, "The pandemic taught us that Joe Exotic don't give a fuck." And I said, "Do flying

974
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,180
fuck." And he edited it to say, "The pandemic taught us that Joe Exotic don't give a flying

975
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,460
fuck."

976
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:06,200
On Friday, August 11th at 4.27 p.m., he texted me, "Yankee with no brim."

977
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,500
he sent me a picture of Ian finance and said the goat. He is the goat.

978
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:16,440
He sent me on August ninth. He sent me all in a row here. Our scooters cringe

979
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,280
is peppermint cringe is rabbit movers. Cranes is the mark range is the bus

980
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,480
driver cringe is peppermint ice cream cringe and then he sent me a picture of

981
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:27,940
a bus and said should I cringe at this? I said yes, no, I don't know what that

982
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,900
is. You don't know yes, yes, yes, okay, well this one was really important.

983
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:37,120
this is the one that I was going to ask when I was gone. Okay. This is a

984
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:43,440
hypothetical scenario that I wanted you guys is opinion on is SpongeBob based or

985
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,420
cringe. That isn't the one that is the fact that Barbie and Oppenheimer

986
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:52,200
releasing at the same time did not result in a Barbie versus Oppenheimer and

987
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:55,400
instead produced a Barbie and Oppenheimer tells me that something is

988
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:57,720
healed in the world. I D. K. That was a tweet. I

989
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:00,200
just said

990
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:06,240
This is what it is. He sent me a picture of me and Pierce wearing the same outfit and said

991
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:11,320
twins boobs vibes. It was probably vibes. Wait, hold on. Can I let me, let me just ask this

992
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:18,400
question. This one I think is really important. Okay. Okay. Would you rather have to eat every

993
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:23,040
sandwich ingredient by ingredient every time you wanted a sandwich for a year? So if you

994
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:26,320
wanted a BLT, you would have to eat the bread, then the mayo, then the lettuce, then the

995
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:31,480
tomato, then the bacon, then the last slice of bread or live in poop city for

996
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,600
six months with two roommates who are pieces of poop.

997
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,400
Poop city, probably the sandwich thing. Yeah, I want to see poop city once in my

998
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,000
life. If it is it free, a Grand Canyon thing, it's not free. Oh, you have to pay

999
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,360
for the sandwich, but you have to live with them for six months, but they smell

1000
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:50,800
like fucking poop. I'm not going to I can't and it's in poop city. I don't eat

1001
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,000
that many sandwiches, so it's not that my when I do eat a sandwich as one

1002
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,660
ingredient. What compels you? Is this just like in the morning you take your

1003
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:00,820
Adderall and then you go? I don't take my Adderall, but I want, I have a lot

1004
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:05,340
of questions in the world, in the life. Well, I'm glad that it, I like the

1005
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:08,940
questions 'cause it's fun to respond, it's fun to have to respond to them

1006
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,640
'cause what I'm used to is the 2 or 3 AM ones that are just a picture,

1007
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,080
a blurry picture. Yeah. Of what? Those of whatever you're looking at in that

1008
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:22,500
moment. Yeah, you say, "Look at this." You say, "OMG." "OMG, I saw this." And

1009
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,580
it's a picture of the ground and you say wow. What do you mean

1010
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:32,100
let's see you sent him a dot. I've we have some good conversations yeah. Yeah,

1011
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:36,580
when I said when we can and I have discussions when I asked him okay, so

1012
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:42,200
we're asking are we going to Philippe and Ian's birthday? He said he said I

1013
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:44,260
said yeah, then he said, which is

1014
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:54,000
which is best Matt Rice, dark humor, Matt Rife's crowd work or Matt Rife,

1015
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:58,100
sexual humor, and I said his sexual lips and then he said, What time you're

1016
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:59,640
going? I said, I'm leaving right now.

1017
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,580
What's better chips or salsa?

1018
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:08,640
Chips or salsa? Chips. Yeah. Salsa with the chip underneath, to which I said

1019
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,300
Fred or Smosh,

1020
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,040
and then

1021
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,500
I said, he said, new idea, salsa that goes on the bottom of the chip. That's

1022
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:21,140
good. And then I I think I just didn't get the text good idea. So I asked

1023
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:26,800
Fred or Smosh, Fred versus Smosh. So I think it's Fred or Smosh. Yeah. Like

1024
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,780
what do you prefer? But Fred versus Smosh, Smosh. Yeah. Two guys. To which I

1025
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:37,540
replied fingering or normal penetration with the penis. And I also sent the

1026
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,440
thinking emoji.

1027
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:46,980
And he said both at the same time using both hands, which to which I said,

1028
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:50,540
damn you a freaky motherfucker. I'm glad to call you my friend, though. Salute

1029
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,080
emoji.

1030
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,380
So this is the kind of good conversation goes out. This is how we decide if we're

1031
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,740
gonna go to a party. This is, yeah. Oh yeah, I forgot that that was the whole

1032
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:03,300
beginning of the conversation. This is, this is telling me that I need to start

1033
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,260
maybe responding to these texts more, 'cause I've never responded to one

1034
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,220
except. Well, this is just all the lyrics to Lucid Dreams by Juice WRLD. We send

1035
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:12,420
each other, all types of thoughts and ideas and pictures that we have

1036
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,580
between yeah like

1037
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:19,220
on Thursday, August, seventeenth at four or five PM.

1038
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,780
Okay, just wrap it. We'll read this like a yeah, okay, Zaza versus perks,

1039
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:28,300
Zaza, Zaza versus lean, Zaza, Zaza versus Siroc, Siroc, Siroc versus

1040
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:33,100
champagne, champagne, champagne versus Zaza, champagne, whoa, not my fancy as

1041
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,660
having that opinion, cocktail party versus wine, tasting cocktail party,

1042
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,740
being zesty versus being straight straightness one hundred

1043
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:51,980
umami flavors versus savory flavors to which Cameron replied.

1044
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:56,660
What is this? Well, I got to turn off the time limit

1045
00:58:56,660 --> 00:59:00,400
with a video.

1046
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,460
It's not playing.

1047
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:04,860
It's not

1048
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,360
doing

1049
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:19,820
so you're not you're not answering these. You're missing out. I could have

1050
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:24,200
he's sending some amazing gifts of people. There's a bunch of gifts, a lot

1051
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:29,040
of gifts. I could I'm missing out on like I feel like a dimension to our

1052
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,860
friendly. You and Cameron are closer than you and me because I don't respond

1053
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,360
these. Like maybe we could dig in. Yeah. You know, I think maybe we could start

1054
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,280
sending the questions and and here you know what now that I think about it,

1055
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,400
now that we're airing out text, I actually have something to say. What's

1056
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:42,680
that?

1057
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:51,360
Yesterday, 9 10 p.m. This is a text from me for you go any further. I did send I

1058
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:56,360
let Cameron know that corn and Adidas are releasing a collaboration in October.

1059
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,240
Really big news for him. Yeah, I had already seen it, but I played along and

1060
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:06,740
I was kind. Oh, that's sweet. Yeah. 9, 10 p.m. In the group chat, text from me. Do you guys

1061
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,600
want to have a day of fun?

1062
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,000
Well, I think...

1063
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,000
I was ignored.

1064
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
I was busy.

1065
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,280
You were not busy because you sent multiple texts after that on a different topic.

1066
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,720
I didn't even notice that text.

1067
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,640
And I'm not going to be kind and not read what you said.

1068
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:22,280
I'm not fucking kidding. I did not even notice that.

1069
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,360
And that's the problem, isn't it?

1070
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:27,040
I didn't notice. I'm sorry.

1071
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,040
Can I...

1072
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:32,080
Patrick doesn't even notice it. Now I'm not noticing it now. I'm not noticing it

1073
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:37,080
now because I said you spec of dust. I sent you an amazing character idea for

1074
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:42,640
world's biggest army, which was walk med the bread dollar sign bag terrorist

1075
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:50,840
walk like W. Walk med walk med the bread terrorist. Oh, so it's Ahmed the dead

1076
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:56,280
terrorist, but he sips lean and makes money walk med the bread terrorist. He's

1077
01:00:56,280 --> 01:01:00,200
a terrorist of money. And you ignored this. So this is I mean a day of fun. I

1078
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,360
don't even know. Yeah, you ignored that to say I think there might also be one

1079
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,360
of those square road labs in the office. You know why I texted you that?

1080
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:10,240
Because you called me asking about about microphones and I talked to you

1081
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:15,160
and I helped you out and then I sent you a text to help you guys as much fun as

1082
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:20,440
this is. My wife just texted me that she crashed a car, so I have to call and

1083
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:24,980
find out if she crashed the car. No, not my car. Her bosses. She put it into a

1084
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,600
fire hydrant.

1085
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:31,800
Oh Jesus Christ. Yeah, but I'll figure this out and I'll send her. Wait, what

1086
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:35,200
should I send her? Which text should I send her? Oh, you should send her

1087
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,000
Walk vs Aza. Walk? Okay, I'll send her right now. Oh, Dew vs Claws.

1088
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:45,800
Walk vs... Here's a question you could actually send her. What?

1089
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:50,000
What if you saw a gangsta with some dew hanging out of his sagging pants?

1090
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:55,000
What if you saw a gangsta with some dew?

1091
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,520
He has like a, in the way that I'm imagining it is.

1092
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,400
She sent me this photo.

1093
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:01,240
Oh, that's nothing.

1094
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:02,060
That's nothing, right?

1095
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:02,900
Yeah.

1096
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:05,880
So I'll say, what if you saw a gangsta with some dew?

1097
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,640
I mean, all she has to do is paint over it.

1098
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,480
It looks like it's gonna start raining outside.

1099
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:10,000
She probably has some car paint.

1100
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,560
I wanna go home.

1101
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,040
All right, I'll call my wife.

1102
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,000
All right, I am opening for Girl God

1103
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,320
in Chicago in November.

1104
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,160
Okay.

1105
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:26,160
up. All right. Bye. Bye.

1106
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:32,480
World of Warcraft dream. Whoa. From GXViper98. This means sound crazy, but hear me out. I

1107
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,560
was playing this game World of Warcraft when I decided to join a group for a raid on a

1108
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:42,960
dungeon. The leader was JK Simmons. Wow. Yes, the JK Simmons. People were telling me about

1109
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,600
his very strict rules about his raids where people were actually dying in real life. I

1110
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:50,480
I remember his game name was Dr. Rain.

1111
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:52,600
Think of his character in the movie Whiplash,

1112
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,920
but a hundred times more insane.

1113
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,400
Anyway, we start the raid

1114
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:58,080
and everything goes off without a hitch.

1115
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,120
I mean, we were tearing through this place at record speed.

1116
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,920
We reach one of the bosses that was known to be pretty tough.

1117
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,600
The Doc, that's what he calls him, the Doc,

1118
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:08,680
made sure if anyone screw up,

1119
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,360
they would pay the consequences.

1120
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,880
We start the battle and it was going well.

1121
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,600
Then one of our key players starts to lag behind.

1122
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,800
He was given a warning, but it continues.

1123
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:21,320
So Doc banishes him from the game, never to play again.

1124
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:23,120
I don't remember much after that.

1125
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:23,960
What could this mean?

1126
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:25,400
- And this is I, I think they fell asleep

1127
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:26,240
while they were writing that.

1128
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,080
- What the fuck could this mean?

1129
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:29,280
- Well, okay, the first part about this,

1130
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,480
we already said, I mean, we already touched upon that

1131
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,040
with the Chris Griffin dream.

1132
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:37,720
- Oh, he sees JK Simmons as an idol.

1133
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,760
- Yeah, sees JK Simmons as an idol,

1134
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,760
or GX Viper is really, really like,

1135
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:52,260
like upset or concerned with celebrity culture and like there maybe GX Viper

1136
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,600
is a secret celebrity that we don't know what could GX be? This could be this could be

1137
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:01,320
G first initial first name that's coming to my head George Lopez this could be

1138
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:10,880
GGL because he replaced Latinx. GX Latinx George Lopez Viper 98 born in 98 or

1139
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:11,880
or he's 98 years old.

1140
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:12,880
Or yeah.

1141
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,880
One of the two.

1142
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,760
Could be 98, he could be born on double day.

1143
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:18,040
He could be born on double day.

1144
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:19,920
There's leap day and there's double day.

1145
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:20,920
Scary.

1146
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:25,000
High school, a femboy, and nonstop cumming.

1147
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:27,000
*roars*
