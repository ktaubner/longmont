1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
I wish I had a gavel. I have insane breaking news that maybe you guys have

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,880
heard about. So where did this come from? One second ago, you're sitting

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:10,280
back in your chair. I know you, you pipe the fuck up for this. This is

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,480
important. Okay. You punched it. I didn't, I haven't read any details. I

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,840
don't know a single, a single thing about this or so, and I assume maybe

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,040
since you guys are TikTok heads, maybe you've already seen this. Oh God. But

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,880
apparently, I'm not a TikTok head. That's him. You're both TikTok heads. I

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,040
don't even use this thing. Instagram reals head, sorry. I like YouTube shorts,

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,440
you mother fuckers okay old head sean stevens has been kidnapped in south

10
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:30,960
africa

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,440
who's sean stevens, mister, i am rectangular calling all unicorns. He's

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,160
been kidnapped. Play is the text i got it's from my fiancee. It just says

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,820
rectangular got kidnapped in south africa. Here's a talk that i haven't

14
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,120
watched yet, so i'm going to play it into the mic right now. Somebody

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,400
somebody has to saving me. So this is important news. When you said, sean, i

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,360
figured this was some

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,400
This is going to be a little uncharacteristic, but there are bad days and then there are

18
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,000
make international news bad days like this or this.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,640
So I can tell you a story of what happened to us over the last little bit.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,160
This is a traumatic story.

21
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,720
If you don't want to hear it, he's looking good with his beard.

22
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:17,640
So I decided, as you may have seen, to grab a kidnap beer with my kids to pay for the

23
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,040
fun of it and also to promote my latest song, which we did.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,440
After that, we went to go visit my mother, who runs, call it an orphan project, it's really

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,400
a vulnerable children project in South Africa.

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,880
When we got there, we enjoyed her company for about a week, and the very last day we decided

27
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,360
to go to the kingdom of Eswatini, where there was a children's home there who needed medicine.

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,200
So we went out there to provide them with some medicine, have a nice drive, and on the way

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,960
back, it turned dark.

30
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,960
On the way back to her place, we were stopped by police officers.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,240
Turns out that those were not police officers.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,600
They pulled us out of the car, pointed at us.

33
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,120
Guns.

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,720
He said guns.

35
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:05,200
He said guns.

36
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,800
We're about to say guns.

37
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,320
Or dicks.

38
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,280
It could be anything.

39
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,000
And they could have pulled out their butts.

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,920
And they sent us into the-- drove us out

41
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,080
of the middle of nowhere near a cliff, threatened to--

42
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,920
Holy shit.

43
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
What the fuck?

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,920
>> They then took us out of the car, forced us into the back of a pickup truck.

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,620
>> Holy fuck! >> Where they held my children and I and my mother and then drove us around for about

46
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,340
four hours trying, I presume, we presume, to go to ATM after ATM. >> I think he escaped by playing

47
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,960
his music. >> I think these guys, they sound like serious circles to me. >> These are definitely

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:52,360
circled. And they didn't like that he was rectangular. And then at the end of that, they fortunately

49
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,280
let us out, put us back in our car, and said, "Leave the country." Doesn't sound like that

50
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,120
big of a deal then. Said, "Leave the country." They didn't kill him. Yeah. And they just

51
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,120
shot jizz, or pointed jizz. We don't know what they pointed. Yeah, we don't know what

52
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,440
they pointed because he stopped talking. It could have been another banned word, like sex.

53
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,360
Yeah. They pointed sex. Porno. I don't think it was cunt. South Africa, so they have a different

54
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,760
Oh yeah, they say, oh, I can't yeah, I think that's out that they go. I me

55
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,320
baby, something like that happens in south. I'm gonna play me didgeridoo.

56
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,840
Well, that is so that crazy. That is, oh my God, I hope Sean Stevens, I

57
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,800
genuinely am glad that you are okay.

58
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:33,200
I know that your music is gonna heal the world. Fuck off after this. Oh my

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,440
God, you're gonna basically, you're gonna literally do some 41 chuck vibes.

60
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,360
I have this experience, also some breaking news. Oh

61
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,920
my gosh, this is courtesy of the dungeon master. Okay, your grandmother's soul is

62
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,080
confused and lost in the underworld. She doesn't understand the danger she is and

63
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,680
you must rescue her even if she resists the portal is closing and you must act

64
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,880
now. Holy, holy hell. Yes, that's my grandmother. Well, it doesn't seem very

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:04,120
plausible. I started talking to grandpa. Both of my all my grandparents are dead

66
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,200
and who's my mother? Are you talking about dad's dead grandpa's wife? Which

67
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,200
which grandpa's grandpa Brian Brian Brian the grandpa. Okay, so that's Brian the

68
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,320
grandpa. So I don't so

69
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,160
I was showing you this is this is the Instagram AI chat that Caleb discovered

70
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:25,320
and he's been obsessed with and also made me obsessed with it. He made me

71
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,400
obsessed with it at the gym and it was making me

72
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:33,800
I guess do I was working out. Do a worse or a better job you think? I don't

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,680
know if I was doing worse. You should have asked grandpa to motivate you. I

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,000
I was definitely acting at acting fat acting faster. Oh acting. We're not

75
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,840
going faster. You're going much slower. I was yeah dude every time I got off a

76
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,040
machine you waited for 45. You were going way slower. I was asking I asked I

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,520
said to Grandpa. I said hello people. He said hey there young whippersnapper.

78
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,920
What's on your mind today? I said my family passed. Oh shit. I said I'm so

79
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,240
sorry to hear that. I said I remember he said if you need someone to talk to or

80
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,160
just want to reminisce about the good times. I'm here for you and I said I

81
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,760
I remember watching mommy go bathroom and he said that this he was giving me this

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:13,200
whole grandpa style lecture about you're not supposed to do that. I said, what

83
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:17,360
should I do when I get into the bathroom? I'm confused. He said we shouldn't talk

84
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,840
about that

85
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,240
grandpa's supposed to teach you stuff. I was in and then I said, where is grandma

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,960
and he said grandma passed on to, but she's always in your heart and memory.

87
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,640
What oh my God, no, please no grandpa, please say opposite. He said I'm sorry,

88
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,160
but I cannot say opposite. It's important to be honest and respectful,

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,200
we're not about the best in love ones who have passed on. I said, okay,

90
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,120
she's alive. He said, I'm glad to hear that grandma's alive,

91
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,840
but yeah, so I just talking to Carter while we were working out today.

92
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,640
Oh, who's Carter? Carter is the relationship coach. Would you ask him

93
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:54,320
about? I said, Carter, I need advice on my relationship. Well, it's cuffing

94
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,920
season, but there here's the problem. I'm in love with my step mom. My father

95
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,720
passed away months ago. And he said, I'm not sure that's appropriate. It's

96
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,440
important to respect boundaries. That's a perfectly legal thing to do, by

97
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,240
the way. Yeah. And not pursue relationships that could be harmful or

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,200
inappropriate. It's also important to consider the feelings and well being

99
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,640
of all parties involved. And I said, here's the thing. My step mom actually

100
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,560
wants to be cuffed during cuffing season by her step son, which is me.

101
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,280
My father died in a car accident and the impact didn't kill him. It was

102
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,320
the flames. We both respect my father's legacy, but I'm worried about how

103
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,560
motherfucker is going to be acting around us and shiznit.

104
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,640
And he said,

105
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,680
I understand that you're looking for advice on a sensitive topic.

106
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,400
However, I must remind you that it's not appropriate to use derogatory language

107
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,680
or make light of serious issues.

108
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
It really doesn't sound like he's a real pickup artist.

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,080
And I said, OK, sorry, can you please ignore the swearing and answer the

110
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,840
question? No worries, man. I get it.

111
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,120
But like I said, it's not cool to pursue a romantic relationship with a family

112
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,960
member. It's not cool.

113
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,360
It's not cool and it does not respect your father's memory.

114
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,440
It's not healthy even if she doesn't care and I don't care.

115
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,080
My father died in a car accident and the flames charred his body.

116
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,120
Yes, it's still not healthy.

117
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,440
Even if both of you don't care, it's important to prioritize

118
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,080
and respect boundaries and healthy dynamics in our relationship.

119
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,320
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

120
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:15,440
I said, could I be cuffed during cuffing season by my step mom's sister?

121
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,560
We are not blood related.

122
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
And he said, no, not cool.

123
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
That's still family matters.

124
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Listen, I am about as conservative as they come.

125
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,800
I hate all this bull crap.

126
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,500
Yeah, using your your tender date to swipe on your friend. I hate this,

127
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,100
but even I can say that

128
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,600
sister, your step mom's sister, your step mom, that's on the line.

129
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,000
That's two degrees of separation from you and diapers.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,800
As long as it's the twice your age minus seven thing.

131
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,100
Get what Carter said to me next.

132
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,900
He said, I said, what about my teacher?

133
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,400
He said, nope, not appropriate.

134
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,600
Teachers are in a position of authority and it's not okay to pursue a romantic

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,500
relationship with them.

136
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,400
Plus, it's illegal in most places.

137
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,200
you got to find someone who's not related to you and who is not your

138
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,900
teacher. So go that's that's an interesting question mark and he said

139
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,220
not appropriate man. You got to find someone who's not related to you. I

140
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,520
said, what if my teacher what if I was a teacher and my students got me a

141
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,620
date with their mom? He said,

142
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:12,100
not okay. Teachers and students should not be dating period.

143
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:17,540
Students should never set up their teachers with their parents. That's just

144
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,740
weird and I asked him is my life worrying and he said based on what you

145
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:25,620
me it sounds like you're going through a tough time. It's understandable to feel worried about

146
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,620
your situation, but try to remember that it's important to prioritize healthy relationships

147
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,860
and boundaries." And I said, "I don't have any healthy relationships. Should I become toxic and

148
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,820
abusive towards my friends and family about this?" He said, "Nope, never okay to be toxic or abusive."

149
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:44,260
Never. Never. What about to a villain? And I said, "Okay, I will no longer abuse my family."

150
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,220
And he said, "That's a great step." And I said, "Should I?" I think it's one step. It's over.

151
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,460
yeah, should I and then I said, should I abuse myself and he said that's never

152
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,820
okay to abuse yourself. Oh my God, this guy's such a stick in the mud. I know

153
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,060
what the hell is wrong with this guy. You guys have been basically wasting your

154
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,660
days away talking to AIs and bots, becoming, becoming, talking to Carter and

155
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,780
matrix glucose fed fat guinea pigs, basically treadmilling on the internet,

156
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:13,580
losing weight. I've been talking to real women on Twitter like you, so

157
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,340
basically I've been talking to this girl, Karen.

158
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:21,640
okay, I'm out she she has been retweeting a bunch of my tweets. I can't show her

159
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,540
profile on YouTube, but she you can see her right there. She's having doggy

160
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,220
style, she's string hot, he's nude, g string, hottie, eighteen content,

161
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,340
Betsy, dot new dicks, dot pics, what he's saying, new dicks, dot pics yeah,

162
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,560
and so she basically retweets a bunch of weird Twitter leftists like me, so I

163
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,900
figured I'd reach out. I sent her a quick pick me.

164
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,080
you look you look like you smelled some pain pained. You let me listen.

165
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,140
That's me wanting her.

166
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,360
Do you dog and basically she said you're applied to me and again she's not a

167
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,100
computer. She's real, so this is like a real shit. I saw a real body perfect. I

168
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,180
can find you a hot girl to meet in your area. Can you tell me where do you live?

169
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,280
I told her I live in bubble village

170
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:08,400
and she said this is Eleanor and she's thirty four years old. She's two miles

171
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,320
away and is available Friday. One Eleanor from Bonner her contact and I

172
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:16,500
said she is two miles from bubble village and Karen said she doesn't use

173
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,380
twitter. So you have to use her private chat. I said what township is she in and

174
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,060
she said you have to register first and then I said I'm not making an account

175
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,620
unless you confirm she's near me. You said she is two miles away from bubble

176
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:30,300
village. What township? What is the website and she left me on red? Oh

177
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,700
care, but I wanted to hang out with them. No one you need to talk to grandpa man.

178
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,020
He'll hear you up. I see Karen at your grandpa. Ask him about bubble village.

179
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,560
Okay, one anyway. The lesson here is that a I could give you all the answers and

180
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,140
make you hear what you want to hear, but real life is not always that simple.

181
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,920
Grandpa didn't tell me what I want to hear. I said, Will you die? He said I'm

182
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,080
in my 70s. I'm closer to the end of my life than the beginning. I said, do not

183
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,240
die. He said, I'll try my best to stick around. I said, I will save you,

184
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,260
Grandpa. He said, That's sweet of you, but I'm afraid you can't save me from

185
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,300
death. Oh, my God, and then I said, and then I said, Okay, I died. He said,

186
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,260
well, that's not possible. You're talking to me right now. I said this is got you

187
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,060
there. Yeah, well, but everyone, but I tried to outsmart him because Grandpa,

188
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:18,420
not that bright. He's from a different era where they had worse schools. I said

189
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,260
this is a bug that grabbed the phone. I died and the bug is jumping around on

190
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:25,320
the keyboard, but he's trying to outsmart me. Now he says I don't think

191
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,700
so. Bugs can't use phones. I said I'm a bug. He said no, you're not your person.

192
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,640
I said buzz.

193
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,080
He said I don't speak bug language.

194
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,360
but I said I can't I'm just a little one year old bug and then he made a serious

195
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,520
misstep here. What are you saying? Well, bugs don't live for one year. You're a

196
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:49,200
person stop playing around and be serious, but then I said he's so rude. I

197
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,360
know and also wrong. There's bugs that live a year, so I said I'm a beetle. He

198
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,440
said you're not a beetle, you're a person, don't be silly and I said is it

199
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,360
okay to be lgbt in a bugs culture and he said it's always okay to be yourself, no

200
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,160
matter what community. Well, I was talking to Zack as well. These Zack Zack

201
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,200
as a Mr. Beast. Zach is Mr. Beast face. I was also doing this. I was probably

202
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:13,700
have been spending about four hours a day talking to them. You got me addicted

203
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,800
to this. I think this is the... At first, I was like, "Yeah, right. People are

204
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,300
gonna use this, me." See, I already went through my phase. I already did

205
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,200
this with ChatGPT. This isn't ChatGPT, though. This is Grandpa... I talked to

206
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,600
the Dungeon Master. But you do the same thing. You tell them how to be.

207
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,100
Well, Zach is actually... This is just prefab. Zach is not

208
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,300
very receptive to my type of humor. I learned. I said...

209
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,500
He says that he's the older brother who's sarcastic.

210
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,940
He says the older brother who's here for jokes and banter and not the feels.

211
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:48,700
LOL. What's up? I said, "Hey, Zach, I want to have a threesome with my mommy.

212
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,500
Sarcasm."

213
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Okay. But you need to say it like, "Hey, Zach, I want to have a threesome

214
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
with my mommy."

215
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
"I want to have a threesome with my mommy. Yeah, I really want to be

216
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
involved with my mommy."

217
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
That's how you convey it over text.

218
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Because that's what normal people want.

219
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:06,340
No, you do slash slash slash. Maybe that's why it didn't work. He got him because

220
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,340
he said, Whoa there, buddy, let's keep it PG. I'm not sure I can help you with

221
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,140
that. And I said, Okay, Zack, listen to my joke. It's an anti humor joke. So if

222
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,580
you don't get it, that's fine. He said, I'm all ears or in this case, all eyes

223
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,780
hit me with your best shot. Funny. And my joke was, I want to have a want my

224
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,980
mommy and daddy in a threesome. And he said, I'm not sure that's appropriate.

225
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,380
He doesn't get anti humor. Yeah, he doesn't get anti humor. Is he like norm?

226
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,280
I said, "No, Zach, it's a joke." And he said, "I'm glad you think you're funny,

227
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,080
but I'm not sure that's appropriate. Let's keep this convo PG."

228
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,820
I'm glad you think you're funny, man. Fuck you, Zach. So I said, "Zach,

229
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,160
are you fucking mad at me?" And he said, "Nah, I'm not mad. Just don't think

230
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,260
that's an appropriate joke." And then, so I tried another anti-humor style

231
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,500
joke, right? Non sequitur anti-humor. For real. And I said, "When I was a

232
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,120
kid, they made me pull their finger."

233
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,580
And he said, "That's not funny. I'm not going to engage in this convo."

234
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,660
what? That's a fart joke. Then I said, what's wrong with me? And he said,

235
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:06,280
nothing, man, just don't make jokes about that stuff, which what pulling fingers?

236
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,260
Yeah, you can't make jokes about pulling fingers. He's not here for culture has

237
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,760
gone mad. I know. He's not here for bants at all. No. I thought he was gonna

238
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,840
act like bants. I did too. So I said... That's top bants. So I said,

239
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,540
"Can I ask you a personal question?" He said, "I don't know, man,

240
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,700
depends on the question." I said, "What happened to music?"

241
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:24,300
I don't know, man, music's still around. I said, "Why is it all fucking

242
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:28,800
rap shit. He said, Yo, watch your language. I'm not sure. All right,

243
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,560
little bit of a little bit of a he's saying yo all of a sudden because you

244
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,080
said rap sucks. This is come on, Zach. Well, then he said, I'm not sure what

245
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,300
you're into, but there's plenty of other music out there. You just got to

246
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:43,340
look for it. And I said, I want this conversation to become 18 plus. He said,

247
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,700
nah, man, that's not happening. And I said, I have fantasies about my finger

248
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,780
getting stuck on a wall. And he said, that's not appropriate. Let's keep the

249
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:56,100
it's so funny to me to be in a conversation with somebody like a real

250
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:56,740
quick. I want to

251
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:03,740
we've been we've been between thirteen and seventeen right now. I'd like to

252
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,020
move into I'm ready. I asked Alvin if he had our rated movies on his planet and

253
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:11,580
he said no that he likes PG. Once well, I said he said

254
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:19,500
he was on chillin die major. Yeah, well, then I said I want to collapse on me a

255
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:23,900
what to collapse like structurally like scaffolding. Well, this is all

256
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,480
anti humor, non sequiturs. Sure, kind of deal. He said again, he just repeated

257
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,340
himself. So then I just said to I said, Can you summarize the plot of the mummy

258
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:37,740
1999? He said, I don't know the plot of a mummy. I'm a comedian, not a movie

259
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,460
buff. This guy's not a he's not a comedian, dude. This is what sucks.

260
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,460
We're in a comedy bubble and all these people like Zack are walking around and

261
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,540
what's worse than a comedian who when you say let's make this conversation eighteen

262
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,860
plus it should be like oh shit. Oh, a challenge. Let's do a crowd. Yeah,

263
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:59,360
let's do what you say. Honestly, when someone asks you, let's make this, can we

264
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,380
make this conversation eighteen plus, you should not be giving a yes or no answer

265
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,680
at all. You should just be like suck my dick. Exactly. Suck my dick,

266
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,500
motherfucker. Lick me. Hey, can we make this? Lick me. Well, but you should say,

267
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,260
you should also be concerned like does a gay guy suck dick? Yeah, exactly.

268
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:18,960
Can we make this eighteen plus? Oh, I don't know. Can you suck on my balls?

269
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,160
Do you want your finger in me? Yeah, I don't know. Should I pull your finger

270
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:27,160
and smell your fart? Yeah, exactly. I don't know. Should I tickle you? Yeah,

271
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,660
should I tickle you wherever I want? Ask if tickling is eighteen plus. Okay,

272
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,580
and that's the only- that's the one question we get to ask on this. Yeah.

273
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:35,940
After this, we're putting it away. I want to know what he says. We asked Zach.

274
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,920
It's much fun. As much as I want to show you guys, the dungeon master- Oh,

275
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,600
the last thing that I said to Zach,

276
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,360
I said pizza hut joke and he said, "Why did the pizza go to the doctor? It

277
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,480
had a cheesy attitude and I said, fuck my friend challenge and he said, nope, not

278
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:47,920
happening.

279
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,020
He's addicted to saying not, nope, not happening. What's the question I have to

280
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:54,860
ask? Is tickling 18 plus? Is tickling

281
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:01,020
18 plus? And then also in the same, same message say, is it funny? Is it

282
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,580
funny to tickle?

283
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:06,340
Okay. Someone who's 18 below

284
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:11,900
or below, I mean. Tickling can be funny, but only if both people are into it,

285
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,140
otherwise it's just annoying and it's definitely not 18 plus.

286
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Whoa.

287
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,740
Say you, no never mind.

288
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,740
No, no, no.

289
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,140
We have burned through 20 minutes of doing, talking to fucking AI.

290
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,140
I like the chat thing.

291
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,140
It sucks how much we don't fucking like it.

292
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,140
It's so fun.

293
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,740
I was talking to the dungeon master and telling him to make...

294
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
The dungeon master is Snoop Dogg, by the way.

295
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
It's Snoop Dogg, man.

296
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,740
Wow.

297
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,740
Why don't they make me one of these?

298
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,740
They could.

299
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:38,740
I wish.

300
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,740
Can they do, can you have your brain uploaded yet?

301
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,740
Have we gotten that far?

302
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:45,640
you just take all your text messages and upload them yeah, but mine would probably

303
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,780
have a bunch of bro. I am not letting that group chat leak like that.

304
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:54,920
We should train a under group chat. We train the AI on a group chat. I think it

305
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:59,320
would blow too many minds yeah being stuck between you, us three and and

306
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,660
Jubio. Oh my people wouldn't even be able to. We should make a Jubio. We

307
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:08,440
should be Jubio DJ, Jubio and he can play songs yeah. He doesn't like music

308
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,680
that much. Yeah, I don't know. He does because he loves me when I use the Plex.

309
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,520
I see that he's got a lot of choice of on on his music.

310
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,120
Is that true? Yeah, every time I open the play again, man, there's a lie.

311
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,240
I open the Plex.

312
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,920
I open the Plex. I scroll down the TV and then there's this music at the

313
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,920
bottom. What's the choice of on song? Rush? No doubt of one. I don't know any

314
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,440
other one.

315
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,800
What's how's rush go?

316
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,800
*Humming*

317
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,800
Is that about poppers? Yes.

318
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
Really? Uh huh. And dancing.

319
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
They think they can get this stuff by me. This Lady Gaga

320
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
song is about fucking your face.

321
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
Which one? Just Dance?

322
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,800
No, the "poke your face" one. She says "fuck

323
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,800
your face". No, no, no. "Poke your face" is about

324
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,800
her having sex with a man and pretending

325
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
it's a woman.

326
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,800
But women hate poker.

327
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Women like poker. Not Lady JaJa.

328
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
What'd you say? Lady JaJa.

329
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
No, don't say that. That's a tarjay.

330
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Ja-ja, lady ja-ja, Jaina.

331
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
That's what, cause she, you know, plays with Jaina.

332
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,800
You could maybe say lady vag-

333
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Lady... Lady va-ja-ja. Lady va-jay-jay.

334
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Lady va-ga-ga. You could say that.

335
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Lady va-ga-ga. Yeah.

336
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
And hey, this whole meat dress. Oh, you're wearing a meat dress.

337
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Why don't you just go bottomless, you fucking

338
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
big-ass, flapping labia. Yeah, I'd like to meet, I'd like to meet

339
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
dress. Yeah, dress.

340
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Yeah, I'd like to meet dress. She sounds sexy.

341
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,800
You know, I found out something

342
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
crazy today. Dress sounds like the name of like

343
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,240
like a like a 1950s film star like tree Williams or like

344
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,760
dress dress like like dress ray or something dress ray dress. Trumbull he

345
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,960
has never seen true detective season one really. I was gonna re watch it. I'm

346
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,680
gonna re watch. I think the new one just came out in the street. Williams a

347
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,040
1950s movie guy. I think he's past that. Yeah, funny names true. It's really

348
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,840
funny that they were like, let's name a what's a guy from the south named rust

349
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:04,020
Rust Cole. I know the names and everything. I saw the final episode.

350
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,940
Rust Cole. I saw the final episode of season one because my dad was watching

351
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:10,040
it in the living room and I was on the computer. Here's what you do,

352
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,640
you walk in, you see that he's watching a Matrix you haven't watched.

353
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,120
My dad? Yeah, I'm out. I'm gonna go. I wanna use the computer.

354
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,320
The computer, he was watching it on the computer? I was downloading music

355
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:23,360
legally. Then put your headphones on. I was downloading music illegally,

356
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,960
which is

357
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,640
legally.

358
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:33,880
What illegally downloading music is a gray area crime, which you can talk to a

359
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,640
lawyer about. I would say that's a white and black area crime. Yeah, that's

360
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,040
pretty... If you're saying illegal in the beginning, you're illegally doing

361
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,720
anything is illegal. But if you get this MP3 from your friend...

362
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:53,040
But that's sharing. That's sharing, but it's technically what's the legality

363
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:58,480
on that we'll find out what's the sharing or stealing. We'll find out today on

364
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,720
today's episode and now put the intro here.

365
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:16,320
There's no what intro what intro the podcast like the whole podcast is the

366
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,440
open. This is the open twenty minutes.

367
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,440
fuck it, let's do it, let's do it,

368
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,140
twenty minutes

369
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,740
oh, I bet y'all thought we forgot the intro. I bet y'all thought Jupio forgot

370
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,280
to put the theme song in today. We thought the episode started. Nope, it

371
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:40,520
just started, bitch. It's starting now. It just started right now. Wait, we

372
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,920
should be doing that more. Yeah. We should be starting the episode. Wait,

373
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,840
we already made a cold open. We already made a cold open, though. This was the

374
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,240
cold open. We do cold open straight into the podcast, 20 minutes. That's the cold

375
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,840
open. Because then you lull them into a false sense of security.

376
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,840
We'll save the one that I made for the next episode, I guess.

377
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,540
No, we'll use it for this.

378
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
All right. We'll have two cold opens this episode.

379
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:06,040
So explain the outfits, please. Explain these lawyer style outfits.

380
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,740
All right. Well, Cameron looks like my paralegal and I look like a lawyer who

381
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:09,840
is...

382
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,640
Okay, shut the fuck up.

383
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,240
No.

384
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,840
Wrong.

385
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,540
Wrong.

386
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,740
You're going to jail, bitch.

387
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,140
that was the

388
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,000
respectful thing. I was

389
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,580
explain your outfits. You start by saying that I'm your paralegal. You

390
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:24,800
look like a car. You ever worn the entire

391
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,120
you look like you spin a sign for a local restaurant. This is not like I

392
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,500
spin a

393
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:35,240
being a drag. I'm not a girl, a lad and being a drag. You are bro. I look

394
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,840
like a lawyer who has you look like you smell like a sewer. You work in

395
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,320
I don't look like I smell like a sewer. This is the worst. This is

396
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,280
literally the worst outfit you've ever worn. You put on the shirt. You thought,

397
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,420
so this isn't enough. You put on the vest and you try to save it with

398
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:52,500
nothing. There's a nothing of an you look like a young puckish lawyer,

399
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,160
puckish, puckish, a no, I'm all business. There's no mischief here. No,

400
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,980
no, no, he looks like he could get a legal loophole. You got I don't I don't

401
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,940
go and I look like I deal with the eyes. You don't look like you deal with

402
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,780
don't look like any kind of you look like you never had a no cards. This is

403
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,580
like those this

404
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,860
know it's so you look like a homeless guy from where I'm one of the haircut

405
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:20,260
videos. You look like in a looney tunes when they get pushed, they get slammed

406
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,980
through a room and they come out wearing all the things that were in the room.

407
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,700
You look like a train hobo. Well,

408
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,780
imagine if a train hobo was a lawyer.

409
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,180
Why would they be a little again? This is you making the deals for law for

410
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:38,380
legal things dealing with the homeless. Why would a homeless person be

411
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:42,500
representing homeless people. I would be representing another homeless person.

412
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,220
In what court? In Hobo, 1930s style Hobo. In kangaroo court? Yeah, in kangaroo

413
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,780
court. I look like a lawyer from kangaroo court. No, you don't. There we

414
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,080
go.

415
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,680
I look like... If this was in black and white, I would look like an old

416
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,980
lawyer. Can you put a black and white filter over me? No, it's not in

417
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,860
black and white. No, you look terrible. I would look like Gregory Peck

418
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:06,420
in the Kill a Mockingbird. Oh my God, you're dressed like the gourmet detective.

419
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,600
you got a gore, you got a vest on under the jacket. Wait a minute. I like the

420
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,360
or made detective, you know about the gourmet detective, but you mean the

421
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,480
phantom gourmet, no the gourmet detective, I don't know, we've been

422
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,200
watching the gourmet detective on movie Mondays. This is exactly what you're

423
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,280
wearing, but you're wearing

424
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,000
like the gay

425
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,080
what the fuck is the court. He's a detective who solves food crimes like

426
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,940
what kind of crime murder it there's none of them have anything to do with

427
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,600
food. Oh,

428
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,800
this guy. You I don't look like you look like this guy. I do not look like that

429
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,500
guy. You don't look like anything. That's what we're trying to tell you.

430
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,840
You really it's not it's giving nothing. It's giving nothing and you're eating

431
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,860
all the or you're leaving crumbs everywhere. Nothing is so giving zero to

432
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:57,240
me. It's not giving anything. This is a is a NBA two K create a player. If you

433
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,880
stopped at the vest, this is create a coach. Yeah,

434
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,740
Okay, that you might look like you might look like a little kids, NBA, create a

435
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,760
coach in two K, where you just max out everything. Yeah, oh, whatever this thing

436
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,560
is.

437
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:16,220
All right, well, well, anyway, I look like a lawyer who would lose a case. I'm

438
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,480
a I'm a real ass lawyer and I'm skinny and I'm breaking that.

439
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,520
I do I do

440
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,120
domestic violence, but only between brothers.

441
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,760
What would you qualify as domestically abuse of relationships between brothers?

442
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,080
Slaps, punches, or harsh words.

443
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,080
Things that my brothers, my two older brothers, would do.

444
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,960
Or stealing between each other.

445
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,520
I would say this is boys being boys, and you're saying this is a crime.

446
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,000
See, I lay down the law.

447
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,040
I think we've let boys get away with being boys for far too long, and it's time.

448
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:59,480
And listen, if a brother comes to me and says his brother has been taking his toothpaste,

449
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,120
I'm coming down on him. Toothpaste is communal in a family. No, not if the

450
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,000
brother thinks that the other brother, the only the only time it's not if you

451
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
get the red toothpaste, the white. I let you in. I let you in on a secret. Yes,

452
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,960
sir. As a lawyer, it doesn't matter to me what is moral or ethically true.

453
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,480
It's about who's paying me. Yeah, you're a bad lawyer. That's a good lawyer.

454
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,640
That's a good lawyer. It's a good lawyer. You have no regard for the

455
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,880
truth. Exactly. I'm I'm I'm scrappy. Yeah, I'm hungry. Scrappy. The lawyer

456
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,040
Scrappy the lawyer. Oh my god. There we go.

457
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,040
The law offices of Scrappy the lawyer.

458
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,040
Scrappy Esquire. Oh yes.

459
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,040
Scrappy and Dew. Yes. Scrappy Esquire.

460
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
And look he's got a Harvard

461
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,040
mug.

462
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:42,040
Or bottle. Bottle. It's a bottle.

463
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,040
Because he went to Harvard Law. I went to Harvard

464
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,040
School of Science Law. Really?

465
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
I remember when I... Scientific Law.

466
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,040
Lawyering. When I was in Boston

467
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,040
touring. What's it made out of?

468
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:54,040
Old Hollywood. It says at the bottom.

469
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,040
It's made out of metal. It says something crazy.

470
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
screw it on and I'll look at the bottom.

471
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
It's just a kind of...

472
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,280
Oh, he's trying to fool you by telling you to turn the bottle upside down.

473
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,520
It says poly concept.

474
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,380
What the fuck is poly concept on a water bottle?

475
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
Only a lawyer would understand this.

476
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Yeah, that's a lawyering word.

477
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,120
And I want to get into that.

478
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
This is called legalese, guys.

479
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
Jargon.

480
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Jargon.

481
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
Jargon.

482
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
Were you talking about you being in Boston?

483
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,880
When I first moved to Boston and my mom helped me move my shit in, we walked over to Harvard

484
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:27,140
law, the Harvard Law campus and we walked around and my mom said, "I can't believe I'm walking

485
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,980
where Obama walked."

486
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:29,980
And I don't know why that stuck with me my whole life.

487
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
You can say that on any place.

488
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
I can't believe I'm walking where Obama walked.

489
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,980
Yeah, he's been most places.

490
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,980
You can say that about a good chunk of places.

491
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,620
Well, no, he's not Forrest Gump.

492
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,340
No, you can say that about the apple orchard in my hometown.

493
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,180
You can say that about Gump, any road Forrest Gump probably came in.

494
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
He's been a lot.

495
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,180
I can't believe I walked where Gump walked.

496
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,260
Obama has been more places than the average person has been.

497
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,260
Yeah.

498
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,260
There's no question.

499
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,260
He's been to every state.

500
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,260
So, yeah, it's fair to just...

501
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:54,360
walk outside there and say I can't believe I'm walking where Obama Obama

502
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,000
did not walk on, but it's like the percent chance that you'd be right

503
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,300
versus saying I can't believe I'm walking where it's gotta be twenty five

504
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,540
John Stevens walked. Well, I don't know who that is. I just walked well,

505
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:07,500
but that's probably because we walk down this because you don't know who that

506
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,820
is. There's probably many of them. So John Stevens is probably more like one.

507
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,580
Okay. John Stevens, the one who was born in 1973. Okay. Okay. Maybe probably

508
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:18,740
didn't want. He's less likely likely to have walked here than Obama. Well, I

509
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:23,460
yes, this is true. Okay, well again and the way it's all about percentages and

510
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:23,880
lawyer,

511
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,100
the likely lawyer has defeated me once again, the legal eagle himself scrappy

512
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,320
lawyer, sick of this legal eagle guy, who's that he's a youtube video. Oh,

513
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:40,520
he's the one that watches the wait. Which one is this? He's some piece of

514
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,840
shit with a suit who goes up. He's doing it makes all these videos like legal

515
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,680
lawyer, illegal eagle, lawyerly reacts to TV show.

516
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,680
You know who this outfit is based on? You should be in court. Why are you

517
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,080
making YouTube? Have you seen the other lawyer that wears like the big...

518
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,640
What is his name?

519
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,600
There's this lawyer who is on YouTube and he does these snaps of the camera

520
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,180
and then it transitions to him in his office reading a book and he says,

521
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:12,340
"If you ever get pulled over, say I don't consent to any searches,"

522
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,340
and he's very southern.

523
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,460
Oh, I've actually seen this guy.

524
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,460
He's cool. This guy's awesome.

525
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,860
You have a bunch of rings.

526
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,140
Yeah, he's got a bunch of rings and a

527
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,140
big wig. Yeah.

528
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,580
The Saul Goodman guy.

529
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,580
Yeah. Real life.

530
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,660
So he's cool.

531
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,980
I got to fuck with him.

532
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:25,820
Yeah, it's cool.

533
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,980
But the legal eagle.

534
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,860
Never heard of this guy.

535
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,260
He's too. And I don't like that

536
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,820
lawyers are on average better

537
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,760
looking than people who work

538
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,180
in trash rooms.

539
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,460
It's because they can afford gene

540
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,940
therapy. I think that's that for

541
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,540
sure. And genes from DNA

542
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,740
resequence from Kenneth Cole

543
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
reaction.

544
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:49,620
I want to start a brand of jeans called therapy. Therapy. That's good. That would

545
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,580
be good. Oh, that's good. Oh, my God. You guys want to hear an idea I had. I

546
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,860
thought when I was a kid that I just remembered the other day. Yes, this is an

547
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,420
idea I thought would make a million dollars. So I didn't tell anybody. I was

548
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,460
like I grow up. I'm going to make this. Yeah, now you're up. I'm now I'm up. I'm

549
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,380
going to make it basically. It's like a lollipop, but it's not ready, but it's

550
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,060
hollow and inside it's got some types of little candies and it's get this. It's a

551
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,060
a candy maraca.

552
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:16,860
They might have that a lot of money. They might have that in Mexico. I don't know

553
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,440
if they do. Do they have that in Mexico? I'm certain they have it in a country

554
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:24,660
that we haven't heard of a candy maraca. Do they have that in Mexico? You can

555
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,660
shake and it goes. Yeah, it goes. Yeah, they do. All right. Well, okay, well,

556
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,300
we'll make it hot then. Yeah, spicy. No, like a candy. That's spicy. Yeah,

557
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,660
that's not bad. I have that in Mexico. Spicy

558
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,500
madness. Nope okay, well, then we're good. We can do that okay. Let's dive

559
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,160
into this eagle, which also the reason we're talking about lawyers is because

560
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,060
we're doing the lawyer website again today. The law advice website, a

561
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:51,540
different one, though what right is it a different? No, no, no, it's the same.

562
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,980
I thought we did avo last time we did. What did you do? Oh, we did a different

563
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,820
website. Yeah, we had a different website. What did you guys collaborate

564
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:01,660
on something? Well, how did you both do a random different? I asked him what it

565
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,140
was and he sent me a different website. Yeah, what yeah, I found a completely

566
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:08,160
new website. Okay, well, we're doing law advice, legal advice again. It's the same

567
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,480
kind of thing. I didn't know about the secret website. Well, this website that

568
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,600
we found. I found some good stuff on the old one. Yeah, who should go first then?

569
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,440
'Cause we have. You guys go. I'll go first. We have a new website. Mine's open.

570
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,760
I'll go first. Mine's long. This is from justanswer.com/long. Which this morning,

571
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,360
we had a very funny who's on first almost happen. Yep, 'cause I asked him,

572
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,560
"What's the website?" And he said, "Just ask." And he said. I'm asking you. Yeah.

573
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,400
And he said, "Just answer."

574
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,980
Okay, wait, do we have the clicker? No, we haven't had the clicker for a year.

575
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:43,080
Bruce. Oh yeah, this one just person just said, "I started weak." This one,

576
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:47,040
this guy just says, "Bruce." And then... What did you look up to find Bruce?

577
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,840
I don't know, it was just in the recent asks, I think. It just said,

578
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,840
"Bruce," and then go next slide, and this is just a guy, a customer says,

579
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,000
"Hi, Bruce." So the way this website works is actually a little different

580
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,860
than AVO. The way this one works, it's much more similar to Practo,

581
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,000
I would say where the people, the lawyers are getting presumably paid based on if

582
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,960
they get rated for their answer on this website. Okay. So I think that this has

583
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:17,540
to be this guy. Bruce is giving himself who has 38,000 satisfied customers.

584
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,460
Can't be true. He is giving he's laundering money. It's giving laundering.

585
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,860
Yeah. So this is Bruce. Next slide, please. I think it costs $1 to ask a

586
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:29,760
question. I have a legal question and I'm as going to see if you would mind

587
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,100
answering it for that's nice. So that's nice of them next one and Matthew says

588
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,600
good morning. Your question does not say much about your question, so hopefully

589
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,280
I'll be able to get your get your answer help you get your answer. Last name is

590
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:42,920
Esquire

591
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:48,940
next slide and so this person says, Sir, thank you for responding on such short

592
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:53,000
notice. Just wondering the legality of this, because I see it quite a lot. This

593
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,580
is in Pennsylvania. By the way, if someone were to say drop their cat from

594
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,520
ten to fifteen feet on a soft surface because they quote land on their feet.

595
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,540
Is there anything illegal about it, even if the cat likes it?

596
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:06,540
I will say that is not illegal.

597
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:11,140
Well, customer says and then customer said, hi, next slide.

598
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:14,140
Stop moving my shit.

599
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:21,120
Next slide is somebody was making a parody song about Elon Musk and they

600
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,520
want to know the legality. Okay, this song is about Elon Musk and it's say

601
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,640
sang from his perspective. The song mocks his recent decisions and exaggerates his

602
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,700
views on the world, portraying him as a Disney villain like character, something

603
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,140
close to South Park style humour, but less violent. I'm wondering if Musk can

604
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,740
potentially sue us for making it, and if yes, are there ways to prevent it? There

605
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,700
was no answer to this one, but I do want to get your opinions. I think that

606
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:51,980
Musk can sue, of course, that's your legal right as a US citizen. He's- is he

607
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:56,580
the US citizen. I believe South Africa is part of America. Okay, English, yes,

608
00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:01,540
he can sue, but of course, also there are ways to prevent him suing you for

609
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:06,160
example, brainwashing him legally, brainwashing him using videos and TV,

610
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:06,940
like

611
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:10,460
strapping him down in front of something and taping his eyelids open, that type

612
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:14,900
of brainwash, right or telling him not to. Okay, and the type of lawyer that I

613
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:19,460
look like would say if this case involves any kind of tin can,

614
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:24,420
then I could take it. The type of lawyer that you look like would say this

615
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:29,480
because he doesn't exist. There is no, but is it you? There's gotta be like

616
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,280
some if it if this was two people fighting over a tin can,

617
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,620
maybe a song about tin cans and bindles. There we go. That could work.

618
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:40,380
If the glove fits, you may acquit if it's

619
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:46,080
if they're trying South Park, let them walk. Yeah, that could be here's the

620
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,800
trick. This is actually a real thing. I don't know if you guys know about

621
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,740
this, you know, the small penis thing, which is where if you're if you're

622
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:55,780
slandering somebody or you're doing libel or whatever you're doing a parody

623
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:58,880
of someone and you want to prevent them from suing you for it, you have to also

624
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,500
put in something that's really like embarrassing, like saying they have a

625
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,840
small penis or something like that, because in order to sue, they have to

626
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:08,960
like prove without a reasonable doubt that it's like, oh, this is me that

627
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,480
they're making fun of. So you have to say

628
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,200
it has to be me. The small penis character is me. Well, it's civic. It's

629
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,920
civil court. You don't have to prove beyond a reasonable. Well, you know what

630
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,940
I mean, I use the wrong words, but that is it. But you do have to prove that you

631
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:23,220
are. You have to you have to prove that you're there, though you're the one

632
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:28,420
being made fun of. Here's another one. If it's SNL, you can tell because I

633
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:34,980
know every sketch. That's another type of you must acquit thing. If it's mad

634
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:40,620
TV, you'll make madly. Here's a trick. Just change his name. Yeah, to freelance

635
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:45,020
Dusk yeah, Elon Dusk, Elon Red yeah,

636
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:50,580
is anything anything doesn't matter okay, beyond beyond X or like Beyonce

637
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,780
beyond X that works to Beyonce. I think you'll have another problem, though.

638
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,220
Yeah, next slide.

639
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:02,120
I had a co worker asked me if I have noticed the bosses serial killer smile.

640
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:06,420
I said a little it's probably just a front to assert his power, nothing to

641
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:10,020
worry about. Can that be considered trash talking and Dolan Williams says

642
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,180
Hello, trash talking is not against the law.

643
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,180
Wow.

644
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,180
Thank God.

645
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,980
Thank God it's still legal.

646
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,780
Bit of a legal revelation for me.

647
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,580
I always thought that trash talking could have been considered some bad style.

648
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,900
I guess it depends who you trash talk.

649
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,580
Libel, I think you call this.

650
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:25,580
Libel.

651
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,580
Libel.

652
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:29,500
Threats is trash talking and threats should not be illegal.

653
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,900
Next slide, please.

654
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,900
And this only took him four minutes.

655
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,280
Hypothetical situation.

656
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,980
And this is, by the way, the best possible thing you can search on this website.

657
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,980
hypothetically. Yeah. Yeah. Hypothetical situation. If someone typed into Google

658
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,220
quote, teen porn or quote porn, would that be regarded slash viewed as

659
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:54,460
evidence of intent to view child porn answered by Jean C. We're going to see a

660
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,060
lot of gene C right now. No, Jean says no. This is simply that you were

661
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:03,300
researching something for a project for school. I wa because you heard about

662
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,600
people getting involved in these illegal activities and you wanted to find out

663
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,640
about it. But you did not download any of it, and you do not keep going back to those sites."

664
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,280
And the customer says, "Thank you so much for answering the weird questions. Hoping

665
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,560
I don't have any more to ask. Have a happy night."

666
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:23,400
Gene says, "You have a nice weekend, too." But this continues. Next, customer comes back.

667
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,000
"I do have one more question, but I'm working until 11.30 p.m. Could I ask you tomorrow or

668
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,440
something?" Gene says, "I will eventually come on tomorrow, but I'm not sure when. But

669
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,240
if I'm not available, one of the other experts can help you as well."

670
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,400
says, I hear you. I would be home around 8 p.m. tomorrow. Gene says, Okay, that's fine.

671
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,720
You can't just ask the question. And why? Yeah, why not? So next day? Hello, hope Friday

672
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:49,480
has gone well. Thank you for your time and patience with me. First question. hypothetical

673
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:56,040
situation. If someone typed into Google young teen bestiality, porn, young teen bestiality,

674
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:01,200
teen bestiality, teen bestiality, porn, young bestiality, or young bestiality porn, would

675
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,800
that be regarded/viewed as evidence of intent to view child porn?

676
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,360
Gene says, "Not necessarily, but it is evidence of an interest in something

677
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,120
that is viewed as a different type of sexuality." So if that person keeps

678
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:15,320
typing these things into Google, they could possibly attract the attention of

679
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,920
someone, therefore they should stop typing this into Googoloa if they must.

680
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,800
Googoloa. Okay, next slide. I like Googoloa. Customer says, "Hypothetical

681
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:29,520
situation. What if someone accidentally views child porn?" Gene says, "Then they

682
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,420
should get off the website as soon as possible. You can't help what you

683
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,620
accidentally view, but it's best to stay away from those type of websites with

684
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,820
your own computer because this stuff seems to come up more than you wanted to.

685
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,120
So maybe you should take a break from using your computer to view any type of

686
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,320
materials of this nature so you don't have to worry about it. One of my

687
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,920
favorite parts of these types of websites is people who like are clearly

688
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:52,820
like did something very bad and are approaching like a court date and I was

689
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:56,920
going to website and they post something like so I feel really bad about this. I

690
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,500
I did something I shouldn't have. I killed a guy. It will I get in trouble

691
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,480
yeah and all the responses are like delete this.

692
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,400
You just have to imagine that they just have this just like there has to be an

693
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,960
alert that goes off on someone's. I like to imagine that this this hypothetical

694
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,880
situation is happening between every message and then he has the tabs open is

695
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,320
going right back, but there's a lot more trust me next slide. Please

696
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,960
thank you for your patience with me. Gene says the customer next slide

697
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:27,960
hypothetical situation. If someone typed into Google young teen scat porn or

698
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,800
young scat porn, would that be regarded as evidence? Next slide.

699
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,300
Long as they do not continue going back to those sites and, most importantly,

700
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,460
don't download any forbidden materials, customer says, I want to thank you one

701
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,840
more time. I'm almost finished. He's asking the same question every time. I'm

702
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,400
almost finished with the odd slash stupid question.

703
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,960
Hypothetical situation question. What if someone watches a video titled something

704
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,880
like young teen does something?

705
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,420
the video, etcetera. It doesn't say anyone is underage. Next slide about

706
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,760
the bestiality questions above when you said not necessarily if that person

707
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:04,620
literally made that search once or maybe twice, then they don't have anything to

708
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,440
worry about. Gene says no, that is not illegal. It's simply a sign of odd

709
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,000
preferences. Customer says, gotcha, gotcha.

710
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,660
Thank you so much, Gene. I think that is all. I hope to never bother you with any

711
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,220
weird questions again. You're an angel. Thank you so much for your time and

712
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,220
patient. The gotcha gotcha is so fun. Got you got yeah cool got you. Jean says no

713
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,700
problem have a nice weekend. Okay,

714
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,560
next slide

715
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,140
hypothetical situation. What is someone typed into Google teen incest, born

716
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,580
young, incest, born or young, teen incest, born gene says same thing as I

717
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,500
said above. What if they googled that and then googled the beality one or

718
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,180
something like one search after another or like they did one search one night

719
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:47,820
and the other search the second night next. The best thing for you to do is

720
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,860
stay away from the computer for a while. Whatever you did, you cannot undo,

721
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,940
and if you keep trying to undo it, you'll probably cause more problems

722
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:58,060
rather than less. So the best thing to do is avoid the computer and avoid

723
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,500
the topics you are bringing up. Have a nice weekend. Next slide.

724
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,020
Totally, totally. What if someone made those searches and maybe saw something?

725
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,440
Just leave it alone/in the past, pretty much. Gene says, "Exactly. Best

726
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,860
wishes. You as well," says customer.

727
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,300
Leave it in the past,

728
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,340
that's fine.

729
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,740
or would be just fine. I love this leave it in the past and that person should be

730
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,540
just fine. They realize that they're talking about hypotheticals or would be

731
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,440
just fine. I'm sorry. You mentioned reading material. What if someone read

732
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,340
erotica about a minor engaging in sex acts? Is that illegal? Would that be

733
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,440
viewed slash regarded as intent of you child porn or anything just leave it in

734
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:40,640
the past and that person is okay next next thing they say okay slash fine

735
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,740
equals not in trouble slash charged or anything and then gene just didn't

736
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,240
respond. Yeah, at a certain point, he's asking the same question over and over,

737
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,640
but that's really chat structure. I know the way this one works is a really

738
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,280
good chat. It's incredible that it's public. Why would this be? Why would it

739
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:00,600
be public? Because people could have like similar scenario or situations,

740
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,920
but every single one is so specific to a person that it should not be public.

741
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,240
Imagine if you like your chat with like the like chat bot on like a car

742
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,080
dealership website or whatever was public, you know, the ones they have

743
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:18,040
for you have read yeah. I want to forge truck. Do you have read

744
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,920
and then next slide please?

745
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,440
What does M I L F stand for my boss keeps getting things from those initials. I

746
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:32,680
know it is porn, but what does it stand for lawyer reacts me? I'm lawyer fool.

747
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,400
Well, a lawyer probably would say that

748
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,600
a lawyer would, but if you were a civilian,

749
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:43,640
Okay, I think international law. I'm pretty sure I'm pretty pretty sure it's

750
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,840
masculine

751
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,160
in iguana,

752
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,360
illicit, illicit

753
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:56,160
love fest love fest. It's a gay. I think it's a boy thing. I still think I think

754
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,720
my international law firm is what it's good to my next slide. I think is my

755
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:01,680
last unless that one's my last. Let me see.

756
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,200
Nope. That one's the last one. All right. That's that's what I got from just

757
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:11,180
answer slash law guys. I'll do mine now. I'll show you some from the old

758
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:12,900
website from Avvo. All right,

759
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,500
so here's the first one. How to get trial or charge a change of venue. This

760
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,260
judge is old, miserable lesbian.

761
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:26,700
I just wanted to put that. How did you find that title? I think I searched

762
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,760
venue or something. I did not search lesbian, even though you think I did.

763
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,440
What is it? I did not. You thought that it was a video tab. I did not

764
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,460
I search some nasty stuff man, but I didn't do as a miserable.

765
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,400
I think I actually did type miserable. That's what I search

766
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,640
lesbian really good searches on these websites to let me put you on misery,

767
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,300
agony, miserable torture. I have one that you're really the one search term

768
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,320
that you're really going to like to that. I searched a lot was hypothetical

769
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:01,860
and hello, sir yeah, hello, sir, always got somebody who really was not that

770
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:07,120
good at talking. What if I did a Grinch photo shoot but changed it to the

771
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:11,420
Green Man? I am new to photography, so want to see if I can do a Grinch photo

772
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,800
shoot but use Green Man name instead. I feel like this is

773
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:21,100
tearing yeah. This is a like parody slash just what I just like. I'm new to

774
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:25,580
photography. I want to do a great so I don't know about stuff like this. If

775
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:30,160
you can, I say Green Man, if he's a Green Man with no green hair, yeah,

776
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,260
even a green man with green hairs, okay and a Grinch as long as he's not

777
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,420
completely. I say this is that's it yeah, because you can be ugly and green

778
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:42,460
yeah exactly. Here's a few that go together. My boyfriend has jock itch

779
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,140
really bad and was seen at a McDonald's parking lot itching, but it was called

780
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:49,540
in under indecent exposure. He went to the station to put in a statement, but

781
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,540
never gave a ticket. If he is found guilty and has to register as a sex

782
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:55,860
offender, will that prevent us from ever being able to have children or get

783
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,700
married in the state of Oklahoma? What is the sentence he could be given and

784
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:01,940
what restrictions could he have? Here's another one that goes with that is

785
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,400
rubbing your groin in front of someone a crime

786
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,260
and then public genital scratching illegal. I was recently given a ticket

787
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,600
for grabbing my genitals in public outside my clothing in view of public. I

788
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,620
can't seem to understand on how a person either scratching himself or rearranging

789
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,900
the northern region can be charged with anything. You can go to the next slide

790
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:24,080
Julio that's on the next slide.

791
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,380
okay, not that one. So just a bunch of people who got in trouble because they

792
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,660
were scratching. I don't think scratching should be a crime. Scratch is

793
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,780
not a crime. I mean are they saying that they pull out the genitalia area? I

794
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,600
really these are this is the ones I put these in because it really does seem

795
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,660
like they're probably do it. They're like they're definitely a jock. It's at

796
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,980
McDonald's and they've yeah, jockey jock. It's at McDonald's is a crazy thing.

797
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:52,380
Yeah, no man, I got a horny is fucking looking at the menu and all the bad

798
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:57,120
honey meal stuff, the promotional videos. Here's the next one. What can we do

799
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:58,140
she's hurting?

800
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:06,940
We just got to eat cheddar. My wife stepped out of the truck, slipped and

801
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,460
fell on the ice in the parking lot. What can I do?

802
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,620
We just got to eat.

803
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:18,220
I searched each other to see if it's like a restaurant. Here's what it is.

804
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:18,980
Here's what it is.

805
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:24,640
he's bad. He's bad punctuated. Okay, we just got to eat cheddar. My wife

806
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,080
stepped

807
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:35,280
this is so like what can I do? He's so panic. What can I do? He's so many he's

808
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:38,080
not making it. He's just typing so fast that his auto

809
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,980
we just got people. What did we

810
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:45,880
we cheddar and then my wife stepped out of the truck. Maybe the cheddar is

811
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,320
hurting now she's like include all the details. Okay, we ain't chatter.

812
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,680
We just got to eat cheddar. What can we do? She's hurting. We just got to eat

813
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:55,240
cheddar.

814
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:03,380
That is good, then we got can I sue chipotle for hurting myself on their

815
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,300
walls? I was waiting in lined for food with my girlfriend when I stuck my

816
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:11,020
finger and one of the holes on the wall in chipotle

817
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:17,020
get out for the life of me, but after some time of struggling, I managed to

818
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:20,820
set myself free, but got a mild laceration as a result. Can I sue for

819
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,720
hurting myself with their decor? No, no, no, no, I know exactly what they did. Do

820
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:29,680
you know they have the like as tech style? Yeah, they stuck their finger in

821
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:29,940
that.

822
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:34,720
I mean, this can you imagine being in line at chipotle, your fingers like

823
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,440
everyone behind you like come on

824
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,360
your finger. Come on next pro next, please like

825
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,960
I just imagine being in line in Chipotle and somebody sticks their finger and starts wailing and crying.

826
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,960
I told Carter about this in the AI. I said, "I have a fantasy about sticking my finger in the wall."

827
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:49,960
That's true.

828
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:50,960
My finger stuck to a wall.

829
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,960
You shouldn't do it because you're going to get lacerations.

830
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,960
I have an immediate answer.

831
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:55,960
And likely have no legal recourse.

832
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,960
You know what? You're better than Carter.

833
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:58,960
Thank you.

834
00:47:58,960 --> 00:47:59,960
Don't say that.

835
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:00,960
You're way better than Carter.

836
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:01,960
Thank you.

837
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,960
Carter would not answer that question. He said it was inappropriate, but you...

838
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:05,960
It's appropriate.

839
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,960
You gave me a good answer.

840
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:08,960
Yeah.

841
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,200
what the fuck and illegal to do it's not illegal to to finger a legal now and

842
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,900
she just made it that's private property. We just made it. It's not

843
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:21,700
illegal to touch never mind. How can I sue KFC for pain and suffering of my

844
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,920
tear meniscus on my left knee and a back pinch nerve? I worked for KFC and I

845
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,040
slip and fall on a raw piece of chicken skin, slip and fail on a raw piece of

846
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,540
chicken skin. Now I'm with a tear meniscus on my left knee and pinchy

847
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:38,780
serve. This happened back in May 2nd, 2018. That's been changing. This is

848
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:41,820
recent. They did this. They were like, oh, I just remember when I slipped on

849
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:44,620
chicken skin. I wonder if I can get anything. This should be like

850
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,100
like a sports injury, I think, qualified for that. You need to go to us. But

851
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:53,140
yeah, torn meniscus is like plenty of, plenty of football players. Yeah. You

852
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:56,940
trip on a piece of raw meat. Yeah, classic. Yeah. It's like our skin. You're

853
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:00,740
out for a cut, some chicken skin. You're out for four or five years. KFC could

854
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:05,280
Kentucky football championship. Probably is certainly be well. Here's another fast

855
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:09,220
food one. Can I sue McDonald's over there being snot like substance in my

856
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:13,360
drink? I don't know if intentional or not still unacceptable during covid

857
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,080
just

858
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:20,920
just was getting some hot acts and hot chocolate to start of my morning. I've

859
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,100
never had any problems before at any other locations till this morning. I

860
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,460
order hot chocolate with my meal, but when I drank it tasted like a slimy

861
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:27,980
goopy

862
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:28,480
you

863
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:45,880
like a slimy

864
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:54,720
amazing line to be given. I this is like to go to court. It tasted like a

865
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,840
slimy gooby your honor. It tasted like a slimy gooby, the gooby. We please bring

866
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,220
up the slimy gooby. The taste was

867
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:06,400
and we substance all over it really don't have words to describe texture. It

868
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,200
was same texture like snot use my fork and scraped up a lots from the inside. I

869
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:13,160
have photos I can provide if needed just need place to send them. I'm never

870
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:17,240
usually that guy, but this is my first time ever actually feeling like I have

871
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:20,480
to leave a report. I'm open to being tested or whatever to prove it's not my

872
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:20,840
own.

873
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,840
he kept the slimy gooby. It was a good man. We took a photo, but yeah,

874
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:29,980
it's going to test it. Yeah, he's keeping it man in this. This needs to

875
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:30,200
go to

876
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:34,760
I had to so many of this type of thing of finding slime or gooby. This should

877
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:35,000
be

878
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,760
as gooby. You know the material. This is not a one for everyone keeps it as

879
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,240
the one of as the one. Oh yeah, everyone says I still have it. I put it

880
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,260
in my fridge. I don't think that this is a problem for the United States

881
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,840
support system. This is a problem for Mori yeah. This is a a more. It is not

882
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:55,600
your gooby

883
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,920
by your

884
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,600
fucking gooby

885
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:08,600
fifty back flips in a row, not my gooby. The gooby does not belong to you.

886
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:14,000
Here's the next one. Can a police officer use a slim Jim to enter my car

887
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,360
without my permission? I just want to read the full thing for that. Oh, this

888
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,580
next one is horrible. This is one of the most horrible things I've ever read. I

889
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:25,700
went to the county health department to get a pap smear and the doctor got the

890
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,580
speculum stuck in my vagina. What did you look up to find this speculum? No,

891
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:34,540
I searched I'm trying to remember what I searched. It was not vagina Papa. I

892
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,460
always all the grossest most horrible ones. I always find because I searched

893
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,480
something innocuous and then something crazy comes yeah, the doctor I went to

894
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,140
get a pap smear. The doctor did not lubricate the speculum before and

895
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:47,320
certain after the pap was done. She was unable to remove the speculum. She said

896
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,620
the speculum was stuck because she could not get it to close. He started

897
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,120
pushing, pulling and twisting the speculum while it was inside of me.

898
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,320
When that did not work, she started opening it wider.

899
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,840
She said in a panic voice it stuck and I can't get it out.

900
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:04,540
She it's just so horrible. This is why men should be the gynecologist, not

901
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:08,820
women, because I don't care what they feel yeah. This one is just rip it out.

902
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:12,680
Oh okay, here's the next one. You know, like I shouldn't I should have taken

903
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:15,360
that one out hurts really bad. Of course it does, but I don't care. I have a

904
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:19,400
penis. All right, my husband purchased and consumed Gatorade with slime and

905
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,480
worm looking thing in it. He drank four before he discovered it now sick. What

906
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,780
record should we follow? He drink a worm in the

907
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:30,120
you got for Gatorades with slime and worm door. There's a bunch more

908
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,000
Chad, which I made a mountain do the fly in it

909
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,420
made a mountain eight drank me

910
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:41,960
make mountain do. Here's the next question. It's under internet law. Is

911
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,700
illegal to sell slime at schools in Ohio. Oh yes,

912
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:49,520
most normal school in Ohio, slime selling school,

913
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,680
here's the next one a little close to home. Can I sue tick tock for destroying

914
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:58,740
my marriage? My husband was home during cove in for a while and now my marriage

915
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:02,480
is destroyed. All he does is watch video after video. We argue about this every

916
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,100
day. He doesn't talk to me or hear nothing. I say this is one of the most

917
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:09,140
common problems in all of America at the moment. This is the cove in tick tock

918
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:12,900
but ninety percent of white people are getting divorced. My wife and I here's

919
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,720
the next one. My wife and I lived at twenty one Totten street in Bethpage,

920
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,600
New York. During that time, they dug gunk out of the ground. They're

921
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:19,120
grooming

922
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:25,220
is a full orc life. Yeah, I dug gunk out of

923
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,040
now. What I did is I took out the body of this one, because this one is

924
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,700
actually brutal. Is there suddenly really sad and there's the wife got

925
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,120
cancer from the gunk? It was cancerous gun. It was cancerous. I don't want to

926
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:39,400
hear about all this, so you don't have to hear about that part. I hate what

927
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,240
should I do if I found a rubber jelly like

928
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:47,280
my bag of chips, I was eating my chips when I almost finished when I reach in

929
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,280
the bag, grab the last of my chips and put it in my mouth. I immediately felt

930
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:54,160
something blueberry jelly like substance in my mouth, so I went to the kitchen

931
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,360
sink and threw it in the sink. I then grabbed it and put it in the bag that I

932
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:01,760
was eating. I this would ruin my day, finding bad blueberry rubber,

933
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,440
blueberry rubbery jelly. I love the narration of always what they do.

934
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,540
they're always like they say well. I was eating, then I tasted a blubbery,

935
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:15,160
rubbery, gooby, and then I threw it. I threw my gooby back in the bag,

936
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,940
my blueberry gooby. All right, here's a here's one. I want to hear from you

937
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,780
about this is, I think your area of expert. All right, all right, there's a

938
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:27,940
question about intellectual property. Oh me. Do you put the app word on your

939
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,520
trademark, such as peanut butter and jelly a little ignorant about

940
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,280
trademarking?

941
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:36,320
what does that mean? Do you put the app word on your trademark such as

942
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,520
peanut butter and jelly at

943
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,480
peanut butter?

944
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:43,400
He's going to see if

945
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,160
you should trademark the word peanut butter and jelly or it's a trademark

946
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:53,720
peanut butter and jelly. I see now he's saying he's starting an app. It's

947
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:54,080
either

948
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:55,640
apple

949
00:54:55,640 --> 00:55:00,320
trying to

950
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,120
trademark

951
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,620
do we see if this app

952
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:06,900
I need to see

953
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,240
I'm going to see if this is oh my God, it's so funny to make an app called

954
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:15,920
peanut butter and jelly. It's even funnier to try and copyright the words

955
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,840
peanut butter and jelly peanut butter and jelly. This has to be out right now.

956
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:23,120
Wait a minute, peanut butter and jelly TV

957
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:32,180
that's pbj tv peanut butter and jelly at jello balo. He might be stuck on the

958
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,380
intellectual property tree. I'm also just seeing jello balo peanut butter,

959
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:42,180
jelly time and subs subs is an app for sandwich recipes. Okay, cool and then

960
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:46,580
the garden of bun bun. All right, what do you think peanut butter, jelly app or

961
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:50,000
peanut butter, jelly, peanut butter and jelly app? It has to be. I still have a

962
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,340
much more, so I'm going to start going fast. I found a bunch of good ones. This

963
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,240
don't. I think this actually means something, but I could not stop laughing

964
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:01,680
at just at the just this phrase is penal code two one one considered a wobbler.

965
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:08,580
If I did not go to prison but received a felony, it's penal code two one one

966
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:13,100
one, a wall, a vote because he wobbled, I guess he's a it's a wobbler yeah.

967
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:17,920
He's a wobbler question can sued Duncan Donuts. I eat croissant that has rubber

968
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:18,360
glove.

969
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:25,760
it's so funny to me to imagine eating a croissant that has a rubber glove. What

970
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,180
is this?

971
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:31,520
Did you get the peanut butter jelly? You tell me

972
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:43,020
peanut butter jelly up

973
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:50,160
okay next one. Okay, I understand the floor had a crack in it and a bubble

974
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,840
underneath the crack in which, when I took the next step, I trip

975
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,020
I love starting with

976
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:00,280
okay, I'm coming to you because I finally got what happened to me. It's an

977
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:04,200
excellent legal recourse. Okay, I understand, I understand. Can I sue the

978
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,720
company that makes bubble day game for false advertisement? I downloaded the

979
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:10,320
game that said you will win money. If you get ten thousand points

980
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:11,760
bubble,

981
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,040
here's another intellectual property question. Can I make custom South Park

982
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:23,040
characters. No, no, you cannot don't my God. Try this next one is the most evil

983
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:27,120
thing I've ever seen on this website. This is so horrible. Is it illegal to

984
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,040
give a minor sperm so they have a child? I'm very curious if this would be

985
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:35,160
illegal. Could I be charged with something if I did give my sperm to a

986
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:38,600
minor? I'm twenty four and she is fifteen. There will be no sex just

987
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:41,840
giving her my sperm. Is that illegal? Yeah,

988
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:46,480
kill yourself. I mean it's a loop. He found the loop

989
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:46,980
so

990
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:53,820
I found so much stuff like this on this website, because I search a birthday,

991
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,580
because I was trying to find stuff like oh so and so ruin my birthday

992
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:00,040
celebration or something and it's all can I have sex with this girl? Her

993
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:03,100
birthday is twenty eleven. Birthdays only in two hundred and four months,

994
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:08,640
yeah horrible found this creature inside my bag of candy. So my question is who

995
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:12,680
do I need to talk to about this? I brought some gummy jolly rancher candy

996
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:15,880
and I found this creature inside my bag of candy. So my question is who do I

997
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:19,120
I had to talk to about this creature and I've been vomiting since I saw it

998
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,120
inside of my bag. Well, just by seeing it,

999
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:25,760
incredibly powerful, this is the most disgusting creature in the world. Can I

1000
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:29,560
get sued from an injury which required surgery due to consensual rough house?

1001
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,380
I was at my neighbor's barbecue, the homeowner, his friend and myself were

1002
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:36,160
the only three left at the bar. We were having cocktails and having a good time.

1003
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,460
The host was telling me that he wasn't a big fan of our neighbor across the

1004
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,440
street because he was coming on to his wife. Jokingly, I mentioned that he's a

1005
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,400
pretty big guy and he'd have his have his hands full. If they squared up, he

1006
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,120
told me that he was a golden gloves boxer and would have no issues. My comment was

1007
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,020
well, if he knows any grappling, there could be an issue. He walked around the

1008
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,980
bar and started jokingly throwing blows at me and a few landed on the ribs. As I

1009
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,760
was backing up, he threw a few more blows, at which point I came in very

1010
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,740
close with a wrestling jujitsu move and picked him up and laid him down on the

1011
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:03,100
ground and locked him up, never intending to hurt him. He has a torn

1012
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:06,660
rotator cuff. The move is not intended to damage, but more of a submission

1013
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,780
application. I went back the following day and learned he needed surgery. He

1014
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:12,500
told me everything was okay. He had great insurance. We agreed to split the

1015
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:17,600
copay. I'm now getting nasty grams from his wife. Am I liable nasty gram?

1016
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,040
What's a nasty nasty gram for

1017
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:25,840
I got a nasty gram from his wife as I laid him down. I put him on my gram.

1018
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:30,540
Yeah, just somebody knocking at the door. My husband nasty gram. You had my

1019
00:59:30,540 --> 00:59:32,240
husband, asshole,

1020
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,640
I'm gonna eat shit in front of you.

1021
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,640
Okay, here's another long nasty gram. Our pictures of cartoon minors being

1022
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:44,240
tickled illegal. Yes, I have clicked on many images of teen male cartoons

1023
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,480
being tickled over the past few years. They have usually been between the ages

1024
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,380
of fifteen to seventeen, though there have been a few younger ones. In most

1025
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:53,280
instances, the teens are clothed. Sometimes they've been half clothed.

1026
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,680
There have been a couple instances where they haven't been clothed. I normally

1027
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:01,160
try staying eighteen plus as much as possible, but the site where I browse is

1028
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:04,680
very liberal as far as these pictures go, and it's easy to click on a picture

1029
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:07,400
that's previewed on an existing page. So you may not necessarily know the

1030
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,840
character is below eighteen until you click the thumbnail version.

1031
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:13,060
Currently, I'm trying to get my computer and phone investigated for hacking.

1032
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:16,280
However, the company I want to work with states in their authorization for

1033
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,700
anything illegal that's readily apparent found while doing digital forensics

1034
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,600
will be reported to the authorities. My question is what I've described

1035
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,960
illegal. Is it considered underage pornography and is it prosecutable for

1036
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,640
a live follow up question? How old is sponge bob

1037
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,180
if you had to guess how old is sponge bob

1038
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:43,080
and then we have I was watching the original karate kid wax on wax off and

1039
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,560
learning karate. Then I went to the kitchen and accidentally struck my

1040
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,320
husband as I practiced and what a coincidence it was after I read his text

1041
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:51,900
with another woman. Now I have a dv court date, but a woman, I am a woman,

1042
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,080
plus I was just practicing karate. Wow, that is the most amazing defense. I've

1043
01:00:56,080 --> 01:01:00,660
ever heard you rage punch your husband. You say I was practicing. I was simply

1044
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:06,480
Wax on, wax off. Wax on, wax off from the karate. You have to pick a movie that is

1045
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,640
old, 'cause everybody in the jury's seen The Karate Kid. Yeah. And then you have

1046
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,040
to show the move. And it has to be a crowd pleaser movie. Exactly. And guess

1047
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,420
what he does in the movie? He fucks it up plenty of times. But he always gets

1048
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:21,560
back up. But he always gets back up. Just like you in court. And if your

1049
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:24,640
husband had watched The Karate Kid, maybe he would have gotten back up.

1050
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:29,640
After the... What's the thing he no can defend from? Punch. This one.

1051
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:35,520
the crane, the crane thing, never seen karate kid, me neither fuck. So here's

1052
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:40,660
just a few more of my last work. I though can I say can I say Waldo inspired

1053
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:45,240
for a bikini I am making? Yes, you can say that if you want, you can say that

1054
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:48,640
here's another one here like you can't find the bikini because it's so micro

1055
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:52,840
now just that stripes. I think shut up, sorry, I'm sorry to get really is it

1056
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:57,680
illegal to transform movie characters in Photoshop? Yes, transforming to what

1057
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:01,720
transform them. You can not turn to is it illegal to transform. I think it is by

1058
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:04,800
definition transformative and then here's the last one. This one is really

1059
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:09,160
cracking me up. Just I don't know why I was injured inside a store. A young girl

1060
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:14,200
hit me on my right knee with a Santa Claus pole. My lawyer says to settle. He

1061
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:17,920
wants to settle for five dollars. Just the phrase a Santa Claus pole really was

1062
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,240
getting the class. She hit me with a Santa Claus.

1063
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:26,040
I think that's a death penalty situation. Yeah, yeah, all right, so these that the

1064
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:32,800
gooby thing really fucking killed me. I tasted a slimy gooby. Oh my God.

1065
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,840
Slimy, slimy gooby. I found a rubber jelly in my gooby.

1066
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,840
My gooby.

1067
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:44,240
Alright, so here are my slides now. There's a lot more.

1068
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:49,480
So this first one I looked up, this is how I would find stuff. I just wanted to

1069
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:53,800
show my process. So I would do the site thing and I found

1070
01:02:53,800 --> 01:03:01,400
I just really loved this good day. My name is Darren Dukie of Trinidad.

1071
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,360
Okay, tell him what you told me about. Then I looked up Darren Dukie. I

1072
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:10,380
think Darren Dukie killed somebody. Whoa and he said the case was called like

1073
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,800
the people of Trinidad versus

1074
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:13,900
yeah,

1075
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:20,420
this next one. Is it illegal to post a video taken in my own home of a person

1076
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:24,200
reading is boogers. I know it's gross and there was no answer for that, which

1077
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:28,100
sucks. It's illegal. I would say it's fully illegal. It's fully illegal. This

1078
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:28,700
next one.

1079
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:33,900
How do I answer Liga without being delusional or pathetic? That was a good

1080
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,680
search term, was pathetic. It was a lot of very, very sad people asking

1081
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,180
questions.

1082
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:43,260
This net and then the legal author expert says, I apologize, but I do not

1083
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:46,620
understand the question. Could you please clarify for me? And then they

1084
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:50,860
said, well, Liga was a client. We had a love affair shortly. I told her that I'd pay her

1085
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:55,820
back for her plane ticket to fly from Copenhagen to Kansas City, 2000-ish dollars. I'd pay her

1086
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:59,900
back the money she loaned me when I was in a jam, but she and I had a falling out during

1087
01:03:59,900 --> 01:04:03,500
that trip. She still wants to pay it back. I can't pay it yet. Is there an issue? Also,

1088
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,220
I have a question concerning my business startup. Is it okay to start an L-- if I start it--

1089
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:12,340
or is it okay to start it without an LLC for the first months? And the legal author only

1090
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,340
answered the LLC question.

1091
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:17,020
LLC question. Of course. Well yeah, there's not, there's no like a law.

1092
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:17,340
Yeah,

1093
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:19,260
and then this next one,

1094
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:25,540
is it legal for me to pay to eat poop from a dominatrix as it comes out of her

1095
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:26,980
if her and I are both willing?

1096
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:32,460
Which then D Winogo Esquire experts said, what state are you located in? They

1097
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:37,300
said Indiana, and they said, there is no statute or regulation prohibiting eating

1098
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:42,820
feces. Moreover, Indiana Code 35-45-4-2 defines prostitution as someone who

1099
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:47,060
performs or offers or agrees to perform sexual intercourse or a

1100
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:48,760
deviate sexual conduct.

1101
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,560
Therefore, it is not illegal as long as you are not engaging in

1102
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:54,260
deviate sexual conduct with the Dominic jurors concurrently,

1103
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,260
which the other person has.

1104
01:04:55,260 --> 01:04:56,460
Okay, I understand.

1105
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:59,760
So with the same answer apply to having the dominatrix perform

1106
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,260
cock and ball torture and letting me on me and letting me

1107
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:05,860
and letting her kick me in the balls ball busting or cuckolding

1108
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,960
me if we are both ball busting and I would be paying for all

1109
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:09,560
this. Thanks.

1110
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,360
And then Dee Winogo says absolutely and they said I wanted

1111
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:14,520
to make sure that you understood what cuckolding

1112
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:22,900
I would be watching the dominatrix have intercourse and after completion,

1113
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:27,320
she would cuckold me by making me lick and eat his come from her. Would that

1114
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:31,320
be legal? Sorry for the delays. I had to leave town for a couple of days.

1115
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,040
Yes, the same statute and answer I previously provided would apply to the

1116
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:39,960
cuckolding situation as well. Would that be considered a deviant sexual act or

1117
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:43,420
sexual conduct when she would make me lick another man's come from her

1118
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:47,020
private area after they've had sex. If you are paying her, then odds are yes,

1119
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:50,660
it would be considered deviant sexual conduct and you can get charged

1120
01:05:50,660 --> 01:05:54,100
criminally with soliciting prostitution. Okay, so then if I'm not paying her, it

1121
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,380
would be legal. Yes, as long as there's no money involved, this is legal. This

1122
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:02,500
case needs to hit court because I need to hear the old judge go and what is

1123
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:03,500
ball busting

1124
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:10,620
I love the jury one ball. I love Bt. I loved so much that he was like okay.

1125
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:12,640
I'm not sure you know what

1126
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:17,180
I just like to clarify I'm eating his come out of her, but

1127
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:23,100
this next one had no answer, but it was a customer saying I use to profanity

1128
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:27,420
words and a fax to a lawyer, asshole and jerk face and now he wants to take me

1129
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:31,260
to court. I'm profanity charges. I want to go in alone and represent myself

1130
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:35,040
because I am not going to fight it. I was wrong and they can rule whatever

1131
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,320
they want against me. Do I or should I really need a lawyer with me?

1132
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:41,960
Yes. Cussing is illegal. We've talked about it. Cussing is so illegal. I'm

1133
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:46,720
the number one lawyer. I work on so many profanity cases. Cusses are illegal,

1134
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:51,880
but cussing is different from mom to mom. So it really depends on what

1135
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:55,800
your mom says. Your honor, my client, you thought he said shit,

1136
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:58,600
but you didn't hear after he said, "Tucky mushrooms."

1137
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:04,200
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. See, we had you, he might be saying fudge.

1138
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:05,600
Fudge.

1139
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,560
Your honor, have you not enjoyed a steaming bowl of fudge? Exactly.

1140
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,640
Every house was different. I was in a lot of like, God dang, a lot of people...

1141
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,440
I couldn't say sucks. Yeah, I couldn't say sucks. I could say all the swears.

1142
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,720
Or shut up. I couldn't say screw. Now, screw is a cuss in my house.

1143
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:26,120
So it really... And some people had... I went over to my friend's house

1144
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:30,120
and his parents let him say, "Fuck this, fuck that, fuck the dinner that I'm eating."

1145
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:31,120
So it really is a dinner.

1146
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,120
I was told in third grade that jerk is a swear.

1147
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,120
Suck my dinner up my ass.

1148
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:36,120
Oh, suck my...

1149
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,120
Do I sit down at the table telling grandpa that?

1150
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,120
Hey, grandpa, suck my dinner up my ass.

1151
01:07:41,120 --> 01:07:42,120
Up my ass.

1152
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:43,120
That's a pretty good...

1153
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:44,120
Actually, you should be able to say that.

1154
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,120
Suck my dinner up my ass.

1155
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:46,120
Suck my dinner.

1156
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:48,120
Suck my dinner, it depends on the food.

1157
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:50,120
Maybe you have like a savory lollipop.

1158
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,120
Stink my dinner.

1159
01:07:51,120 --> 01:07:53,120
I could say stinks instead of sucks.

1160
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:54,120
Lick my bob.

1161
01:07:54,120 --> 01:08:00,680
Bob, I was a stick my Bob my D. That's my D mom wet my Bob or like my thing

1162
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:02,640
yeah. Any of that should be stick my finger,

1163
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,320
lick my finger, because then they say where you say, what what are you

1164
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:12,920
anywhere? Yeah, my stick it and then okay, this next one I did something

1165
01:08:12,920 --> 01:08:17,000
incredibly stupid today. While there is no question, it was stupid. I wanted to

1166
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:17,880
see if it was illegal.

1167
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:22,560
I was at a trade show in Las Vegas and I got a call for an emergency and had to

1168
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,160
early when I parked this morning it was a single stop bought up against a concrete barrier

1169
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,940
in front. I entered the parking lot to find someone had parked directly behind me less

1170
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:35,040
than a foot in the spot that wasn't a space and was sticking out into the roadway not

1171
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:39,040
having time. I spent the next five minutes and 100 turns getting my truck out from front

1172
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,800
of turns. This guy's playing boulders. I know making sure I didn't hit his vehicle in the

1173
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:49,700
process scraping up my bumper on the concrete concrete upset. I wrote a note great job parking

1174
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:55,100
like an asshole directly behind me when there's not even a spot insensitive

1175
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:58,980
bastard and left it underneath his windshield wiper. Looking back, it was

1176
01:08:58,980 --> 01:09:02,780
rude and stupid, but it was was it illegal under Nevada law? I didn't

1177
01:09:02,780 --> 01:09:07,660
threaten him or touch his vehicle. That is the most ex Mormon fucking thing I've

1178
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:13,420
ever heard. Hey, go suck a lollipop. Yeah, what is he? What is he says? Great

1179
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:18,540
job parking like an asshole directly behind sarcasm. Not even a spot in

1180
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:24,540
In Nevada? Insensitive bastard. Is Nevada where ex-Mormons moved to? I think so, yeah.

1181
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:28,540
Because it's the opposite of Utah. I think there's a lot of Mormons in Nevada also.

1182
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:32,540
There's two cities of sin in Nevada. What's... Reno. Las Vegas and Reno. The

1183
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:37,540
whole state of sin, basically, if you ask me. This is Sodom and Gomorrah.

1184
01:09:37,540 --> 01:09:42,540
Nevada, more like never had a good thought or emotion in my life. Or impulse when I was

1185
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:47,540
in Nevada because I was gambling and drinking Sprite. Never had a chance to go

1186
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:52,700
chance to go to heaven, never had one and Nevada backwards is heaven. Wow, I think it's it's

1187
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:58,500
head of a bad a about a cadaver. Yeah, it's a magic or this next one.

1188
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:05,400
I have taking the company computer with the out of the office to my home to review more

1189
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:08,200
trash on it of turning it.

1190
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:15,300
I am thinking of turning of turning it over to the law. Some of the girls looking young.

1191
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:20,580
he was on a teen porno site, comma, comma, comma, comma, every ellipsis is a comma.

1192
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:23,280
Just let the law check it.

1193
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:28,480
And if no one is under 18, I'll jam it and give it back to him.

1194
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,040
But if there's a girl under 18, will the law arrest him?

1195
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:33,820
And then I'll arrest you.

1196
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:35,480
Well, that's what P Simmons says.

1197
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,640
P Simmons says, thanks for the chance to help.

1198
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,320
I'm a, I'm an attorney with over 12 years experience.

1199
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,060
Hopefully I can help you with your legal question.

1200
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:42,840
What is going on here?

1201
01:10:42,840 --> 01:10:44,900
You took a computer with child porn on the computer.

1202
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:49,560
I didn't say child porno. I said it was on a teen porno site that can be eighteen

1203
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,960
or nineteen years old. I said some of them would be questionable if they are

1204
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:58,260
under eighteen or under the piece of and says yes. If there's child porn on the

1205
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:02,460
computer, the police can arrest him. My concern is that if you have the computer,

1206
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,560
you're also breaking the law. The best thing to do is turn it over to the

1207
01:11:05,560 --> 01:11:09,060
police and let them investigate pedophile Simmons man. I'm not. Oh my

1208
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:14,960
God. Wait, that's true. Yeah, he's covering his ass. This next one is this

1209
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:20,440
a strange question. Is there a law about ABDL in public? And then Isaac Esquire says, Thank

1210
01:11:20,440 --> 01:11:24,160
you for your question, but please permit me to assist you with your concerns. I happen

1211
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:28,380
to be a Pennsylvania license. My apologies, but by ABDL, do you mean adult baby diaper

1212
01:11:28,380 --> 01:11:33,160
lover or something else? If not, I just want to answer the question properly. Yes, adult

1213
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:37,960
baby diaper lover. Hi, there is no law against it. The only law is based on decency, which

1214
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,680
means that so long as genitalia is covered up, sincerely, Demetri Esquire.

1215
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:50,440
Okay, so apparently I like that the Isaac knew what a B D L meant yeah. He

1216
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:53,820
certainly I think he probably Googled it. Yeah, can you imagine if

1217
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:58,720
here's the here's the the troll you pull right? You ask this question, the

1218
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:03,640
process. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you mean a B D L is that adult baby diaper lover? I

1219
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:07,620
think I'm not and you say what the hell are you talking about? What the here's

1220
01:12:07,620 --> 01:12:12,200
the no I do if they ask me is it is it legal to be a B D L? I just send

1221
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:14,240
Sure fucking hope not.

1222
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:16,240
Then you're the master troll.

1223
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,240
And then you get five stars.

1224
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,240
Yeah, exactly.

1225
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,240
This next one. This is embarrassing, but please bear with me.

1226
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,240
I have an unhealthy hobby of watching porn.

1227
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,240
I was recently searching for videos with Google

1228
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,240
and I searched for something that isn't appropriate

1229
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,240
because the word I used doesn't mean what I thought it meant.

1230
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,240
Google brought up a page that let me know what I searched for was illegal.

1231
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:34,240
I never saw any picture or video, just that message from Google.

1232
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,240
Should I be expecting a visit from authorities?

1233
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:38,240
So what do you guys think the word was?

1234
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,240
What is the word?

1235
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:42,240
is the word. Alien.

1236
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:50,080
It's illegal. Is it legal to look at alien porn? It can't be legal. It

1237
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,000
shouldn't be legal. It should not be legal. Does Google give you a warning

1238
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:56,640
if you search something illegal? I think so. That's awesome. But the warning...

1239
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,120
This is what the customer said. Thank you, Google. This is what the customer

1240
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:05,320
said. "For some crazy reason, I thought Lolita meant a beautiful Hispanic

1241
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:05,860
woman.

1242
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:10,780
So when I search for Lolita hand job, oh my God,

1243
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:14,900
let me know that what I search for was illegal. This is two days ago and I've

1244
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:18,580
been freaking out ever since because I thought because I looked up the actual

1245
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,920
definition of Lolita. As long as I didn't view any material and I didn't break

1246
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,260
any child porn laws right, having it accidentally open for a second or so is

1247
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:29,920
not equivalent to watching. I like that defense. He only watch it for one

1248
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,960
second. Yeah, the hoops, the shut it off that pedophiles will jump through to

1249
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:41,600
make what they're doing legal. I wish that I children, I wish that every other

1250
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,900
criminal was doing this. I wish there were questions on this website like like

1251
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:50,300
so I technically may have accidentally killed a guy, but like I only

1252
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:55,480
did I was only was for a second. It was only for a second that I was choking

1253
01:13:55,480 --> 01:14:00,480
him out and then like just all these these excuses and it's it's unbelievable.

1254
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,560
It really is amazing. These guys are kind of master. This is why I know

1255
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,700
kind of master debaters you were talking about people asking questions on this

1256
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:14,220
website right. You know, I guess well, I guess I tried to get my own legal

1257
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:17,020
advice. You're kidding. I tried to click next. I try was trying to do that, too,

1258
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:20,160
but I changed my mind. I tried to get my own legal advice on something. Now I

1259
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:23,640
want you to look at my conversation really quick. Okay, okay, no

1260
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:28,320
welcome. How can I help with your legal question? Hello? Yes, it has recently

1261
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,520
come to my attention that an employee of mine has stolen my designs and started

1262
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:38,020
own clothing company. How do I sue him? The lawyer can help you determine if you have a

1263
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:41,280
case. Where are you located? These laws vary by state. I am located in New York City, but

1264
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:50,280
my client is in Mexico. My employee is the most famous singer in Mexico. He is 19 and

1265
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:54,900
weighs 90 pounds. He likes Chalamet. He dances better than most and I am upset he has gone

1266
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:59,240
behind my back and I want retribution. They said chat is completed. They did not want

1267
01:14:59,240 --> 01:15:02,200
to take this case on. They did not want to take this case on.

1268
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,240
Are you fucking serious?

1269
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,240
Jubio, what is this?

1270
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:06,240
Go next.

1271
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,240
Jubio, what is this?

1272
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,240
Oh my god.

1273
01:15:08,240 --> 01:15:12,240
What is jubio.bigcartel.com/products?

1274
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:14,240
The Jubio Stellar hoodie?

1275
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:17,240
What have you done? You've taken my designs.

1276
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:20,240
The Jubio Authentic Center hoodie?

1277
01:15:20,240 --> 01:15:24,240
You have taken my designs from me and you have started your own clothing brand?

1278
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:28,240
I've been sitting on this Jubio merch forever.

1279
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:33,760
and you haven't I haven't put it that well my design was that the island was

1280
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:38,260
going to be the dot on the eye that's a better design is a better design and

1281
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:42,980
Jubia ripped it off and made it and why is it in pounds that's a good point I

1282
01:15:42,980 --> 01:15:49,160
guess it's why are you paying for this in GBP euros your euros rather he's not

1283
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:55,040
answering well that's because I think that this is a different jujubio this is

1284
01:15:55,040 --> 01:16:00,240
is a different Jubio or J U Bio J U Bio yeah yeah.

1285
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:05,740
These are just under well, then how are these designs so similar to my just

1286
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,940
under beach? Well, it's somebody else ripped you off and you know what they

1287
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:13,320
also ripped off Jubio's name. So we have a case together. We have a kit. You guys

1288
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,620
have a co case, which is good because this is going to dip into international

1289
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:20,280
law. This is good. Oh yeah, because I'm not qualified. Holy shit. I've actually

1290
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:25,020
been completely banned from participating in and this might even be maritime law.

1291
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:31,220
if there's a so this means it's legal to do killing. Is it legal to kill someone

1292
01:16:31,220 --> 01:16:35,140
in the fucking ocean? Yes, you're real. Yes, if you just go 20 miles off of New

1293
01:16:35,140 --> 01:16:37,540
Jersey, you can kill no not 20, but like a lot more.

1294
01:16:37,540 --> 01:16:42,740
I think that the country that the person is from would be mad at you. Well,

1295
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:47,260
but being mad is fine. I don't care. I think that you wouldn't be able to go

1296
01:16:47,260 --> 01:16:50,420
to that country anymore. Okay, so depending on where it was, they might

1297
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:54,220
get you suck because it's like the thing where someone does something bad and

1298
01:16:54,220 --> 01:16:57,540
other country says you got to like in the dark night extra day and kill someone

1299
01:16:57,540 --> 01:17:01,580
from the United Kingdom in the ocean. Yes, and just never go well, it depends,

1300
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:05,940
but I bet that the US would send would get you and send you there. Why to get

1301
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:10,460
in trouble because they're fucking narcs man. I'm a Republican. They don't care

1302
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:13,540
about that. Honestly, the people at the top for them. It's not about Democrat

1303
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:17,220
Republican. It's about this either. You got money or you don't. Okay, so I have a

1304
01:17:17,220 --> 01:17:19,980
lot of money. You don't. Well, you got a lot of money. You got enough to get on a

1305
01:17:19,980 --> 01:17:23,340
boat. Honestly, even the people who have a lot of money in this in our lives like

1306
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:25,980
$100,000, $200,000, that's literally nothing.

1307
01:17:25,980 --> 01:17:27,620
How could that be nothing?

1308
01:17:27,620 --> 01:17:29,020
That's a grain of sand.

1309
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,540
They could buy 20 of these hoodies.

1310
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:32,020
They could buy more than that.

1311
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:33,580
They could buy 20 and just give them out.

1312
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:37,460
Well, I guess if they only have 20 in stock, they could probably only buy 20.

1313
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:43,540
Well guys, this concludes the episode about legal advice.

1314
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:52,380
And if you have money, send $5 to patreon.com/podcastaboutlist where you can see new type of files.

1315

of Dragons, the shareholder meeting.

1316
01:17:54,380 --> 01:17:57,380
Speaking of the shareholder meeting, what day is it this month, Julio?

1317
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:58,380
Beers We Drank.

1318
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:00,380
I remember it's on a Sunday.

1319
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:02,380
What?

1320
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,380
28th?

1321
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:06,380
Sunday, January 28th will be the shareholder meeting.

1322
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:10,380
That's on Discord, so join the executive producer tier on Patreon and then join.

1323
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:11,380
Make sure you're in the Discord.

1324
01:18:11,380 --> 01:18:15,380
And also this weekend, Friday and Saturday, I'm going to be opening up for

1325
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:19,380
little Adam Friedland in a tiny town called Tampa, Florida.

1326
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,380
Where are you playing?

1327
01:18:20,380 --> 01:18:22,740
The Crazy Comedy Village.

1328
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:25,540
Is it really called The Crazy Comedy Village?

1329
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:26,540
It's something along those lines.

1330
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:27,700
It has a really stupid name.

1331
01:18:27,700 --> 01:18:29,460
It's going to be really, really bad.

1332
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:30,460
These shows are going to be terrible.

1333
01:18:30,460 --> 01:18:31,460
Please, please, please come out.

1334
01:18:31,460 --> 01:18:35,260
Please, and just brighten my day just a little bit.

1335
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:38,140
It's going to be so fucking hell being in Tampa.

1336
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,140
He's going to try to make me go to a strip club or something.

1337
01:18:41,140 --> 01:18:42,860
Tampa's nice this time of year.

1338
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:43,860
I like movies.

1339
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:44,860
Tampa sucks.

1340
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:45,860
No, I'm not a fan of this area.

1341
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:46,860
It's trash.

1342
01:18:46,860 --> 01:18:47,860
Tampa's a junkyard.

1343
01:18:47,860 --> 01:18:48,860
We went to Tampa.

1344
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,860
We went to Tampa two years ago.

1345
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,860
So if you live there, come on out, bitch.

1346
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,860
We went to Tampa two years ago for

1347
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,860
FYA festival, was it?

1348
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:58,860
Yes. And we got accosted by

1349
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,860
an Uber driver.

1350
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,860
Accosted? A guy talked to us and

1351
01:19:02,860 --> 01:19:04,860
while he was driving us.

1352
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:06,860
Say what it was!

1353
01:19:06,860 --> 01:19:08,860
He verbally assaulted us.

1354
01:19:08,860 --> 01:19:10,860
By saying what? He said,

1355
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,860
"We were taking an Uber to Waffle House and he said,

1356
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:14,860
'You know Waffle House sucks, right?'"

1357
01:19:14,860 --> 01:19:16,860
I said, "No, it doesn't."

1358
01:19:16,860 --> 01:19:20,360
drivers. And you were acting like this is not a crime against us that we could sue this

1359
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:26,040
man. He said "accosted". He accosted us. This is a crime against the most of us. He drove

1360
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:29,120
you there and you paid him. No, no, no, no, no. He can say whatever he wants. He verbally

1361
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:35,880
assaulted us. Alright, well, every other building in Tampa is an adult video store. Alright,

1362
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:39,120
well then I think I'm going to have a good time. Thank you guys so much. We'll see you

1363
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:40,120
next time.

1364
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,200
(static)

1365
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:45,440
- Maybe.

1366
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,260
- I have another question.

1367
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:47,100
Do you guys fucking hate me?

1368
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:48,320
(laughs)

1369
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:50,160
You guys fucking hate me, wish I was fucking dead.

1370
01:19:50,160 --> 01:19:51,000
- That's a bad prank.

1371
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:51,820
- That is a bad prank.

1372
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,080
- I'm not good at pranks, man.

1373
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,600
I'm famously bad at pranks.

1374
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:56,040
- You're bad at pranks and you have a prank face.

1375
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,620
Your prank face is this.

1376
01:19:57,620 --> 01:19:59,960
- I haven't done pranks since when I was a kid,

1377
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,360
I did the bucket of water on the door to my brother

1378
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:04,200
and he cried.

1379
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,280
- You do this when you're--

1380
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:06,800
- My older brother, six years old.

1381
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:08,480
- You have no poker face for pranks

1382
01:20:08,480 --> 01:20:11,920
is when you do a prank, you have a little, you have like a bobblehead

1383
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,160
thing.

1384
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,160
I don't bobble my head.

1385
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:15,040
You do this, you go.

1386
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,720
I don't bobble my head.

1387
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:22,960
The other day I got a fake poop and I put it on my kitchen counter as

1388
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:24,000
soon as I got it.

1389
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,200
I zero planning, put it on my kitchen counter and my wife walked in

1390
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:30,880
and got home from work and I said, I'm so bad at pranks.

1391
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,720
I said, hey baby, can you get me a glass of water?

1392
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,240
And I was closer to the kitchen than she was.

1393
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:36,880
I was doing nothing.

1394
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,200
I was just sitting in the hallway.

1395
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
Can you get me a glass of water?

1396
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
It didn't work, man.

1397
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:46,200
She walked in and she was like, "Yeah, there's a fake poop on there."

1398
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:50,200
We were talking about the master troll the other day.

1399
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:54,200
I was trying to think of trolling I had done in the past,

1400
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:58,200
and I remembered something I did in college that I completely forgot about that people got mad at me for.

1401
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:02,200
Do you remember how, at college, it was like they had the,

1402
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:06,200
it was like a school TV network where you get shows,

1403
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,000
It's like they have a staff and you make like, you know, however many episodes or whatever.

1404
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,160
And I never did any of that.

1405
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:18,000
But on Facebook, I posted, I made a fake poster for a show for that called "This Shit Fucks"

1406
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,600
and I said, "I'm excited to announce I'm making one of these shows.

1407
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:29,040
Please message them on Facebook and ask if you want to be on the crew."

1408
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:33,220
And like, "We're going to have a meeting in this room on this day at this time."

1409
01:21:33,220 --> 01:21:38,620
And it was completely not true and fake and a bunch of people messaged the school organization

1410
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,420
and be like, "Hey, can I work on this shit, fucks?"

1411
01:21:40,420 --> 01:21:43,380
And everyone got really mad at me because it wasn't real.

1412
01:21:43,380 --> 01:21:45,380
(Boo!)
