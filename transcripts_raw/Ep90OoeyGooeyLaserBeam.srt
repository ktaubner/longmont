Podcasts for the homeless.

I'm here to announce I'm running for president.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Yeah, I'm actually Justin McElroy and I'm running for vice president and also his brother.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah, now that Pete Buttigieg dropped out, we thought that somebody needed to run who was pretending to be gay for money.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:42,080
Travis. Travis McElroy. Travis put it down. Travis. Travis put it down. Battery. Put it down.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:49,920
Travis ate a battery and this is him now. Travis. We need the nine volts for the smoke detector.

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:59,280
The weed smoking McElroy Brothers. Yeah that's what they need the smoke detector

11
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,660
cuz they'd be smoking inside. Yeah. You know they turn it on so all the

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:13,880
neighbors know. Yeah. And then like you run into the hallway you're like yeah sorry I

13
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,360
know the smoke alarm keeps going off. You're still doing the voice. Cuz it's the McElroy's that do that.

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,360
to do that. They are smoking weed in their apartment. Fuck you man. Fine, never mind. You ruined

15
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,800
my life right then. I did not ruin your life. Keep going. Keep going. Okay, do you really

16
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,960
want me to? Ignore Justin. Can we have a vote? Who wants me to keep going? Me. Well, you

17
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,640
can't vote for the fans. That's half and half. And I am the deciding vote. Patrick's the

18
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,440
new guy, so he doesn't count. True. You are the new guy. You're the new guy. I'm not the

19
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,560
new guy. New guy on the pod. Fresh blood, that's what I call you. I can smell you. You

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,440
You smell one day old. You smell like a baby. You smell like a baby's little diaper. You

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,360
smell like a baby's diaper that Cameron likes to smell. Dude, I'm gonna spear you with my

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,360
ooey gooey laser beam. You're gonna melt. Okay. Yeah, you're gonna melt. And you're gonna

23
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,760
melt into human candy. That's fine. Patrick melts if he touches soda. That's not true.

24
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:12,240
That's true. He drank, was it Baja Blast? Yeah. He drank Baja Blast out of a jelly jar

25
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,960
with the straw. Whoa. It didn't have any jelly in the... That's insane. You know that cup

26
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,360
that I... From Taco Bell? You know that cup that I have? He poured it out of the bottle,

27
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,720
out of a plastic bottle into a little mason jar thing. I needed to drink it through a

28
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,960
straw because sugar hurts my teeth now. I gotta go to the dentist. Maybe you shouldn't

29
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:33,160
be eating sugar then. Yeah, no, I know. Yeah. I had a... Today, like two days ago I found

30
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,720
a pack of cigarettes on the ground that had clearly been run over by a car, so I picked

31
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,360
them up and I did not even have a single thought that that was maybe a bad idea

32
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
until today and I feel like-- How many did you smoke? Huh? How many did you smoke? Six.

33
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,280
Nice. Yeah, there's probably tire stuff on them. Yeah. You know and I'm just inhaling it.

34
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,400
Oh, you got like more dirt? There's more dirt than normal. You got more dirt.

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,880
There are more reds though, you know, they're like a nice cigarette. Extra dirt.

36
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,120
Yeah. Can I get the cigarettes with the extra dirt? Yeah. Can you give me the

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,320
dirtiest cigarette. It's okay, it has a filter on it, it doesn't matter what's in it.

38
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,420
It's true. I got that dirty juice. You know those filters that Hunter S. Thompson used?

39
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:20,000
You know what, no I don't. Like the ones from Fear and Loathing? The white ones? Yeah, like the

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,120
white filters that you put on the ends of cigarettes. I think that's Cruella DeVille. Oh yeah, the holder thing.

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,120
The Pink Panther one. It made me stop smoking cigarettes.

42
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Because you thought, why? Because I watched all the tar build up in it.

43
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,480
wearing fishnets and lounging on the couch with a martini and holding a cigarette holder

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,480
in two fingers.

45
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,640
And he was like, "Maybe I should stop smoking cigarettes."

46
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
I don't like what cigarettes do to me.

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,720
They turn me into a sexy, sultry little bitch who hates Dalmatians.

48
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Yeah.

49
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,640
They turn me into one of the most respected fashion designers in that book.

50
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Cruella DeVille.

51
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,640
Yeah.

52
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,720
Yeah, actually, Cruella DeVille work.

53
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,720
She's getting her money.

00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,600

forget that you have two crazy loud cats yeah yeah listen it catches you off

65
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,600
guard every time somehow. I don't know. Yeah I watched two Godzilla movies today.

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,760
That's all I did. Really? Yeah. Yeah I had to walk home with the bad ankle. I watched... I don't care

67
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,120
about that. Yeah we're talking about Godzilla. Can you just... Hey new guy will you hush?

68
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,880
Son of Godzilla and Destroy All Monsters. Destroy All Monsters? Yeah. Guess what

69
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,560
they do at the end? They don't destroy the monsters. You're correct. They don't destroy any of them.

70
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,920
Yeah. Which... Is that a Godzilla movie? Yeah. Keep up. Godzilla, Destroy All Monsters?

71
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,920
What's the turtle one? It's just called Destroy All Monsters.

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Oh yeah, I've never watched Gamera.

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,920
That one's good, man. Gamera is awesome.

74
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,920
That's good. When does Baby Godzilla come in?

75
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
Baby Godzilla is in- Godzuki?

76
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
First appears in, no, Godzuki's from

77
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,920
Hanna-Barbera. That's the one I know.

78
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Baby- Minilla- I know Godzuki.

79
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
Minilla is in Son of Godzilla.

80
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
But Baby Godzilla is a

81
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
different character that's from- I couldn't get

82
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,920
into Godzilla. Godzilla vs

83
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Mechagodzilla 2 or something? I watched a

84
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
couple of them with, or just like a couple of

85
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:55,680
movies with Cam and Pierce and I really liked them. Not enough to watch them by

86
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,200
myself but they're really fun to watch. I don't think I could ever watch them by myself. I think I've tried.

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:04,880
We should watch them. Did you say you'd think you'd cry? No, yeah. I'd be too scared. The monsters are too big.

88
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,040
No, it's just they're destroying all the cities. They're even destroying schools in that.

89
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,680
That's kind of cool. But they destroy the people's houses too.

90
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,600
They destroy a big building that has a big elevator. Patrick just cries

91
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,280
when he sees more than five Japanese people in the same room. He starts crying and wailing.

92
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,760
Yeah.

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,080
Yeah.

94
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:29,480
So, there's all, they always have like one character who's just an old white guy whose

95
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,400
dialogue is very clearly dubbed into Japanese. He's like, "Why'd you cast that guy?"

96
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,160
Does he still do that?

97
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,440
Like Matthew Broderick?

98
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,440
No, it's just like he literally, he's, it's like in a dub, you know, where you see,

99
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,360
he just is saying other words. He's not speaking Japanese. It's like, "Why?" Nobody,

100
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,840
they probably didn't understand him on set. Why cast him? If he can't speak Japanese, why is he

101
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:59,560
there? I love - the fun - the best part of that - of those movies is hearing just every time Godzilla

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:06,360
comes on stage - on stage. On stage. On stage. All the scientists just like looking up.

103
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,000
It's Godzilla. I've not seen enough Godzilla movies.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,160
That's just a - that's what happens in Japanese media. It happens in anime too.

105
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,360
Every time that they see a Godzilla.

106
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,240
Every time someone gets surprised they go, "Oh, yeah, oh, oh."

107
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:23,560
Yeah.

108
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,280
Just like that.

109
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,840
And when they come they go, "Ahhhh!"

110
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
They go, "Ee-oo-ee-oo-ee-oo-oo."

111
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,800
They reversed it.

112
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Yeah.

113
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,720
Yeah, for Japanese.

114
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,920
They freaked it.

115
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,360
And they went and they mind freaked it.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,160
Yeah.

117
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,640
Yeah, we were watching a lot of Criss Angel before we started recording.

118
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,920
easily one of the most sexual people who's ever walked this earth.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Yeah.

120
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,120
It's weird how like...

121
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,360
Just like you, it's... Magician's the only job that you can wear a vest with nothing under

122
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,200
it. Magician or Green Day, those are the two jobs.

123
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,200
It's true.

124
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,200
It's mostly Green Day.

125
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,200
Or the cool librarian.

126
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,880
Or the cool... That's true. That's true, the bad boy librarian.

127
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Yeah.

128
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,880
Yeah.

129
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,280
Yeah, it was like, "Yeah, you can return the books a day late, I don't even care."

130
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,960
"Hey, you can be as loud as you fucking want in here, man, who cares?"

131
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,120
I took the safe search off the computer.

132
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,680
You can go on YouTube now.

133
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
That's right.

134
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,680
Yeah.

135
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,720
And if you see a funny video, you send that shit.

136
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
That's right.

137
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720
No more Freddy the Fish.

138
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
We're playing Quake.

139
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,440
Quake on the computers.

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,320
All the computers are Alienware now.

141
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,280
It's pretty sick.

142
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,440
Yeah, that's right.

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,480
You know what the book, the only book we have here is?

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Nice to meet you.

160
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Kratom the bad boy librarian.

161
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,960
Dr. Kratom.

162
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,920
Dr. Kratom.

163
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,540
No relation to the drug.

164
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,400
No relation to the other Dr. Kratom.

165
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,360
No relation to Dr. Kratom but I am related to Dr. Sebi.

166
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
Yeah.

167
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,440
Yeah we have all Dr. Sebi's 5,000 books that he wrote.

168
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,320
That's pretty much the only thing in the library.

169
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,040
I don't know anything about Dr. Sebi.

170
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I just assume he's like Dr. Bronner.

171
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
No, yeah.

172
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:11,040
Yeah, he was like if Dr. Bronner added like two more things to the soap, but the things were like it washes away HIV and it cures cancer.

173
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
That's kind of what he was.

174
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,040
So being a doctor is all about getting soap.

175
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Yes, it's mostly a soap based job.

176
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Do you think Dr. Sebi had...

177
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,040
That's why they do that thing with their hands.

178
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Wash them.

179
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,640
there and they're like oh I'm sterile and they yeah they can't they can't have a

180
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,840
kid that's like while you're asleep I'm not gonna fuck you I can't have any

181
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:40,120
pregnant you I can't have any kids mm-hmm yeah yeah dr. Sebi I think his

182
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:45,520
thing was like I don't know horsing around I'm just around no I think we

183
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,840
talked about this he thought like he thought like yeah he felt like HIV could

184
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,040
be cured by the power of music or something oh really yeah our music good

185
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:58,840
vibes and good wine and good wine and so they killed Nipsey Hussle they put a

186
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,880
bullet through his brain because they thought he's gonna tell the world. We've talked about Dr. Sebi so much.

187
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,880
It's funny that we've talked about him so many times and never once have we gotten to look up.

188
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:16,680
We just think he's a funny name. He's probably just like a good guy. I don't think so.

189
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,080
I don't think he's like a good guy. I think any doctor that you know the name of is

190
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:32,200
probably not a good person. That's true yeah cuz then it's like Dr. Eugene Gu, Dr. Phil's good, Dr. Eugene Gu, Dr. Kravorkian, Dr. Mangala, Dr. Acula.

191
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,360
Dr. Acula is the worst one. Yeah he's scary.

192
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:44,320
Not the worst one. Dr. Who, Dr. Evil, Dr. Doom. Dr. Evil, you know that's a layup.

193
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,880
We knew from day one that was a bad guy. Well yeah but then he turns around and you say

194
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Damn look at that fat ol' ass!

195
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,880
[Laughter]

196
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Yeah.

197
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,880
Well yeah but now Scott Evil is the bad one so.

198
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Oh.

199
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Dr. Scott.

200
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
Dr. Scott Evil.

201
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,880
Terrifying.

202
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,880
Dr. Bronner is probably evil.

203
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
No, Dr. Bronner is good.

204
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:12,880
You can't put that many numbers into one number without having some kind of deal with a dark beast or a devil.

205
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,880
It's true.

206
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,400
- And that soap, I got that soap on my asshole once.

207
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,240
- Six, six, six, and one, you ever notice how it says

208
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,440
six, six, six, and one on the bottle?

209
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,320
- How about this, we start a new shampoo, soap, shampoo.

210
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,160
- Shampoo.

211
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
- One, three, three, seven, and one.

212
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,400
- Oh, okay.

213
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,600
- Yeah, those are shampoo for gamers.

214
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
You can clean your computer with this shampoo.

215
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,440
You just pour it all in.

216
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,000
- If you put enough water in it, it turns into goo,

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,440
and then you can do like a swipe of your keyboard

218
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,260
to get the cheeto- - And then you put goo

219
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,100
on your friend.

220
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:38,940
- Dr. Mario.

221
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,600
- You can put goo on your friend.

222
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,200
- Yeah, and if you drink it, it's a stim.

223
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,440
It's a stim pack.

224
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Yeah.

225
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,440
And it makes you way better at gaming.

226
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,240
Your health bar goes up.

227
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,040
I wish that people had health bars.

228
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,400
You can overheal with a special goo.

229
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
That's true.

230
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
You can get super shield.

231
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
Yeah.

232
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Overshield from Halo.

233
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,520
You can go uber charge medic TF2 mode.

234
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,520
Yeah.

235
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:00,520
You turn into a red crystal.

236
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
You turn into a red blood monster.

237
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
What is it supposed to look like?

238
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
I feel like it's super charge.

239
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:12,960
I think it's red super charge energy, but that's just the scientist in me speaking.

240
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,960
It's blood.

241
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
Who knows?

242
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,960
It's extra blood.

243
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,960
I think it's extra blood energy.

244
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Yeah.

245
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,280
It's definitely some sort of energy shell machine.

246
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,760
Would you guys drink a bonk if it was real?

247
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
Yeah.

248
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Yeah, absolutely.

249
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Would you?

250
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Yeah, I would.

251
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,520
I would drink pretty much anything if it was real.

252
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:34,080
Would you fuck the flubber guys if they asked you to?

253
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,640
If they really wanted it?

254
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,640
Yeah.

255
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Yeah?

256
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Really?

257
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
Really?

258
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,640
If they helped me with basketball.

259
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,640
You notice I said guys.

260
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
If they helped me with basketball.

261
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:49,000
help you with basketball? Anything to get me into the NBA. What do you think for all of

262
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,360
us, when do you think we would have had to start training to get into the NBA? For me?

263
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,520
I could start training tomorrow and get in in three days. Okay. Let's do it. I can probably.

264
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:07,080
If I train for 16 years, starting tomorrow, I could get into the G League. You think so?

265
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,760
I could play for the Maine Lobster Red Claws. The Maine Lobster Red Claws? Is that what

266
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,840
called the main Red Claws. That's not a G League team is it? Yeah it is. The Gatorade League?

267
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:22,640
The main Red Claws. It's a team. Is that the Boston G League? I think so. The main Red Claws?

268
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Yeah. They have a lobster as their mascot? Yeah like a main lobster. That's funny. Yeah. It used

269
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,120
to be the D League. If I started training the second I was born I would be in the NBA by month

270
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,440
one. Month one of your life? Yeah. You have to graduate if to a year of college. I would have

271
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,000
done it already. Well, didn't Kobe. Kobe didn't do college. That was before they changed the rule.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,600
They're going to change it back. It's called the Kobe rule.

273
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
128 online credits within a week of being born.

274
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,440
Wow. Yeah. That's impressive. Yeah, it's all rollover for my channel.

275
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,200
I just guess. It's all rollover, man. I just guess on all the multiple choice tests.

276
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,000
I have to go through a lot of reincarnations before this pans out for me.

277
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,760
It's like the monkey writing Shakespeare thing.

278
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,040
Yeah. Eventually, I can be a one-year-old in the NBA.

279
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,600
By one month old I mean. Yeah I guess you're right. Wow the Maine Red Claws what a terrible logo.

280
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,240
Yeah. Yeah it does look like a Freddy the Fish thing. I think that might be their updated logo.

281
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,120
That's still bad. He has basketballs for antennas. Yeah. That doesn't make sense.

282
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:29,200
It's because he loves to sense the basketball. Yeah the Celtics complete the purchase of the

283
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:35,120
Maine Red Claws. This is on Bangor News Daily. Oh that's huge. That's congrats Stephen King.

284
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,520
Stephen King's - Stephen King, that's huge, man.

285
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,120
Yeah, this is big for Stephen King.

286
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
The manager of the Red Claws.

287
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,400
Stephen King.

288
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,640
Stephen King.

289
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,960
Or Joe Hill is the manager of the Red Claws.

290
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,120
Yeah, well, no, Joe Hill is on the team.

291
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,400
Joe Hill is the -

292
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:48,880
Yeah, I know.

293
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,680
The ref.

294
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,800
Yeah, I know.

295
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,360
I'm the ref.

296
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,320
I know that.

297
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,040
You don't know that.

298
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,240
I knew that already.

299
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
I knew that before you were going to say it, because I have a premonition like

300
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,120
Stranger Things by Stephen King.

301
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,200
All right.

302
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,400
Who's Stephen King?

303
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,000
Steve and King.

304
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,400
Yeah.

305
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,000
I one time saw the coach of the Celtics, Brad Stevens, in the Boston Common Coffee Company

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:17,120
downtown and I was with Neil and he was like on his computer like two tables down and I told Neil,

307
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,520
I was like, "That's the coach of the Celtics." He was like, "Whoa." And we were like, "What do you

308
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,640
think he's doing?" And I was just like probably something like and then I started typing on my

309
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,840
computer, "Basketball, basketball, basketball, basketball," like really loudly and we just

310
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:39,840
just kept doing that and then he like stormed out of the coffee shop. It was so funny.

311
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,280
Yeah. Nice. Sorry Brad if you're listening. That was a really gross wall of water. Yeah

312
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:52,560
you want me to do it more? You can do it more. That's gonna sound good. That's gonna sound

313
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,280
good. Water makes Caleb burp. No it doesn't. Water makes me go crazy. I get too much water

314
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:03,120
in me I go wild I start spraying pee everywhere yeah I spray a clear your BP

00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,960
just mist no there's a thousand monsters that come out of my penis hole.

320
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:31,240
about Stephen King's The Pissed. And he's fucking mad. And he's really angry. Yeah.

321
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,960
Yeah. Yeah. The Mist is the one. I'm Stephen King, I'm pissed. The Mist is the one with The Mist. Yeah, The Mist is in that.

Absolutely.

415
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:34,400

418
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,820
But yeah, imagine like first you meet someone named Sprite and you're like, oh, that's weird.

419
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:43,720
And then just the absolute horror when you learn their last name is also Coke.

420
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,000
Yeah, when you see them sign for like the tip on the restaurant.

421
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,040
Yeah, it would be worse.

422
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,200
You see, so you learn that their last name--

423
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,280
It would be worse, Dr. Pepper Pepsi.

424
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,280
That would be worse.

425
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,300
You learn, so you go, you find out their name is Sprite Coke, right?

426
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:05,660
And then you look at the receipt and it says Sprite Coke Jr.

427
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,660
Oh my god.

428
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
That's terrifying.

429
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,900

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,300
Sprite Coke Jr.

431
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,420
What about a guy named...

432
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,940
Fuck you, Ernest Hemingway.

433
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:18,900
I wrote a sadder story in three words.

434
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,860
Sprite Coke Jr.

435
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,740
Speaking of names, me and a friend were watching The Great British Bake Off.

436
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,740
Maybe I've said this before.

437
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,060
We were watching The Great British Bake Off.

438
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,540

442
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:48,620

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:57,820
John F. Hollywood. John Fitzgerald Hollywood. So fucking crazy. And he's from like you know Leeds or whatever.

492
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,640
"you're the first black president."

493
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,800
And he was like, "Yeah, yeah."

494
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,640
(laughing)

495
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,480
And everybody's like, "Woo!"

496
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,900
- He does like finger guns at the guy.

497
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,800
- Yeah, yeah, so funny.

498
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,160
Yeah, that's what he thinks black people do,

499
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,000
is finger guns.

500
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,040
(laughing)

501
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,000
He's like, "What does a black guy do?

502
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:05,840
"This."

503
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,660
(laughing)

504
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,500
Yeah.

505
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,340

506
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,040

Okay, that's one. Yeah, that's one. Yeah, he smokes weed

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:50,420
I need to borrow your car

That would I would not let job of the heart my car do this. He would ruin the suspension listen, buddy

516
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,820
I just need to sit in the passenger seat

He could say poop

00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,840
We won't say that one. Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to be too strong sugar is low

520
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:20,240
Nice you have any crackers or juice because my blood sugar is low

521
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:29,400
It feels like we're avoiding doing this list

522
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,800
It feels like we're dancing around it. All right, you're fine. You don't want to finish the job a list

523
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,800
everyone's gonna be angry at you for cutting off the job list.

524
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm sorry I said anything.

525
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,800
I just saw a magical phenomenon.

526
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,800
Okay, there we go, that's six.

527
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Alright, I spoke too soon.

528
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,800
Here's number seven.

529
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
I just saw another one.

530
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Okay, that's seven.

531
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,800
The charcuterie board was amazing, Debra.

532
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
You really outdid yourself this year.

533
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,800
You sound like Danny Trejo.

534
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,060
(laughing)

535
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:06,480
- I got the virus, guys.

536
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,200
- I just saw the loogie in your mouth when you talked.

537
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,660
I saw a big green jaba in you.

538
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,500
- That's the Jetsman jaba that's been talking.

539
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,400
- You just coughed the jaba,

540
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,560
that's why you can't do the voice anymore.

541
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,560
- I have two more.

542
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,400
- Two more?

543
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,400
- Two more jabas.

544
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,520
- Donald Trump, you can say Donald Trump.

545
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,720
- Donald Trump.

546
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,560
(laughing)

547
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,080
- I don't know how to do the voice.

548
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,520
- You need to reset the modem.

549
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,360
- Yeah, that's good.

550
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,200
- All right, that's pens.

551
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,240
nobody will be mad that we didn't finish that list. I'm glad we finished that one up.

552
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:42,240
Yeah. It was all worth it. In the end everything's worth it. Okay, so remember

553
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,840
when you had that crush and you turn - Patrick remembers when he had that crush.

554
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:49,840
Remember when you had that crush and you turned to your magic 8-ball to see

555
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:56,240
if he liked you back? What if it said one of these things? Yeah, so this is a list

556
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,500
for Patrick mostly. Yeah number one who is your guy crush?

557
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:06,440
Who's your man crush growing up? Non-exist. Who's that? He's a tall guy.

558
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:12,160
He's an elf. Non-exist. Who is your guy crush? Mike Condolences.

559
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:22,360
Mike Condolences? That's pretty good man. That's a Bart Simpson. Heywood Jablomi. Yeah mine was Sucka My Pino.

560
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:34,360
Suck on da... Suck on da my dog. Suck on da my dog's penis. Remember when Kevin Gates told that, did that thing where he made the woman suck his dog's penis?

561
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:43,880
Yeah. I remember you telling me about that. Dude that's a great video he's just he's just like talking to the camera and he's like I had this

562
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,080

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,080

566
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,840

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:17,040

569
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,240
Yeah yeah yeah. Number one is I'm literally a ball filled with water and triangles in it.

570
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,640
What are you expecting? The answer to life? Get a job. Yeah we need sort of a sardonic

571
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,120
like Bill Maher. Yeah yeah. But you shake the ball and then it's just. Yeah the Republicans.

572
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,680
I'm here to smoke weed. Yeah.

573
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,080
Yeah, he shakes the ball and it says, "It's time to smoke weed."

574
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,920
Yeah, wow. I need that in my life. I need that. Imagine a world

575
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,280
where no, with no religion and everyone smokes weed.

576
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,400
Perfect.

577
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,880
Yeah, that's heaven to me.

578
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:08,720
That's heaven to this atheist.

579
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,680
Oh, shit.

580
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,560
Yeah.

581
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,600
Um...

582
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
uh...

583
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,600
blue

584
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:20,000
you know uh... we have a little bit of a job again and i really want to know

585
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,140
what do you think that's the sound like

586
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,280
as kind of a sound like next

587
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,080
besides the triangle part

588
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,360
isn't that what people's mom say when

589
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,760
that turned twenty

590
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,200
why are you talking to the white and slowly

591
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,640
can you not read

592
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,480
can refer missing you know i read you not really actually i was letting you

593
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,560
guys are you can always read all of you got approve approve you wrong patrick

594
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,480
went to go wash his eyes out.

595
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Why?

596
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,880
Well, wait, I want to go back to that comment.

597
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,960
Beside the triangle part, isn't that what people's moms say when they turn 20 and still

598
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,660
live in their basement?

599
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,960
So without the triangle part, it's, "I'm literally a ball filled with water.

600
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,400
What are you expecting the answer to life?

601
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,400
Get a job."

602
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,760
That's what people's moms frequently say.

603
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:03,240
This comment is completely ridiculous and unprecedented, unwarranted.

604
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,960
I'd like the commenter of this comment to come forward, denounce the comment, remove themselves

605
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,840
from the website and come on the podcast for an order for us to do bukkake onto them.

606
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:18,100
You just proved him wrong atheist style dude. You just went Bill Maher.

607
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,840
You went TJ amazing atheist on him. You just went TJ Miller on him dude or you're

608
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:27,120
about to. You know what I'm saying? You went TJ whatever his last name is and you

609
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,960
poured hot oil on his penis. Oh jeez listen to this comment from Pet Sounds.

610
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,200
Whoa that album? Yeah well this is by Brian Wilson. Oh yeah I used the 8-ball and daisies

611
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,720
on so many crushes back in the day I wouldn't take no for an answer either

612
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,160
oh whoa no yeah well that's I mean that's not that bad I'm sure yeah I know

613
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,840
what he means yeah but take no for an answer from the eight ball yeah okay

614
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,080
yeah but it's pretty bad yeah I think you were too great you guys are

615
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,040
overreacting I don't he's fine I think we needed I wouldn't take yes for an

616
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,000
answer that's better yeah that is a better reason this made me nearly cram

617
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:16,160
my pants. Which one is that? I don't know if that's, it could be pee. I bet he meant crap

618
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:22,160
and he mistyped. Well that's so far away on the keyboard though. Maybe cram my pants.

619
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:29,200
Cream? Yeah is it cream or crap? But why would that make you, why would you cum from reading

620
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,440
(laughing)

621
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,320
- Just thinking about the eight ball.

622
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,520
- Yeah, well not even, yeah.

623
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,360
- The hole in the eight ball.

624
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,180
- Eight balls around like a boob.

625
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,020
- Water and triangle.

626
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:37,840
- Somebody took the glass off.

627
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,600
- 'Cause a boob's is water with triangles in it.

628
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,960
- Oh, that's why the moms say that.

629
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,800
- Yeah.

630
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,640
- Yeah, because they--

631
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,940
- And that's why you cram,

632
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,040
'cause you're thinking about your mom.

633
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,760
- Yeah, and her triangles.

634
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,720
- Yeah.

635
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,560
- Yeah, yeah.

636
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,000
My mom is modeled like a RuneScape character.

637
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,240
- Cram a pants, maybe got a boner

638
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,560
and his pants got crammed.

639
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:04,800
got some cram in his pants. Maybe he meant to say cramp his pants. Yeah.

640
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:12,520
And he's trying to combine them. What about cream? Maybe he was trying to say

641
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,920
ramp my pants and he added the C at the beginning. He's trying to skate his pants.

642
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,760
Ram his pants crazy into his pants crabe

643
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,760
Yeah, what's crabe

644
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,920
Isn't it something he does. Yeah, it's probably something he knows. Maybe he was trying to say wash his pants. Oh

645
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:41,440
That's a really good. It could be that wash or rinse. He also didn't do it. He got but he got near he nearly nearly

646
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
He nearly crammed his

647
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:51,040
I nearly crammed my pants. Number two. You have a therapist for this. No, I don't. And then the

648
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:57,360
comments are there's one that says mind readers. A guy who takes a therapist is a mind reader.

649
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:07,600
Well, get out of my head. Well, well, well, what's the solution? What's wrong? Yeah, what's wrong

650
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,880
with me? You already know what's wrong. God, why am I even here? You already know everything. Yeah.

651
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,580
Yeah.

652
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,380

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,200
This is the latest web craze known as the Charlie Charlie challenge,

675
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,440
perhaps dating back to an ancient Mexican tradition.

676

No, no, no, he gets out of jail, right?

740
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
He comes to us at this time where-

741
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
Does he have glaucoma?

742
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:05,740

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Yes, he has glaucoma.

747
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,740
Is that bad?

748
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,240

749
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,240

00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:12,740
Yes, he has glaucoma.

752
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:13,740
You shut up.

753
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,740
I just wanted to know.

754
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,240
Okay.

755
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,240
You're in Edward mode right now and I don't like it.

756
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
[laughs]

757
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Edward moment.

758
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,740
So, Bill Cosby gets out of jail, comes to us.

759
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,740
This is like, you know, ten years from now or whatever.

760
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,240
I don't know how long he's in jail for.

761
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,280
He should be in jail 10 years maximum in my opinion.

762
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,240
But anyway, he comes to us.

763
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,040
That's all he's got left.

764
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,000
Okay, he comes to us.

765
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,160
We're at the time, we will be producers at NBC.

766
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,600
Okay, all three of us.

767
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,480
You know, we'll be huge money making, money fucking money makers, right?

768
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,240
We produce the biggest shows on TV.

769
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,360
We produce toddlers in bikinis.

770
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,200
No, not that.

771
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:49,840
That's a different...

772
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,120
That was all you.

773
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:51,760
That was your idea.

774
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,880
That was all Caleb's show.

775
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,760
We produce women, women with huge cans too.

776
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,320
And the third one. And we produce a Spongebob reboot. Okay?

777
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,820
Yeah.

778
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,820
Spongebob meets Star Wars.

779
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,820
No Squidward.

780
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:03,820
Spongebob meets Star Wars.

781
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,820
No Squidward in the reboot.

782
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,200
Spongebob meets Harry Potter meets Battlestar Galactica.

783
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,200
And Halo TV.

784
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
Halo TV.

785
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:13,560
And Halo TV show. So they come to us, or he comes to us, right? And he's like, "Listen,

y'all. I've been..."

787
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,240
Why are you giving him that voice?

788
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,600
Because now he sounds like this because prison made him normal. He said, "Listen, y'all. I'm

789
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:26,160
different now okay I'm different but you know it but I'm but I'm still the same

his victims and they come and do whatever they want, and he can't move.

797
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,920
So they can beat the shit out of him.

798
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,420
They can crap on him.

799
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,420
Well, it's a hypothetical, Patrick.

800
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,420
No, it's not.

00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420

804
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,040
He's going to be here in five seconds.

805
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Not five seconds.

806
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,040
He's fucking old.

807
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:11,040
He's slow.

808
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,040
Wait, hold on.

819
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:51,920
your glasses it's just one bill Cosby. It's just one, I'm wearing my six glasses. Yeah he has six vision.

820
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,480
Yeah. Oh my god he's making a sandwich. What kind of sandwich is he making? Don't touch my meats.

821
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:06,360
What was that? What was that? What the? That was a tuna sandwich. He's making a tuna sandwich.

822
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,520
You brought that from his house. He brought the ingredients. He brought the ingredients.

823
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:21,720
ingredients separately? Yes. Why? Hungry. I guess that's a fair reason. I'm hungry. Yeah, I got that.

824
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:29,080
What are you touching in there? The fridge. Are you giving me a tuna sandwich? Yeah, for later.

825
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:35,080
You're not even gonna eat it. I already ate. You already ate? You said you're hungry.

826
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,400
You said you were hungry earlier, what the hell?

827
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,520
I'm a famous liar.

828
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,560
I guess that is true, he's a famous liar.

829
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,360
He is a famous liar.

830
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,560
You're a deceitful guy.

831
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,000
You should probably get that guy out of your fridge.

832
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:49,160
I don't even, what if that's a can of chicken, not tuna? Is that chicken or tuna?

833
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,200
The same thing.

834
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,400
They're not the same thing.

835
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:52,360
This is the same thing.

836
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,480
They're not the same thing.

837
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,000
It's the same meat.

838
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,520
It's not the same meat.

839
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,800
It's completely different.

840
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,000
It's on the sandwich now.

841
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,280
It's a good point, there's nothing you can do, it's on the sandwich.

842
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,720
What's on the sandwich?

843
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,720
The chicken and tuna.

844
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
What? You said the chicken.

845
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,720
I don't know.

846
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:11,720
Can you just read what does it say on the can?

847
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:13,720
Tuna.

848
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,720
Okay, okay.

849
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,720
I think he might be lying.

850
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:19,720
If it's a yellow can, tuna comes in a blue can.

851
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,720
Why is there a chicken on the can?

852
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,720
It's the chicken of the sea.

853
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,720
That's a good point.

854
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
He does have a good point there.

855
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,720
It's the chicken of the sea.

856
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,720
So are you just going to hang out there for the rest of the episode?

857
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,720
No.

858
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
Where are you gonna go?

859
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
Med school.

860
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Why?

861
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
I don't know.

862
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,720
What school?

863
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:38,720
Temple University or Alma Mater?

University of Phoenix.

865
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:40,720
You're going to University of Phoenix?

866
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,720

867
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,720
That's on the computer.

868
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:43,720
Are you gonna stay on the computer in my kitchen?

869
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Yes.

870
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720

And he's going I don't wanna do it. He's been chewing his sleeves

985
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:15,860
Mm-hmm. I used to chew my sleeves a ton when I was a kid. One of my cousins used to chew his neck of his shirt.

986
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,860
I will always remember the flavor of a sleeve.

987
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:20,620
What about the string on a hoodie?

988
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:25,900
Yeah, they weren't as salty. Sleeve is better. Sleeve you got a lot of good salt. I never ate a sleeve.

989
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:30,320
I ate a whole sleeve. Yeah, I turned I turned a jacket to a vest

990
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:36,020
That's the day to take it out of my stomach my belly button

991
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:40,240
One I thought you said shirt for some reason we said jacket

992
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,200
What I was thinking you had to you know what never mind

993
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:48,100
Cameron does not own a shirt Cameron doesn't even own a shirt. That's how cool. I am yeah

994
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:50,100
He came in here with pasties on his nipples

995
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,200
Pasties that were shaped like mr.. Krabs yeah

996
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:58,480
yeah mr. not sure I'm not not painted to look like mr. Krabs just shaped like it

997
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:06,440
yeah so it took us good silhouette yeah but it's the continents on it it looks

998
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:09,960
like an earth shaped like mr. Krabs people don't know that Pangea when you

999
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:14,000
put it all together looks like exactly mr. Krabs yeah that's what they based

1000
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,120
spongebob off of was show you Pangea yeah they based it off the past I heard they

1001
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:23,840
actually faced I heard they based a lot of these TV shows that are coming out

1002
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,860
now about either the past, present, or future? That's terrifying. They base a

1003
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,040
broad city on the future. They base broad city on the present because it's about me

1004
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,280
and my best friends. The future where women can actually be on TV. Yeah. That was the first show to

1005
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,540
feature women. Yeah, before that it was like old Greek plays where you just had

1006
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,080
just guys playing girls but some of them were really hot. That's why some of them

1007
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,700
could get it. Like Kids in the Hall and White as Kids You Know, those were the only shows on TV.

1008
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:52,420
Yeah. They had guys dressed up like girls. Or when they had Chris Farley dress up like a

1009
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:57,380
girl that was in fun buddies with Tom Hanks wasn't buddies white chicks mm-hmm

1010
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:02,700
yeah I think that was the the straw that broke the camel's back that's when they're

1011
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:06,700
like these women are getting too hot okay we got it we got to put real women in

1012
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:13,660
now yeah yeah and then they did not make a movie for a girl until 2001

1013
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,740
- Yeah, finally the phallus was destroyed.

1014
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:21,620
It unlocks the female energy. - Two big penises in the sky?

1015
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:23,380
- And the plane kinda looks like a pussy.

1016
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:24,960
- Yeah, you know, now that I think about it,

1017
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,100
the World Trade Center, two dicks, kinda gay,

1018
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,500
good thing it was gone.

1019
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:30,540
I don't want that shit in my New York City.

1020
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:33,860
I want a big, two boob-shaped towers.

1021
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,340
- They should do-- - That's what they should

1022
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:37,860
replace the one big dome.

1023
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,860
- That's why they wanna build a mosque there.

1024
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:41,700
- One-- - Oh my God!

1025
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,140
- That little-- - Ah!

1026
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,620
(laughing)

1027
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:45,460
- It's terrifying.

1028
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:51,640
was like a dome but it was the height of the Twin Towers like both of them.

1029
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,720
What if there's a box the size of the entire earth, the whole earth could fit inside of?

1030
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,720
Yeah.

1031
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,920
It would be night for a thousand years inside of the box.

1032
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,880
What if there's a microwave that you could actually fit a whole bag of Totino's inside?

1033
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,560
What if there was a microwave that made it cooked?

1034
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,200
Did you know a bag of popcorn is larger when popped than it is smaller than when it is not

1035
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:11,200
popped?

1036
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,200
Yeah.

Uberfacts.com.

1038
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:14,720
We should start a fact-based website.

1039
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,680
Yeah, do you know that Mr. Bean actually...

1040
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,680
Mr. Bean actually had a bean?

1041
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,680
Mr. Bean has never eaten a bean.

1042
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:25,680
He actually had a bean in his pocket.

1043
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,180
Did you know Mr. Bean actually had a bean in his pocket the whole time?

1044
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:31,680
It was there the whole time.

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,680
It was there the whole time. Things you missed.

A closer look.

00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,680
A closer look. Mr. Bean actually had two beans in each of his pockets.

1048
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,680
And you... Wait, and we're just learning this now?

Or did it improve? And nobody was a licensed contractor on that entire set.

1058
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,460
Did you know Tim Allen actually had to fight the producers to get Jonathan

1064
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:24,440
Matters actually did matter. They did. Fun fact, The Family in Family Matters was actually white

1065
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,160
and they painted them before every episode.

1066
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,040
They did.

1067
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:28,540
Yeah.

1068
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:33,160
Yeah, it was originally called Family Splattered because they were splattered with paint.

1069
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:34,760
It was originally called Family Guy.

1070
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:38,040
That was taken in the future by another name.

1071
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:39,080
And they realized, but then, yeah.

1072
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:41,240
Somebody was going to make a really good show called that.

1073
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,440
They were like, "Ah, shit, that's already lined up. We can't take that."

1074
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,660
Yeah.

1075
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:51,640
Okay, so the SD card ran out and it stopped in the middle.

1076
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,920
Yeah, we lost the--

1077
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,800
We lost a bit about a dad going crazy over Mickey Mouse. We hit the funny maximum on this one.

1078
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:05,160
We topped out the funny meters. Yeah, until we come back to... It ran the funny alarm.

1079
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:13,080
Bring the funny with Jameela Jamil or whatever or no Chrissy Teigen and Jeff Foxworthy. We brought

1080
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:22,760
the funny and Jeff Foxworthy went, "You might be bringing the funny if you got a fucking

1081
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:23,760
shit."

1082
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,760

1083
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,440

Skype calling with you this week if you'd rather that but it's I mean it's

1154
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:54,740
just tough in general. Yeah. And also Patrick gets really scared and cries when

1155
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,980
he sees a Skype window and he has to be in the room to chaperone the Master Chief call.

1156
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:03,020
He thinks that the ringing sound is too loud. Yeah. Yeah. For some reason that makes him cry, we

1157
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:07,940
don't know. We tried to solve it by screaming into his ears over and over. It's the bells.

1158
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:13,260
He hates the bells. Boom, boom, boom. Don't even. He thinks he's getting married to

1159
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:17,260
whoever's calling. Yeah. And he gets really excited. He crams his

1160
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:20,140
pants when somebody calls him because he thinks he's finally getting married.

1161
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:25,300
Yep, it's true. I'll say it. It's true. It's all true. We have fun stuff coming on

1162
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,860
the Patreon. Yeah, we're gonna be making some videos this week I think hopefully

1163
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:31,580
that you'll see eventually. We decided tonight that we're gonna have a special

1164
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:36,100
themed episode coming up. Yeah, we do. We'll do that on the Patreon. You'll be excited for that.

1165
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:41,100
We have a weird Jollibee documentary that'll come out. We're gonna be putting a

1166
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:46,860
director's commentary on the Patreon. Yeah! We have access to the

1167
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:50,220
Grinch movie I have that on... We're gonna be doing a watch along. We can do a watch along that

1168
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:55,340
may or may not include some way to get the Grinch movie onto your computer for

1169
01:02:55,340 --> 01:03:01,380
free so you can watch along with it easily. Yeah. Actually, yeah, definitely not

1170
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:04,740
now that I think about it. I don't know why I said may or may not. It doesn't, that

1171
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,700
doesn't exist. There's no such thing as a Grinch movie online. There's no link

1172
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,700
you can go to that downloads the Grinch movie for you on Google Drive or

1173
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:15,260
anything similar. And if there is we would never post it. Absolutely not and it would not have

1174
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:19,620
an audio track included already and it would not be covered under parody law

1175
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:24,980
because of and I would I there would not be little rope like robot versions of us

1176
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,980
at the corner of the screen yeah and I would I would not have one of the

1177
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:33,740
smallest wieners my doctor said he ever saw and the episode Caleb's doctor is

1178
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:39,020
dr. said and he is dr. seven he's seen tons of penises yeah that he is the

1179
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:45,200
other thing was he wouldn't but he is. If you rearrange penis it spells sepi.

1180
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:52,960
That's true. It spells nsepi which is pretty close to sepi. Yeah. So just

1181
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:00,560
think about it. And also one last thing, I love you. Mm-hmm.

1182
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:05,080
I love you. Caleb loves you. I love you. All right this is two Mike's and Michael

1183
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:10,200
signing off. Two mics. Two mics and Michael, that's good!
