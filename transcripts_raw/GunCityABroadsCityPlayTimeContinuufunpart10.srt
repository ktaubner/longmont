1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
I'm so fucking little.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,280
All right. Do your thing.

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,080
All right.

4
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,280
Last time on Gun City, a broad city playtime continue fun.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,600
That's also the wrong one.

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,240
Hold on.

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,400
I don't everybody moaned.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,920
Oh, what if I can I can I control these still?

9
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,240
Yeah. OK.

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,640
Last time on Gun City, a broad city

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,840
playtime continue fun.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:32,220
You're wasting them. I said, you know, I listen,

13
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,020
I set up all these cool things for you so you could pull them out and surprise

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,060
everybody. Okay. You went through 25% of them.

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,700
And the first what is wrong with my fault. There's there's only eight.

16
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,780
And then that's 25 only eight. That's the only,

17
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,460
really appreciate that. You did this for me. I'm going to delete them right now.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,700
Please don't continue. I'm not using them ever unless I need to.

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,900
You learned your lesson. I did. Thank you. Yelled at me.

20
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,820
I can't see my fucking computer screen.

21
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,820
I'm so little.

22
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,140
Last time on Gun City Abroad City, Playtime Continue Fun.

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,820
The gang moved further and further into the Greech's lair,

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,780
outsmarting Stretch Armstrongs and freeing the leprechauns

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,080
who were held captive by the Greech Queen.

26
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,860
They stumbled upon an odd photograph, an old photograph,

27
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,740
with young doctors Ebenezer, Lateralis, and Maud Reddy,

28
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,500
along with then-prominent investor

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,180
of the New England, in the New England Federation,

30
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,420
Huge A. Fax.

31
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,340
Are we doing swear? Are we swearing?

32
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,060
Yeah, we're swering. Go buck wild.

33
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,060
OK, huge ass facts.

34
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,780
Upon this discovery, they called lateralis, who explained that he and Ebenezer

35
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,500
are you doing bunny is he and Ebenezer form playtime industries together

36
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,460
where they were trying to take advantage of the incredible energy source

37
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,500
Stargoon found inside a derelict alien spaceship.

38
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,620
Soon, Ebenezer, Maud and Hugh J.

39
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,660
Wrote it for the swears.

40
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,300
Yeah, and huge ass facts were lost to the stuff.

41
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,300
Lateralis abandoned the project before seeing it come to fruition.

42
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,300
Though, he spoke of unknown mysteries about the Stargu and the ship in general.

43
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Armed with this knowledge and not much else, the gang sprinted toward the room that held one of the energy cores that powers the Pleasure Palace.

44
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,300
Sitting in it, laying her filthy eggs, was the Greech Queen herself, who may indeed be Maud Ready.

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,300
When the gang entered, the lights went out, and blowtossed...

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,900
Maybe. Maybe. Well, maybe. It may well be.

47
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,300
May well be. Shut up.

48
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,500
And Blotas was attacked by Playtime.

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,500
It might be.

50
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,300
And after a failed attempt at getting Maud to relax,

51
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,100
My throat is gut-slit.

52
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,500
through a phone call by Dr. Tool Adoralis,

53
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
it is Maud's turn.

54
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,300
And she's probably distracted. Oh wait, are we about to die?

55
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,100
Yeah. It might be.

56
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,700
Oh! I...

57
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,900
I thought we had a 10-minute event.

58
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,100
I thought we had Tool on speakerphone.

59
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,300
Let's take out your character sheet.

60
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,500
Shit. This is gonna be a...

61
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,700

63
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,440

64
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,320
never been erased.

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:06,540
I give you a spare sheet. I have three yeah you have three, but also my I

66
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:13,040

67
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm not hitting nothing okay. I'm pulling up the this is patches playground

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,400
today.

69
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
Okay, so yeah, so

70
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,300
so

71
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,860
yeah, this is pretty grim.

72
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:28,640
You guys have it doesn't mean it's light hearted like the brothers grim.

73
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,340
Yep, no, I would not say the brothers grim is light heart. Have you seen the

74
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,480
movie? The child turns into has no eyes. I didn't even know

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,720
oh, I didn't know they made the brothers grim into a movie. Yeah,

76
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,920
really scare me when I was a kid. I used to really, really scare me because

77
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,900
he got a bear and Cohen. Sorry, I know this is no, no, let's just I know this

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,600
it's a lane. I really want to start. I know this is a tangent, but there's a

79
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,920
part in that movie where a child loses their mouth and nose and can't breathe

80
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,160
and they fall asleep. Do you remember when when pans labyrinth came out my

81
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,540
parent remember when that came out? Yes, my parents got it on netflix on the DVD

82
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,240
mailing and I wanted to watch it because they were like it's like oh it's a

83
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,440
dark fairy tale. I was like oh fairy tale that's for kids right, but they

84
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,600
wouldn't let me. They would not let me watch it. I wasn't even even get to see

85
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:19,080
one second of it about span. I remember seeing the scene on HBO where he stabs

86
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:24,000
a guy in the head and I said brothers grim no in pans labyrinth, a labyrinth

87
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,800
of Delphi. I was a kid, oh yeah, the butt of the gun or whatever. Let me

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,760
watch. Oh boy, it's the same guy. Yeah, as a child, that's not comparable,

89
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,480
though. I don't know if it was comparable or not. When I was when I was

90
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,800
a child and my mom would take me to Macy's, I'd be in a damn pants labyrinth.

91
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,820
Wow, I'd be running around to be high. That was yeah and one time when we

92
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,420
went to the pan store, I was in a pan labyrinth. Yeah, I hid in the clothes

93
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,640
the great queen time and my mom got real upset because I was gone. No,

94
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,400
it's a normal episode. The great queen is going. There's no set. There's no

95
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,520
set. Now I'm being normal. Okay, I'm not being my character. Let's make this.

96
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,720
Let's die. Let's die. Yeah, I know you have some stupid afterlife plan. I have.

97
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,880
I don't. Well, I'm throwing the thing in my hand at you. Okay, don't.

98
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,520
what was that it was the inside of a dog, a black pasta

99
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,760
the inside of a black noodle bag, the great

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:25,360
not a black being new. I didn't just have a noodle. I didn't have a noodle in my

101
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,240
short row. We're not gonna have time to boil her vaginal interior in your shorts.

102
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,520
She rears a back interior and she screeches and you all need to roll

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,920
constitution saving throws. How about I roll that we were talking about other

104
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,740
stuff that's other. Well, imagine a black bean noodle this size that would be too

105
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:47,580
big to be noodle. Well, you know what I ever do cool that I'm dead then okay,

106
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,360
what are we rolling for by the way, constitution saving for their thorough

107
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,500
and I got a three. I also got a three way. If we get three threes

108
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,320
nineteen, wait, what's my what's my I was going to say, we got three threes.

109
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,220
That's an angel number and that means an angel will come down and save us. Yeah,

110
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,980
so I have a plus zero on constitution, but you're safe.

111
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,520
probably not. I got a three. Okay.

112
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,820
What do you have? Zero, I got, I have three. No, how much health do you have?

113
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,520
Six. Okay.

114
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,960
You are alive still. Woo! What? You have

115
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,980
three HP.

116
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,520
Oh yeah. You failed, right? It goes half. Can you hand me that? I also got a

117
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,760
three, but I just assumed that... You're dead. Yeah, you are... He has five.

118
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:30,820
Oh, you're five? Oh, no, you've got two HP. It's a halfing, it's a half.

119
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,280
It's a halfer. Oh, it's a halfer. I thought it was a vagina. No, the halfer

120
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,280
for you, actually.

121
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,280
Oh!

122
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,280
Which is a...

123
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,920
Well, it's just halving them.

124
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,920
I won down...

125
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,520
I round down for everything, so you only take one.

126
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,520
Okay.

127
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
But you...

128
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,080
Oh, actually, yeah, but you two have...

129
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,040
I went to middle school with a kid named...

130
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,680
With a last name Halffinger.

131
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,480
You two have minus five on all your rolls for the next two turns.

132
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Minus five?

133
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
I took one damage?

134
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Yeah, on any roll you do.

135
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,480
Cool.

136
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,480
Oh, that's cool.

137
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,480
Yeah.

138
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Yeah.

139
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,480
Yep, and then she is going to...

140
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,480
I mean, she's gonna...

141
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
The thing is...

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
She's a...

143
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,260
She's going to attack again.

144
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,080
Why would you say what?

145
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,880
Again.

146
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,120
Yeah, she's a boss. She gets two

147
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,120
attacks.

148
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,440
She should...

149
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,600
Yeah.

150
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,840
So...

151
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,320
I don't condone violence against

152
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,160
women, except for in the campaign.

153
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,920
Really?

154
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,780
But I want to beat the crap out of

155
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:23,980
this lady.

156
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,340
I'm still kind of laughing a little

157
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,800
bit about black bean noodle over

158
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,300
here. I'm still thinking about it.

159
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,320
Still getting it, black bean noodle.

160
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,320
The black bean noodle.

161
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,320
It's not that crazy of an idea.

162
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,320
gave an idea.

163
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,680
Who tossed the phone? It's a vegetarian. You did your dad.

164
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,420
You're honestly like a you're a bitch. I'm I'm just I'm zero one of her

165
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,740
tentacle dicks

166
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,700
perks up for a second. We wears its eye towards you and shoots acid through

167
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,960
your gut. Okay, I don't see any of that because I look the other way. Okay,

168
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,380
you're looking at the way you're ignoring it. Yeah, I don't care. You

169
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,520
don't care about it. Yeah,

170
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,680
through my head, who cares? Whatever I'm knocked out. Okay, can I at least

171
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,580
describe what I'm dreaming about yes, I'm dreaming that I got cast on Saturday

172
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,220
night live.

173
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,020
That's right,

174
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,760
which in this universe is a different show. It's the show I invented the show

175
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,820
in my head and I and when I wake up, which eventually I will, I will be

176
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:24,860
starting Saturday night live. Oh yeah, Pat, it's your turn. You cook that's a

177
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,480
better idea.

178
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:32,420
So I commit suicide. I yeah, so here's the options I gave you last time, which

179
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,500
didn't involve that, which I don't condone. You don't condone it? No,

180
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,400
these people are wrong. I condone it.

181
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,680
That's condemn. Condone means... I don't even know what I can do, 'cause

182
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,480
I barely have any Techno Slime. I can't revive him. How much Techno Slime

183
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,840
do you have? I have like six. Weren't you about to tell him some

184
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,200
options? Yeah, so Pat, you have the ability that you can kinda go crazy

185
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Jedi mode if you flip your sheet over. Oh, yeah. You never really use

186
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,200
that. I'm gonna use that then. Well, let's... Why wouldn't I use...

187
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,520
Dubio, your stuff is still making sounds.

188
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:05,880
It gets me every time.

189
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,200
The Cameron spice.

190
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,200
The Cameron spice, yeah.

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,900
That is pretty good.

192
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,960
So let's take a look at that.

193
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,280
And then, I mean, here's the other thing.

194
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,400
You can use that and then again, you can run.

195
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,560
Yoda's mind or Yoda which one?

196
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,440
It's like, it's basically battle.

197
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,360
I think it's battle meditation, I might have called it.

198
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
Oh, that's actually from the stuff.

199
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,240
From Kotor, yeah.

200
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,800
It's from the stuff.

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,080
Battle meditation.

202
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,920
Yoda's mind.

203
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,760
Here, wait.

204
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
No, no, no, no, no.

205
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,600
maybe it's on this page. Definitely on this one. Yoda's mega mind.

206
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,200
What's that one? Well, that's so when you use like your Jedi power, that's

207
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:44,300
supposed to be me. This is my fucking asshole. So when you use you maybe look

208
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,500
like Baron Harkonnen, I think I said last time, which is awesome nerd

209
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,600
reference. Can I look at your sheet for five seconds? It looks like

210
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,800
the guy from Men in Black. I think that was I was drawing the well.

211
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,040
enough to know for you.

212
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,440
Jonathan, I'll tell you.

213
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
Is he still alive or did he die?

214
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,400
I think he turned into a bug

215
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,760
monster. Full of bugs.

216
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,760
You can't live that long.

217
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,440
They killed him in the movie.

218
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
Fucking your back sheets.

219
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
There we are.

220
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,880
Cool. He's looking for my

221
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,720
best. It's called use.

222
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,400
Nope. It's called use the force.

223
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,340
You need you need a techno slide

224
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,400
points to use it. That's so

225
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,960
funny. You have you have a

226
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,000
refill which you could use as

227
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,680
an I'm going to use the refill

228
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
as an action.

229
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,600
Also, use that.

230
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,680
You could also start

231
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:32,800
to run. No, I'm going to use this. Okay. I'm going to use my techno slime refill.

232
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,880
Did you just say that he could abandon me? No, he could pick you up and stuff.

233
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:46,360
Wait, wait, wait. So that, you use the force, so then I can use...

234
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,920
Once you do it, you can like, you have like levitation, you have extra

235
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,760
lightning abilities, you have extra mind abilities. And then my health boosts?

236
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,700
know, then what's the point? I'm just gonna pick him up and run. You can do

237
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,740
that. You could do that. I'm gonna do that. All right, cool. So

238
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,460
cool. Yeah. So, I mean, you could just literally pick him up and run like

239
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,900
just and run. And guess what I'm gonna do? What? That. All right, cool.

240
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:18,540
So you turn around out the door, you start to run down the... Like away

241
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,240
from her, away from the core, away from the bridge,

242
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,640
now back into like the main sort of like lobbyish area of the like prior to

243
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,380
entering the bridge of the Greech lair.

244
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,040
Do I still have my phone?

245
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,000
And I go like, "Bye!"

246
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,840
Your phone...

247
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,340
Bye!

248
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
No, your phone is still by her.

249
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,840
Okay.

250
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,340
So, Lateralus is still going like, "Maud, listen to me!"

251
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
Like, you know, he's still trying to...

252
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:39,840
Cam, you have to pick up...

253
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:40,340
I have a plan.

254
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,840
No, I got a plan.

255
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:41,340
Don't worry about it.

256
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,840
Don't worry about a thing.

257
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,840
You're not out of the combat encounter just yet, but you are like, you're further out of range.

258
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,340
Yeah.

259
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,840
I was gonna call in a SWAT.

260
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Mm-hmm.

261
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,840
Baby, don't worry about a thing.

262
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,840
All right. So yeah, we are at the top of the order. It is actually...

263
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,840
What did I write here?

264
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,840
Oh, it's Ray's turn. Ray, roll a death saving throw.

265
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,840
Thirteen. You're okay.

266
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,840
This is another success. All right, now you're up.

267
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,840
Okay, so what's every detail that I know about

268
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,840
the mod?

269
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:26,580
at some point pregnant with Ebenezer's Child.

270
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,900
Say every detail out loud.

271
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,420
But so okay just pretend I know all these things.

272
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,420
You do.

273
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,200
Yeah pretend though because we're playing D&D.

274
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,040
Yeah so it's all about pretend.

275
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,960
But what I'm going to do, what I would like to try to do is I want to use my I'm Who ability

276
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,840
which is teleport up to 30 feet to a location you can see.

277
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,080
If it is occupied by another person they must roll a strength or dex saving throw against

278
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,000
spell DC on failure inside their body and control them for six seconds until you

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,200
phase out of them. So I want to try and go into this thing's body and then be

280
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,800
like just start saying all of the details I know about the what it about

281
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,560
Maude and just be like I am and I and as a may be like I am Maude I was pregnant

282
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,960
I did all this stuff or whatever and try to remind her back out of and make it

283
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,120
listen to the phone and that's and just fucking chill out. Such a cool idea.

284
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,440
So I want to try and do that so it has to roll a strength or dexterity and this is the last

285
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,480
of my techno slime too and my spell DC is 14.

286
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Okay.

287
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:29,040
Let's see what we got here for her stats on that.

288
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,040
Where is this?

289
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,520
This doesn't, if this doesn't work I'm going to nut.

290
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
Okay.

291
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,200
That'd be a weird reaction.

292
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,600
Yeah we got to try to avoid that I think.

293
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,600
That's okay you can't see it.

294
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm going to nut out of scaredom.

295
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,600
Yeah.

296
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,600
All right.

297
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,720
yeah all right, yeah sorry yeah it by God, so you teleport into her and you

298
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:53,440
just kind of get knocked back and you're kind of just

299
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,160
standing in front of her. Now, let's move your character right in front of

300
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,960
all right, so the set up is also you guys right guys. Also, I know I did

301
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:06,480
that I had a plan or did anything, so you just saw me teleport right in

302
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:06,720
front

303
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:15,700
Oh man, it is her turn. Unfortunately, probably will focus on maybe there's a

304
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,800
fly flying around her head. She tries to swat yeah fly named your

305
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,660
dead. I'm dead all right.

306
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,960
No, I really thought that was going to be it, though you have to admit that's

307
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,160
a good plan. I love it pretty good. It was a great plan. It wasn't as good as

308
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,320
run, but it was pretty good. Yeah, oh yeah runs kind of boring. Well, we ran

309
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,120
we're a lot of fourteen minute and with his we'll have to figure out what I

310
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,200
think if this really is how these characters die, including solvent, by

311
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,500
the way, who wait, we're so wait, solve and save us solve it is knocked out on

312
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:53,000
your chest. Oh yeah, I have a bound to be getting right. I'm using him as a

313
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,320
bullet.

314
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,440
It was really good use of solvent. It really was probably the only useful

315
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,240
thing he's ever done. Okay, I'm stupid frog now. Sometimes he can't hear me

316
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,380
just sometimes I feel like you're so let's

317
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:08,140
whose turn is I don't like so long because he's a little learn all the

318
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,000
other. Yeah, I got it characters. He is smaller.

319
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,700
What is her health? Oh yeah, I guess she goes health bar. She's just gonna

320
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,940
move towards you guys towards the door. Okay, she and how do we say

321
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,320
your health bar? Okay, Pat, what is her health? You are the only person

322
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,480
alive. You have to health. You have to save both of us

323
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,280
or you have to run away as fast as what happens if he leaves us if he abandoned

324
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,600
what

325
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,600
run really fast was my suicide threat ability that we established. I don't

326
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,120
think it's going to register. I don't think that she speaks English. I think

327
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,380
you have to leave us by and I think you have to run as fast as you have to get

328
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,480
out because if you survive, then at least we don't have to do a hard reset.

329
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,420
If you survive, then I can come back and me and Caleb can play on our phones

330
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,240
while you do the rest of the

331
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,920
or

332
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,760
come back as girls.

333
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,880
I never played a girl character in the game.

334
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,540
Canada.

I'm whipping I'm getting the hell out of here. I throw ray all die and then

339
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,840
just like out of like a big steamy room comes this girl for

340
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,340

347
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,500

348
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:09,220
go all right you keep running she keeps moving towards you let's do death saving

349
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,940
throws for you what does it matter we can't get up any even if it's a saving

350
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,180
throw for you someone might be maybe might come find us if he goes and oh

351
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:21,340
Oh yeah, no, I mean you'll probably be eaten before then nine. You can't

352
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,020
you're not supposed to take a side. That's a fail right. That's true. Yeah,

353
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,540
you can't take

354
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:32,900
you are now pat you are a you are probably far enough away. Now there are

355
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,740
likes to like kind of like mindless creatures that are like looking for like

356
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,520
a monster body to like latch on to, but you're probably far enough away that if

357
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,740
you have any techno slime left to heal, you could heal ray. Okay, wait, how's

358
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:49,720
far enough away that I got it. Oh yeah, sorry. Do you see her get to the door

359
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,220
and she stops and starts to turn back and so go back further towards the

360
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,480
core. She won't leave that room with the core. Well, get me up, God damn

361
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,800
it, and let's go save Blotoss. All right, I'll do that. Don't run back in.

362
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,400
I have... Okay, I will take my... You're gonna get healed, get up, run

363
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,880
back in and die. No, I won't. I'm gonna use my techno slime refill. Okay.

364
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:16,060
so take it off your thing. Okay, you're already yeah. I think yeah, I should have

365
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,660
given you guys pencils. Oh, I did give you all pencils. I gave everyone pencils

366
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,360
actually, but

367
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:28,260
right. I forget. How much does the refill fill fills five technoslime points?

368
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,860
Okay, so you just use all all of them. You should probably use them all on.

369
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:38,260
Okay, I'm going to use them all. Yeah, wait. So then 11 is how many points 15.

370
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:44,100
I have one left. Okay. Sorry. Each one is one point of HP given to me.

371
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,220
No. All right. Then I'm gonna use the... I'm gonna use four skin on him.

372
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,160
Yeah, I think it's 1d10, right? And then... Oh, yeah, d10. I think it's

373
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,820
1d10 and plus four? I never can tell which one is the... Is the d10?

374
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,940
The d10 is... Yeah. Pretty much the same as the... Yeah, it's the roundest.

375
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,340
It's very close. It looks very similar to the d8. This one with the

376
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,780
10 on it. No, that's a 3d12. No, you had it. You had it. Okay.

377
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,580
The way to think of it, the D8 is like 2D4 stacked on it.

378
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,580
That sounds like it's not going to be helpful.

379
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,580
Two pointed one.

380
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,280
That's a three.

381
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,080
That's a three.

382
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,980
So yeah, that costs and then so I think you add four to that, right?

383
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,580
I never remember.

384
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:20,280
Yeah, 1D10 plus four.

385
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,680
So seven and you get the full one because you're not just grabbing his

386
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,780
foreskin and putting it over you.

387
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,480
So I have seven.

388
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,880
You get seven HP back.

389
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,780
So that's what you can do for your turn because we're just just because

390
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,380
we're still in the like turn order here.

391
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,380
Okay, I am running back in.

392
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,480
Is it my turn?

393
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,580
Yeah, I mean, here's the thing.

394
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:39,620
The only, yeah it is, oh actually wait let me check if it is.

395
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:42,100
Sorry I'm like goofing up the turn order here a little bit.

396
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,940
- It's his turn.

397
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,020
- And he's used a single phone.

398
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,780
- It is actually Blotas' turn, sorry yeah.

399
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,220
Blotas yeah roll a dead sign.

400
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,140
- Oh brother.

401
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,500
- And then it's, then it's.

402
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,260
- 18.

403
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,420
- Nice another save.

404
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,500
Okay and then it's Mama's turn.

405
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,940
'Cause I forgot to, I realized I skipped a turn here.

406
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,820
- Her name is not Mama.

407
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,660
- Oh yeah I called her.

408
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,940
- Let's try and keep the lore consistent

409
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,780
between the episodes.

410
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,460
- He called her Mama, the guy called her Mama earlier.

411
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,040
- His name is Maude.

412
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,700
(laughing)

413
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,540
- Asshole.

414
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:12,040
- And Maude is not short for Maude.

415
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:12,880
- You're gonna hear--

416
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,920
- It would just be Ma.

417
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,160
- Mud, mud.

418
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,140
- You wouldn't hear this,

419
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:19,640
but I guess you guys would kinda hear this.

420
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,420
- Get him!

421
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,520
Kill him now while he's down!

422
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,620
And so--

423
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,500
- Wait!

424
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,340
Motherfucker said what?

425
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,280
- So, they heard that.

426
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,620
Not lateralis, sorry.

427
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,460
- Oh.

428
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,280
- Yeah, that's very confusing.

429
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,120
- Really sounded just exactly like--

430
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,260
- I need to figure out, you said this last time,

431
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,400
I haven't figured out a better, different,

432
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,940
I guess I can do kill him now while he's down some or maybe

433
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,340
never mind.

434
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:48,580
Thought about it. Okay, cool. So yeah, she is gonna start digesting you.

435
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,200
Well, she didn't even eat me yet. I'm gonna walk in and I'm gonna grab my

436
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,020
nuts and I'm gonna say, digest these, mommy. So you are six, you are about

437
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:02,140
like 90 feet away, so... You can do that from 90 feet away. You don't have

438
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,940
you be close yeah. I'm just talking shit. You just hear like

439
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,380
when I

440
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,980
grab my nuts at so it is ninety feet away. It was like in it.

441
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,340
Those sounds like when you try to use a skill that yeah, just cool down

442
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,540
doesn't load in it.

443
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:22,340
You're dead blow to I'm dead dead capital D. You're dead, fully dead

444
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,220
you're. Can I rip my character sheet down the middle into the microphone? You

445
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:25,560
can

446
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
way.

447
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,820
Low toss piss.

448
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:33,180
Who's been with us for a long time,

449
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,260
like three years.

450
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,220
This is the first time one of the big

451
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,220
threes died, right?

452
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,220
Yeah.

453
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,420
I drew.

454
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,100
Didn't I die? Patrick Yodar.

455
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,220
Oh, yeah.

456
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,860
Three original gun city characters.

457
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,060
Yeah.

458
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,540
This is a reboot.

459
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,940
This year is really a reboot year.

460
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,420
Yeah. For the past six months.

461
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,700
Fuck it, bro. I'm killing.

462
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,980
I I'm like you're despondent.

463
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,520
Yeah, no, no, I'm not despondent. I am thrown into a

464
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:05,780
can you get a rage and I'm going to kill this squid

465
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:12,460
or whatever. Let's do it. You run in there seven HP. I think we need to do.

466
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,140
I think yeah. All right, roll. I'm doing this for you.

467
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,660
You understand me? That's I can't believe I got it. Yeah, I have to. Oh,

468
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,340
wait. Are you talking?

469
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,260
There we go. That's better. Thank you for muting. Yeah. Okay, so now you're

470
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:29,180
up so let's well actually so it's her turn and then it's really actually

471
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:36,700
Pat's turn. Yeah, I'm there's so much fear in me right now. You're not gonna

472
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:41,820
die for your friend. I'm in the corner. I'm jacking off. What? What? What is

473
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:47,140
that? How's he jack off? I'm nasty. We're all nasty dude, but you don't we're

474
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,340
trying. He just died. Can you show a little bit of fucking respect? That's

475
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,460
what he told me to do.

476
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,620
What the hell is that? That's what he told me to do when he died

477
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:00,380
in his... Back in the day.

478
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,580
Somebody's playing some instrument that only goes, "Ooo."

479
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,380
Yeah, the squid is a therapy. And then somebody just played a gorilla song.

480
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:14,200
Alright, I'm not jacking off. Okay, what are you doing? Come on,

481
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:14,540
help.

482
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:18,060
We have to kill this bitch. I'm looking at porn on my phone. That's not...

483
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:20,420
That's halfway to jacking off. You also don't have your phone. That's more

484
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,420
than halfway to jacking off.

485
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,140
lateralis

486
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,180
here's that's like that's like

487
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,160
what else here's you getting eaten

488
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:36,960
watching porn on their phone on the bus. I wouldn't I wouldn't be half as mad as

489
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,640
if I saw them jacking up, but what are their percent is matter they're doing

490
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,700
this yeah. I still wouldn't like hands up, but I feel like

491
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,240
I'd be half. I think it's halfway. I think it's maybe even forty percent,

492
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,000
yeah, because like sometimes somebody, you know, funny. I mean, I don't know

493
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:50,540
it's just

494
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,280
I'm giving benefit of the doubt in that case. Definitely, it's definitely not

495
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,440
half as bad, but

496
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:00,000
eighty percent, but it's a way there. What if it's like a hard core of the

497
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,520
movie situation and they're seeing their own daughter on that thing right if

498
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,040
they're crying,

499
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,560
that's a thing and they're watching porn and crying. I am not touching that

500
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:12,480
situation. I'm not feel bad for them. I'm not stepping in and saying knock it

501
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,320
off. I'm just I said I was I walk up. I'm saying tissue. I'm going to shoulder

502
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,280
to cry on you. What's wrong? Do you need to want to talk about what I wouldn't

503
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,780
expect you to need a tissue for, right?

504
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,280
Yeah.

505
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:21,780
Yeah.

506
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,280
Yeah.

507
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,960
All right. I guess I'm going to... Can I throw a techno of my foreskin at him

508
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,160
before he goes?

509
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,680
Excuse me. At me? At him or me?

510
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,180
At him.

511
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,020
At Ray.

512
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:31,520
You'll let him...

513
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
To heal him a little more.

514
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,920
I don't want... No, no, no, no, no.

515
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,420
You don't want it?

516
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,920
I want like the...

517
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Okay. Then I'm using Yoda's dark slide.

518
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,220
I'm using the...

519
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,420
You're using the force?

520
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,920
Yeah.

521
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,420
Okay.

522
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,120
Can I use... Can I do like a rally thing?

523
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,300
like I send out a big burst of energy that helps him out?

524
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,760
Energy? You could do that. Force?

525
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,280
But, okay, here, if you want to give him like force powers, but there's got to be some

526
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,800
risk to you. Can we meld together?

527
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,920
You guys want to fusion dance and go and kill each other?

528
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,920
Can we at least Freaky Friday just for the last couple minutes of us being alive?

529
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,000
Yeah, if this is what you're committed to, we could do that. Well, how would we do it then?

530
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,040
Explain. So, well, you're a computer demon.

531
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:20,900
Yeah, maybe you upload yourself into him instead and then maybe my God and our health would combine

532
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,740
What if you guys?

533
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,880
So true and then maybe my health combines and you guys get like negative 50

534
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:33,560
Yeah, and maybe we combine with some of the other stuff that's in the room and we become really strong

535
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:40,780
So now he has all the powers of a computer, but also Yoda's force and also a demo and also a demon

536
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,280
do we do that character would have been way better can it what okay? What if

537
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:48,800
it's this simple? I take his asshole and I've put it on my head, so his entire

538
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,160
body is the head of the demon. If it's that simple,

539
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:55,980
I just put your computer on to him because you're the computer right fine

540
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,440
and you're just the demons like your but I try that first and I take a

541
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,960
and then I take them. Yeah, perfect yeah, and I don't you're going to get

542
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,640
cancer and I'm a computer easy computer. Okay,

543
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:11,920
no, I actually don't. I would just want to die all right. Okay, I want to run in

544
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,040
there. Everyone wants to copy me. What am I going to do

545
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:22,200
buddy? I'm going to shove you use the shelf shelf. Yeah, I'm so mad. It's like

546
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,800
when your buddy gets in a fight outside of the party. What the fuck is up? Yeah,

547
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm going to do that, but my friends being eaten yeah, yeah, so I ran action.

548
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,280
What does it say that you should do for your show action athletics versus

549
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,960
athletics? So you're going to roll against her athletics. She's also is like

550
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,920
the kind of fat right yeah she's a bit of a size up, though, so it's going to be a

551
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,720
little bit. She can have some bonuses. There's a now that was a

552
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:53,940
fifteen. She also got a fifteen. Whoa, we I think you win. I win that right or is

553
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:57,340
it the yeah because if you match a see typically I've never heard of a me

554
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:02,380
stop this. I've never heard of a shove. I shove her. You do show

555
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,780
yeah, I show you why my what the fuck is a fucking bitch and then I do one of

556
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:13,380
the why by litigating this yeah, oh, they're kind of a soccer style. Fuck

557
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,380
that's make sure anybody who sees it gets it yeah, okay, and she what's your

558
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:18,820
AC

559
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,360
my AC is fifteen. Okay, mister,

560
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:28,960
so she gets the role again. No, she is to rose. She misses both of her attacks

561
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,480
on you just now. Well, she's like slapping her dick. You you shove her

562
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,460
back, she kind of lurches back and then she starts slapping her dicks around,

563
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,500
try to, like, whap you with it. Tell me, yeah,

564
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,420
stupid bitch, keep shoving her. I think I might be invincible. Keep shoving her.

565
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:49,640
All right, you're up. I tell him to keep shoving her. That's what you do. And

566
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,580
then I use, yeah, I use the force to okay, just push it, push it. All right,

567
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,780
you've you've you taken did you take techno slime? Let's say you took techno

568
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,540
slime last term because you didn't do any. I took time with my refills. Oh

569
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:04,040
yeah, you did take all of them. So yeah, you used to force techno slime is

570
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,760
complete. Read what used to force does use it. Let's read what let's read what

571
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:10,740
this move does. That is like the longest most involved move. You ever use

572
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,240
action. You can use the force for thirty seconds, giving him an extreme boost in

573
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,500
combat and ability skills. Ultra deflect AC increases by two and as a reaction

574
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:22,580
can automatically deflect all non supernatural miss with his hoagie

575
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:27,280
supernational Yoda fast movement speed is doubled and Patrick Yoda can fly up

576
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,700
to sixty feet vertically.

577
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,340
I gave you such a cool move.

578
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Yoda strong, melee attacks do, well yeah, I'm saving it for big things like this.

579
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,340
This is it, you're right, you're right.

580
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,540
Yoda strong, melee attacks do plus two additional damage.

581
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:43,340
Yoda bonus lightning, Yoda can now cast lightning as a bonus action for no cost.

582
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,740
Dealing 2d6 plus wisdom can't be charged like Yoda lightning.

583
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:51,540
Yoda telekinesis, based on a wisdom DC, check against the size of an unbound object.

584
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,340
Automatic for tiny plus small.

585
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:59,140
DC 10 for medium, DC 15 for large, DC 20 for huge, DC...

586
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,460
You can move five for guard. It's Yoda in Clone Wars when he's lifting the

587
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,700
fucking. Oh my God. Yeah. Okay. So in the fifth movie, when he's like, turn,

588
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,460
I turned my eyes, turn blue and shit. Yeah. And then I run into the room and

589
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:17,380
I try to pick her up. Is there, we're near a cliff. You're on like a bridge,

590
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,620
like, yes, it's like the bridge in episode one, like when you're fighting

591
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,340
at least fighting. Okay. Then I'm going to pick her up and throw her off the

592
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,300
bridge like Palpatine. Oh, you're going to try it. Yeah, we'll give it a shot.

593
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:32,040
Wait, what were you about to say before we do that? That's a steal.

594
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:38,140
Well, I'm going to I'm going to shove. Well, we'll do his turn first. Yeah.

595
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:43,540
So yeah, that's going to be a gargantuan. So it's she's not gargantuan,

596
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:48,640
but she's large. She is large. That's DC 15. What does that mean?

597
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,740
Well, it's yeah, I have to roll. Well, she's also she's on an object.

598
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:57,340
I have to roll 15 DC 15. No, no, no, no. So really what it is,

599
00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:00,300
this is just like you're going to contest her

600
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,300
in this regard. I can't have you just move because she's not like an object

601
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,260
technically, but he's an object. She's a woman. I knew this is going to happen,

602
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,580
right? So I was trying to preempt.

603
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:14,300
No, it's just fucking disappointing.

604
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:22,140
So I hope you do die. Yeah, let's no, no, no. So I take two

605
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,980
no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not doing that. You can't get out of this that

606
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:43,980
you

607
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,980
do

608
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,420
strong. What does it say there? I'll see if you always realize you have minus

609
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,380
five to all your roles to from the screech from earlier. Oh, no, it's been

610
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,380
more than two turns. Sorry. So what does it say? So you have plus two. So

611
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,660
fourteen and then two additional damage. Let's just make that also add to your

612
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:08,220
role. I think that's fair. I should have. Well, yeah, I should have made that.

613
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:12,340
What are you saying? Right? Doesn't matter. And then add your regular

614
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,860
strength. What is it? One is it minus one already? Oh, I'm sorry. It's OK. So

615
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:25,180
13. So she's going to roll. Yeah, okay. So you fly in and like like like Ray,

616
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:28,940
you just like her, I guess like like he just sort of like like goes around you

617
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:32,860
crashes into her. You like kind of push her back and you're like going back and

618
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:38,060
forth and she's able to with her like dick arms like just like shove you off

619
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:43,020
though. So I'm dead. I fell off the thing. Not yet. She just shoves you off of her

620
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:46,460
and you're still like flying. So you're kind of like hovering in midair like in

621
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:51,360
in front of her in front of you. Okay. So well, okay, then why don't I use Yoda

622
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,380
fast and move sixty feet vertically? That's your turn.

623
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,380
Yeah, so I can't do that. Not right now. No, you already did your turn.

624
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,340
Okay. I'm gonna be in on turn order. I think it's her turn probably, right?

625
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,300
I'm gonna check. I don't know why I keep forgetting.

626
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,940
It's Blotas's. He's, no it's not. It's your turn. Oh, for my turn? Really? For

627
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:17,440
my turn. Can I can I take a turn, though from you to turn? I just want to show my

628
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,120
drawing. Okay, show this you put it on the table, put out the table.

629
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,340
Wow,

630
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,980
dinner, that's dinner, hot dog burgers,

631
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:31,520
really true. Jubio honestly you work as a oh and you knocked the girl over. So we

632
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:31,760
went

633
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,040
one. I would like to walk up to this bitch and I don't use that word lightly

634
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,600
and I would like to shove the shits the shit out of her. This is okay. Do it

635
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,440
Yeah, rolls. Let's just do it. Yeah.

636
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:50,240
What's he get?

637
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,400
And I don't know. I told I rolled an eleven.

638
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,800
All right. You kind of just like your hands, like kind of like

639
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,960
do I shove her at all? No.

640
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,960
She kind of like moves a little bit.

641
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
Can I please just shove her?

642
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,600
No, it's OK.

643
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,240
Do I have like some kind of you're both your A.C.S.

644
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,000
My mind is double right.

645
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,340
Mine is fifteen. Mine is all my stuff is double yeah. My

646
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,240
increases.

647
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,440
Ghost block the attack. Okay,

648
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,840
really

649
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:27,340
that is so sweet. They see a ghost. So now really here's the question is is how

650
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,780
big of an asshole are you going to be about this? No, no, you guys want to

651
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,100
know

652
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,260
do we want to spend the rest of the session because you're both dead. So we

653
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:35,860
lost all three.

654
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,580
that's really how you you didn't have some big you didn't have something

655
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:46,500
written. I gave you the option to run away. I did run away and then I wanted

656
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:53,020
to show her. I will write something up and I'll even put it over a video and

657
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:56,640
you could just shove it in here as a in memoriam or maybe at the end of it. It

658
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,260
better be

659
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:02,920
better be. It'll be very hard for I love these characters so much. I can't

660
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,060
believe we all three died in the stoop optional. Now we gotta make new guys.

661
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:11,300
what that was the so that wasn't even the final boss. No, nowhere near the final

662
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,680
boss. It's nothing no. I got my I got attacked by the final boss. We didn't

663
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,900
even find a time.

664
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:22,300
Do you guys want to know can we take some guesses? Okay,

665
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,240
what do we get? We have a twenty twenty five the rest of the story or

666
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,040
I want we've it's always been. We try to guess and you've always given us, you

667
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,540
know, two good guesses per episode, I'd say okay, so I would like to do about a

668
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:40,780
twenty minute guest session to just see if we can guess okay, and you have to do

669
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,640
all your yeses and nos in the voices that you have programmed that we will

670
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:50,160
unfortunately not see like a podcast DJ. I know okay mixing it. Let's do it all

671
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:50,760
right so

672
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:58,960
guesses so I still know that have been the Grinch the now the Grinch. No, it's

673
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,380
not the Grinch. Okay, it's all yes or no stuff.

674
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:04,540
Was it the guy who pushed us down the well?

675
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,860
no shit was it his boss.

676
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,920
No was it huge as facts

677
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:18,840
no was huge as facts involved in the badness. Not really. I don't think so

678
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:26,040
no, not really okay. I still my words was was it was it was a low job. No

679
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,580
was it somebody that we've met was it somebody who was who was it was

680
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,260
somebody in that picture of all the people in the picture. No

681
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,420
well, then I don't have any guesses. Then okay, well, that wasn't a yes or no. I

682
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,740
guess

683
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:42,840
do you think I have any more guesses?

684
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,840
I think

685
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:52,480
I think you can. What would be the best ending? What would have been the best

686
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,640
and why don't we do? Why doesn't so wake up and go figure? I have another one

687
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:01,740
hold on hold on. I'm solving to go figure it out. Okay, is is new Sullivan

688
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,000
alive. Yes,

689
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,860
he's alive without any parents.

690
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,340
He's safe.

691
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:15,300
What do you mean he's safe? He's play time.

692
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,440
Don't do that because

693
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,660
that would be jumping the shark. I would fire you. That would be jumping. You

694
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:26,040
would be gone. No, he's not. We would fire you on the spot if he was play

695
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,140
time. Is there any way that we can zoom out and then zoom back in on wherever

696
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,560
little new Sullivan is and I just want to see I just want to make sure on my way

697
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,300
to hell. I want to make a yes, that's true. Can we all can we we could do a

698
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:43,100
hell can we go to well, can we right now go to hell and I do a hell campaign

699
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:47,160
somebody tell us everything when you're a demon so may or your demon part is

700
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,120
maybe just so then I'm just maybe I'm just a computer sitting on the ground

701
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,420
yeah, I have nothing to control yeah, you don't go to heaven or your computer.

702
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,620
You just get to lead it turned off. No afterlife yeah, you just power down, but

703
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,740
go to a day to recovery. I think it's arguable that that ray william johnson

704
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:07,540
had more heart than almost anybody that is arguable and you know, I'm just

705
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:11,780
thinking now. I think it's very it's very lucky to the continuation of this

706
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,740
story that we all

707
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,880
during in between this campaign in the last one each impregnated a woman.

708
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,640
Yeah true, that's very lucky that we did that. Oh yeah, I forgot that we I

709
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,140
completely forgot that we all impregnated women with yes, specials

710
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,960
terms that become identical when I come out. Did we have a name for that,

711
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,280
too? Yeah, it was called Identical Sons. Yeah. Oh, my God, we did have

712
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:33,700
literally

713
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,960
a

714
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,740
we literally had a plan. We had a we knew this

715
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:46,660
technical son. You a t p k. How could you possibly okay, but I do what I

716
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:50,720
ripped up his thing. Yeah, well, that's that's I got a blow toss. Yeah,

717
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,960
that's not what I was doing. I would really, really like to go see check on

718
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,380
Sullivan before we go any further, just so that we can piece it together from

719
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:57,880
there.

720
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:05,080
Yeah, I'll tell you where he is. So you guys remember Reddy, right?

721
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,380
Patrick has monkey pucks.

722
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,180
Reddy, Maud Reddy, right? And then there's Reddy.

723
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,280
That white bitch.

724
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,080
So there's Reddy, the assistant scientist, right?

725
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:17,880
The one who pushed us.

726
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,580
Yeah.

727
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:22,780
So how do you want me to tell this? Like a story or like with answers?

728
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:25,040
I literally wanted to zoom out.

729
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,840
Imagine that we won the game.

730
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,120
We zoom out.

731
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,120
We're in a small room.

732
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,520
We're on YouTube right now and we're looking up Final Fantasy VII best ending.

733
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,420
Okay, thank you. I got it now.

734
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,920
Maybe a little, maybe actually, yeah.

735
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,920
So you're in a, we're in a small room.

736
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,780
You see this hunched over young scientist with that messy red hair.

737
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:51,520
He has a microphone near his face and he's screaming,

738
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,520
"Kill them! Eat them! Kill them!"

739
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,480
And, uh, um, he's like getting frustrated and then he looks in his monitor and he sees as

740
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,560
um, Maude Reddy, his mother, eats all three of you, digests you.

741
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,440
And a smile creeps on his face and a sigh of relief.

742
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,480
He turns around and he exits this small room with these like monitors and this like speaker system

743
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,720
to a

744
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:25,520
uh off-white room with basically completely bare. R.I.P Virgil.

745
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:33,200
Which... Oh that Virgil? Yeah. Thanks. Um so. You said off-white. Oh.

746
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:42,560
You go into this room and you see New Sullivan and in this room there's nothing except just

747
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,080
just a bunch of little toys that New Sullivan's playing with. He's playing with the little action

748
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:53,280
figures of you guys. Yeah, he's like, "Oh yeah! Wow, wow!" He's playing around. He's

749
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,200
uh, he's uh, he's looking around. He's like, "Playtime! Playtime!" And in swoops, from

750
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:13,600
nowhere, this alien that doesn't really look... it's an alien. Okay, I'm done with this. Yeah,

751
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,600
yeah,

752
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,560
right this

753
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,360
alien. Okay,

754
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:32,560
okay, cool,

755
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,880
a cowboy comes in

756
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,320
and it's this

757
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,520
It has these gnarled sort of like fingers and this face that is kind of contorted

758
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,560
and twisted with eyes like they're like little slivers similar to what Maude,

759
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,440
the monster's eyes were. And he's covered in these like black and green kind of

760
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,480
like flesh that's kind of like warped together and he's like hunched over.

761
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,440
Looks similar to Reddy but he's not. It's a different person. And it's making these

762
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:12,240
we're clicking noises as it approaches New Sullivan, and the hand is going

763
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,140
for him, and then you see he picks up a toy, and they start playing together.

764
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:20,640
And Reddy is...

765
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,520
Says, "And I'll get you more playmates soon." So you're saying this is a

766
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,120
sloth from the Goonies style situation?

767
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,440
A little different. So... So Reddy stole New Sullivan from us, and that

768
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,780
that was his only plan.

769
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:36,780
So playtime...

770
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,780
Was to take New Sullivan and put him on his ship.

771
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,620
So Reddy is the illegitimate child of Maude and Ebenezer.

772
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:44,620
Yeah.

773
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,620
I see.

774
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,620
And he grew up in relative...

775
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,940
He basically grew up as Ebenezer's unwanted son.

776
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,940
Yeah.

777
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:56,140
Maude was a failure of an experiment that Ebenezer started to do to her.

778
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:59,540
And Ebenezer doesn't even acknowledge Reddy as his son.

779
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,540
Reddy...

780
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,940
Playtime, the thing, the noises that Tull Lateralis was hearing when they were working on the

781
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,260
ship and the noises that you have been hearing was this alien. That alien

782
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:15,180
derelict ship that was discovered held the child of a like alien race that

783
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:20,220
exists like one of their children. Oh my god and it was New Sullivan? No it was

784
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,900
Playtime and Reddy. I can't even follow this story anymore. Playtime was killing childless

785
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,840
couples because he was resentful of anyone who didn't have children. Because

786
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,400
he likes playing. He likes to play and he misses his parents. And then he found in New Sullivan

787
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,640
the perfect playmate. And so why is Reddy involved in this whole thing? Reddy discovered the alien.

788
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,160
The alien had escaped all the scientists' grasps except for Reddy the assistant. And

789
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,320
so Reddy said, "If I will..." Basically, Reddy is kind of cracked from resentment and basically

790
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:57,600
did the whole playtime, played it up, did the announcements on the loudspeaker, did

791
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:01,160
the whole media campaign for it and just said, "You go out and basically,

792
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
I'll target people for you to kill

793
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:10,640
and to cause this mayhem." And basically, it was like, "You just kill

794
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:12,240
people for me and I will give you

795
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,000
this perfect playmate here. I'll give you toys, I'll let you live in

796
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,080
the ship." So basically, the whole story is that

797
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:25,160
New Sullivan is too good of a kid, too perfect of a son

798
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,160
that we couldn't there's no way we could ever hold the most unwanted with the

799
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,440
most wanted son, huge ass facts wanted to you just facts part of his position is

800
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,680
that so he was an investor for Leo,

801
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,160
but he went he kind of turned you know, went went towards a criminal path, but

802
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,480
he has dirt on everybody in the federation, including Leo. He has

803
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:54,400
pictures of Leo specifically playing with toys, girl toys. No,

804
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,000
That was dirty. That's why I was able to operate his enterprise. That makes sense.

805
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,920
That makes a lot of sense. Janet Blowjob did was actually this was a whole...

806
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,280
Fuck! It was a whole other thing. Janet Blowjob was working for John Carlo.

807
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,680
Bloody hell. She was a double agent working on both on the case. Yeah, I figured that out.

808
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,200
I didn't know that. She was working on both the Leprechaun Rebellion, but she was also

809
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,500
people working with huge as facts to try to destabilize this the both of the

810
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,800
England Empire by playing up both sides on behalf of John Carlo. If you guys

811
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,900
went down that John Carlo path, a lot of his jobs, he wouldn't have given you

812
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,500
like details, but she would have been your contact and you would have done

813
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:42,300
stuff to help continue to destabilize. Yeah, so can I ask you a question is is

814
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,300
Is New Sullivan happy?

815
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,300
He is.

816
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,300
Okay.

817
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:46,300
Is he?

818
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,300
So this is kind of...

819
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:48,300
He misses you guys.

820
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,440
He misses us, but overall this is maybe kind of a story about three guys who created a

821
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,740
Frankenstein perfect child and...

822
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:00,580
If New Sullivan was in danger, it would have been one thing.

823
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580
He's not...

824
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:04,940
Playtime would kill everyone in the world for New Sullivan.

825
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:09,300
Does he know what happened to us?

826
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,140
Does Playtime know New Sullivan fed New Sullivan?

827
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:17,060
he tells him? Will he ever know? And if we're going to come back to New

828
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:21,980
Sullivan at some point, I don't want you to answer that. Okay. Because one day,

829
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:28,180
and here's the only thing I hope. I hope that there is never a day

830
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,820
where he thinks that we abandoned him. Yeah, that we forgot about him. I don't

831
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:36,380
think he could ever believe that. I don't think he knows a lot of stuff

832
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:37,500
going on. And I hope

833
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,080
that new Sullivan pretty much knows. Oh yeah, and play time. I hope he never

834
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,880
learns any new words because I think with those words, he might wield them

835
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,520
against our spirits. Yeah. And he might say something really sort of a real

836
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:55,320
like you. He could say that he don't even that's not that's not that's not

837
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,560
funny man. God, that's really not a linguistic thing, right? It's like you

838
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,520
kind of know what? Oh my God, wait, wait, wait, wait.

839
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,220
Teenage New Sullivan next campaign.

840
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:10,600
Hopping out of the school bus, walking into high school.

841
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,080
What's up, Sully?

842
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:13,900
Oh yeah.

843
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,580
Oh yeah.

844
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,460
Yeah.

846
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,580
What other things are going on?

847
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:22,140
What's his name?

848
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,980
Drink beer.

849
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
We do gummies.

850
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:29,300
He's not the type to drink beer.

851
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,300
And study hard.

852
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:30,900
He will be.

853
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,100
I sure hope he studies hard.

854
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:35,700
Study hard, but still have fun.

855
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,700
Work hard, play hard.

856
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Hang ten.

857
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,700
Perfect balance.

858
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,700
Perfect balance.

869
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:51,700
Meet a boy.

00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:53,700
Meet a boy?

872
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,700
Oh yeah.

873
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,700
Oh yeah.

874
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,700
Oh yeah.

875
00:46:56,700 --> 00:46:57,700
Being honest.

876
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,700
Okay, so that's okay.

877
00:46:58,700 --> 00:46:59,700
Gumby Superior.

878
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,700
See, I want to experience all this shit.

879
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:06,280
was also like got turned into a vampire during the vampire wars, the

880
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,660
transylvanian war, nobody knew and so that was another thing that huge ass

881
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,740
facts had on him. That's why he was so afraid of him. Okay, everyone was afraid

882
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,860
of huge ass facts because he had all the information, but Leo was keeping him

883
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,060
around because he had to because he had information on him and he had guys

884
00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:23,540
around. And was there a name for this alien guy that or does he speak english?

885
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:27,460
Does he say anything? I mean he was just play time, he didn't have a name at all.

886
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,880
Okay, another one other thing. He slices blow tosses throat,

887
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,720
but he had a child.

888
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,720
He knows his child very well. Yeah. He's his best friend. He doesn't know.

889
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,940
Who's that again? Who is it? Is it Matthew McConaughey, right? Yeah. I

890
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,820
don't know. You've been watching True Detective? No, I've been watching

891
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,580
YouTube videos about True Detective. Okay, cool. That's awesome. Yeah, they

892
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:52,860
loved their kid. They had a kid. And I was an uncle. The only one here

893
00:47:52,860 --> 00:47:57,420
who should have died is me. So play time has been frustrated with Reddy on

894
00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,420
more than one. The reason why you heard him screech in anguish when he sliced

895
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,780
what's his name's throat O'Neal's throat was because he was like that was not a

896
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,540
childless couple. That is who I want to kill.

897
00:48:08,540 --> 00:48:11,860
That is the only people in like ready just directs him to who he should kill.

898
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,980
Yeah. So is there some kind of growing?

899
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,460
He would have been. Yes. There was this growing tension between the two of them.

900
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,140
Played it up. Playtime would have slowly is slowly learning that ready is

901
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:25,740
manipulating him. Because they basically like ready sees it as like like

902
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,740
playtime is the is my brother like we are brothers in this because they were both

903
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,620
born from the same like fucked up thing. I mean he wasn't born from the can we

904
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:37,260
can we ask questions about what we could have done? Yeah, absolutely. Was that

905
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:43,220
mod thing a good move? Well, no, we dying. No, no, no, no, no. I mean saying

906
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:48,620
her name. That was a good move. You just literally to where my did not roll

907
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,900
very if I could have gotten that role and I could have gone inside her body

908
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,220
being done, God knows what to her insides. Yeah, but I have one that

909
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:59,860
shut up. You could have found a way I would have if you if you nailed that

910
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:03,740
that was such a good. The way I reward you with you guys is like great

911
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,900
sweatpants. If it's a really creative because because you're not going to

912
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,820
always you're just not going to play the rules all the time. Yeah, or most of

913
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:13,580
the time, but if it's a really fun idea or really funny idea, like really

914
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:17,140
creative or really funny, like I usually was like that was a really creative,

915
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,940
cool idea. I was like if that worked out, I would have been down. I like that

916
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,660
this is turning a talking gun city. Now,

917
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:28,500
we should do a separate companion show. Yeah, the I think that should be the

918
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,840
next, the next thing, the next, the next episode is just talking. We should do

919
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:36,620
what they did. We really, we should do what they do for. We haven't really

920
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,280
talked. We don't talk always about it. We've been doing it. We should, we

921
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,960
should do what they do for the HBO shows and after everyone we do like a

922
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,660
like inside the episode. Yeah, okay. I might I have one. I have a couple more

923
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:51,260
questions. Actually, one is with play time is it would it have been possible

924
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,300
for us to

925
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,300
basically adopt him? Yep, yeah, of course. Wow,

926
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,620
oh my God, that's so beautiful for us to have the angel and the demon.

927
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,380
Well, no,

928
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:08,020
play time can't talk. Is there any understand he understands intention?

929
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,540
Could we have taught him, but he wouldn't they wouldn't have a conversation

930
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,780
between yeah. Oh my God,

931
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:18,380
play time and yes, what would play time saying? Oh, yes, I like

932
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,580
that's like how it sounds like okay, so

933
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:28,540
as we know is oh yeah, so it'd be kind of like this. It'd be kind of like

934
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:32,700
oh yeah, oh yeah, play time and the new song would like play with a toy and

935
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:32,940
then

936
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:41,700
oh yeah, now it's like most of their conversation. Can we hear can we hear

937
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:47,140
like the screw tape. What "Oh yeah" would sound like in Playtime's voice?

938
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,340
Oh yeah!

939
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:56,440
That's exactly what I wanted. Now can we hear it in Arnold Schwarzenegger's

940
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:56,840
voice?

941
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:02,040
Oh yeah, oh yeah. And now can we hear what Patches would sound like

942
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:02,540
normally?

943
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:04,540
Go ahead.

944
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,140
Go ahead.

945
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:11,540
Damn it. Wait. Oh, it does sound normal. Stop your

946
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,740
blocking it. Stop, stop. You didn't even turn it off. Whoa. He put the deep

947
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:16,980
voice.

948
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:23,020
All right. Well, I mean, that's pretty much all I wanted to know. Okay. Wait,

949
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:28,700
because I had I felt like I was following a lot of the shark guy. Yeah.

950
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:33,980
The shark guy was also a double agent. I knew that. But he was working. He was

951
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,180
working with the fishes. He was working with Leo. He was working with

952
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:42,660
He was both there to spy on Belinda for Leo because he thought Belinda had

953
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,940
some sympathies for the Irish slaves, which she did, though she wasn't acting

954
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,220
on any of that. Okay, speaking of the Irish slaves, I almost...

955
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,900
The leprechaun slaves.

956
00:51:50,900 --> 00:52:01,220
I was trying to... If we had gone down the path of liberating all of them...

957
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,660
Yeah, that was definitely a path.

958
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,380
And we were getting really close, I feel.

959
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:10,280
Yeah, I feel I I here's how I thought this was gonna go. I thought you guys would have run away

960
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:14,940
Uh-huh. I was I was trying to when this was happening. I was thinking like they might

961
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:21,540
Kamikaze and I would get why because it's like so hopeless and like it'd be kind of fun to like do a fresh start

962
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:25,500
So maybe they'll do that, but I was thinking like if you do this, I was thinking they would run away

963
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,580
Head back to the leprechauns

964
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,980
They'd be like you freed so many of our guys were so like we will go in and kill the green

965
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:33,540
That's what I was trying to do.

966
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:37,380
And then we'll help you guys find your kid because you guys have like fucking

967
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:38,220
like nearly died.

968
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,700
I had that whole, that's why I was trying to run away.

969
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:42,540
And then you were saying you want to go back.

970
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,820
You kind of put your lot in with them once you went for the Greech Queen quest.

971
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,980
Well, once he died, I was like, I don't,

972
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:50,820
I'm not so sure that I want to live in a world without me.

973
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:54,660
Yep. Don't make me say that. I'm serious. Don't make me say that.

974
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,540
If it's all three of us.

975
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:00,300
I did not want to live in a world where

976
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:05,400
glow toss was not there. Oh, also the sex toys that were being made were being

977
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:07,260
made by Ebenezer

978
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,940
for

979
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:13,700
huge ass facts. Was there a reason? To keep people addicted to shit, like

980
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:16,140
another... Was it a reason that... And using stuff from the Stargoo from their

981
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:19,660
old experiments back in the day, but reintroducing it on the Pleasure Palace.

982
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:23,780
Was it a connection that the spaceship was sex toy shaped to, or was that just

983
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,340
randomly both funny? That was kind of just like a... That was some space

984
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:28,500
- Bullshit. - Must be real.

985
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,780
- That was some space bullshit.

986
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,620
- That was just space bullshit.

987
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:31,440
- Yup.

988
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,220
- And the story came about as I realized

989
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,980
we were gonna be using toys to do it,

990
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,940
and then I was like, oh, this would be really fun

991
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:40,660
to play into how we're using toys.

992
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,500
- The medium is the message.

993
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:43,340
- Right.

994
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:44,160
- Marshall McLuhan.

995
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,740
- So what if, okay, so this whole campaign

996
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,180
was a test run for--

997
00:53:50,180 --> 00:53:51,700
- It was not a test run.

998
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:53,360
- It was a test to see if we were brave

999
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,540
and all of us passed.

1000
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:55,380
- Yup.

1001
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:58,940
we get a sweet reward. Yeah, which is

1002
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:00,980
you say

1003
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:06,500
you have to sing one song right now. You have to sing one karaoke song to end

1004
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:07,820
the episode of Our Choice.

1005
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:09,540
That's not

1006
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:14,500
you're making up all the... No, you have to sing a karaoke song to end the

1007
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:19,500
episode. You're not in D&D anymore, buddy. D&D is over. Now, it's Bully Hour.

1008
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,260
You're the singing master.

1009
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,260
You have to sing Hero by Gabriel Inglésias.

1010
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,260
Or not, Enrique Iglesias.

1011
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,260
I don't know that song.

1012
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,260
It'll be Pictures of Us.

1013
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,260
I genuinely don't know that song.

1014
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,260
Or Foo Fighters.

1015
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,260
Foo Fighters.

1016
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,260
That one.

1017
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,260
You know that one.

1018
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,260
And it has to be about us.

1019
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:39,260
Because it's going to be about bravery.

1020
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,260
Maybe.

1021
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,260
Foo Fighters Hero.

1022
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,260
Foo Fighters Hero.

1023
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,260
Well, I don't know if I know the verses.

1024
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:47,260
I'm about to verses you if you don't sing this song.

1025
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,260
Oh, wait. I actually don't know this song.

1026
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,260
there

1027
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:50,260
you

1028
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,260
know

1029
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:54,260
you

1030
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:56,260
know

1031
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:58,260
you

1032
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,260
know

1033
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:02,260
you

1034
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,260
know

1035
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,260
you

1036
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,260
know

1037
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,260
you

1038
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,260
know

1039
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,260
you

1040
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:16,260
know

1041
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,500
- Dim as they go.

1042
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,420
- Because it's us three.

1043
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,260
- Yeah.

1044
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:21,080
- Oh yeah.

1045
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:21,920
- My heroes.

1046
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,940
- And say extraordinary.

1047
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,440
- Dim as they go.

1048
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,440
- My heroes.

1049
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,220
- Heroes.

1050
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,580
- Watch him, he's ordinary.

1051
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,140
- They're extraordinary.

1052
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:31,980
- All right, sorry.

1053
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,900
- Say that.

1054
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:33,740
- Oh, 33 seconds.

1055
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:34,580
- 33 seconds.

1056
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,060
(laughing)

1057
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:38,940
- And now at 33 seconds, musical interlude.

1058
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,860
- Can you do what I've done by Linkin Park?

1059
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:42,700
- Oh, that'd be good too.

1060
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:43,780
- Because it's kind of you.

1061
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,620
- I mean, we gotta feel it.

1062
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:45,440
- Atoning for what you did.

1063
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,040
Fill the hour a few more minutes

1064
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:56,520
No, you're gonna see I'm not trying to avoid that oh, yeah, right, okay, you should try to avoid it this is

1065
00:55:56,520 --> 00:56:06,340
Okay, I don't remember I don't know the verses for this either

1066
00:56:06,340 --> 00:56:14,440
I I know the verse goes are you gonna sing it Cameron? I'll help him

1067
00:56:14,440 --> 00:56:23,760
Oh my God, when the drums come in, when the drums come in, I may get high

1068
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,580
transformers.

1069
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,880
Oh my word.

1070
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:33,920
I feel like we all forget how good this song is. We are always forgetting.

1071
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,320
Okay, you can skip to the chorus. Yeah, this is crazy.

1072
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,120
Wow. There's no blood.

1073
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:45,240
There's no alibi.

1074
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:52,880
Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lives.

1075
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,880
So let mercy come.

1076
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,880
Alright now just patches.

1077
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:00,880
I don't know just cut away.

1078
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,880
Ready? Okay.

1079
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,880
What I've done.

1080
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,880
I'll face myself.

1081
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
To cross out.

1082
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:09,980
cross out

1083
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:13,780
sorry guys

1084
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,380
I'm sorry,

1085
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:22,180
wow,

1086
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:22,680
wait,

1087
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:23,380
all right now,

1088
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:23,980
sorry,

1089
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:24,580
I think that's enough.

1090
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:24,780
No,

1091
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,080
that's one more one more one more song that we all know,

1092
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:27,480
sorry,

1093
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,580
no put on fruit salad by the wiggles.

1094
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:29,980
No,

1095
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,580
we're not doing that was such a beautiful.

1096
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,280
That was beautiful.

1097
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:32,480
Wait,

1098
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,780
do we are you going to sing?

1099
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,380
No,

1100
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:35,080
he I don't think you

1101
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,880
day. But I'm I'll do it.

1102
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,640
You've got to sing this one.

1103
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:41,880
Anything that you'd like to say to

1104
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,340
people before we end this this

1105
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,040
campaign? Because this is this is

1106
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,320
I know this is pretty crazy.

1107
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,840
So this is the worst ending that's

1108
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,160
ever happened in the whole show.

1109
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,000
Is it up to this one?

1110
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,140
Look to this. Do you have a final

1111
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:52,040
monologue?

1112
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,940
I don't I don't have I was I

1113
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:54,940
was really not expecting to run

1114
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,120
away. No, I wasn't really

1115
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:57,680
expecting this. I was I thought

1116
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,680
about it on the way here.

1117
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,600
I was like, you know what? They

1118
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,600
might.

1119
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:02,760
Thank you guys for always

1120
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,720
listening and enjoying the

1121
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,160
show. It means a lot to me.

1122
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:07,760
And I think it means a lot to them, too.

1123
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,760
I don't know. But I would love to hear any thoughts or suggestions

1124
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,800
or ideas you have for what we want to do next.

1125
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:18,260
I always love it. You can always DM me your thoughts and ideas.

1126
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:24,140
We could either do just clones of them, other holiday episode.

1127
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:25,580
I'm really just looking forward to doing more.

1128
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:29,080
I wish Batman episode we should do the Batman episode.

1129
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,480
I think if I if I could do this all again, I probably will.

1130
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:36,220
It's one of those where you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't, right?

1131
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:40,520
Like you could just, um, you could, you know, give them all,

1132
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,360
hey, heads up, like this is going to actually start to take advantage of

1133
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,660
all the kind of abilities I've given you and all the things we've done together

1134
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,260
so far.

1135
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:54,460
But, you know, instead, I was like, I'm just going to let them see

1136
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,360
what they do with this, right?

1137
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,600
They they've played with me now for three years.

1138
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:01,300
She said I was going to be out of the rattle, but I thought

1139
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,380
they were going to be going to go like this.

1140
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,660
You can't you just can't always win.

1141
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,140
We can't do that.

1142
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,420
All right. That's going to do it.

1143
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:13,220
We'll see you next time. All right.

1144
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:14,940
Bye. Go see.

1145
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,060
So this kid, I gave him that to me.

1146
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:21,340
And don't think I'm going to give a lot.

1147
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:26,260
I'm thinking, oh, I do what I do.

1148
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:36,260
[Music]

1149
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:46,260
[Music]

1150
00:59:46,260 --> 00:59:48,260
Yeah, yeah, man, I'm a stand-alone

1151
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:51,380
Normal, no, no me said he don't know me

1152
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:54,500
Yes, I get the money
