00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,360
He might be big for me later.

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,840
I've never seen him or heard him talk in any format and whatsoever.

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
He looks like a monkey.

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,480
I mean I know actually I've seen pictures of him but I've never seen a video or heard

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,480

19
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,040
You've seen a video, have you seen the Irishman?

Yeah, Sebastian Maniscalco, he's like, "Oh, I can get you a..."

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
He's like, "Yeah, the Irishman's frying zucchinis backstage."

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
That's the only thing they can get him to say.

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
"I can help you with your case, Robert De Niro, but it's..."

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
"But I gotta go help my mom. She's backstage frying zucchinis."

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
"My wife Deborah's in Queens."

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You know Sebastian Maniscalco? He's like, "Oh, Deborah, why?"

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,040

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:42,640

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,960
bizarre movie to watch him yeah yeah it's fucked up I mean they should do

34
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,120
that what they do to the man they should do that to Ray Romano next they should

35
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,360
good dude I mean he once I feel like you either get that treatment when you're

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,600
famous in your 20s and you turn 30 or you're famous in your 40s and you turn 60

37
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,200
yep then they make a last-ditch effort to put fucking like mud in your head

38
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,840
until you look like a balloon yeah yeah I'm hoping I I'm hoping if we hit it big

39
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,160
I mean what kind of mods should I do that's a big that's a big question Marty

40
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,920
Marty maxing out my job I've been over that I want to I want a chin that goes

41
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,960
to like a point like one foot away from my face but I don't want any other changes to

42
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,360
the shape of my face just a line.

43
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
Like a pharaoh?

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Exactly.

45
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,360
Tiny penis.

46
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,360
A pharaoh chin.

47
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,360
Tiny penis, big balls.

48
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,800
Well they won't have to do much work on that first part.

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,800
Yeah.

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
I know.

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,800
They'll have to upgrade it a little bit I think.

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I know.

53
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,280
I think maybe I have to go bigger than smaller.

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,360
You need to go to small and not from microscopic.

55
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,640
It's gonna be a pretty big leap.

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,280
We don't have a lot to work with down here if I'm being honest.

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Yeah.

58
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah well listen we could extend it to be like.

59
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,300
I want an inverted penis. We could get it like two inches longer but we'd have to take two

60
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,200
inches off of your legs in order to get the material we need. It's mostly going to be

61
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,680
foot and femur bone and we're going to build you a new penis. What if I get, what if you

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:12,560
get like a bone installed in your penis? I think you can, right? I mean you can get anything

63
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,200
kind of installed anywhere, right? I could get a TV in my back but I don't want to. No

64
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,640
reverse Teletubby. He could. I could get a TV in Janice's back. Oh come on don't do that to your wife.

65
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,240
Do it to my... I'd be doing it for me dude. Then you got to get a satellite and everything.

66
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,080
For me. To carry a satellite around. Put a satellite on her head, hide it in her hair,

67
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,880
TV in her back. Hey baby do you want to go look out of the window for two hours?

68
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:46,640
I believe it's Monday Night Football. But I think there's some birds out there.

69
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:55,920
there. Yeah, I just fire crop tops all the time. Yeah, I know it's a timber, but I just

70
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,760
think you look great in crop tops. Yeah, yeah, little TV, like PSP sized. You know, actually

71
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,360
just a PSP. Yeah. Yeah, maybe instead of getting any kind of body mods at all, I get a PSP.

72
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:13,320
Maybe I just get a PSP. Might be actually a way cheaper move. Or a TV. Yeah, maybe I'm

73
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm thinking of maybe getting like a PSP,

74
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,080
something that's easy to homebrew

75
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
and just kind of like load it up,

76
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:23,100
like load it up with like old games.

77
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,920
- You're some sort of hacker.

78
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,440
I want you to know, if you hack something

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,520
or download a game, I will report you.

80
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,680
Yeah, I will be reporting you to the NYPD

81
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,040
and they're gonna kick down your door.

82
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,400
- That would be so funny.

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
- That's right, and they're gonna take all your games.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,280
Actually, they don't even take the games,

85
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,640
they just delete the saves.

86
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,480
- Yeah.

87
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,440
- Oh, that's worse, they take my memory cards?

88
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,720
Oh, they know it's worse.

89
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,720
Yeah, they fucking know.

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
That's why they do it.

91
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
God.

92
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Yeah.

93
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,920
They're going to catch you fucking on Jedi, whatever, Jedi Academy games on PSP.

94
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,320
You're going to be like one level off the boss, dude.

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,600
They're going to fucking snatch that shit, delete it, give it back to you.

96
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,400
I'm going to be on the Hoth mission.

97
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Yeah.

98
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
They're going to...

99
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,280
Do you ever have a saved game like just super deleted by a sibling?

100
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
Yeah.

101
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,640
I had a save, yeah, my fucking Kingdom Hearts.

102
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Kingdom Hearts 1.

103
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:17,160
It was my brother's birthday and I don't know what happened, but we were we had just beat Riku

104
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,800
We were about to beat the game and then somebody deleted the save we don't know who

105
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,940
But it was like some agent. We I don't know if it was like my cousin or my brother

106
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,760
I think I think we talked about this before yeah, we definitely have

107
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,800
Because this was sense this was a fucking nightmare

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,340
This was like one of the worst things that happened because we didn't know how to beat Riku

109
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:47,740
We didn't know why we beat him. We didn't we didn't understand like oh you have to use this thing and like this armor or whatever and

110
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,160
It was just like a fucking like

111
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,760
You fucking did it. No you did it. Why did you do it?

112
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:57,960
I didn't fucking do it like just going back and forth screaming at each other

113
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,660
And then we were like well, I guess we just have to beat it again

114
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,140
I think you maybe had an agent of chaos and on the premises.

115
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,340
Yeah, it could have been.

116
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,340
It could have been.

117
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,300
Maybe my mom deleted it.

118
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,860
Oh, my dad.

119
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,860
So you're your mom that your mom saw you and your and your brothers were getting too close

120
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,060
and we're gonna overthrow her.

121
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,140
She was like, I need it was my sister.

122
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,560
My sister beat it.

123
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,140
So it was like a like a thing where it was like all of us were getting along.

124
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,140
You can't let them.

125
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,260
Yeah, you can't let them reach across the aisle like that.

126
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,720
If they all get along, they won't need me.

127
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,420
- Yeah. - Yeah.

128
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,260
- That's excellent.

129
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,740
They'll start cooking and cleaning

130
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,300
and making food for each other.

131
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,740
That's a bad sight for a mom.

132
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,580
- That is what happened when my sister left.

133
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,620
- Moms hate harmony so much.

134
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,860
Moms despise harmony.

135
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,260
- They wanna sow some discord.

136
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,660
- They love discord.

137
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,580
They hate harmony.

138
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,940
- Disorder, disorder, disorder, I don't know.

139
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,580
- My dad's fucked up my Mewtwo unlock on Melee

140
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,520
'cause he had to like leave the GameCube on

141
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,840
for like a long time or something.

142
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,800
Like you had to be playing the game for so many hours.

143
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,240
- Yeah, it's like 200 hours or 20 hours.

144
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,680
- Yeah, so I just left my GameCube on for like a couple days

145
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,320
and I came in after a couple days

146
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,880
and the GameCube had been off

147
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:14,120
and I was like, "What the fuck happened?"

148
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,960
And my dad, I asked my dad and he was like,

149
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,200
"Oh yeah, I had to turn the breaker off to work on a light."

150
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,400
And I've like never hated somebody so much.

151
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,220
- Yeah.

152
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,920
- Yeah, I wish that he had just gotten electrocuted

153
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,000
working on it instead of fucking up my YouTube shit.

154
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Oh man, when you're a kid, that's the most devastating fucking thing.

155
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,200
He's the only character in the game who does a backflip.

156
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,700
Yeah.

157
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,900
And my dad's worried about a fucking light in the kitchen.

158
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Suck my dick, David.

159
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,000
My aunt Kathy ran over one of my skateboards.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
Ugh!

161
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,200
And I, yeah, when I was like in fourth grade, and it was a...

162
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,600
It was like one of the most devastating.

163
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,100
Like, I was so pissed.

164
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,400
Like, I remember, like, my brother had just gotten another skateboard,

165
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,600
and that was like an older one that we had, that like a neighbor gave us.

166
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,900
And uh, she like, it was, I mean, it was pretty much already on the way out, but just the fact that she ran it over, I never forgave her.

167
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,420
That's tough. Can you imagine how much worse that is if you have like a- I still don't.

168
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:10,780
Like, do you know anybody who whose parents like ran over their kid on your car?

169
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,380
No. That's gotta be tough. Yeah, that I mean- They're talking about save games. That's fucked up.

170
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:21,900
That's not good. Yeah, the kid's gonna be so mad. I knew one kid and he was like,

171
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,940
I went to school with this kid and his mom was like our art teacher or something and they

172
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:35,320
talked about-- it was a Christian like homeschool thing and they were-- they told us like you

173
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,140
have to get together and have these like Christian conversations about shit and I can't remember

174
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:43,020
what they call it but like the reason why they became a Christian, they tell that story

175
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,460
and this lady told the story about running over her son with her car and she was like

176
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,420
yeah that's when I started believing in God because I like cracked his head open

177
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:59,060
and his brains are everywhere. And I didn't even notice for seven hours.

178
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:10,260
But like here he is he's still okay and this kid was not okay. God through all that

179
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:18,940
made him so normal and this kid was like he was fucking weird. He was like at

180
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:22,780
recess he would just try to get on top of whatever like every part of the

181
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:27,140
playground like he would like climb on top to the very top of the like slide

182
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:33,860
gym thing and he would just sit there by himself. It's like that like ant

183
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,580
parasite that makes ants climb up to a high place and then their head explodes

184
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,900
and shits up the sports. Yeah but his head exploded first and then he started climbing to the top of shit.

185
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,460
Yeah when his head was cracked open some an ant parasite crawled in from the

186
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:51,900
ground yeah dude I miss climbing dude we can hit a rock yeah you could go climb

187
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,740
I can't fucking do anything right now oh yeah I gotta go get vexed I gotta go get

188
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,740
my second appointment tomorrow I gotta walk to this fucking place no yeah it

189
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:08,020
sucks we get it I'll get like a crutch or dirt an uber or get Caleb to drive you

190
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:11,780
I'll get you a scooter well it is down that it's like they moved my appointment

191
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,140
place so it is closer but I still get a walk downhill and that's gonna suck I

192
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,140
I think walking uphill would be worse.

193
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Just roll in a ball.

194
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,140
Like Sonic.

195
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,140
I could become a Droidica.

196
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,140
I could roll.

197
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,140
You don't have time to build all that armor right now.

198
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,140
I don't have time to build a shield generator.

199
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,140
Just buy it second hand, dude.

200
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
You just roll up like a roly-poly.

201
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,140
Yeah.

202
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:37,140
I'm ready to get my vaccine.

203
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,140
I have a question.

204
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,140
I'm gonna go to the vaccine and have like a

205
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,140
obviously like huge bulge of

206
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,300
prosthetic skin over the vaccine. And as you can see, there's like a jar

207
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,100
side.

208
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,300
Just right in there, that'll be perfect. Shoot it right there.

209
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,620
A lab coat that just says like Chinese government.

210
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,980
Yeah.

211
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,980
Yep. A little higher. No, right there. You see this up? I have a

212
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Flight to catch.

213
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,580
You see the little nozzle right there on my arm?

214
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Just right in the nozzle, please.

215
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:22,660
Yeah, you just have a valve that stops it.

216
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,060
And I also have a vaccine for you as well, if you don't mind, while I'm here.

217
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,060
Try this out.

218
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
Why don't I give you one?

219
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,540
You might be very, very tired.

220
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,860
Man, I'm dreading that.

221
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:36,940
I don't want to feel any more tired than I already do.

222
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
You should do some drugs.

223
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,940
Yeah.

224
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Or go to sleep.

225
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
Yeah, man.

226
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
No.

227
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,940
The second dose was not that bad.

228
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,440
Which one did you get?

229
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Pfizer or Moderna?

230
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,440
Pfizer.

231
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Oh, I heard Moderna's second is bad.

232
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
I felt like shit, but I did not feel like shit.

233
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,940
I still went places and stuff.

234
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:58,940
The first dose, the day after, I was like, "Knock the fuck out."

235
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:02,440
Nope, I've not heard that at all from anyone about the first dose.

236
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,940
I think you might have an issue.

237
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,440
I think, yeah, maybe I'm a...

238
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,440
Did you stay up until 4am that night?

239
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Yeah, probably.

240
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,940
He slept for 20 minutes that night.

241
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,300
He's like, "Oh, something about that vaccine knocked me out, man."

242
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,300
I don't know.

243
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,180
Maybe the second one will knock you out, though.

244
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,180
It didn't mind.

245
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,940
I just felt really shitty the day I got it, and then the next two days I just had like

246
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,740
a headache and was tired, but like it never...

247
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,420
I tell you what, if you actually get the vaccine, I'm going to knock you out.

248
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,620
Putting that poison in your body.

249
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,940
You get it.

250
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:36,140
No, I stood at an angle where she thought that she put the needle into my arm, but it

251
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,140
just went behind my arm.

252
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:42,020
And then it squirted on the ground and she noticed and I said, "That was me.

253
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
I squirted that."

254
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,740
That was my, that's my juice.

255
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,740
It comes out sometimes.

256
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,740
Yeah.

257
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:48,740
Yeah, no, no, that's my stuff.

258
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,220
No, that's my stuff and I'm going to take it also.

259
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,020
It should be on my allergy card.

260
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,100
I squirt stuff when I'm sick.

261
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,100
Any allergies?

262
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,140
I'm sick right now with COVID-19.

263
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,620
Any allergies at all?

264
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:03,820
Yeah, just, just, just I squirt.

265
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,820
I'm a squirter.

266
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,700
When there's too much pollen, I squirt.

267
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,140
I'm a bleeder and I'm a squirter.

268
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,980
So be prepared.

269
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,540
I'm a squeter.

270
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,380
I'm a squirter.

271
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,720
I'm a jurdle.

272
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,700
I'm a midnight squirter.

273
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,700
Squirting my stuff on the nerves.

274
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:25,100
Squirting the meat to fall on your bum.

275
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,460
How about that?

276
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,140
That's gotta be one of the worst songs ever made.

277
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,820
Really? You don't like the Joker?

278
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,260
No. You know what I like? Guitar Hero 3.

279
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,260

music that I know is probably from Guitar Hero. Yeah. Like Guitar Hero has a

294
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:12,620
huge grasp on my mind. Remember that guy with that big-ass chin? Uh-huh. That ain't a

00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:16,140
guy, that ain't fooling nobody. That ain't no person. Which one was that? Was that uh...

00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:29,620
Napalm and Judy Nails and uh... fucking Lars Umlott, that's a fun name. He's the

298
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:59,080

305
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,580
I remember uh...

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,020
What, Forza 4?

307
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,540
I'm actually a real race car driver.

308
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,760
And that's not like driving a real race car.

309
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,260
You don't- you use a wheel, not a controller.

310
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,740
Oh, Tony Hawk?

311
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,540
Yeah, alright, go outside, fuckin' try that shit.

312
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:41,940
Yeah, just spam A and B all day on your skateboard.

313
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,300
Nothing's gonna happen, you're gonna do-

314
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:46,980
Yeah, people would say that shit about like Call of Duty and it's like you're 12 years

315
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,980
old.

316
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
Yeah.

317
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,700
This would never happen in a real war.

318
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,940
Yeah, trust me, I know war.

319
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,940
Yeah.

320
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,780
I'm actually a master chief and the energy sword. It's not it's not even that good in real life

321
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:07,340
You can't make a hammer that has gravity. Yeah, sorry you can't put gravity in something cars aren't called warthogs in space

322
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,080
They're just called cars. Why would he have a new name for them?

323
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:16,540
Warthog still exist I remember I was playing guitar here with my cousins once and

324
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,880
We were doing like the slash battle

325
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,580
And I think one of my cousins was like man slash must be so good at guitar here

326
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:30,360
I just remember this thing like, "Well, no, like, I don't think so. It's just pressing

327
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,360
buttons." He's like, "Yeah, but the hand-eye coordination."

328
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,680
I think the best part about those is that like, with like rock band and shit, is that

329
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,560
all of them are just like pressing stupid buttons or whatever and you can, people who

330
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,920
play those instruments can be like, "Yeah, whatever. It's not like that." Except for

331
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,360
the drums is just playing the drums.

332
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
Yeah.

333
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,360
It's just exactly like the drums.

334
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,720
You have to know how to play the drums to play those.

335
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,200
you have to be a drum a drummer to play that game well like there's probably

336
00:16:56,200 --> 00:17:01,000
some people who have learned the drums through rock I'm sure there's a huge

337
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,560
amount of people I think I know people learn to dance people learn drums from

338
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:09,080
like electric drums I think because you can't you know I never considered it

339
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:13,200
like like looking at it like electric drums cuz it's like I look at that and

340
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:18,040
I'm like oh that's just a toy yeah well drums are a toy most instruments are

341
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
DJ Hero.

342
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,520
That's the thing, musicians need to grow, they act like it's art, it's, you know, you're

343
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,520
playing.

344
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Yeah.

345
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,520
It's called playing music.

346
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
It's not, it's, exactly.

347
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,600
You're saying that because you don't play any instruments.

348
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,120
I play a lot of instruments.

349
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
Yeah?

350
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,160
Name them.

351
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,600
My mind and my soul.

352
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,960
Uh, well, one instrument would be the, like, writing a song is one thing that I'm sure.

353
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
I play my computer really well.

354
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,560
You have written a lot more songs than anyone else here.

355
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,320
You know, the notes.

356
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,040
notes I tend to play different notes. You know I was trying to get on your shit but I think

357
00:17:53,040 --> 00:18:02,800
you know I went too far. The keys uh-huh the black keys. Damn really you play those? I can

358
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,120
only play the black part of the piano. Yeah yeah just a bunch of just sharp notes. My fingers are

359
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,920
too small and weak to play the giant white keys. I can only play the I can only push down on the

360
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,880
on the thin black parts. Oh I'm sorry I'd love to play piano in your band but I can only play

361
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,620
the pedals. I don't even know how to play the keys yet. Yeah I'd probably be really good

362
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,800
at driving a car. If you want to get like a really big piano and you stand on the upper

363
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,600
level and play the keys and I can stand underneath because I can't do the pedals with my hands

364
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,280
either. I can't like crutch down under a normal sized piano. You sit on my lap and you play

365
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:39,040
the piano. And I'll do the, I'll fuck up the pedals. I mean you don't have to worry about

366
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,800
it. Those notes are going to be sustained. Yeah I'm going to sustain every last one of

367
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,640
If you want to sit on my lap when you play guitar too, I can do that too.

368
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,320
I mean I can do the pedals for the piano while you're doing that.

369
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,640
It won't make any noise but it might be fun.

370
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,360
I can do some pedals for the guitar too.

371
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Hey, why not?

372
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
Why not?

373
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,240
I think that they should add more pedals to the piano.

374
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,240
Yeah?

375
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,240
Well you could.

376
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,160
You could get an electric piano, plug like a...

377
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,320
They should add one that just drives around the piano a little bit, pretty slowly, like

378
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
five miles an hour.

379
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,800
Oh dude, I would hate to get one of those.

380
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,960
A piano where they mixed up the pedals at the pedal factory and they gave it car pedals

381
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
instead.

382
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,960
Yeah, from like a Lamborghini. It's the fastest fucking piano.

383
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,960
So she sits down to play her piano for the first time and it just shoots into the wall.

384
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,960
Yeah, that would be a big mistake, dude.

385
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,960
And you take it to the shop and they're like, "Yeah, see, the gear shift should have tipped you off right away."

386
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Yeah.

387
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
It was very obvious.

388
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,960
You just have a whole car in your house, you think it's a piano?

389
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
It's got pedals.

390
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,240
I thought it was a piano.

391
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,280
Look, the fucking, the key's here.

392
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,480
There's a key.

393
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
- Yeah, there is a key.

394
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,560
- Whoa.

395
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,720
- A single key, wow.

396
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,400
- Cars and pianos both have a key,

397
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,360
pedals and a chair.

398
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,600
- Yeah. - Hold on.

399
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,440
And they have a sound that they make.

400
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,240
- And you can open up the hood to see

401
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,880
what Tom and Jerry play in.

402
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,360
- Yep, I think a lot of people don't realize--

403
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,680
- What Tom and Jerry play in?

404
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,720
(laughing)

405
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,080
What they playing in there?

406
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,080
I hear some Tom and Jerry shit.

407
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,520
- Walking into a dueling piano bar in New Orleans.

408
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,640
- Y'all do some Tom and Jerry shit in here.

409
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,840
Oh, now I'm out, man.

410
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,000
- Every time I play the piano,

411
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
I get really, really scared and I triple check the piano

412
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,080
to see if Tom and Jerry are inside,

413
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,480
if they're gonna pull any shit.

414
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,760
'Cause I do not wanna get hit in the face

415
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,760
with one of those hammer things from inside.

416
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,840
That shit would suck.

417
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,000
- I mean, one of those self-playing pianos,

418
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,960
tell me that, I don't know how those work.

419
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,560
It has to be Tom and Jerry, dude.

420
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,520
There's no way it's anything else.

421
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,440
Because you can't make a computer, we know this, a computer can't play music, that's

422
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
the Turing test.

423
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,440
Exactly.

424
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,520
So it's Tom and Jerry in there and they're fucking punching those keys dude.

425
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,920
And you gotta wonder, you're like, well not only is this weird to have a Tom and Jerry

426
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:55,240
in there, but it's also immoral because you know one of them is playing it with the other's

427
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,240
body.

428
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Exactly.

429
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,600
That's how the Chuck E. Cheese animatronic bands work too, they got Tom and Jerry and

430
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
the guitars and stuff.

431
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Just battling.

432
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,480
Don't even get me started on the xylophone, you know that's one of their rib bones.

433
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,600
it's their teeth uh-huh it's their teeth - it's either rib bones or teeth either

434
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,920
way this is not vegan to me uh-huh yeah it is not vegan to play any of these

435
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:25,360
instruments cuz Tom and Jerry or maybe maybe could be loony tunes yeah remember

436
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,260
Jerry's French cousin the little gray mouse it's like you guys like nibbles

437
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,980
the orphan is that his name I don't know if I don't think nibbles the orphan was

438
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,960
French the orphan who comes and he's even hungrier than Jerry and he eats all the

439
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:46,060
food and makes Jerry mad that he was I posted I posted about my thing and

440
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,580
somebody message requested me and said um you know his name is it nibbles the

441
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:55,220
orphan it's toughy the mouse right what I think one second was it toughy nibbles

442
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,980
also known as toughy yeah all right so you're both right fuck this guy yeah

443
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,540
shut up this guy fucking pussy you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna chop you a

444
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,280
Way better name, I'll say.

445
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,440
I'm gonna chop you in half,

446
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,800
and then I'm gonna push out the eye of the ribeye steak

447
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,880
that happens when I cut you in half.

448
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,420
That's not gonna happen.

449
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,700
I'm gonna push it out with my big claw.

450
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,960
How come Tom never got an orphan to hang out with?

451
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,860
Quacker, Quacker Jeff Duck.

452
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,020
That's just lazy.

453
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,860
Tom and Jerry Loki, one of the best cartoons of all time.

454
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,700
Yep.

455
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,180
Remember when he went to heaven,

456
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,200
and then he went to hell?

457
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,900
Remember how racist it was?

458
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,740
Yeah.

459
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,740
I had a cartoon about a cat and mouse fighting and they still found a way to like...

460
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,740
They still made it racist.

461
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:44,740
Well yeah, you run out of ideas at some point, right?

462
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,740
It's like, ah, the cat and the mouse are chasing each other.

463
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,740
I guess we'll make it a racist thing now? At least they had that cartoon thing where they

464
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,740
didn't show the people's faces so when they had like Aunt Jemima walk in

465
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,740
at least you know they were gonna do some really fucked up shit.

466
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,240
that was a good move by them. When you when was the when was the day that you

467
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:13,700
realized Aunt Jemima was racist? What? For me? You know what I'm saying? Aunt Jemima's a

468
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:19,000
racist depiction. When was the day you realized that? I have yet to realize it.

469
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,020
Yeah? Yeah. I think she's pretty cool. I mean she seems like a sweet lady. I

470
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:27,500
didn't I didn't know about like this the like the stereotypes or anything

471
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,140
surrounding it and then like I think when I was in high school I was like I guess

472
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,660
that is a little fucked up huh yeah I heard they're changing auntie mama

473
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,460
because they find out that found out she was racist against whites yeah yeah

474
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:48,700
that's what I meant when I said that they're changing the logo to some really

475
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:52,980
messed up stuff yeah yeah switching it to a she said she said white people

476
00:23:52,980 --> 00:24:01,300
listened to Radiohead and and they actually take a fucking made her lose

477
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,180
her job they fired her for that yeah it's pretty fucked up yeah she's

478
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:10,340
actually that size and they use her real body as a mold for the the syrup bottles

479
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:16,580
didn't just do like a doc didn't take out a book from the dr. Seuss yeah

480
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,580
something like that it was the one where it was like a Japanese is a Japanese.

481
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:27,020
They stopped publishing it. Yeah I think that you sent it to us forever ago.

482
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:31,140
It's like yeah these are two Japanese people. Well he did way worse stuff than

483
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,700
that. Yeah I know that's why it's so funny for that to be the thing that they

484
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:38,260
take. Yeah that one's like one panel in a book but he yeah he did some stuff.

485
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,220
Yeah you see how this guy talks about who's? Not kindly. Have you seen his

486
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,020
- It's so funny that-- - There's depictions of you, of who's--

487
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,860
- Of who's? - Their noses don't look like that!

488
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,780
- He has the whole thing of the sneeches,

489
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,780
where it's just like, "Oh, racism is bad,"

490
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,980
but you go like, you just look at any,

491
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,580
like all the cartoons he drew, like World War II,

492
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,420
it's like, man.

493
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,260
- Yeah.

494
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,780
- Yeah, he only thinks racism is bad

495
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:02,060
when it's like a bird-turtle hybrid.

496
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:05,100
- Who's more racist, Dr. Seuss for drawing a Japanese guy,

497
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,980
or my great-grandfather for shooting one in the head?

498
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,180
(laughing)

499
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,580
In World War II, which one is worse, you think?

500
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,460
probably doctor seuss you think so

501
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
i'm just kidding

502
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,460
woo i'm in the clear sounds good

503
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,460
maybe doctor seuss

504
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,460
i don't know

505
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,460
i think it's worse to kill somebody than it is to draw something racist about them

506
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,460
well well

507
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,460
uh

508
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,460
i don't know i think that's a no brainer

509
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,460
my history teacher told me it was all justified

510
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
in high school so

511
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,460
i think he's in the clear

512
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,460
yeah dude they were being mean or something

513
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,460
yeah they were all being mean

514
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:47,820
Yeah, they were being so rude about dr. Seuss's cartoons. Yeah ruined it. They ruined somebody's surf surfing lessons in Hawaii

515
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:53,900
So we obliterated two cities. Uh-huh. Yeah, somebody's fucking

516
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:58,540
Margarita got the umbrella blown out of it in Hawaii. Yeah by some wind

517
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,260
The hotel from forgetting Sarah Marshall had to close

518
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:08,260
Japan just dropped a fart on Hawaii. We have to obliterate it with a laser now

519
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,840
Mm-hmm, and I guess it worked kind of

520
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,780
What works?

521
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,780
Well, you know

522
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,420
It worked we what do you mean it weren't we won

523
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:28,060
World War two we won it right. I don't remember actually who won. I think yeah, I think we won, right

524
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,420
Maybe you know might have won are any of us Japanese or

525
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,940
Hitler no, we won't true. Yeah

526
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:40,960
It's cool how we won every war it is pretty cool. You got you start to wonder like man

527
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:48,700
Maybe maybe we're just the best. Yeah, maybe everyone's jealous of us. Yeah, maybe maybe that's why the war started in the first place

528
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,100
Mm-hmm

529
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,780
The u.s. Is so fucking swag

530
00:26:52,780 --> 00:27:00,500
This sucks. We should fight each other for three years first and then see if they get involved. They're trying to bait us

531
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:04,740
Yeah, they were in on it the whole time. Yeah. No, we're doing some fucked up shit

532
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:13,140
Also, World War II, they were like, "The US is gonna want to get in on this so fucking

533
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,140
badly.

534
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,860
Let's just fucking fight each other forever and then just see, I mean at some point they're

535
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,860
gonna cave."

536
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,420
And we were just like, we were all in the US just like biting our knuckles, just like,

537
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,420
"Oh fuck.

538
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,300
Oh, I wanna go there so bad and kill some people, dude.

539
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,940
Please, please, just let me.

540
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,620
Let me go over there."

541
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,300
Yeah, they started doing the holocaust and everyone in America is just like, "Oh no, that's fine."

542
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,780
The what now? Sorry, no clue what you're talking about.

543
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,060
That word's too big for me.

544
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,660
Yeah, the holler what now? Oh, Hollaback Girl, Gwen Stefani, great song.

545
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,700
Yeah, and then Japan, fucking...

546
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,260
No, no, no, we're not talking about Hollaback Girl.

547
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:58,260
There's something very... there's something going very wrong here.

548
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,580
We're doing some messed up stuff over here that... see if you even fucking care.

549
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,940
Yeah. I think we need a World War III like insanely soon also. Yeah. Yeah. That stuff's getting too

550
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:14,260
good, dude. I mean, a world where we, us three, can be like kind of successful needs the biggest

551
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:20,020
war of all time to happen. Exactly. Agreed. We need something to just level the planet.

552
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:28,660
Just take it down, dude. We need every ice cap to melt. We need a meteor. A meteor. Giant meteor

553
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,740
2021 we need like cloudy with a chance of meatballs level like

554
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:38,020
Devastation. Yeah. Yeah. We need a giant pizza to fall on me and I go

555
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,540
Mmm, that's my favorite book as a kid. Did you guys ever read that book? Yeah, it was so awesome

556
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,220
I had to read that in first grade and then we had to write our own

557
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:51,700
Cloudy with a chance of meatballs story where it's like with the day that that happened to us

558
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,100
Whoa

559
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,940
I thought it was so cool and you know this should have been an early sign from my

560
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,540
parents to you know that something maybe was going on with my brain. My favorite

561
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,660
part of that book is I was like they have a part where they have like street

562
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,500
sweepers but they have like plates and forks and knives instead of the

563
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,060
sweeping. I was like that's the coolest thing ever. They need to make machines

564
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:20,180
like this. Yeah I remember in my thing in the first grade I wrote mine about how I

565
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:26,260
skateboarded on a sausage that's sick dude yeah that's actually I was in the

566
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:34,620
halfpipe similar personality revealer yeah yeah I never had an experience with

567
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,860
that book oh really yeah it's pretty guessing it out check it out at h24 I

568
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:46,160

00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:34,240
it's a it's a it's a brave new brave new weed here in New York City

600
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,460
yeah I'm gonna just like old like songs that you would hear out of like a weed

601
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,320

I miss that.

604
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,400
And then Pharrell talks about his big hat.

605
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,400
Yeah.

606
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,680
And you're like, "Oh my God, dude, this guy knew his hat was big."

607
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,680
Yeah.

608
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
He realized it all along.

609
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,440
I always thought that this was some sort of accident.

610
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,280
Maybe his hat had fallen into an enlarging ray, but it turns out that he bought a big

611
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,280
hat.

612
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,000
Before he got to the Grammys, somebody took a leaf blower to his hat.

613
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Yeah.

614
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Or maybe he got shrunk, but he left his hat.

615
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,000
I mean, Pharrell, I've always trusted Pharrell's choices like that, but that hat was too damn

616
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:24,480
much I mean that hat was huge uh-huh that was a big ass hat. Has anyone really talked about this hat?

617
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,360
That must be the size of Texas. Oh my god hey Arby's Pharrell has that your logo yeah wait a second

618
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,040
that that hat must be the size of the whole United States. Do you think that reached other countries?

619
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,040
That was like a big enough news story there was like an anchor in Mexico who's like a Pharrell hat

Everything else English but if you say it in that voice it sounds like Spanish. You said es un.

622
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:03,920

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,760
open it and it's some poll from Quinnipiac. Yeah, it's like,

652
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,320
we're I am going to kill myself if you do not open this email.

653
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,120
Yeah, dude, that's a I think that should be outlawed. Yeah,

654
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,880
absolutely. Nobody should be able to send you emails. There

655
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,920
should be a do not call list for emails, but there I guess there

656
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:11,440
isn't, you should be able to just say nobody can ever email

657
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:18,600
me unless I ask you to. I guess that's what a spam filter is. Mine doesn't work though.

658
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,880
And then you forget to unsubscribe. You know what I found out the other day? I've been

659
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,040
a member at fucking Magic Mountain Six Flags for like two years, paying fucking ten bucks

660
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:33,960
a month. Is that the LA one? Yeah, it's in fucking Los Angeles. I knew I shouldn't have

661
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:38,120
got that fucking thing. You were like, no dude, if we go like twenty times then it's

662
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:45,160
worth it and then I dude and then I tried I went three times and then I tried to

663
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,760
cancel I think I'm actually still up because I only went three times and it's

664
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:53,080
ten bucks a month I think cuz it's 60 bucks per visit so I mean I'm still

665
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:59,160
winning obviously but the I tried to cancel it and the website when I press

666
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,640
cancel just broke yes wouldn't load anymore they love doing that shit yeah

667
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,300
- It's crazy, there's definitely something wrong.

668
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,900
- I have to go out there, and here's what they do.

669
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,080
They make it so you have to fly all the way out

670
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,880
to Los Angeles to cancel your membership,

671
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,280
and then you get there and you're like,

672
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,580
well hell, while I'm here,

673
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,800
might as well fucking hit a couple rides for old time--

674
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,920
- That Superman ride is calling me.

675
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,040
- Might as well hit Superman Return to Krypton real quick.

676
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,720
Oh my God, I'm coming again.

677
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,360
I'm re-upping my membership, wow.

678
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,920
That was incredible, I got so high.

679
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,380
- That's the same thing they do with Planet Fitness.

680
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,240
- Last time I went, I went with Joe,

681
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
and Joe was like about to vomit the entire time

682
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,360
and he ended up vomiting,

683
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,060
and I just walked into one of the kitchens that they had

684
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,840
and I stole an onion and two bags of tortillas

685
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
and I just walked around the whole park.

686
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,680
- I remember that.

687
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,720
- With like, and then every ride they'd be like--

688
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,760
- I think that might have been the onion that Patrick ate.

689
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,960
- Oh, it might have been actually.

690
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,880
- That is not it.

691
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,720
- I think it might have been.

692
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:53,540
- That was way earlier,

693
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,040
'cause there was a bag of onions in the hallway.

694
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,320
- I walked around all the--

695
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,060
- Isn't that the one that Caleb took?

696
00:38:59,060 --> 00:38:59,900
- No.

697
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:00,720
- Could have been.

698
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,760
- No, 'cause that, when you didn't go to sit,

699
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,320
That was like when you first got to LA.

700
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:08,040
- No, you came when we were right about to leave LA.

701
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:08,880
- I went a bunch of times, bro.

702
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,120
- You were in LA, that was like a week before we left.

703
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,600
- That was not the same onion.

704
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,560
I can tell you that right now, it was not the same onion.

705
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,920
- I don't think it matters.

706
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,760
- It matters.

707
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,600
- It doesn't.

708
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,500
- It was the same onion.

709
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,120
- Every ride I went to, I'd have to put the onion

710
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,720
and the tortilla in the cubbies

711
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,900
where you're supposed to put backpacks.

712
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,240
And the person would be like, I'll take your backpack.

713
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,640
And I'd be like, can you just take these things?

714
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,520
(laughing)

715
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:36,520
I brought the onion on a roller coaster and it just flies out and kills somebody.

716
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,320
Well, because I was thinking at the time I was like I'm paying ten bucks a month for

717
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:44,280
this if I can get groceries every time I come to Magic Mountain I'm up so much

718
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:47,600
because there's no security on the restaurants you can just walk in there's

719
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:52,520
piles of food everywhere it's mostly tortillas and onions from what I've found.

720
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,520
And you can just carry them around with you dude. But and then on my way out there was

721
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,820
like there was like like they had a sheriff like a sheriff's department like

722
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:09,100
right outside of Magic Mountain and they were loading up like fucking m16s and

723
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:17,600
shit into the sheriff's department and Joe was like some it's an onion and he

724
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,620
thought that somebody called the cops cuz I stole that's pretty cool dude yeah

725
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,940
they were bringing like an m16 to fucking threaten you they're gonna kill

726
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,520
- Yeah. - Oh, they did.

727
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,240
- They were gonna do the thing from Good Time

728
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,680
where they pour all the acid sprite into your mouth.

729
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,820
- Yeah.

730
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:36,240
- And then leave you in one of the rides.

731
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,120
- I didn't see Good Time,

732
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,360
but which character are you insinuating I am?

733
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,340
- Security guard.

734
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:43,060
- All right.

735
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:45,200
I'm fine with that one.

736
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,640
- Why, what?

737
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,520
- Anything but that one guy.

738
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,440
- What one guy?

739
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,600
- From Good Time.

740
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,720
- Oh, the sassy brother?

741
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,360
- Yeah. - Oh, okay.

742
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,000
as long as I'm any character in that movie but him I'm pretty happy with that

743
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,320
comparison. You do a lot of stuff that Robert Pattinson did in that movie. Yeah.

744
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,800
Yeah. I've seen it. Yeah. Yeah. Can you get you to sign off on that? Can you say it? Yeah dude.

745
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,160
Fuck yeah. I'm Robert Pattinson in that movie. I do everything he does.

746
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,080
Oh no. What does he do?

747
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,800
He probably just helps us. He rubs a bank. He makes out with a sixteen year old I think too.

748
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,280
Yeah. Okay.

749
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,520
Can I be the one with the no brain, please?

750
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,840
Can I switch?

751
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,560
It's just deaf.

752
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:29,800
I think-

753
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,920
Can I switch sides?

754
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,520
All it is is he's deaf, right?

755
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,720
I don't think so.

756
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,600
That's not how I've had that movie described to me by comedians.

757
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,680
I don't think that's true.

758
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,640
No.

759
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,960
No, I think he looks deaf, but there's more going on.

760
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,560
How does somebody look deaf?

761
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,480
How many times do I have to explain this to you?

762
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,840
No, but yeah, no, this-

763
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:57,800
If you walk around and you see somebody and their face is a little bit wrong and you can't quite

764
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,000
tell what it is and then you notice that their eyes are really really big.

765
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:11,320
You notice that they're sound waves that are going into kind of like they can see.

766
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,800
Like they're kind of like watching sound waves maybe.

767
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,280
Yeah that person is deaf.

768
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:20,840
They sniff really loudly before they cross the street.

769
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:26,360
I don't want any of our deaf listeners to get angry. That's fair. All right. That's fair.

770
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:33,400
You know what's worse than being deaf is having super hearing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like tinnitus.

771
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,440
That's what super hearing. That's super. Is it? What? Really? No. No, that's it's tinnitus is

772
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:43,080
bad hearing. Tinnitus is like you fucking hear the earth's vibration. That's what that sounds.

773
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:49,240
Tinnitus is like also everybody has tinnitus is like I saw Brockhampton and I was it was too loud

774
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:56,280
and now I have tinnitus. Tinnitus sucks dude. Shut up. It's so evil. Yeah. I have very slight tinnitus.

775
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,320
Really? It's gonna get, dude by age 30 it's gonna be over for me. That's what Cameron gets for

776
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:05,640
listening to all those, that loud rock. All that damn rock and roll music. Honestly probably what

777
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,840
it was. Yeah. Probably just from listening to my iPod too loud. Cameron put on like,

778
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,760
yeah, Cameron put on like Psychosocial by Slipknot. Putting on Psychosocial, yeah,

779
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,920
walking to school and turning it up really loud so everyone could tell I'm listening to Psychosocial.

780
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:20,920
Sick. That was a power move, dude.

781
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,420
Yeah, yeah.

782
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,920
It's like, I'm suffering right now just to fucking, just so you know how cool this is.

783
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,420
I still turn music up way too. It's nicer loud, dude. That's what, it helps you get in touch with yourself, you know?

784
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,920
Yeah, I like to touch myself loudly.

785
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,420
Mm-hmm.

786
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,920
My, uh, this is a stupid fucking story from my youth.

787
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:46,920
My, uh, I think one of us said, like, "I want an eye touch for Christmas," and my Uncle Kevin turned to us and was like, "Hmm, I want an eye touch myself."

788
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,340
- That's clever. - That's pretty good.

789
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:51,900
- I think about that a lot.

790
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,220
- Dude, my uncles have had some bangers over the years.

791
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,860
- Yeah, I mean, the advent of Apple has to be

792
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:01,180
like the number one best thing to ever happen to uncles.

793
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,020
- Yeah. - Yeah.

794
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:02,840
- Yeah.

795
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:07,780
- iPod, iMac, whatever happened to I have a job?

796
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:09,060
- Yeah. - You know?

797
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:11,540
- iPod, iPad, I paid.

798
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:16,060
- Yeah, iPod, iPad, I don't give a crap, honestly.

799
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:17,700
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah.

800
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:22,460
yeah I poop that's yeah I poop my damn pants like a neon shirt with like a

801
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,460
silhouette of a guy on a toilet and it says I poop you ever see those people

802
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,660
wear like an like a shirt with an Apple logo on it mm-hmm what the fuck yeah I

803
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:34,820
mean Pierce is taking like pictures oh yeah

804
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:40,860
on their cars this shit is so funny yeah it's such a fucking so many people

805
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:44,260
sticker yeah so many people put the Apple logo on their fucking cars yeah

806
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:50,900
insane I have an iPhone the sticker that comes with the phone yeah makes you go

807
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:55,420
the worst sticker ever made I think yeah the big joke is like putting it on your

808
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:01,140
like Windows PC or whatever and yeah like of a Mac I would know I would never do

809
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:04,500
something so controversial I don't yeah I would not do that I would I would put a

810
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,540
sticker the sticker that comes when I buy an assault rifle and I will put it

811
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:11,260
on my phone that would and that would be kind of a bait like a bait and switch

812
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:14,500
thing like it also be a bit of a commentary like which one of these is

813

816
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,980
right now yeah maybe the first time in my life I listen to the iPad iPod I just

817
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,900
thought. Wow and if you know and when you're on one of those damn things

818
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:47,500
you're not thinking. Absolutely. Yeah. Screen time, whatever happened to brain

819
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:53,940
time, excuse me, your brain. Screen time, whatever happened to scream time, I need

820
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,980
sometimes I just got to let it out. Sometimes you got to yell into that

821
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,620
pillow. Uh-huh. Yeah. And now what you yell into your phone? Mm-hmm. I don't think so.

822
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:05,460
You can't do that. Yeah. Apps used to be something that you would get at TGI

823
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:10,740
Fridays you know nowadays it's how you how you fuck a gay man as fast as

824
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,480
humanly possible yeah you know there's so many things and hey it's like they

825
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,760
always say there's an app for that mm-hmm yeah there's an app for everything

826
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:24,820
you know how everyone's still saying that except for meditation oh wait is

827
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:31,620
there there's an app for that a message a message used to used to say well now

828
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:39,660
it's on your phone uh-huh yeah preach you said notes used to be a musical in them

829
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:46,500
you had it in music I I remember when notes used to be sticky yeah I remember

830
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,220
that too oh my god I was thinking the other day how funny it is that people

831
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,980
who are like they pay like 200 bucks a year to use headspace and then they

832
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,140
think they're doing the same thing that like starving monks are doing yeah

833
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:02,620
Because they're doing it like on a subway train on the way to where we work.

834
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:03,660
What's Headspace?

835
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:08,500
It's like one of those guided meditation apps where like a British guy tells you

836
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:12,700
like just try not thinking for a couple minutes.

837
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,420
Yeah.

838
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,820
And those people are like I'm pretty much gonna like a monk right now.

839
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,380
Yeah.

840
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,380
I'm basically the same as like...

841
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,460
If you watch, I have to give you a secret right now.

842
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,580
You don't have to spend a dollar.

843
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:30,080
If you want to learn to meditate, all you have to do, you watch all three extended edition

844
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,220
Lord of the Rings movies back to back.

845
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,040
It's going to change your life and the way you think about things.

846
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:38,800
You get really into listening to very boring music.

847
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,080
You're going to be sitting on the couch all night thinking, "Damn, you know, the world

848
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:43,080
really is beautiful."

849
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,280
And you know what?

850
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,160
Some things come to you, you never thought of before.

851
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,880
You know, Pokemon really is ingenious.

852
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:49,880
That's true.

853
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:50,880
Stuff like that.

854
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,520
It'd do be crazy how cars go.

855
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,720
- How'd that work?

856
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,320
- That's how I think about everything.

857
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,160
- I don't know.

858
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,280
- That is genuinely how I think about everything nowadays.

859
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,120
- Yeah.

860
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:02,960
- That's how I've always thought about things.

861
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,520
- If I'm up past 10 o'clock, I sit there and I go,

862
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,660
damn, it's crazy they invented the hole in the hat

863
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,000
so it goes on the head.

864
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:09,840
- Yeah.

865
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,440
(laughing)

866
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,260
- I remember having a moment where I was--

867
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:14,640
- You guys ever think about how we're like meat sacks

868
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,560
floating on a rock in space?

869
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,800
- Wow, yeah.

870
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,900
I'm gonna pop you.

871
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,640
(laughing)

872
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:23,560
I'm gonna pop you, I'm gonna squirt you like a balloon.

873
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:24,560
Yeah.

874
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:25,560
Yeah.

875
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:29,560
I did one time have a, recently I was like on a plane and I was like, how the fuck does

876
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:30,560
this work?

877
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:31,560
And then I realized, I don't know.

878
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,000
Every time, every time I'm on a plane.

879
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:35,200
I don't know how a paper airplane works.

880
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:41,320
Why am I trying to understand how this thing works?

881
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
I don't know.

882
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,560
Yeah, no, how you truly transcend is what, yeah, when you start having those dumb guy

883
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,320
thoughts that are so dumb that there's not even like yeah like it's like like

884
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,280
every every dumb guy is like oh we're just we're just meet sex on a spinning

885
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,160
rock oh like how does an airplane work but not every dumb guy can get to like

886
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,960
damn the computer keys are crazy yeah that's a way of saying yeah that's how

887
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,800
meditation gets you yeah that's it truly puts you in tune it's because you you

888
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:13,640
were make actively making yourself stupid or meditating yeah you're trying

889
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,480
- Trying to atrophy that brain.

890
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:15,960
- You're literally, you're emptying your brain.

891
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,720
That's what do you think is gonna happen?

892
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:18,560
- Yeah, dude.

893
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,280
What do you, I mean, yeah.

894
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:21,120
'Cause also like--

895
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:23,360
- I think if I think less, I'll be smarter.

896
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,200
- 'Cause also, like monks aren't sitting there like,

897
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,960
oh, I hope this meditation makes me better at running.

898
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:30,780
- Right.

899
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,760
- Or my job.

900
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,520
They're like, I'm trying to die.

901
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:36,200
- That's just what Buddhism is.

902
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,400
They sit around, they go, damn, it's so crazy

903
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,320
that a fish could be a bird.

904
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:42,320
- Yeah, and they're wrong.

905
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Shut up dude, I'm doing mathematics.

906
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,320
Yeah.

907
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,920
One plus one plus one plus one, four.

908
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,320
Dude, it's so stupid to fucking try to be smart.

909
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,320
Just chill.

910
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,320
Yeah.

911
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,320
You know?

912
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,640
Just fucking watch TV, drink some beer, eat some pretzels.

913
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,640
How hard is that?

914
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,040
That's like literally the happiest you can possibly be.

915
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,120
Here's my impression of someone who meditates who would try to do that.

916
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:07,360
I can't drink beer and pretzels at the same time because that's too many thoughts for

917
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,360
me.

918
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:09,360
Or even this.

919
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:10,360
What is beer?

920
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:12,880
Because they can't remember because they emptied their brain.

921
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,360
How does beer work?

922
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,360
Yeah.

923
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,480
Pat, he's completely frozen.

924
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:18,480
I didn't even notice.

925
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,480
Sorry, I was meditating.

926
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,480
Wow!

927
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,480
Oh my god.

928
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:22,480
Wow, dude.

929
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:26,040
You're like the most zen guy in the world.

930
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,040
Did you come to any conclusions?

931
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,760
You're like Gary Shandling.

932
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:29,760
I did.

933
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,040
I did come to a conclusion.

934
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,040
What'd you conclude?

935
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
You're gay.

936
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,040
Woo!

937
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:36,040
You're gay.

938
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,040
[Laughter]

939
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,040
Woo!

940
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:45,040
You ever think about how they make this, they can make, they have long sleeve and short sleeve shirts so they don't have that for pants?

941
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:46,040
Yep.

942
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:47,040
They do.

943
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,040
Not sleeves.

944
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,040
Yeah, pants don't have sleeves, they have legs, Caleb. Get with it.

945
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,040
Is that?

946
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,040
You guys ever consider...

947
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:59,040
Who named the key...

948
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,040
[Laughter]

949
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,040
Yep.

950
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,040
What kind of name is that?

951
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,720
probably some New Zealand guy Apple makes sense you guys ever think about there

952
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:10,680
was no you know there was no there's no difference between cats and dogs until

00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:16,360
society changed it that's true yeah the society put the society came up with the

954
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,360
names you know cats and dogs used to the names used to be switched there a social

955
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:26,160

00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,140
- Yeah.

960
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:40,980

00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,940
- What does that mean?

962
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:44,520
- You ever think about how a cat's ears

963
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:47,280
can hear the same as a human's?

964
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,980
Even though it's full of fur?

00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,700
- Yeah, the little floppas.

Dude, I wanna get one of the...

976
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,200
My goal in life is to move to Russia

and just own one of these

978
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,700
and just wait for it to kill me.

979
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,200
Why do you wanna go to Russia, dude?

980
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,200
'Cause it's where you can own this.

981
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,700
Yeah, they have cool shit in Russia.

982
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:19,700
Oh, dude, you can own so many fucking cool animals over there.

983
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,700
Alright, slave master.

984
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:23,700
I'm not a slave master.

985
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:25,200
You want a bunch of slaves.

986
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,200
I don't want slaves, I just want a caracal.

987
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,640
Yeah, you want to own it though slave guy. How is that a slave it won't do anything for me?

988
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,220

989
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,160

00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:44,240
Yeah, you ever realize like really I was slaves to the to the animals

991
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,760
No, humans are slaves to their phones. Oh

992
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,360
Serious

993
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,640
I'm busy right now. I'm looking at a picture of a caracal cat eating a drinking a bottle. I

994
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:04,220
Don't like that shit. I don't like when people like fucking feed a skunk milk out of a bottle

995
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:07,640
Yeah, just relax dude. Well. What if its mom died?

996
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,080
Yeah, I don't care and he needs to be fed. I will I I don't care

997
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:18,000
What if why don't you care a skunk if I was a skunk? I'd probably fucking

998
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,040
The thing about Caleb is he loves to pretend to hate animals

999
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,980
I don't hate animals, but I'm not gonna fucking speed a skunk out of a bottle

1000
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:30,300
I would do that and then it's you would you feed a fish a soda?

1001
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:35,100
I remember when I was first when I was first getting I was first getting to know Caleb

1002
00:53:35,100 --> 00:53:39,520
I showed him a picture of my dog, and he's like I don't care about anyone else's dog. I don't want to see this picture

1003
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,120
That's true

1004
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,120
Anybody else's dog is not my concern

1005
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:48,560
Yeah, and then fucking twice a week. You're like. Yo, you know my dog's name was crash bandicoot

1006
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,240
That's not true. Yeah, it is. I've heard that so many times. You've definitely

1007
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:59,440
talked about that. What other people like about that dog? I don't know anything about Patrick's pets, that's all I'll say.

1008
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,520
I know all of your pets names because you love them too much.

1009
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:10,120
Name all my pets. The one, Kiryum Abdul Jabbark? That's not mine. That's yours.

1010
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:13,280

1013
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,320
Never looked at an ocelot before really.

1015
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,320
Yeah those are cool.

1016
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,320
Is that an alien?

1017
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:32,560
You know what's an insane looking animal that I was- that me and Leo were talking about?

It looks like a xenomorph or a predator or something.

1025
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:46,760
Yeah that thing's terrifying.

1026
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,240
I think it should be in jail.

00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,240
Mm-hmm

1028
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:54,480
You're going to normal human jail for that mm-hmm

1029
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,720
Unleashing a bat in a prison

Disgusting food museum puts new spin on delicacies.

1052
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:58,160
Three new bat species identified by their penis bones.

1053
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:06,380
Damn that would feel I'd be so embarrassed if they discover me based on my penis bone

1054
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:14,480
Like I don't think we have bones in our penises, huh? No, I think only I think where they might be the only mammals that don't

Explain the lack of baculum and humans might be more than 2,000 years old the biblical rib that was taken from Adam may actually have been

1065
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,640
Really? I thought it was Chewbacca. It's confirmed.

1066
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:13,520
No Bigfoot is a rat. Nope Bigfoot is Kane and he's cursed to walk the earth after killing his brother.

1067
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:22,560
So he got and also he got really hairy at some point. He fell into a glue truck

1068
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,200
and then he fell into a hair truck and then he had to walk the earth for the

1069
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:31,760
rest of his days. Damn. Yeah. Pretty crazy. Those are the coolest

1070
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,040
Bigfoot truthers are the people who turn into like

1071
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,480
you know make a bible or like he's a ghost or something

1072
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:41,280
yeah instead of just like he's a big monster. They try to make everything the

1073
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,080
bible. There's five or six times they've

1074
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,760
found a like a mountain that has like a line

1075
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,400
on it and people will be like this is Noah's

1076
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:55,020
arc yeah yeah this is Noah's Ark and it got turned into a mountain to hide it

1077
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:59,620
from us the people who think that they're used to the the Nephilim and

1078
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:06,280
shit you know my absolute favorite like thing like that is is the well people

1079
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:12,260
think that Marines in Kandahar fought and killed like a giant yeah that's my

1080
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:17,380
that's my absolutely so good fuck that search just search giant Kandahar it'll

1081
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:24,500
probably come up. How do you spell Kandahar? K-A-N-D-A-H-R-A-D-H-A-H-A. I think it's

1082
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,700
norm supposed to be giant of Kandahar. Yeah here it is.

1083
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:30,220
Oh it's one of those things where I don't think that's how it's actually

1084
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:33,140
spelled but that's out of the type of people who think that a giant was there

1085
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:38,460
would spell it. Do you think it's just like a big guy? I mean I think it was an

1086
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:42,220
occurrence. I think classified by US government in his popular radio show

1087
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:47,860
coast to coast. Oh, okay. So it was on, yeah. He was 12 to 15 feet tall, had six fingers

1088
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:54,020
on each hand. Well, that's how you know it's inhuman. It has one more finger. Dude, the

1089
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:58,420
giant of Kandahar should have hooped. He was tall as hell. Yeah. It's so fucking sick, dude.

1090
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:03,980
I think it really happened. It has to have, right? Yeah. I don't doubt that it did. This

1091
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,540
is the guy who talks about it a lot. It's L.A. Marzulli, who's that guy that I'd sent

1092
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:12,820
the video before a bunch where he's like drinking a thing of water ball and he

1093
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:18,060
goes like Osama bin Laden he's the guy hold on let me get my slurp here and then

1094
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:27,780
he goes bin Laden he's the guy he rocks yeah I'll post that video with the

1095
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:30,340
episode because that's all right that's time to spin in the rest of the day

1096
01:00:30,340 --> 01:00:33,860
checking out this giant thing yeah you should watch some la mars always videos

1097
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:37,780
he's very knowledgeable on this type of thing.

1098
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,940
The Kandahar giant.

1099
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:44,380
He's got, he has some documentaries about Nephilim and stuff.

1100
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:47,900
I think I might be a descendant of a Kandahar.

1101
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,660
Here's a comment on the crypted, on the crypted uh, wiki.

1102
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:53,380
I thought it was a giant.

1103
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:54,380
No.

1104
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:57,660
Nephilim are the giants.

1105
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:02,500
There's a comment from DavinGaming903 on that wiki article about the giant of Kandahar.

1106
01:01:02,500 --> 01:01:06,740
"Imagine if this happened in World War II. You were a German soldier in the Russian

1107
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:11,060
cold fields. Suddenly your squad tank gets smashed down by a monster. Then your squad

1108
01:01:11,060 --> 01:01:14,020
fired bullets and anti-tank shells to that creature. It died."

1109
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:20,740
Real quick, I would like to point out, if it has nothing to do with what side you're

1110
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,900
on and you're just imagining if you were in World War II and you start, "Imagine you're

1111
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:28,660
a German soldier, okay?" That would be a bad sign.

1112
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:33,300
That guy's a born storyteller too. I mean you can really see that happening in your mind's eye,

1113
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:36,100
the way you described it. Painting a picture with words.

1114
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,420
He's a master. All right, time to research. Bye.

1115
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,140
Bye.
