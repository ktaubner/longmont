13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,720
Caleb Pitts is with us in the room.

14
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,720
Hey, what's up?

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,720
I'm Caleb Pitts.

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:32,720
I like to eat butts.

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,840
I smell like poop all the time, every day of my life.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
I'm glad you finally admitted it.

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:39,840
That's my name.

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
This is what Caleb says often.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,040
We have our beautiful friend Alex here with us.

22
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,040
My roommate.

23
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:52,120
Because Caleb got very sick from eating butts and he smelled his own poop smell too much.

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,640
Caleb smelled his finger and he like, you know when a cat smells like a pickle?

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
No, you're seeing those videos

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,760
For like a cat like a cat was smelling your pickle in a video. There's like a video if you ever see those videos I make

27
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,860
They're really good. You have my computer

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,600
there's like videos are like people giving their cats and their dogs like pickles and then like the hands will be like

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,000
Caleb did and it yeah, you know how I can in like

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,040
Colonial times or whatever they believed like that you would get sick if you're like your humors were in balance like there

31
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,720
you know, you had like black bile and yellow bile and like and blood and snot or whatever the last

32
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,080
one was. And well, Caleb had like a really bad imbalance of his poop humor. Like it was like

33
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:43,440
way out of whack. He's actually one of the only people that has a fifth humor that's like,

34
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,200
because he just has like poop in his body. It's disgusting. He's got poop in his blood.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,160
He would be probably like burnt at the stake. Yeah. In the back in the olden times.

36
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,240
I mean back then fire was precious. They probably wouldn't even waste it on him.

37
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,960
Yeah.

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,440
Yeah. That was back before fire was everywhere.

39
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,600
Used to.

40
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,160
It was so precious.

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,960
It was very rare.

42
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,760
I used to have to walk up to...

43
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,240
They used to use it as currency.

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,880
I used to have two...

45
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,720
We don't have any precious things anymore.

46
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,640
No, there's so much of everything.

47
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,120
It's fucked up.

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,440
Yeah.

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,560
I was going to say.

50
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,200
Yeah, shut up.

51
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,240
I mean yeah, it's like back in the middle ages, Bitcoin used to be, you'd find like one Bitcoin

52
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,960

53
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:37,600

54
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:44,080
at a saloon used to do. That's right. What's up? Yeah, what's up? Come on, come on. I'll give it

the the Griffin family would have been able to survive in the Middle Ages

66
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,320
definitely Stewie yeah yeah Stewie he's like resourceful and clever he would have

67
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,920

77
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,880
Yeah, Lois Griffin used to used to be deflated then now she's inflated. Yeah, and you can also

86
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:54,960
It's like back in the day bet like like kids nowadays. They'll they'll go to a library. They'll read a book

87
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,880
They'll get to the bottom of the page. They'll say why is the next one loading?

88
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,920
It's like, "Hey, you got to click next page on the book."

89
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:01,920
True.

90
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Yeah.

00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
We know stuff like that.

92
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,920
They don't.

93
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,360
It's almost like websites or books.

94
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,920
It's almost like books are like...

95
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
In the new era.

96
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:14,840
Yeah, it's almost like books became like what movies were for like back when we were kids,

97
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,560
but then like video games are kind of like more like websites now.

98
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
True.

99
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
Wow.

100
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
Yeah.

101
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
You guys are so smart.

102
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
I'm learning so much.

103
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,680
I'm glad we like we huffed all that paint before we started recording.

104
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,840
in my living room there's been a gas leak in here. There is a pretty much a gas leak that

105
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:37,360
has followed me to every room. Yeah, to your ass. Yeah, the past month. I feel like every

106
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,160
time I get in a room with either Patrick or Caleb, something happens to my brain.

107
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,120
Well, you said the air smelled weird in our apartment. It did. There was a difference in

108
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,440
the air. I think it's the scented candle. Yeah, I bought that candle a while ago.

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,920
Yeah. So you know it's good. It's gone bad.

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:58,560
I think it's stale. That candle expired. It tastes so weird when I try to eat it.

111
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Is that? God, that candle's expired as fuck right now. It is so crazy. It does look, it's

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:08,320
like black slime. Yeah. There's like a layer, it's like when you see like one of those videos,

113
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,520
it's like this is what happens to your lungs when you smoke a cigarette and there's like

114
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,640
a like black tar. That's what the candle looks like right now. Let's say you know it's working.

115
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:21,200
There's also this weird like bright flickering orange thing on top of the wax. It's dancing.

116
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,520
It's beautiful, I want to touch it.

117
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
It's hypnotic.

118
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Hypnotic, tectonic.

119
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,960
Yesterday when I was walking to Caleb's, I forgot to mention this to you guys, I saw

120
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:37,240
two guys in military uniforms walking down the street, but not like camo, like fatigues,

121
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:42,560
some kind of like, I don't know if it was like Navy or what, but they had like, they

122
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,000
were in some kind of uniform.

123
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,440
And they were walking down the street, they weren't talking or anything, and then one

124
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,440
One of them walked by a mannequin and he just reached out and grabbed its boob.

125
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,800
That was so funny.

126
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
That was the FBI.

127
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,120
That was the Federal Booby Inspectors.

128
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
Hell yeah.

129
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Hell yeah.

130
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
You saw them.

131
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Damn.

132
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,960
Dude, it's like seeing a G-Man or a man in black.

133
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,640
You saw the Federal Booby Inspector.

134
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Damn.

135
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,120
Dude, I should have taken a video.

136
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,120
Were they armed?

137
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
I don't know.

138
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
They were armed and dangerous.

139
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,680
Not that I could see.

140
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,320
He had an arm for two boobs.

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:25,760
That's right yeah I for two boobs they keep us safe yeah yeah I saw a big

142
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:32,200
pulsating imprint of a gun in his pocket.

143
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
His gun got way bigger.

144
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
He had a long straight gun.

145
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,680
It was scary and it smelled really bad.

146
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
It shot at me.

147
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,600
It got in my mouth.

148
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,080
It shot conditioner out.

149
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,600
It must have been some kind of conditioner gun.

150
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,200
Yeah, yeah, because he did also say you're going to taste my conditioner

151
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:59,000
gun. I thought that was really weird. Yeah, yeah, this is the Alberto V05 gun.

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,500
The what? The what? The Alberto V05. The what? It's like a shampoo that costs

153
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:14,200
like a dollar. Alberta, what is it? Alberto. Alberto. V05. V05. V05. Unless

154
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Those are two different.

155
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
Alberto V05.

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,200

157
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,200

Okay.

159
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
It comes in different colors.

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,800
Y'all never fucked with Alberto V05?

161
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:22,880
No, I have.

162
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,960
I just never knew that that was actually called that.

163
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Just looking at that is very...

164
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,560
There's one, I think it's the strawberry one right there.

165
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,640
Click on the strawberry.

166
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,640
That's like a classic.

167
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,640

176
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,680
It smells like toxically strawberry.

177
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,880
looks like it would smell nice but I'd rather it not be strawberries and just be cream

178
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:51,400

Who?

201
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,560
The toy like your sisters didn't have a strawberry shortcake. Uh, no. Oh, I know the the popsicle though

202
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,360

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
You didn't like that one?

204
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,960
No, if it's like a popsicle, I like a sour, like a Crybaby.

205
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
That one's good.

206
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
A Crybaby?

207
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,160
Or like a 2 Ball Screwball.

208
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,200
You ever get Spongebob though?

209
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,200

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,200
Ooo, Spongebob.

211
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,440
I was about to ask you the same thing.

212
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,440
What was the one, it was like the ice cream trucks that have the one and it's like in

213
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,280
a snow cone thing, but it's like tiny little like sour balls.

214
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
Oh, the lemon lime ones?

215
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Yeah.

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Those ones are so good.

217
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,720
I liked those a lot. Yeah, I liked those a lot. I like pizza. Yeah, pizza was pretty good from the ice cream truck.

218
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,360
There should be a pizza ice cream truck.

219
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,180
That sells ice cream and pizza from a truck.

220
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:47,960
And the song that it plays. Yeah, what's the song?

221
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:56,560
That song from the Portivolo.

222
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,560
the

223
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,760
it was that's all it is a good thing to do it

224
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,160
the

225
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
was like a solid the plate funeral

226
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,480
the

227
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,720
that's what it was taps

228
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
You always think there's like a military funeral going on?

229
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,440
It's just like, "Oh no, that's just the pizza and ice cream, man."

230
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,440
I mean, you know what?

231
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
He never stops.

232
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
Yeah.

233
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,560
You know, if like a, because everyone like knows the ice cream truck song now.

234
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
You know, it's everyone.

235
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,120
The Entertainer by Scott Joplin.

236
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Yeah.

237
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
And so I feel like-

238
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Like Janis Joplin?

239
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
I feel like now they have to like-

240
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
There's also The Sting.

241
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,320
There's got to be like some kind of ice cream truck like startup that needs to like disrupt

242
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,880
it and like draw more people.

243
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,820
here's my idea okay is a an ice cream truck it doesn't play any music but

244
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,880
every once in a while it plays like an insanely loud noise of just a car crash

245
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,960
then like even the parents everyone's running outside to see what's happening

246
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,280
and then they go they're so excited that nobody died that you know they'll buy

247
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,160
ice cream yeah but that's the thing that's the thing about the pizza and

248
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,120
ice cream truck have you ever been to a funeral and heard an ice cream truck no I

249
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,140
Have I wish I had that sounds so fun. That's like it would cheer me right up

250
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:25,640
No, cuz you're at the funeral and like out of nowhere you hear the ice cream truck you're like damn

251
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:31,160
I wish I could leave this boring. Yeah, right now true go get an ice cream. You know what I saw

252
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:34,260
I don't know if I'm gonna sleep like yeah, let me get in there with you

253
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:41,920
Kill me I don't even get to put a cigarette in his mouth. I'm so bored kill me. I want to die

254
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,480
They have a they have an ice cream truck in Boston

255
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,180
That's like it's run entirely by police, and I think it's called like to protect and serve ice cream or something

256
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,340
I forget it has some weird do cop run businesses are so fucking funny cuz it's like

257
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,140
like

258
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,140
It's just PR for cops

259
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:11,260
It's like in a paddy wagon - god damn dude

260
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,740
It's so like like how do we really?

261
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:20,300
Work, how do we rehabilitate the Boston cops image? Yeah, what's he cups?

262
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,620
Dude, so sick

263
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,980
There's a there's a skate shop in South Carolina called five. Oh

264
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,140
And it's like run by like a former cop

265
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,700
it's like

266
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:40,980
The same shit is like like a cop making an ice cream truck is just like trying to get like kids to trust cops

267
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:51,880
cops. Yeah, I scream press. What is that? Fucking say his shit that kid shirt says

269
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:05,080
and surf. Yeah, that is a 40 look. All those kids are getting guns. Yeah, time

270
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,280
they have gun shaped ice cream and then they keep giving the kids gun shaped ice

271
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,680
Well they probably like, you know what they probably do is they probably like have like

272
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,040
a trash can to throw away the like the popsicle sticks and they just like like pull all the

273
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
DNA off it.

274
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,640
They're planting DNA of like children.

275
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,840
Well that's isn't that what they don't they have like a truck that like the police have

276
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,560
like a truck where you can play like video games for free and then they just like pull

277
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,040
you I don't know if I don't know if it's true if they pull your fingerprints or not but like

278
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,240

293
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,520
it's so awesome dude we should start a

294
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,800

300
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,680
we should start like

301
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,660
like the bank robber ice cream

302
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,880

303
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,340
and then get this we get cops to staff it the cops pull up see a truck that says

304
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,120

305
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,080
bank robbers they arrest the cops who are running it uh... puts cops in jail

306

That's what Rage Against the Machine was saying.

309
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
That's what it's all about.

310
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160

total police cock blocker. I get in there. I start fucking them, but I like

338
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,680

339
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:15,920
I lock it up. I say no chance you sir are not serving your community. So I will

340
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,600

341
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,760

342
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:31,360
You've blasted your last slime, my friend. This is reform. Yep. Yeah, I'm

343
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,160
going to defund your balls, officer.

344
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:41,260
So yeah, I'm going to handcuff your balls to your wiener. See how you

345
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,860
like that.

346
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:49,460
Yeah, I'm a hero. Yeah, yeah, you're you're handcuffed like it's like

347
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:55,220
handcuffed around the balls in the wiener like a cock ring, but you're handcuffed to the handcuffs

348
00:18:55,220 --> 00:19:02,620
and it's like what's that is it 48 hours where they wear the handcuffs like a handcuff to

349
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
the cop.

350
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,620
What are you chewing on?

351
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,740
That's just something I found on the floor.

352
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:08,740
What is it?

353
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,740
It's like a leg piece.

354
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:12,340
It looks like part of a urinal.

355
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,340
Yeah.

356
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Do you want it?

357
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,340
I'm not eating that.

358
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,340
No, it's just in your mouth.

359
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
I did almost.

360
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,340
Come on.

361
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:20,860
I did almost do it for a split second.

362
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,860
Yeah, you did.

363
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,660
Best split second of my life.

364
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Yeah.

365
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
Ouch.

366
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:33,340
Whenever a cop pulls me over, right before they walk up to my window, I turn off the

367
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,340
porn that I was watching on my GPS screen so that they can't enjoy it.

368
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,980
Can you do that in a Tesla?

369
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,980
Isn't that like what the big-

370
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,980
Well, the police do that in their damn police cars.

371
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
They're riding around with a laptop.

372
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,540
How many cops do you think pull their shit while they're driving?

373
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
All of them.

374
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:52,440
constantly talking. Yeah, they you know their uniform has a yeah. They have a

375
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,240
special tugging machine that goes in the pants.

376
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,240
That's why they're so angry whenever they get out because you interrupted

377
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,340
them. Yeah, if you interrupted their tug, yeah, I have to arrest you. That's

378
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,840
why it's why they wear sunglasses a lot too because you'll see like their

379
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,740
eyes are like super bloodshot because they just been like drained of all

380
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,540
moisture.

381
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:15,640
They've just been like squirting out all the liquid in their body all day

382
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:20,080
Cops do like an IV drip of like semen.

383
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,080
Yeah they do, a lot of them have to.

384
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,560
Because it's like, I mean it's just so punishing to like just be like, just like coming and

385
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:29,240
blasting and squirting and dripping all the time.

386
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:32,760
I need 10 cc's of junk.

387
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,720
I mean that's why, that's why like, that's why it's tough for like when they get defunded

388
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,240
it's like you know.

389
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,880
It affects all of us.

390
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
They have to start stealing their magazines.

391
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,040
It's like, it's tough you know.

392
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:51,040
It's like millions of dollars of magazine budget of dirty mags.

393
00:20:51,040 --> 00:21:02,040
Yeah, so yeah, we have we've ascertained that the at our offices stumbled upon 40

394
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:09,040
40 40 copies of ass magazine. I don't know where I was going with that.

395
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,200
- I can't do the voice.

396
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,040
- You're crazy.

397
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,460
- Dude, oh, speaking of crime,

398
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:18,980
dude, me and Caleb did the best crime of all time.

399
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,280
- What'd you do?

400
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,240
- You were there.

401
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,400
No, you weren't there, you were there.

402
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,240
- Alex was there.

403
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,080
- Alex was there.

404
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:24,900
- Oh, yeah, I know.

405
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,840
- Yeah, we, if, yeah.

406
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,600
- You guys went to Six Flags, I didn't go.

407
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,000
- Yeah, I don't wanna talk about that.

408
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,520
(laughing)

409
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,740
But there was, on the way back from Six Flags,

410
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,180
there was a vending machine,

411
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,500
I don't want to reveal the location because I think we'll be going back and

412
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,580
using this trick several more times.

413
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,780
But we were trying to get water and it was all sold out of water,

414
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,340
but I was putting in dollar coins to try and like, like,

415
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,740
like get by the water and there was was sold out.

416
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:58,260
So I pressed the coin return and what comes out but $2 coins plus four quarters.

417
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,140
Yup. That's right. I found a real life infinite money hack.

418
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:04,140
And we did that for about 30 minutes.

419
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,580
You guys went, Caleb really went fucking crazy.

420
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,380
Caleb went nuts.

421
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,260
Caleb got like an old Susan B. Anthony dollar that was worth like $8.

422
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,900
I'd never seen that like look in Caleb's eyes before.

423
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,100
It was just like 10 minutes of him.

424
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
I feel like he was like so excited.

425
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,820
Yeah, dude.

426
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,540
Yeah, I would have too.

427
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,020
It was cool.

428
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,700
Yeah, it's like when you teach like a rat that it can like pull a lever to get a treat.

429
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,180
Yeah, yeah.

430
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:26,420
He just like...

431
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,060
Get cheese.

432
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:27,300
Yeah.

433
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,460
That's like a rat eating cheese was watching him.

434
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,340
Yeah.

435
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:30,980
Watching Caleb.

436
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Yeah, most of the time watching him just like watching a rat.

437
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,860
But that time it was more like watching a rat eating cheese.

438
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:42,900
Yeah, that's crazy, because he's like not he doesn't eat. She doesn't have cheese with

439
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,020
them. Yeah, that day specifically was like a rat with his cheese. Yeah, it's totally

440
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:52,700
like a rat like with eating his cheap bit of a bit of a doctor do a little type. You

441
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,180
talk to you talk to animals pretty much. Yeah, most days wait. We're talking to a dog right

442
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:04,380
now telepathically. Yeah, you should give me a beer. Whoa, really run along. Okay, I'll

443
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,380
I'll go get it.

444
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,380
Go go.

445
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,380
I'll get it.

446
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,380
What's the dog's name?

447
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:09,380
Uh, Fido.

448
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,380
Fido.

449
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,380
Ah.

450
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:14,500
That sounds like a very generic dog name.

451
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,500
But you're too, it's telepathic.

452
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Yeah.

453
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
It's not, you don't like, you don't bark or anything.

454
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,500
No, I don't need to.

455
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500

518
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,880
You see these little guys?

519
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,880
That was pretty much it.

520
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,880
They follow groups.

521
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,700
He was just giving a speech about like an app or something.

522
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,500
Like he was talking about like some website and then in the middle of it he just said

523
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
that.

524
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Pretty cool.

525
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,900
Oh wait, maybe it's the Geico Gecko.

526
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
Could be the Geico Gecko.

527
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:49,900
There's only one of the Geico Gecko.

528
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:54,900
Hello mate, I'm a Geico Gecko.

529
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,900

Dude, thank you.

531
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900

00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,900
Holy crap.

533
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,900

534
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900

laughing

540
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,900

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,900
that was beautiful

543
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,900
that was really good

544
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,900
could you do like flow from progressive now

545
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,900
hello mate

546
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,900
I'm the Geico Gecko

547
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,900
That's all I say for the rest of the podcast.

548
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,900
This is a protest.

549
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,900
I'm protesting your show while I'm on it.

550
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,900
I'm protesting the apartheid.

551
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,900
Yeah.

552
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,900
That's what the Geico Gecko caused.

553
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:45,900
The Geico Gecko caused apartheid in South Africa.

554
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,900
Yeah, he did do a bunch of fucked up stuff.

555
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,900
I don't like him.

556
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,900
The first time I got suspended from Twitter was because I told him to kill himself.

557
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:55,900
That's not funny.

558
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,540
Back then you could say whatever you wanted back then too.

559
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
That was an outlier.

560
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:09,980
Isn't it crazy that like, why the fuck is the Geico, like Geico's insurance, why the

561
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,580
fuck is it a gecko?

562
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,300
Well geckos are, they love...

563
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,100
The fastest animal on earth.

564
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:19,940
And the best thing about insurance is how fast it is.

565
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,860
Yeah, how fast you get your money.

566
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:27,420
The only commercials that make sense in my head is like Allstate.

567
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:32,380
But like why do they have insurance commercials in the first place?

568
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,180
Because insurance is so boring.

569
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,020
Yeah you need an exciting character.

570
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:42,900
You need someone like J.K. Simmons, Flo, the cavemen, people you can trust.

571
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
Yeah.

572
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,700
To give them their money.

573
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,660
Remember when Flo first dropped?

574
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,980
Oh yeah.

575
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,980
We all know who we were.

576
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,940
The streets were on fire. Oh man, you could not you could not it's like the OJ verdict. Yeah flow dropping

577
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,940
I think that happened on the same day actually

578
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,900
That's what people were crazy about. Yeah

579
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,780
That's the thing about oh, Jason's a people like crazy

580
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:13,440
I don't know how to feel about this fucking OJ verdict, but I mean have you seen flow? Yeah, goddamn dude

581
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,480
That's a keeper. They're gonna keep her around for like 10. It's been like 10 years since it's been a long time

582
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:26,400
Yeah, it's crazy. She's good. She has a good job. Yeah, she has a good job. You know what fuck you guys

583
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,040
She has a good job

584
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:33,760
She's probably so rich. She probably is like net worth. You know, that's her name

585
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:42,840
She played I think she played

586
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,440
Tom's wife

587
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,060
Yeah, what's her name Stephanie Courtney Stephanie? Sounds like I made it up

588
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:55,160
It's like oh yeah

589
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,860
Brittany Ashley, that's her from the from the Geico Gecko. That's the woman. That's the

590
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:08,040
Geico Gecko, that's the woman who does the Gecko? Yeah model. She's like the does the mocap. Yeah mocap for the Gecko

591
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,040
Yeah, cuz she has a tail so

592
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,580
Only woman with a tail only women with a tail can mocap for the Gecko true

593
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,040
The only woman can mocap for the gecko too because of his contract demands.

594
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,600
He has a slender body.

595
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,600
And his slender body.

596
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,360
His beautiful slender body.

597
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,360
He's slim thick.

598
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,360
He is.

599
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,360
He is slim thick.

600
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,160
I'd love to see the Geico Gecko with a BBL.

601
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,160

602
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,160

Suddenly I gotta put this pillow on my lap.

606
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,160
Suddenly I can't stand up.

607
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,320
The Geico Gecko with a big ass.

608
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,320
You should draw that.

609
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,320
You draw that picture.

622
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,940

Want it for free

626

Yeah, all right

627
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:25,960
My Stratocaster that's kind of broken but the SG was a an impulse purchase that I can't justify

628
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,960
justify my anyone if any other listeners are wanting to buy something.

629
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,760
I have my Rodney copper bottom that I am willing to sell.

630
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,660
I have my madam gasket.

631
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,460
I'm also willing to sell.

632
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:41,260
I will not be selling my big well.

633
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,660
Okay, so you can just come to our apartment and buy some stuff.

634
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,560
Yeah, I am serious about the guitar though.

635
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,060
I can't justify owning it.

636
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,360
Yeah.

637
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,460
Anyway, here's the list.

638
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,560
I'm also selling some shirts that I own.

639
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
What is this?

640
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:58,600
You can just post about this on Twitter.

641
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,400
I'm selling a t-shirt that I own.

642
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,080
I'm not selling anything.

643
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,960
I like everything I own.

644
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,680
Nothing will be sold by me.

645
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Some people have all the answers.

646
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,320
Maybe I've got to get into Depop as a side hustle.

647
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,160
You do really well on Depop, I think.

648
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,400
Yeah, I've got some shit.

649
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,000

like green velour and I put it on and I was like man I look so fat in this.

651
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:35,640
All you have to do is order like a Jurassic Park t-shirt from Amazon and then just list

652
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:40,120
it as like retro logo tee and you can sell it for $80.

653
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,120
Are you serious?

654
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,120
I'm completely serious.

00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,120
Oh who's this?

00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,320
a little pretty much yeah uh the description of this list is at least be

685
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:08,680
kind to some dentists they too have feelings

686
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:11,840
all day and that's a good point that's a good point right there

687
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,320
well i get it feeling like a lot of the other students are you going to

688
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,080

well just to themed you were not for so long to get it's not finish it i got

690
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,040
about one line

691
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:29,520

692
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,920

694
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,600
there yet to get on the uh... number one

695
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:45,480
bite down suddenly the moment his finger is furthest down your mouth.

696
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,520
It's funny to me how your dentist is sticking his finger like so far down your mouth.

697
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,800
That's just like trying, that's how to help you if your dentist is like trying to do something

698
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
to you.

699
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:58,800
When the dentist puts the finger in the mouth, it's like man, don't you, can't you make a

700
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,800
tool to do this?

701
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Yeah, use a tool.

702
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Like I'd rather they use like a...

703
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,160
My dentist doesn't really put his hand in my mouth.

704
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,160
Mine does.

705
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,160
Really?

706
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
They just use their tools.

707
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,160
I mean if they're gonna put their finger in my mouth, I'd rather they make like a

708
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,280
Like a silicone finger that they put in my mouth. Yeah, yeah

709
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:17,920
I just their actual they should you know, like when you get a magic kit and yeah

710
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,980
Like a fake finger job that you can have to wear one of those

711
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,920
Yeah, so I can buy you like maybe like like a latex like

712
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:29,200
Fake finger for all five fingers and it's blue. Well, no it

713
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,200
It should be like that like to be a dentist

714
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,760
You should have to like chop off one of your fingers as like the dentist oath or whatever

715
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,840
Yeah, and then you put on like a fake finger every day that the patient is allowed to try like bite off sure if they want

716
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,480
To sure cuz like me how fucked up are your guys teeth? I do that really good

717
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,240
Yeah, mine are like not great. But I mean you all know my teeth stories. You don't know what's going on

718
00:37:53,240 --> 00:38:02,040
You just ask cuz you wanted to tell your teeth stories again and you guys all know y'all know my teeth stories are wild as fuck

719
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:07,420
Dude yeah Pat at parties telling his teeth stories like the whole room. Yeah

720
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:15,840
There was like two nights ago. I we were at that like that show and somebody was talking to me about like

721
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:23,600
Dental insurance or something and I did like just like, you know, you know how I like Trent like trail off until like ADHD stories

722
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,840
I like go nowhere. I just like told them about like my cracked tooth

723
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:36,440
I was like, I realized like after like I stopped saying it, I was like, yeah, that was like,

724
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,520

725
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,840
somebody like I met is a long story. Kind of dude. I was just like punishing somebody

726
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,280
about my tooth. It sucks. It sucks that I do that. I hate it so much. But if you get

727
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,120
a text and it's like, Hey, can we hang out and talk more about your tooth? Hey, you're

728
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
You're the tooth guy, right?

729
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,120
Yeah.

730
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,120
Whoa.

731
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,120
You're the weird teeth guy.

732
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,520
I wanted to hear the end of the story.

733
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,660
Like what happened?

734
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,200
This guy came into my job the other day and he was like, "Man, I really want to buy a

735
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,400
soda but I really hurt my tooth.

736
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
I got a hole in it.

737
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,400
Look.

738
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
Ah."

739
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,320
And he's like, "You can see it in the back.

740
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
Ah."

741
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
That, dude, yeah.

742
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Whoa.

743
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
For like a year.

744
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,520
For like a year, I like, while we were, I think like a day we were recording like the

745
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:31,560
first couple episodes I cracked my tooth eating candy. I cracked my back molar eating candy

746
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,240
and I didn't get it like fixed until like. I cracked that tooth and I cracked the bottom

747
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:45,240
tooth I'm doing it again. I'm doing the same fucking story. Here's a top comment. I did

748
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,440
this they got upset because it hurt her finger. It's a good point. But it says his finger.

749
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,800
this one says her finger. Well I think you could only do this if you have a boy dentist.

750
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:01,240
I've always wanted to do this, says cat lover 2004. I did that once before, she screamed

751
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,160
super loud. I never went to that dentist ever again. It's crazy that you can just change

752
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,800
your dentist up. Yeah. Damn. I do, I'm no loyalty to your dentist, fuck you. That's

753
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,800
right, I hate going to my dentist. Folks, do you hate going to the dentist? Yes. Well

754
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,800

755
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:33,120
Marin20. Marin20. Marin20. I don't know why I'm giving him this voice. I'm Mark

756
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:43,840
Marin and I hate going to the dentist. Yeah. Fuck. I just was trying to put this on your head.

757
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,480
Oh my god. You want to play my little games? Fine.

758
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:54,080
Number two. Oh you guys are making fun of me all the time.

759
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:08,320
Number two. Paint the words dentistry is for tit heads on your teeth before your appointment. That's

760
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,440
actually pretty clever. That sounds like it's a more harder for you because you have paint on

761
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:23,340
on your teeth. Yeah. So, let's say the dentist has to clean it off. I hate this

762
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,540
fucking list. Yeah. God damn it. Well, that's what happens. This doesn't fit.

763
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,740
This wouldn't fit on your teeth. So, you start writing it and then you end up

764
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,740
just painting the words dentistry on your teeth. And they go in and they're

765
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,840
like, you know, you don't have to do that. Is that 26? Yeah, they'll do it like that.

766
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,940
They'd be like, oh. Is that 26 letters? Let's count together. One, two, three,

767
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:47,940
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

768
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,940
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five.

769
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,940
You do count, I mean you need a space.

770
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,940
Yeah, but your teeth have spaces, at least mine do.

771
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:03,940
My teeth really have, this guy right here.

772
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,940
Look at this, I have a tooth right here, it's rather sharp.

773
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,940
It's called my canine tooth.

774
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,280
That guy at work was just me.

775
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
I just had a...

776
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,280
Yeah, you were in the mirror.

777
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,380
Did you guys know I had two sharp teeth in my top teeth?

778
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,940
Because my past life I was a dog named Werewolf.

779
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:18,940
Really?

780
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,940
Yeah.

781
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,940
That was you?

782
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:21,940
I used to have a dog named Werewolf.

783
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,940
Oh!

784
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:23,940
Boy?

785
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:24,940
That's it.

786
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
Maybe it would be a baby.

787
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,940
A baby?

788
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
Yeah.

789
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,940
Just like old times.

790
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:37,940
Yeah, I was this mistreated dog in my past life.

791
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:43,060
my owner used to like do all these crazy things to me shut up shut up you liked

792
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:49,100
it the top comment is was going to vote this for the first one but this was

00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,260
going to vote the first one but this genius one will do nicely haha true does

so he will love that, but it's true. I mean that I mean well that thing is

800
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,940
He will love that that's Glenn Martin DDS. Yeah

801
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:34,180
Well dentistry is for tit heads. It's like a tit head is like a fan of tits, right?

802
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:40,600
There's like tit heads and ass heads or is it a head? That's a big tit. Yeah, I mean either way either way

803
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,600
I'm sure on that thing's face

804
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,540
Sucking on your dentist face, huh?

805
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,460
So you can get a mouth profile

806
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:57,660
He puts his mouth on my mouth. Yeah, he sucks it in and then it's like Kirby

807
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,660
He knows like when I go to the dentist

808
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:03,280
They put the lead blanket on me the whole time because my boners like so

809
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,940
Try to weigh it down

810
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,980
You're just like I'm sorry

811
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:18,200
They like leave the room for a second they come back and I'm lying like like belly down like

812
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:28,760
pumping the air. You're completely naked. Oh, I didn't know you were coming back.

813
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:39,480
Yeah, where did the water jet go? Where is that? There's like a huge puddle

814
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:47,240
like pouring. Get out! I rented this space today. I'm trying to take dick pics

815
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,240
with the x-ray.

816
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,200
They're like, "All right, we need to take a picture of your teeth," and they leave the

817
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,400
room to take the x-ray.

818
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,040
I take my pants off and stand up.

819
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:04,440
I'm so glad I've never had a tailbone injury or something like that where they have to

820
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,440
take an x-ray where my dick is visible.

821
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,440
Where they have to put that thing in your butt in order to heal you.

822
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:14,160
I don't want my doctor knowing how small my thing is.

823
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
No way.

824
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,160
Oh my God.

825
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Could you imagine?

826
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,560
and they're like, oh yeah, they're trying to they're trying to rub it off.

827
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:22,920
They're roasting like there's like a like there's a smudge on it, but now

828
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,720
it's just my thing. Yeah, they'd be like, can you try and make your thing

829
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,560
bigger before we take the x ray? Just like it's so that you don't get

830
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,280
embarrassed. Yeah, that nurse kind of likes you.

831
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,160
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with your tailbone like

832
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,440
Doug. Yeah, I don't know. Like put this on and go talk to her. And it's like that

833
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,160
like robe with like the butt exposed.

834
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:52,560
Yo, she wants to see your butt so bad through the robe.

835
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,840
It's like a 95 year old man.

836
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:59,640
Yeah. I'm not even your doctor. I'm just like helping you out, dude. I'm just

837
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,960
trying to wingman you here.

838
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
Yo, Pops.

839
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,840
That's what they call me in this doctor's office. They call me Pops. They only keep

840
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,160
me here for vibes.

841
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,160
True.

842
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,520
I'm kind of like bez and the happy mondays. I'm just here to dance. I treat

843
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,400
I treat the dentist office like a barber shop crazy. I go in there. I'm like

844
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,120
y'all seen this. Yeah, it's a little seen this shit. Yeah. What do y'all

845
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:28,840
yeah, arms broken number three fill him up with all the anesthetic. I got a

846
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:33,280
munch as since I keep breaking my own arms. I could talk to the doctor fill

847
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,960
him up with all the anesthetic until he feels nothing at all. Then amputate his

848
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,960
arm when he's looking away.

849
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,320
Martin Clitz says, "I think this won't just annoy him."

850
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Good point, Martin.

851
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Yeah.

852
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,560
That's a very good point.

853
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
It's a bad idea.

854
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:47,920
Don't do that to your dentist.

855
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:48,920
You'll get arrested.

856
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:49,920
That's just a crime.

857
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
Yup.

858
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,240
Most of these are crimes.

859
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,760
And crimes aren't annoying.

860
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,000
They're cool.

861
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,320
Crime is the coolest thing you can do.

862
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
I respect criminals.

863
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:58,320
Unless it's to me.

864
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,320
Unless you mug me or steal my shit.

865
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:00,320
Never do a crime to me.

866
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
Then it's lame.

867
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,320
Then it's embarrassing for you.

868
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,280
I straight up I don't like when crime happens to me.

869
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:08,280
Facts.

870
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Yup.

871
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
Deadass.

872
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,880
For my family or my chosen family.

873
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:13,880
Or anybody.

874
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,880
Homies is family too.

875
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:15,880
Homies is my like chosen family.

876
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:16,880
I'll drink to that.

877
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,400
Is that the ICP song?

878
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:22,120
My homies blood is like thicker than my family's blood.

879
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,680
It's like a saying.

880
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,680
Yup.

881
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,680
What's the lyrics to that ICP song?

882
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,680
Homies.

883
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:29,480
I know the chorus is like, Homies, homies.

884
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,480
Yeah.

885
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,480
Yeah.

886
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,480
I heard that in fourth grade.

887
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,480
That song is all about homies.

888
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,240
Did I ever tell you about the ADHD forums I was on in fourth grade?

889
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,240
No.

890
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,240
It's called sparktop.org.

891
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,080
I told you about it for sure.

892
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,240
It was on sparktop.org.

893
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:50,560
I found out about, I looked up if other kids on there were talking about CKY and there

894
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:55,240
were, there were a lot of kids talking about CKY on there.

895
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,880
And they got, one of them got me into ICP.

896
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:03,160
They told me to look up "Piggy Pie."

897
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,720
And then through that, I found "Homies,"

898
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,400
and I thought that was a beautiful song.

899
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:08,400
- Yeah.

900
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,520
I don't care about the "Homies" song.

901
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,360
- Yeah?

902
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,960
- Yeah, I don't like that one very much.

903
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,920
- It's not a good one.

904
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,920
It's not their best.

905
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,160
- It's not a good one, no.

906
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:18,720
- 'Cause it's not about anything scary or clown-related.

907
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:19,560
- No, the good ones are, yeah,

908
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,640
are all the-- - Yeah.

909
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,280
- The good ones are-- - The good ICP songs

910
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:23,840
are all about either killing people,

911
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,480
being a clown, or being a Christian.

912
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,000
- Yeah. - Yeah.

913
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,920

914
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:39,280

916
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,600

918
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:56,600
Why are we singing this?

919
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,920
Shouldn't it be happy birthday?

920
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:58,920
It's his birthday.

921
00:48:58,920 --> 00:48:59,920
You guys are so stupid.

922
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:04,520
His birthday was last week.

923
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,640
Number four, throw up violently the moment he starts examining you.

924
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,560
Can the dentist sue you for this?

925
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:14,120
There's one comment that just says, "Oh God!"

926
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,360
If I saw someone do that, I'd say that.

927
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:18,360
Oh God.

928
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:19,360
Oh God.

929
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:26,480
I'd say oh brother. That's what I'd say. I'd say oh mommy. Yeah. Like you're like insanely horny.

930
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:35,280
Mommy! Mama! We can just cut that part out. What movie is that there's like one specific...

931
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,040
There's an Austin Powers. That's what it was. That's why I was thinking about it. He's like

932
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:45,520
mommy. Yeah then he's like falls into lava. Thinking about his mom. Oh man. That Austin.

933
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,360
I mean that piece of work those that crowd that he hangs with yeah Austin their sketch uh-huh

934
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:59,120
man gold gold member loves gold but he did I mean he loves his faja too I think he loves it or he

935
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:05,120
hated his faja I can't I know Dr. Evil hated his faja I know Beyonce Knowles is in that movie oh

936
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:12,400
remember when he kisses Nathan Lane that's a funny scene oh yeah Nathan Lane Nathan Lane is doing

937
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,720
Beyonce's voice. Oh yeah yeah yeah. That's a perfect movie. All three of them. Yeah. One

938
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,280
mega movie. I'm a huge AP fan. AP and Dune are my favorite movies right now. Hey I still

939
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,000
haven't seen it so you better not drop any spoilers. It's so good. This would be horrible

940
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,400
but you probably wouldn't get sued since throwing up isn't your fault even if you did it on

941
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,160
purpose how would they know. True. I can't throw up on purpose. Me neither. I stick my

942
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:41,960
finger down my throat everywhere. I'm sorry. I'm really sick. I ate some time.

943
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:46,040
I have to go home. Can you take me to the nurse? Yeah, I don't want to. I don't want

944
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:50,280
to get a dentist appointment today. So can you just send me home? I'm so sick. I can't

945
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:54,920
when you guys go to the dentist. You just kind of smell like latex for the rest of the day.

946
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,240
A little bit. I feel like that's whenever I go to the dentist. I think I talked about it before,

947
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:05,560
but there's like a like a latex mask thing that they would put on like they had like scented

948
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:09,640
latex masks that they would put on at this one dentist office I went to for

949
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,040
like the laughing gas. And my little brother did that. He's like

950
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,240
insanely allergic to latex and like that's how they found out was like they

951
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,560
put one of those on. He was like I want the grape scented one and then like they put it on

952
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:26,200
and he like couldn't breathe. And he died. Rip. Yeah my little brother is dead.

953
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:30,200
do we know happy halloween

954
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:36,840
number five pin him down with his tools and start pulling his teeth out without

955
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,680
anesthetic. I would so do this to my former childhood dentist. He did that to

956
00:51:42,680 --> 00:51:47,480
me, so i would love to do it to him as well, so he could see how that feels. Who

957
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,600
made this? Did jigsaw make this list? No, it was positron wild talk. Oh yeah, you

958
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,640
you know hello dr. harry i'ma for years you pulled out my teeth for years you

959
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:03,760
told me to floss but now you will have to floss or else you'll die that's the

960
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,860
thing about dentists they don't do any of the shit they tell you to do no way

961
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:11,240
huge hypocrites yeah you smell the dentist's breath disgusting it's

962
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,640
horrible yeah they just eat candy all day - yeah it's like they since their

963
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,260
dentists like they don't have to get yelled at by any dentist so they know

964
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,560
they can do whatever they want up they get candy all of themselves because no

965
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,400
- No one else is eating it.

966
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,100
- Exactly, all to themselves.

967
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,420
So, you know, if you see a dentist

968
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:26,640
come to your house on Halloween,

969
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,360
don't give him any candy, they've had enough already.

970
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,340
- I went to a dentist a year ago,

971
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,700
saw a Reese's cup in his pocket.

972
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,540
- What?

973
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:35,380
- Back pocket.

974
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,220
- What a hypocrite.

975
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:37,040
- And it melted.

976
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:39,220
- I think he might have pooped his pants.

977
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:40,240
- Nah, dude.

978
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,300
- And it smelled weird.

979
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:44,600
- 'Cause it did smell like peanut butter, but also shit.

980
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,060
- You know what I had the other day?

981
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:47,420
- I think he made a Reese's at home.

982
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:48,820
- I think he had a feces cup.

983
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,300
(laughing)

984
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,500
bit into a Reese's cup and it was one of the Reese's cups with the Reese's pieces inside.

985
00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:00,020
Whoa. It was really delicious. They got one now that's two Reese's with a pretzel in it.

986
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:05,020
Really? Yeah. I saw that somewhere. I don't believe you. I saw it at the store. Which

987
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,460
store? Now do you believe me? Which store? Candy store. I love the candy store. You buy

988
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:15,900
yourself five minutes. I will be back with questions. Number six, ask for a toffee filling.

989
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,900
Actually, that's like if you could get fillings made out of food. Yeah. That'd be great. You

990
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,180
you could just taste it all the time.

991
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,860
- I would get a Cool Ranch filling.

992
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,700
- Yeah.

993
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:25,520
- Yeah.

994
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,660
- What's the food that you'd want to taste like 24/7?

995
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:28,700
- Not Cool Ranch, actually.

996
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,860
It would probably be Brussels sprouts or steak,

997
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,420
or steak and Brussels sprouts.

998
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:34,660
(laughing)

999
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,420
- Yeah, probably.

1000
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,260
- I might.

1001
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:38,820
- Or with mashed potatoes on the side.

1002
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,340
- I mean, if we're going practical,

1003
00:53:41,340 --> 00:53:44,580
maybe like mint, like just have mint in your mouth all the

1004
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,420
time.

1005
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,900
- 'Cause then other people could taste it if you kiss them.

1006
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,380
- Exactly, or if you like tried to,

1007
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,620
if you were like, open your mouth really wide

1008
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:52,260
and like licked all over their face.

1009
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,380
- You know what would suck though?

1010
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:55,300
If you're like, you're a big fan of Big Red

1011
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,240
and then you're like, oh yeah, I want the Big Red filling

1012
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,100
and then you like, later just like, man.

1013
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:00,980
- Why did I choose that?

1014
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,820
- Why did I choose that?

1015
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,680
- Yeah, or like if you chose like the poop

1016
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,340
or like the sewage filling and it's like,

1017
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,540
well, like this was fun for like an hour,

1018
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,580
but now it's the rest of my life.

1019
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,340
- That's the, here's the thing about that.

1020
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,180
Can you shut the flavor off?

1021
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,180
- No, it's a film.

1022
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:16,540
- Yeah, I mean, you could take it out.

1023
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,380
- So, I think--

1024
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:25,140
I think maybe it'd have to be something that can go with every food.

1025
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:30,980
Yeah, because if it's like the water filling, the water filling would be pretty good.

1026
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,100
That would be perfect.

1027
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:32,820
Yeah.

1028
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:33,380
Yeah.

1029
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:36,740
Maybe like a cheese whiz, sparkling water filling.

1030
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,860
Yeah.

1031
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,700
I get pop rocks filling.

1032
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:42,900
I get the YouTube filling.

1033
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:50,020
I'd have Charlie the Unicorn in my mouth all the time.

1034
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,220
I get the Charlie Brown feeling.

1035
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,300
I get to open my mouth and hear it go, say, "Leo Plerodon."

1036
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,300
When does the Charlie Brown show come on?

1037
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,580
Charlie Brown Pumpkin.

1038
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:00,580
Usually around Halloween or Christmas.

1039
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,620
It's soon though, right?

1040
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,420
Isn't tomorrow Halloween?

1041
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,420
Valentine's Day, Arbor Day, my birthday.

1042
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,340
Now I know where that fucking plastic thing came from.

1043
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,540
It's from the goggles you're wearing.

1044
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,020
Oh yeah?

1045
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:08,580
It fell off.

1046
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:12,580
Alex has been putting on and taking off goggles this entire time.

1047
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,220
I don't know why.

1048
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:15,620
It's because I'm smart.

1049
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:20,620
- You're looking at this like it's a science experiment for you.

1050
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,460
- Yeah, everything is an experiment for me.

1051
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,860
- The only guest who fidgets more than Patrick.

1052
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,100
(laughing)

1053
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:26,940
- I got a lot going on.

1054
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:28,360
- He's like chewing on your goggles.

1055
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:30,540
(laughing)

1056
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,380
- I'm hungry.

1057
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,300
- I've honestly, since he's been here,

1058
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,500
I've not fidgeted that much.

1059
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,540
- He's doing it all for you.

1060
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,380
- Yeah, I know.

1061
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:40,740
(laughing)

1062
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:41,580
- He's dancing.

1063
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:42,420
- Help me!

1064
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,220
(laughing)

1065
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,820
Number seven, hide a tiny paintball gun in your gums,

1066
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,820
which you can operate with your tongue.

1067
00:55:49,820 --> 00:55:51,100
(laughing)

1068
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:51,940
Just make sure you--

1069
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:53,820
- What kind of fantasy world do you live in, Positron?

1070
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,540
- Well, listen to this, just make sure you practice

1071
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,660
and perfect this skill before the big day.

1072
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,780
Yeah, I mean, obviously you couldn't do it with no practice.

1073
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,380
- Yeah, you'd have to practice so hard.

1074
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:04,900
- Yeah, number eight is speak as if you're already

1075
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,540
on anesthetic when you walk in, and the only comment is,

1076
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:10,180
would love to be a fly on the wall if anyone did this.

1077
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:12,180
- That is actually a perfect comedy sketch

1078
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,020
when you think about it.

1079
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:13,860
- Yeah, it is.

1080
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:17,140
I could see that on SNL or Ellen's show.

1081
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:23,300
Also, this is kind of similar, but you know people are always like, if you could have dinner

1082
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,500
with anyone living or dead, who would it be?

1083
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,060
I would probably choose my dentist because he could tell me which food I should eat and

1084
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:30,060
which I shouldn't.

1085
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,060
At dinner.

1086
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,060
Yeah, at dinner.

1087
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:37,700
If I could have dinner with someone living or dead, I would prefer to choose living because

1088
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:39,500
I think it would smell pretty bad.

1089
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,460
yeah. I want to come to the food, though dead. I do not like live animals.

1090
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,460
They're loud

1091
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:55,400
okay,

1092
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:56,900
number

1093
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:02,140
nine. Keep a live snake in your mouth and wait for him to discover it by

1094
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:07,300
surprise. Whatever number ten is really good. It is really good. Eat his tools.

1095
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:13,620
That is clever. Yeah. He wouldn't expect that. He would be fucked. That's like a lot of money.

1096
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,340
Yeah, I try to swallow the like water thing, but like you know it has like the whole, the

1097
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:22,180
like the pipe that goes like it's like a, it's like a tube. Oh yeah. I love it when

1098
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:24,540
they do that. I try to swallow it. That feels so good when they do that. I swallow the entire

1099
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:31,460
chair eventually. Oh yeah? Yeah. That probably set, could cost him, send back a few hundo.

1100
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:33,720
(laughing)

1101
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:34,680
- He's probably--

1102
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,740
- Didn't we look up--

1103
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,980
- Apple Creek without a paddle.

1104
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:39,340
(laughing)

1105
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:40,720
- Didn't we look that up one time,

1106
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,360
like how much dentist tools cost?

1107
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:44,600
Or we looked up medical tool,

1108
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,140
'cause we found that Amazon thing where it was like--

1109
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:49,160
- You can buy medical tools on Amazon

1110
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:50,360
for like thousands of dollars.

1111
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,200
- Yeah.

1112
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,320
- Yeah. - But what?

1113
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,780
- We should get, for the apartment,

1114
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:55,480
we should get like an ultrasound machine.

1115
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:56,320
- Yeah.

1116
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,160
- A dentist chair. - We have so many tummy aches

1117
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,000
and we don't know why.

1118
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,340
- Okay, we get an ultrasound machine, right?

1119
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:04,060
we have friends over we were like okay eat this coin we're gonna see if we can

1120
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:13,460
see the coin yeah yeah bad news you're pregnant with four babies we find out

1121
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:17,980
one of our roommates is pregnant yeah I'm not looking forward to that day yeah

1122
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:23,380
I'm not pregnant all right let's see number 11 chug a two liter of coke in

1123
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:27,340
front of him before your appointment yeah you know what I did I went to

1124
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,140
I went to, because I had that weird like lymph node thing,

1125
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,940
I went to the, like I went to urgent care

1126
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,780
to get it checked out.

1127
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:36,420
And I did get prescribed candy.

1128
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,000
- Ooh. - That's so sick, dude.

1129
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,080
- The dentist, or the dentist, the doctor said

1130
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,900
that like I take antibiotics,

1131
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:46,340
but also I should eat a lot of sour things,

1132
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,100
like Warheads and Sour Patch Kids.

1133
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,580
- Damn, dude, that's the dream.

1134
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,220
- I was like, whoa. - That's insane.

1135
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,380
- That's so sick. - Wow.

1136
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:53,580
- Oh man, I yesterday had--

1137
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:54,420
- That's what I get for going to Dr. Wonka.

1138
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,660
- It'd be funny if like, if you,

1139
00:58:55,660 --> 00:59:02,580
You got prescribed that and then you like, you go, you like, you get like a $10,000 bill

1140
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,900
because the candy isn't covered by your insurance.

1141
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,420
You were not supposed to eat that.

1142
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,420
Yeah.

1143
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:11,540
Yesterday at that mic I saw like a, there's a plate of candy at this open mic and it was,

1144
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:16,700
I thought it was like a gobstopper, like something to suck on, but it was a gumball.

1145
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:17,700
I felt violated.

1146
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:20,700
You just suck on a gumball for like an hour.

1147
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,140
Wait, you could have grabbed the candy?

1148
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,140
Yeah, you didn't see that?

1149
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,140
They had a big tray.

1150
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:28,300
asked the guy to throw me a piece of candy. He said no? No, he said no. I'm sorry man.

1151
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:35,740
Damn. Then they spelled my name wrong. Did you see? I did. Yeah, I went, I'm doing stand up again.

1152
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:40,140
I went to a mic. My handwriting is so bad that they wrote Patrick Domav.

1153
00:59:40,140 --> 00:59:49,020
It was like projected on the screen behind him when he was going. Patrick Domav. Patrick Domav.

1154
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:52,140
yeah, I don't know like the Irish rush. Yeah,

1155
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:58,060
the Irish, the Irish Russian could be all my jokes are done and yeah,

1156
00:59:58,060 --> 01:00:06,380
yak off smirnoff thing, but yeah, the Irish in in troubles, Ireland car bomb you yeah,

1157
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:12,220
hey, sorry to all the I'm sorry to all my my people yeah for that joke yeah, it's you're

1158
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:16,460
you're the Irish Russian comedian. You just get on stage and immediately pass out from alcohol

1159
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:21,460
all poisoning because I'm drinking whiskey and vodka.

1160
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:22,460
Yeah.

1161
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,460
All right.

1162
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,980
What's the last one on the last one on the list?

1163
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:27,140
Number twelve say you've never flossed in your life.

1164
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:31,020
There's one comment on it that just says oh God.

1165
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,020
Yeah.

1166
01:00:32,020 --> 01:00:36,340
Just imagining the dentist reaction and just like would flip out.

1167
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,140
Yeah I might actually do that the next.

1168
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,780
That's the only one on this one that you on this list that you can do.

1169
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,780
Just telling your dentist like yeah I'm never going to floss again.

1170
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:45,140
I never floss nothing you can say will make me floss.

1171
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,140
I hate you.

1172
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,140
All right.

01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:06,100
There could be more.

1189
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,820
There could be other people in them.

01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:08,820
