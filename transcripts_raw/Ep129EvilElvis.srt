[LOUD EXPLOSION]

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,440
Fuck, dude.

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,320
Here we go.

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,880
I have a joy hangover from Christmas.

9
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,960
Yeah, let's do a clap to line it up.

10
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,800
OK, now you can line up my audio to Patrick's clap.

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,200
Can we-- what if we do--

12
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,760
What if we--

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,440
OK, and then about 10 minutes, Caleb, you should do a clap.

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,000
And then you can sync up your clap to our claps.

15
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,280
- Yeah. - Okay.

16
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,340
- What if we did a snap?

17
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,920
- Okay, that sounds more fun.

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,760
- Okay, we did a snap.

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,440
All right, so they all happened at the same time.

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,000
- I think this might be the most synced episode

21
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
we've ever done already.

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,840
- Well, oh my God, I can't even believe

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,920
how synced up it'll be.

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,840
- I'm so excited.

25
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,880
Did you guys have a nice sweet Christmas

26
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,200
with lots of gifts? - I did, I did.

27
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,720
I didn't get any, I just got 200 bucks.

28
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,840
My mom's just, she's at the point now

29
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,400
where she's just like, yeah, I'm just giving you money.

30
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,000
- Yeah, that's the move, dude.

31
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,860
- Yeah, I wish it's better.

32
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,500
I think, I talked to my dad and I think next year

33
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,780
we're just gonna give each other $100.

34
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,980
Yeah, my mom, the way my mom did it though

35
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,980
was she put the money inside of like trash.

36
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,620
So she bought like--

37
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,620
Your mom is so weird.

38
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,500
She bought a thing of, my brother got like wart remover

39
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,940
with $100 in it and I got feminine hygiene wipes

40
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,220
with $100 in it and she taped it all together

41
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,780
so I had to pull it out.

42
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,020
So it looked like I was pulling money.

43
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,580
- So it looked like you were pulling out something else.

44
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,620
- And then my nephew-- - That's dirty.

45
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,320
- My nephew-- - And your nephew's

46
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,060
watched you do that?

47
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,540
- One of my-- - Your nephew's watched

48
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:45,660
you pull feminine stuff out of your hygiene area?

49
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:48,980
- Ugh, you're nasty, dude. - Don't say that.

50
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,220
- Well, you said it already.

51
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,460
- You literally just said that.

52
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,940
- You didn't let me finish.

53
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,380
So my nephew-- - And they liked it.

54
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,380
My nephew saw me do that and I guess he heard somebody say,

55
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,920
I got pussy wipes.

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,780
So then he started walking around.

57
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,340
- Saying I got pussy wipes?

58
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,100
- Yeah, he was saying pussy wipes.

59
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,400
- That's awesome, bro.

60
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,460
Yeah, I didn't really get anything cool.

61
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,620
I got slippers.

62
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,460
That's mine.

63
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,280
- Nice, dude.

64
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,700
- And I bought myself some candy.

65
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,220
- Whoa!

66
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,020
- My favorite part of--

67
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,460
- Yeah!

68
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,460
- My favorite part of Christmas

69
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,820
when you're not a kid anymore is buying stuff for yourself

70
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,540
and then like making your parent wrap it.

71
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,380
- Yeah.

72
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,460
- I think that's so funny to do.

73
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,860
I love like I got the Friday the 13th box set

74
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,340
and I just had it shipped to my dad's house

75
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,540
and I was like, dad, you're gonna wrap this for me.

76
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,380
(laughing)

77
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,420
- That rules.

78
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,840
Yeah, this is the first year since I've not seen my aunt,

79
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,980
this is the first year that I haven't gotten

80
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:48,580
a Blockbuster gift card in like my entire life.

81
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,220
- Oh no.

82
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,800
- Yeah, she just bought, I don't know, like 10 years ago,

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,440
she bought like 100 Blockbuster gift cards

84
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,240
'cause she was like, "This'll be around forever."

85
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:59,960
And she's just been giving them to everybody since then.

86
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,160
Can you like redeem them for anything?

87
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,080
I haven't even tried.

88
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,920
Yeah, coolness.

89
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,760
I haven't even thought about it.

90
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,600
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

91
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,040
Wait, let's look up if you can.

92
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,020
I could probably sell 'em.

93
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,040
I have a couple back at the apartment.

94
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,320
They're vintage, dude.

95
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,160
True.

96
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,880
People will frame them and put 'em on their walls.

97
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,560
Dude, I miss Blockbuster, bro.

98
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,140
I miss like trying to just guess

99
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,000
which movie had a boob scene in it.

100
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
- Yeah.

101
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,480
- Just trying to, just wild guess.

102
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,720
- My only memory from the video store in my town,

103
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,040
'cause it closed before I was like old enough

104
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
to like really go to, like to go to it by myself,

105
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,760
is just like going there with my parents

106
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,480
and seeing Jurassic Park 3,

107
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,320
and seeing the claw marks on the video

108
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,560
casing me like, holy shit, the claws make a three.

109
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,080
And that's the only memory I have from that video.

110
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,080
- It's just me walking around looking for tits,

111
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,280
just picking up every Halle Berry movie,

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,680
and being like, "Mom, Dad, I have to watch this movie."

113
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,520
- Ma, I'm really a huge fan of Swordfish.

114
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,360
- I'm a huge Halle Berry fan.

115
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,880
- I'm intrigued right now, Mom, Dad.

116
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,880
- I looked it up, Caleb, as of April 2011,

117
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:11,000
Blockbuster gift cards are completely worthless.

118
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
- Are you serious?

119
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,280
She's been giving them that long?

120
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,280
- Yep.

121
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,120
- Bro.

122
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,960
Nobody, I honestly don't even know if she knows

123
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,260
that it doesn't exist anymore.

124
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,100
- Yeah?

125
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,740
- Yeah, she might seriously think that it's still around.

126
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,540
- It might be, it might be like,

127
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:29,140
they might have changed Blockbuster

128
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,120
into a streaming service.

129
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,960
- True.

130
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,200
- They tried to do the DVDs thing for a while.

131
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,580
- They might have changed Blockbuster

132
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,400
into a streaming service.

133
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,240
- Whoa.

134
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,400
- They might have.

135
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,880
- We should do, we should start sending the episodes

136
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,840
on CDs in the mail.

137
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,680
- I was talking about this on stream.

138
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,440
That's the next tier is I'm gonna mail people DVDs

139
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,640
'cause I have too many DVDs

140
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,080
and I'd like to get rid of some of them.

141
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,360
And the thing is, but the thing is,

142
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,120
I only have like 10 too many DVDs.

143
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,280
So it's gotta be enough money of a tier

144
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,200
that only a few people are gonna subscribe to it.

145
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,760
- Let's say $1,000.

146
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,600
- Yeah, okay.

147
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,420
- Yeah.

148
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,240
- Well, if you get $1,000, I'll send you my DVD

149
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,760
of "Tammy and the T-Rex" or like "Alien vs. Predator"

150
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,600
or something.

151
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,720
- I'll send you a video from the Creation Science Museum

152
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,200
if you subscribe for $1,000.

153
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:17,720
- Do either of you have Dish TV?

154
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,200
No, like the thing no dish the the antenna like

155
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,600
Cable thing like dish network dish network if you have dish network blockbuster

156
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,340
Blockbuster comm is where the magic of blockbuster video lives on with dish

157
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,840
dude

158
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,800
2011 blockbuster has been part of dish and you can still make it a blockbuster night registered trademark

159
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,120
Continue the blockbuster experience. We just a channel dish

160
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,800
Do you know why they call it Dish TV?

161
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,640
Why?

162
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,460
Because you sit on the couch and you say,

163
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,840
"I'm watching Dish TV."

164
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
(laughing)

165
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,480
True, true.

166
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I'm gonna watch Dish TV all night long.

167
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,680
Yeah.

168
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,280
Yeah, I don't really know anybody with satellite anymore.

169
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,160
Me neither.

170
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,640
My dad switched over completely to streaming services.

171
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,440
He's spending like 300 bucks a month.

172
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,720
Yeah, I think my parents are doing the same thing.

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,520
Just to watch live basketball and shit,

174
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,160
it's like dude, that rules.

175
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,080
Yeah.

176
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,840
Yeah, I wish I had a TV.

177
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,960
Oh, I think, I wish I did too.

178
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:29,760
I need to get, I'm sick of watching movies on my computer.

179
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,900
I gotta get a big TV and surround sound.

180
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,740
Yeah.

181
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,960
Can I just get some Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound?

182
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,800
Oh, I'm going 7.1, are you kidding?

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
7.1, no, no, no.

184
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah.

185
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,840
How about just--

186
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,440
I was getting 100, but I mean, you guys can--

187
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,080
- Yeah, but they have to get a 10 million point one

188
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,960
surround sound set up.

189
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,280
Yeah, 10 million and one decimal point.

190
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,120
- I'm thinking of getting like infinity point one,

191
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,280
Dolby digital, I don't know if you guys agree with that.

192
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,120
- Yeah, I'm thinking of getting a giant,

193
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,800
I'm thinking of getting like a 1200 pound TV

194
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
that's 36 inches wide,

195
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,880
and then a $50,000 surround sound set up,

196
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,120
and one of those ugly leather couches that reclines.

197
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,360
- Ordering a TV that says it's 50 inches,

198
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,000
but it's like a foot on the diagonal

199
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,960
and it has like a 50 inch deep like CRT monitor.

200
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,360
(laughing)

201
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,640
- It's 50 incher, dude.

202
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,760
- Yeah, you can get inside there if you want.

203
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,800
- That's a plasma screen too.

204
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,800
- Yeah, there's plasma in there, so don't go in, you'll die.

205
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,520
(laughing)

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,960
- Yeah, I'm gonna get one of those crazy couches.

207
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,200
I'm gonna tell everybody I have a home theater set up

208
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,360
and they're gonna come through

209
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,640
and we're gonna watch the first "Transformers" movie

210
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,480
in 480p. - And I'm gonna sit

211
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,560
in the chair behind the couch and I'm gonna jack off.

212
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,440
- 4DP, 4DP with the best sound on earth.

213
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,600
- The best unbelievable sound.

214
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,440
- Terrible video.

215
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,960
- You can't even see what's happening.

216
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,400
- It's 16 by 16.

217
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,520
- I got a state of the art sound system for a home theater.

218
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,560
Okay, how it works is everyone puts on headphones.

219
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,200
We have one headphone splitter.

220
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,160
And if you got, listen, if you have really,

221
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,800
if you have good headphones,

222
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,600
it's gonna be the best sound you ever heard.

223
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,440
- Yeah.

224
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,560
- But if you bring fucking Apple earbuds,

225
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,440
it's gonna sound like shit.

226
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,280
- That's on you.

227
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,720
- And we're gonna call you gay.

228
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,680
- Yeah.

229
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,320
- Yeah, but you will be able to hear

230
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,280
through those terrible headphones.

231
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,560
I'm gonna say, "You're gay."

232
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,280
You're gonna be like, "I heard that loud and clear."

233
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,800
- But yeah, but then this guy over here

234
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,120
has got the Audio-Technica over-ear headphones.

235
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,640
You know, he's not gonna hear it.

236
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,480
- Yeah, headphones do make you--

237
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,920
- He's gonna be smiling and he's gonna be watching the movie.

238
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,000
- They're insult-canceling headphones.

239
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,960
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

240
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,920
- It's genius, dude. - That's a good idea.

241
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,480
If everyone wore insult-canceling headphones, nobody--

242
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,040
- How many times has somebody called me a homo on the train

243
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,600
and I just didn't know 'cause my big ass cans?

244
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,760
- Yeah. - You know?

245
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,680
- Your boobs?

246
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,200
- My big ass boobs that I have.

247
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,520
Yeah, I was like, excuse me?

248
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,440
- It bounced right off.

249
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,960
- I just say, look at these, man.

250
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,040
- Yeah. - They get distracted.

251
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,760
They don't even know what they called me in the first place.

252
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,400
- Yeah, my boobs are down here.

253
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,480
- Excuse me, my boobs are down here.

254
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,280
- What a stupid ass gay hot guy with big boobs?

255
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,800
(laughing)

256
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,440
Look at that homo with the most beautiful tits of all time.

257
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,720
- You're walking out from behind the escalator

258
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,880
so he just sees your head at first and then.

259
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,040
(laughing)

260
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,880
- What?

261
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,360
- Hominomin, hominomin.

262
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,940
- The escalator on the train.

263
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,780
(laughing)

264
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,480
In the train station.

265
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,680
- No, they have double-decker trains in New York City.

266
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,520
- In my city.

267
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,340
- It's like an inter-K thing.

268
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:32,400
(laughing)

269
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,080
- Yeah, in my city that I'm inventing

270
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,280
where I have giant boobs and I ride the train all day.

271
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,000
(laughing)

272
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
- Yeah, 'cause I'm the mayor, dude.

273
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,000
I gotta prove the trains work.

274
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,720
I'm just getting on there with my big ass titties.

275
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,560
- Yep. - Yeah.

276
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,320
- Dressed in a suit, a men's suit,

277
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,160
my tits are bursting out of 'em.

278
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,600
- And my name is Boob Da Boobio.

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,580
(laughing)

280
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,800
- Yeah, that's right.

281
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,640
- Yeah.

282
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,960
- And I live in huge boob city.

283
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,800
- Yeah.

284
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,640
- In the state of huge boobs.

285
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,600
- Yeah, titty city.

286
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,120
- I love it, I live in New York titty and new titty.

287
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,160
- Papa new titty.

288
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,800
Papa's new titties.

289
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,640
- That's right.

290
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,480
- Uh huh.

291
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,360
- Papa's got a new pair of titties.

292
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,200
- Yep.

293
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,020
- They're on the way.

294
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,440
- Papa's got a big rack.

295
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,480
- Can you check the mail?

296
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
It might be my tits.

297
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,440
- Daddy needs a new rack.

298
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:19,360
(laughing)

299
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,720
- Daddy needs a new, this is a guy at Vegas.

300
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,880
Daddy needs a new set of boobs.

301
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,720
- Did you guys see Santa Claus?

302
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
- No.

303
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,380
- Did you wait for him?

304
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,220
- No.

305
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,060
- No.

306
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,880
- No.

307
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,720
- He came immediately.

308
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,240
He came down the chimney 6 p.m.

309
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,080
- Yeah, he's definitely a man.

310
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,600
- I said, "Man, you're early."

311
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,160
And he didn't say anything.

312
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,000
- No.

313
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,040
And he waited until midnight, and then he went back up the chimney. He didn't even eat cookies

314
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,880
He can't speak at all he can't no he had well

315
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:49,480
He can say ho ho ho but he has like he had a there's a bullet lodged in his brain

316
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,740
And they can't take it out, but it it has disrupted his verbal ability

317
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,860
Yeah, that's true bad now for all yeah, I bet you feel real naughty now

318
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,480
What would you guys do if Santa just chilled in your house for like six hours?

319
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,920
I would make fucking fight him. I'm just a world star shit to him dude

320
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,760
I it's funny cuz you look at the Santa tracker, and it doesn't look at that Santa tracker right now

321
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,760
It doesn't say where he is so he could be

322
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,880
He's on other planets delivering gifts to aliens. Yeah, it's true. Yeah. Yeah, he goes down

323
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:29,080
Woman's chimney, and she's like oh, I don't have you know I don't have any money

324
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,120
And but and he's like you don't have to pay me with money

325
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,240
It's presents, but she doesn't understand and then she traps him in the bedroom. That's a movie that I could see being made

326
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,560
Oh my god, dude. I was thinking about this doesn't it feel like back in the day?

327
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,800
Women they used to look like Marilyn Monroe and now they look a lot more like Marilyn Manson

328
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,520
Have you guys thought about this

329
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,160
Well now think about this yeah, but you said these beautiful

330
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,080
four-foot women, weighed 180 pounds,

331
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,760
blonde as the sun, and she's fucking,

332
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
if you're the president, she's gonna suck your dick.

333
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,880
Now, Marilyn Manson-style women,

334
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,840
walking around all the time, they're seven feet tall,

335
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,640
they're skinny as a rail, casting spells.

336
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,000
- Back in the day, we used to have women

337
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,680
that looked like James Charles.

338
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,760
Nowadays, we have women that look like Charlie Chaplin.

339
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,840
- That's so fucking true.

340
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,060
(laughing)

341
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,640
That's really true.

342
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,920
I'm sick of these Charlie Chaplin ass bitches.

343
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,760
Yeah.

344
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,440
Yeah, back in the day, women used to look like

345
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,000
a big ass thumb though,

346
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,040
and now they look like Dikembe Mutombo.

347
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,480
And that's facts, no printer.

348
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,320
Yeah.

349
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,920
I can't think of any of them.

350
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,360
That's right.

351
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,400
Yeah.

352
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,120
Ooh.

353
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,800
- Back in the day we had President JFK,

354
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,560
now we have President he's not okay.

355
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,480
- No.

356
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,840
- Somebody needs to check on this boy.

357
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,680
- That's right.

358
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,500
- Somebody needs to check on this JFK.

359
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,480
- Yeah, somebody needs to check and balance on this guy.

360
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,280
- Oh my God.

361
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
- Oh my God.

362
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,320
- Do you think the president could even balance?

363
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,800
I'm so hungover guys.

364
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,080
- Boy had a little too much nog.

365
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,920
- I did.

366
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,760
- Yeah.

367
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,580
- I did, I did.

368
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,420
- He was drinking Christmas cream, dude.

369
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,880
- There's one time of the year

370
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
where you can nog yourself into a coma

371
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,240
And this man, he's just drinking it out of a Camelback.

372
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,960
We, me and my brothers, drank just straight whiskey.

373
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,480
Just Christmas Eve, just.

374
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
I drank straight up Aldi wine.

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,320
Yeah?

376
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,960
Yeah, I had three bottles of Aldi wine.

377
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,920
Damn.

378
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,760
Yeah.

379
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,580
Good for you.

380
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,080
I was dressed as a gnome at my family Christmas,

381
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,320
walking around drinking Aldi wine out of the bottle.

382
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,160
Oh yeah.

383
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,980
Just like.

384
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,800
I'm glad you like your gift.

385
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,640
I'm glad you like your costume.

386
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,920
It was the best gift I've ever gotten.

387
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,920
My grandma was so confused.

388
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,320
She was like, "What?

389
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,600
"Why are you dressed like a gnome?"

390
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,760
And I said, "I got cursed."

391
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,960
And she kept being like, "Seriously, what are you?"

392
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,160
And I was like, "I don't know.

393
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,540
"I'll turn back to a guy at midnight.

394
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,640
"There's nothing I can do."

395
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,080
She was like really upset with me.

396
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,640
- Yeah, was she upset with the knife I got you?

397
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:14,520
- No, she thought the knife was absolutely righteous.

398
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
- Yeah? - Yeah.

399
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,320
She thought it was so swag, dude.

400
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,720
- It's so funny how small that knife is.

401
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,400
- I showed, I told-- - It is tiny.

402
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,720
- I opened it up and I-- - It's like,

403
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,200
the handle's bigger than the blade.

404
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,920
Pat got me a knife with a, yeah, it's really small.

405
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,840
Pat got me a knife with a Bible verse on it,

406
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,240
and I read it, I was like, "Oh, it's got a Bible verse on it."

407
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,280
My mom was like, "Which one?"

408
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,980
And I was like, "Philippians 4.13."

409
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,800
And then she spent like 10 minutes

410
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,040
just trying to guess what that Bible verse was

411
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,800
and getting it wrong every time.

412
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,200
(laughing)

413
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,560
Yeah, some Christian she turned out to be, dude.

414
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
Patrick got me an Excalibur.

415
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,520
Oh yeah, that's true.

416
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,360
I was trying to get you this one.

417
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,600
I wasn't sure if it was from Patrick.

418
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,680
Patrick said he got me that in a DVD drive,

419
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,700
and he told me he was sending the DVD drive

420
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,720
and I didn't know he was also sending a sword.

421
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,760
So when the sword got here,

422
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,280
I genuinely didn't know if it was from Patrick

423
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,320
or from my uncle.

424
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,040
- It's a real sword or a sword-like object?

425
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,440
- It's a sword-like object.

426
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,400
- Oh, buddy.

427
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,320
- I'm gonna hang it on the wall though.

428
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,640
- Yeah.

429
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,200
- I think I'm gonna make a sword while I'm here, I decided.

430
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,840
I've been watching this show.

431
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,680
- Oh, Forged in Fire?

432
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,040
- I've been watching Forged in Fire.

433
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,080
- I've been watching this show.

434
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,080
I didn't know if you knew what it was, dude.

435
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,640
I've been watching it, and I was like,

436
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:29,140
"God, that's crazy cool, I definitely wanna do that."

437
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,640
And then me and my brother looked up

438
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,280
how much a forge costs.

439
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,100
It's like $60.

440
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,940
What?

441
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:39,540
Yeah, to get like a propane-powered forge

442
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,860
and like a little anvil, it costs like 60 bucks.

443
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,160
And then you get a scrap metal.

444
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,320
We're making a sword like tomorrow.

445
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,240
That's sick.

446
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,260
It's gonna be awesome.

447
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,520
I'm thinking of going with Damascus steel.

448
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,360
Yeah?

449
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,440
Yeah.

450
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,280
That shit's hard to make.

451
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:59,080
sharp nope it's easy is it easy yeah they do it on TV okay yeah I trust you about

452
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,480
that show I only watched like one or two episodes of it it the only cool part is

453
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,120
when they hit the pig with the stuff oh yeah rest of it is just like it's just

454
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,200
like it's a cooking show but not interesting it's like what yeah they're

455
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:13,640
making it's just like a stick of metal

456
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,740
- They should have a sword swallower to see,

457
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,120
to test that aspect of the sword.

458
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,480
All right, your blade will kill, it will cut.

459
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,680
Let's see how it swallows and how it tastes.

460
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,120
- It shows them like dunking the sword in water

461
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,320
or whatever and the guy's like,

462
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,600
"I was really upset because my sword, I didn't like it."

463
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,960
And that's like the extent of like,

464
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,680
it's so not interesting.

465
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,360
- My favorite part of that show is every three episodes,

466
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,920
they try to have a girl on.

467
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:44,040
- Yeah, and they fail.

468
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,880
They lose in the first round.

469
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,960
- They always lose the first round every time, dude.

470
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,520
It's so funny.

471
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,400
They have a girl on and she's like,

472
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,800
"Yeah, I've been doing this for like 50 years."

473
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,620
And all the other guys are like,

474
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,460
"I started last summer."

475
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,840
- Yeah, there's a guy who's like 20 years old.

476
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,480
- Yeah, and then she can't even get the metal to get hot.

477
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,560
And she just, they cut to the judging section

478
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,500
and she's holding part of a spring

479
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,880
that she tried to turn into a sword.

480
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,480
And they're like, "Unfortunately, you are disqualified."

481
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,840
He's sorry.

482
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,000
It's pretty, it's a pretty funny show.

483
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
It's always like beard guys on that show too.

484
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,840
There's a guy with a kilt.

485
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:22,680
Yeah.

486
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,560
And then they did the thing where they leave

487
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,680
for a couple days and they make a sword in their home forge

488
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,760
and then come back.

489
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,760
And the guy, when he was at his home forge wearing pants,

490
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,200
comes back to the show, brand new kilt.

491
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Of course.

492
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,600
He just can't be seen in the stew without a kilt on.

493
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,820
Yeah. It rocks, yeah.

494
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:44,980
I don't know, I think I might have to pick up a tactical kilt pretty soon.

495
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Yeah?

496
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,980
Yeah.

497
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,780
You're not Scottish though, you can't wear a kilt.

498
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,780
I'm tactical.

499
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,420
Ah, well, you know what?

500
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,740
That's an aspect of the kilt that I forgot.

501
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,220
I have knives and screws that I need to keep around.

502
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,420
Yeah, in the kilt.

503
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,860
That's what the tactical kilt is, it's covered in fucking cargo pockets.

504
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,300
Oh, okay.

505
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,300
Come on dude.

506
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,300
What color is it?

507
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,660
I thought it was tactical because it was made out of Kevlar.

508
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,100
- Yeah, it's made out of bulletproof,

509
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,260
it's a bulletproof kilt.

510
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,980
- Yeah, so you don't get your thingy shot off.

511
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,060
- As long as they don't, as long as they don't

512
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,700
leave it short. - Shot off my thingy.

513
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,220
- The problem with the bulletproof kilt

514
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,460
is if the bullet hits the ground

515
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,740
and bounces up into the kilt,

516
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,020
it's just gonna ricochet around inside there.

517
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,860
- That's true.

518
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,180
- And fuck up your shit from every direction.

519
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,740
- Not to like a birthday cake.

520
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,260
- A birthday, yeah it does.

521
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,780
What if the candles, what if they can't blow out?

522
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,060
They're green candles. - Well that's a what if,

523
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,340
that's not a negative.

524
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,700
- Well yours is a what if.

525
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,300
- No that has happened.

526
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,380
- Are we talking about a tactical birthday cake?

527
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,220
- Yeah.

528
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,380
- Ooh, that's not a bad idea.

529
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,180
- That's a birthday cake covered in pockets for the presents.

530
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,080
- So yeah, you can keep, wow.

531
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,180
It's like a mobile birthday party.

532
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,020
- Yeah.

533
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:57,980
- It has wheels to it.

534
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,580
- And clowns can fit in there too

535
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,780
'cause they can get small.

536
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,820
- If it's a tactical bachelor party cake,

537
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,780
you can keep the stripper in one of the pockets.

538
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,620
- Whoa.

539
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,340
and then she doesn't have to get messy

540
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,680
and you don't have to put her in the oven

541
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,520
to get her into the cake.

542
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,460
- True.

543
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,260
- That's the worst part about bachelor party cakes.

544
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,020
- You have to find a heat resistant stripper.

545
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,220
- Where the fuck is the stripper?

546
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,700
She's supposed to pop out of the cake

547
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,780
and digging through the cake

548
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,460
and she's just like red and burnt.

549
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,340
- Somebody stuffed this cake with pulled pork.

550
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,780
What the fuck is this dude?

551
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,820
- Oh no, we left Goofus in charge

552
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,700
of getting the stripper into the cake.

553
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,940
(laughing)

554
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:39,020
- Sorry guys.

555
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,860
(laughing)

556
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,980
I'm sorry about that.

557
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,420
- We left Goofy from the first scary movie.

558
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,940
(laughing)

559
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,060
We left him in charge.

560
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,380
Why do you fuck everything up, Goofy?

561
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,800
You're so stupid.

562
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,620
Yeah.

563
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,520
- I wouldn't do that on my bachelor party.

564
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,280
- Dude, are we gonna do a bachelor party when I get married?

565
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,100
- I guess we have to.

566
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,340
- Should just us three--

567
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,540
- Just watching TV.

568
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,340
(laughing)

569
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:07,860
It's just us three at Pat's house watching TV.

570
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
With all of our arms around each other.

571
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,220
With my mom and dad.

572
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,660
My mom and dad are in their chairs.

573
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:16,540
Yeah, we get a big bowl of popcorn.

574
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,500
They're not allowed to touch it, that's our popcorn.

575
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,820
Just watching YouTube videos.

576
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,700
Yeah, cut to my fiance's bachelorette party.

577
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:28,820
She's just on a casting couch getting fucking just turnt out like a fucking hot pocket.

578
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,820
We're just like, we're watching Mr. Bean again.

579
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,700
- Caleb's jacking off under the blanket.

580
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,940
(laughing)

581
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,740
- We're sitting, it's me and Cameron on the left

582
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,580
and right of the couch and Caleb's in the middle

583
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,420
jacking off.

584
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,260
- Yeah.

585
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,500
- Caleb's going like, oh, oh, oh.

586
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,340
- And we look over and he's like,

587
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,420
no, it was really funny, I'm laughing.

588
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,380
- I wouldn't jack off in front of you guys.

589
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,900
That seems like a Patrick move.

590
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:58,540
- No, what are you talking, I would never jack off

591
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,820
- Caleb is definitely the one who would do that.

592
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,660
- What?

593
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:04,300
- You are 100% the guy who would jack off in the--

594
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,340
- I don't even jack off in my life.

595
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,180
Why would I do it in front of my friends?

596
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,520
- Yeah, you do.

597
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,580
- No, I don't.

598
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,220
- You're the one who jacks off the most.

599
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,660
- I do not jack off.

600
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,760
- Yeah, you do.

601
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,600
- Dude, I'm like--

602
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,340
- You probably quit like a week ago, right?

603
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,180
- I'm like a divorced dad.

604
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,020
- For the holidays?

605
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:23,100
- No, I've been every other weekend for years.

606
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,180
- I don't believe that.

607
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,180
- It's true, dude.

608
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,520
How do you think I stay so powerful?

609
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,280
You don't, you're not powerful.

610
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,640
That's why every other Monday

611
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,600
is the worst possible day to catch me.

612
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,840
If you need me to do,

613
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,560
I can't even fucking tie a knot every other Monday.

614
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,820
I'm so fucking, I don't have any cum in my body.

615
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,000
Yeah? Yeah.

616
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Either way, you're the one who would jack off

617
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,400
under a blanket. No, dude.

618
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,040
I'm like a samurai. No.

619
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,960
Yeah. We know samurai

620
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,120
jack off under blankets.

621
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,840
Yeah. Samurai have never

622
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,680
jacked off.

623
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,320
And I'm jacked off all the time.

624
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,720
- No, incorrect.

625
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,320
- Then why is his name Samurai Jack?

626
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,960
- You might catch me, now I'm not gonna say--

627
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,960
- Answer the question.

628
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,680
- His name is Sam, because he jacks off so much.

629
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,280
But that's why he's not just called Samurai.

630
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,240
He's Samurai Jack because he's the only one that jacks off.

631
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,560
That's not true, listen.

632
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,960
You guys might, you might catch me edging on the couch,

633
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,080
but I would never come.

634
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,200
'Cause edging is part of the power.

635
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,480
I edged fucking 30 minutes ago.

636
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,240
I was edging while I was shitting,

637
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,240
because I had to do this.

638
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,080
- So it hurt less.

639
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,400
- So that's why you were taking so long to get here?

640
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,240
- Yeah, I had to bring my penis with me.

641
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,520
- Because you were having a diarrhea attack

642
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,880
and you were edging at the same time?

643
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:38,720
- Yeah, dude.

644
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,320
I rubbed the tip like a crystal ball

645
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,480
and I'm ready to podcast.

646
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,720
(laughing)

647
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,160
That's just how it works, dude.

648
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:53,000
That's a little trick that I learned from Gus.

649
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,560
Yeah, I was about to ask, didn't Gus teach you that?

650
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:56,800
Gus taught me that.

651
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,640
Yeah.

652
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,460
And I've been on a new level ever since.

653
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,300
Yeah?

654
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,680
Yeah, I can see the back of my head right now.

655
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,800
Maybe I should have done that.

656
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,200
Maybe I wouldn't have, it wouldn't be so tired right now.

657
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,080
Yeah, dude, when you start edging

658
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,360
and taking stimulants a lot,

659
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,680
you're living like a third person view.

660
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,500
Yeah?

661
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,520
It's insanely cool.

662
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,940
You hit P and you go into third person.

663
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,800
Exactly.

664
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,440
First person, you don't have,

665
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,740
you're missing stuff out of the corners of your eyes.

666
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,720
What if somebody tries to attack you from behind?

667
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
I can see around corners when I edge.

668
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,440
I can see through wooden doors.

669
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,900
That's right, I can noclip.

670
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,800
Yeah, yeah.

671
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
I'm getting there, that's the goal.

672
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,720
Eventually, if I hold my command long enough,

673
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,700
I can start noclipping through walls.

674
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,000
You can use player.setscale 0.2.

675
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,840
Yeah.

676
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:46,680
You can get underneath doors.

677
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,680
I get, yeah, I get real, when I edge, I shrink down.

678
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,600
I set my jump to 5,000.

679
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,760
That's right, and bound my jump to the mouse wheel

680
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:57,760
so I can do it faster.

681
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,140
Yeah, I spawn so many items.

682
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,720
That's right, it's just the truth.

683
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,280
I set my max health to a million.

684
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,040
I'm really hard to kill right now.

685
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,880
Yeah.

686
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,720
Yeah, but it wears off.

687
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,880
I feel like I'm dead.

688
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,760
Maybe I should start doing this.

689
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,640
You should, man, I could teach you how.

690
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,480
Yeah?

691
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,440
Yeah, Cam could leave you

692
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,960
and we could stay on the Zoom call for a while.

693
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,220
He's the host, that's the problem.

694
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,640
I think we could just shut off our video

695
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,100
and then tell each other how to do it.

696
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,360
- Well no, I have to show you.

697
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,240
- Okay, then Cameron can put a piece of tape over his screen.

698
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,160
- Okay.

699
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,880
- One piece of tape over my screen?

700
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,520
- Over your whole screen.

701
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,160
Just take a thing of duct tape,

702
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,240
take duct tape and put a big X on the monitor.

703
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,440
- I just cross it out.

704
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,280
- Yeah.

705
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,400
- Just FaceTime me later and I'll show you

706
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,240
how to do it on a banana or something.

707
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,080
- Okay.

708
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:45,900
- I don't have to show you my penis.

709
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,200
- Dude, on Christmas morning,

710
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,120
I woke up like still fucked up and I was trying to like

711
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,760
sober up and my mom told me to eat a banana.

712
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,600
- Yeah.

713
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,960
- 'Cause I guess that she was like,

714
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,440
oh, that'll sober you up or whatever.

715
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,640
And I tried to eat a banana and I immediately threw it up.

716
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,400
- You threw up a single banana?

717
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,760
- I ate like the tip of the banana,

718
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,200
held it in my mouth for like a second

719
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,040
and then just like threw it up in the sink.

720
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,000
- You didn't even swallow it?

721
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,440
Okay, so you spit out the banana.

722
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,000
- Yeah, so you didn't throw up a banana.

723
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,020
- It felt like I threw up.

724
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:21,860
- Do you ever do that thing where you--

725
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,340
- You just say, wait, it felt like you threw up

726
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,460
or you did throw up?

727
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:26,300
- It felt like I threw up.

728
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,140
- Do you ever do that thing where you sit with your friends--

729
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,180
- So you spit, wait, so you just spit it out?

730
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:30,780
- He just spit it out.

731
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,620
He doesn't know the difference

732
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,900
between spitting and throwing up.

733
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:33,740
Do you ever do that thing, Pat,

734
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,580
where you sit on a bridge and you see how far

735
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,940
you can throw up and then suck it back into your mouth?

736
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,780
- Yeah.

737
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,820
- Yeah, that's pretty good, right?

738
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,820
I like doing that kind of thing.

739
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:45,020
- I felt, dude, it's straight up,

740
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:48,660
I think if I ever swallowed a banana, I would throw up.

741
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,300
It'd be funny to go to the top of the Empire State Building

742
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,060
on a tour and just throw up off the side.

743
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,900
Yeah.

744
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,780
That would rule.

745
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,900
I feel like the wind,

746
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,660
I feel like it wouldn't touch the ground.

747
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,500
I feel like the wind--

748
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,140
It will, every single person would get like one piece

749
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,780
of throw up on their face.

750
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,620
Maybe like, "Ew, carrot."

751
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,780
That's the coolest shit, dude.

752
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,540
When I would go to Canterby Lake Park,

753
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,860
we'd go up on the log flume.

754
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,980
Oh, the star blaster?

755
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,060
No, the log flume.

756
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:17,900
Oh.

757
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,180
you know the log flume where you have to climb all the stairs

758
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,780
to get to the top, like it's like this metal,

759
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,700
it's a log flume, I don't know how more to describe it.

760
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,040
Yeah, you have to like climb all these stairs

761
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,500
to get to the top of it, like to wait in line,

762
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,500
and we just like spit off the top of it

763
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,780
and just watch like the wind would just like explode

764
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,420
the spit halfway down.

765
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,060
Just the coolest thing in the world, dude.

766
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,900
- Yeah. - Yeah.

767
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,140
- I mean, the Star Blaster,

768
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,060
that was always fun to spit off of.

769
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,740
- Yeah, I just love spitting.

770
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,580
- Me too, we should just start spitting a lot.

771
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,100
- That's the fun part of amusement parks.

772
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,060
That's one thing COVID's taken away from us, dude.

773
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,600
- You can't spit on people.

774
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,440
- You're right.

775
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,980
- You can't spit onto people from--

776
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,260
- It's become a rude thing.

777
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
- From 40 feet in the air.

778
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,820
- Yeah, it's become very rude.

779
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,740
- It's become very messed up to do.

780
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,580
- It's pretty sad.

781
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,160
- It sucks that people think it's rude.

782
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,500
- To spit on someone?

783
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,340
- It's funny too.

784
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,260
- Sometimes you need to spit on the ground too.

785
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,560
That's something, people are always like,

786
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,260
people always go like, oh it's so disgusting

787
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,500
when people spit on the ground.

788
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,420
It's like no, sometimes there's something in your mouth

789
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,540
you need to get it out.

790
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:12,060
- It's fine to spit.

791
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,340
- If you say it's bad to spit on the ground

792
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,580
or it's gross to spit on the ground,

793
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,260
I know that you've never eaten anything in your life.

794
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,460
- You've never eaten sunflower seeds?

795
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:23,260
- You've never had phlegm, you've never had allergies,

796
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,660
you've never had any, I know that you drink through a tube,

797
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,500
you drink water, that's all you eat.

798
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,740
- We gotta bring back spittoons.

799
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,100
- Yeah, I agree.

800
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,820
- Like at a bar, just like a metal pot.

801
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:37,300
- They should put 'em around like they put trash cans.

802
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,900
- Yeah, dude. - Outside, it's everywhere.

803
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,580
- Well, that would be a problem for pigeons.

804
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,700
But then there would be like a guy who likes to like drink it.

805
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:46,540
Yeah, exactly.

806
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,380
I mean, he can do what he wants.

807
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,140
There's probably a guy who likes to drink the trash cans too.

808
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:50,980
Yeah.

809
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:53,060
Is that what those families are doing

810
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,460
when they walk around my neighborhood

811
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,820
opening all the recycling bins?

812
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,420
They're looking for cans with spit in them?

813
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,780
They're looking for empty bottles to eat.

814
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,760
You know what I would be scared of if they had spittoons

815
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,180
is somebody taking my DNA.

816
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:07,780
You know what, maybe now with DNA,

817
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,020
I don't want somebody to take my--

818
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,580
Now that DNA has been discovered this year.

819
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,420
Yeah.

820
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:15,020
I don't want someone to take my spit from a spittoon

821
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,860
and put it at a crime scene.

822
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,980
That's a good point.

823
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,820
Yeah.

824
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,200
I went to a pool hall yesterday,

825
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,260
'cause we called them, we were like,

826
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,540
hey, what's the deal?

827
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,380
Are you guys open?

828
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,100
And they were like, yeah, everybody has to wear a mask,

829
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,300
and we're opening every other table and stuff.

830
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,060
And we're like, okay, that seems pretty safe.

831
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,180
We get there, and we get set up,

832
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,900
and there's a guy in a cowboy hat,

833
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,660
walking around with no mask, licking his hands.

834
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,500
(laughing)

835
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,380
Just walking around the whole place,

836
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,380
licking the palms of his hands without a mask on.

837
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,700
Giant cowboy hat.

838
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,180
- Was he doing it as like a fuck you?

839
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:50,220
- Like a fuck you COVID?

840
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,820
- I think, or he just had like the best wings ever.

841
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,500
It's one of those for sure.

842
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,260
I honestly have no clue.

843
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,700
Yeah, it could have been either one.

844
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,280
- Man, that's so funny.

845
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,060
Let's do this list.

846
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:05,900
- Yeah, hold on.

847
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,660
I'm gonna, since I'm editing this,

848
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:13,060
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee one second. I'm gonna get one too. I won't I promise I'm not gonna edge anymore

849
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:18,900
That's just gonna get picked up on the call

850
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,580
Hey now that Caleb's not here

851
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:30,020
I've got another present going to his house. He's gonna hear this when he edits it. It's a it's

852
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:35,420
Anthrax did you get my present? I think I said I did Asheville by accident

853
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:40,440
No you I got it. I think I sent it to Nashville by accident. Oh now I get that now I got

854
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:48,900
Yeah, I think I sent it I think I sent it I think I sent it I think I think I sent it

855
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,660
I think I sent it. I think I sent it. Yeah, I think I sent it

856
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:58,180
Yeah, I think I accidentally played a message to say you had to evacuate and then send it to Nashville by accident

857
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,680
And my niece really loved the the gift that you got me Cameron

858
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:08,960
It was that's so funny doesn't make noises. Yeah, it makes it makes baby Yoda sounds and farts

859
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,860
Really dude. Yeah, nice. All right. My penis is a red-hot tamale and we can record now. All right, okay

860
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:21,780
58 things you probably forgot happened in 2020 since this is the last episode of 2020. Mm-hmm

861
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:28,040
And this is from mashable everyone's every favorite website. Yeah, here's the thing. I did a quick cursory glance of this list

862
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:31,200
I remember all this. Yeah, you have an amazing memory

863
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,180
This is this list is by Jess Joho

864
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:41,740
Wow, what a cool name? Yeah, wow guys we survived 2020. Yay

865
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:48,200
Congratulations, you survived 2020 does the idea of this godforsaken years and bring you little comfort because you know

866
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,420
The horrors it rot will outlast December. Yeah us to

867
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:56,860
Emotionally speaking 2020 lasted approximately 12 months and 487 years

868
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:00,100
quarantine time distortion is a real thing.

869
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,220
That's why we're billing to what,

870
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,060
we'll bill it.

871
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,880
(laughs)

872
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,720
- We're Billy Willys.

873
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,620
- We're Billy Willys.

874
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,220
We're willing to bet you will not believe

875
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:08,020
many of the events we've compiled on this list

876
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:10,780
actually took place in the year of our Lord 2020.

877
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,260
You know that, the year of our Lord.

878
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,100
- This is funny.

879
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,920
- Time is a human construct.

880
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,140
It's lost all meaning forever,

881
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,900
whether due to isolation or just the unending onslaught

882
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,820
of world ending news.

883
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:20,660
In all likelihood,

884
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,020
you'll experience the memory of events

885
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:22,860
from earlier in the year

886
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,420
like they're from a bygone era,

887
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,660
a time when humanity was more innocent and naive

888
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,660
unless, you know, on the brink of total societal collapse and whatnot.

889
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:34,660
Or maybe you were just bombarded by so many unfathomable news stories,

890
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,660
or, let's be honest, too busy spiraling to pay attention,

891
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:41,660
that you missed some or deleted others from memory to make room for...

892
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,660
everything else that happened.

893
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,660
As strange and unbelievable as some of these seem,

894
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:49,660
they all did indeed occur in our current timeline.

895
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:52,660
So get ready to dive headfirst into the wormhole, friends.

896
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,660
Let's defy the laws of physics and logic together

897
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,820
as we walked down a memory lane located in the bowels of hell,

898
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,860
smiley face emoticon.

899
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,980
Your body might want to physically reject the fact

900
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,140
that some of the following took place

901
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,460
in the span of just 12 months,

902
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:07,900
but as your soul fights to leave your body,

903
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:10,580
just try not to think of what's to come in 2021.

904
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,300
- It's just rules that no matter how bad shit gets,

905
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,020
people will still write these articles.

906
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,900
- Yeah. - Just forever.

907
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,700
There'll just be like 150 cities that fucking

908
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,580
were consumed by the ocean this year

909
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,860
that you might not remember.

910
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,260
- Yeah.

911
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:26,340
- That's swag.

912
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,500
- I'm thinking the ocean came in this year.

913
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,500
- Yeah, a hundred cannibals you might not remember

914
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,580
eating your loved ones this year.

915
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,940
- I think, you know, I think it's pretty,

916
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,660
it's good that we have lists like this.

917
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,380
- Yeah, it is good.

918
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,420
Why do you think that?

919
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,140
- The devil just appeared, because why not?

920
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:53,340
- Yeah, 'cause now it's 2020 and I guess that's a thing.

921
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,100
- I guess the devil is real now.

922
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,940
Yeah.

923
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,080
I think this has been the worst year.

924
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,060
Wow, really?

925
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,740
Dude.

926
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,860
I feel like there's just like,

927
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,780
it's just like, I can't wait for the dumpster fire

928
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,620
to be over.

929
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,440
Dude.

930
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,280
Is one thought that I've been having.

931
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,460
It's gonna be so freeing when you wake up

932
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,540
on January 1st, 2021.

933
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,380
Yeah.

934
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,060
And you're like, dude, it's all, it's back to normal, dude.

935
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:19,860
I'm still writing garbage fire on all my checks.

936
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,220
When I wake up back in my kid body

937
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,820
and I realize I'm not an adult anymore.

938
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,660
Uh-huh.

939
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:31,300
2020 is over. I wake up back in my race car bed, "Mom, I missed you." It'll be great, dude.

940
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:38,900
Dude, every year has been so bad. You know, like 2019, Peter Mayhew died.

941
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:45,300
Yeah. First Peter Mayhew. That was the first hell year for me. That was when I know it was

942
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:51,540
going bad. And then this year, you know, this year, my uncles. My uncles didn't come to Christmas.

943
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:55,460
Yeah, it's pretty fucked up dude.

944
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:58,060
Oh, by the way, my uncle, we're getting him on the podcast.

945
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,880
He's coming.

946
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm so excited.

947
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,540
We're doing it, dude.

948
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,740
(laughing)

949
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,220
Patrick died.

950
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,220
He asked me what the podcast was called

951
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,780
and I just lied to him.

952
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,140
It's just somebody who's like, really?

953
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,980
I don't know anyone who's really into Peter Mayhew.

954
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,220
(laughing)

955
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:19,580
It is so funny though, every fucking year before this,

956
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,220
they were like, this is the hell year,

957
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:25,220
because like one celebrity they yeah always it's always like that because

958
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:29,660
like it's always it's always a from Star Wars yeah yeah great David Bowie died

959
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,660
This is officially the worst year of all time.

960
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,900
(laughing)

961
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:44,500
- It's not even that funny.

962
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,040
It's not even that funny at all.

963
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,880
- Awkward, it's tired.

964
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:51,180
- Dude, he's got nog brain.

965
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,920
- Number one, makes it happen.

966
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,720
Makes it.

967
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,380
We need to get you you need to take a vibe answer

968
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:13,760
The year we lost fucking Mayhew man this sucks

969
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:23,320
Didn't lose Peter Mayhew this at least he already died so that he didn't get to die again

970
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,680
And Peter Mayhew dying. Thank God. My father died of coronavirus and Peter Mayhew

971
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,480
God this year sucks

972
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,600
Megxit this is one of those lists where every item is just a tweet

973
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,320
Yeah, and then has like a little blurb about the tweet. That's swag

974
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,160
So Megxit was when Harry and Meghan were leaving the royal family. I will be honest. I don't remember this one

975
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,080
I don't remember this happening. I you know I was too broken about Peter Mayhew

976
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:05,580
Yeah about Peter Mayhew? I was still recovering. There was about six months that I just blacked out after he died.

977
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:12,480
I don't even remember everything. I was kind of entered a fugue state. I went on an insane bender. I woke up in Tulsa.

978
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,360
And you know people were telling me I had to put on a mask and stuff. Yeah. I was like what?

979
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:22,660
I was like what? Why? I gotta put on a mask? Don't you know fucking Peter Mayhew just died?

980
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,020
- Yeah, can you stop bothering me with this mask shit?

981
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,860
- Oh my God.

982
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,680
- I'm mourning.

983
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,900
- I'm mourning Peter Mayhew.

984
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,820
- It has been nice though,

985
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,660
'cause now you can't tell who people are.

986
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:35,420
So sometimes I see a guy with long hair out

987
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,820
and I'm like, that could be Peter.

988
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:37,660
- That could be Peter.

989
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,500
- He could still be alive.

990
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,300
- Sometimes I'll see a dog running around

991
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,020
and I'll be like, if that thing stood on two legs,

992
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,140
it might look a little something

993
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,020
like Peter Mayhew's famous character.

994
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,340
- I hope he yells.

995
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,420
- I put bandoliers on my dog.

996
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,660
(laughing)

997
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,900
(laughing)

998
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,780
Yeah, I don't remember this at all.

999
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,740
But I don't think I would have known about this

1000
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,380
the day after it happened either.

1001
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,820
Yeah, I don't think I was ever aware of this.

1002
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,320
I do remember this.

1003
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,180
I don't think, I was kidding when I said that.

1004
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,540
Well, you're a TMO, dude.

1005
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,700
Did you get tore up?

1006
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,460
Put the floor up?

1007
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,580
I didn't actually.

1008
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,420
No?

1009
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,240
I didn't actually enter a fugue state

1010
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,460
when Peter Mayhew died.

1011
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,580
Although, it does seem believable.

1012
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,300
Actual Brexit happened too.

1013
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,140
Yeah.

1014
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,140
Like it happened every year for like five years.

1015
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,820
Brexit keeps happening.

1016
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:29,380
As Americans trying to deal with our own dumpster fire of a country, it can be hard to keep track

1017
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:32,580
of the clusterfucks happening across the pond.

1018
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:36,620
But as recently as a year ago, the UK thought it was a good idea to officially break up with

1019
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,520
the European Union.

1020
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,980
Then the pandemic hit.

1021
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,300
We're hashtag all in this together though, right Boris?

1022
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,020
Yes, dude.

1023
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,020
Get Boris.

1024
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Get Boris.

1025
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,140
Kinda like Donald Trump's brother in some ways.

1026
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,380
Well, 'cause yeah, everybody has a British brother.

1027
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,460
It's like a doppelganger.

1028
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,900
Yeah, did you know Peter Mayhew was British?

1029
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,740
Really?

1030
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,560
Mm-hmm.

1031
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,980
The UK and America are actually sister cities,

1032
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,540
which is why that happens.

1033
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,780
Yeah.

1034
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,320
If you have sister cities, you get brother guys.

1035
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,160
Yeah.

1036
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,740
I'm like sister shitties due to the different leaders

1037
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,580
who are in charge of various nations of the world.

1038
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,540
Yeah, and the different fires going on in our dumpsters.

1039
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,940
Yeah, that's right.

1040
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,500
Parasite won the Oscar for best film.

1041
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,020
I mean, what a-- What a clusterfuck.

1042
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
- What a duster fire of a year.

1043
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,820
- Oh my God, don't they realize

1044
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,940
it's an award for American movies?

1045
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,700
- Right, they should get that award

1046
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,180
to movies with Peter Mayhew.

1047
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,820
- They should give it to Wonder Woman 1984.

1048
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,660
- True.

1049
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,260
- Yeah, now the joke's definitely fucking dead.

1050
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,780
- You think that was it, Patrick?

1051
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,820
You think that was the one that killed it?

1052
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,660
- No.

1053
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,020
(laughing)

1054
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,860
No, it's gonna come back.

1055
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,700
- Don't say killed, he'll remember

1056
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,500
that Peter Mayhew died. - Yeah, I'll think about Peter.

1057
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,840
- And he'll start laughing like a hyena.

1058
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:56,080
It's gonna come back. Yeah, no I remember when Parasite won. Yeah is that the way

1059
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:00,300
that you get out of your laugh fit is just saying that? Mm-hmm yeah I remember

1060
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:15,240
that one. Number four there were locust swarms in Africa.

1061
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:35,280
stop laughing stop I'm I'm I'm so sorry I ever do I need you need to put an

1062
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
Aspirin under your tongue, dude

1063
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,680
There's something wrong with you

1064
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:51,080
Wait didn't though didn't the locust swarms happen after we killed cuz team Soleimani

1065
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:56,380
Yeah, yeah, we did yeah, we three

1066
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,220
Yeah, yeah.

1067
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:58,820
He said, "This is prefer Peter, maybe."

1068
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:03,820
We weren't supposed to reveal that, but I just, ah, fuck.

1069
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,580
I stopped laughing.

1070
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:14,340
Wow, this is a funny, I mean,

1071
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,180
how hilarious is this fifth one?

1072
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:19,700
Harvey Weinstein was sentenced to prison for sex crimes.

1073
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,140
Wow.

1074
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,420
Yeah.

1075
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,260
It's hard to recall any justice being served in 2020,

1076
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,380
But folks, it did indeed, it did indeed,

1077
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,380
it indeed did occur in at least one case.

1078
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,580
- You think Harvey Weinstein's funny?

1079
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:40,360
- I think it's funny what--

1080
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
- What he did?

1081
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,740
- No, what's going to happen to him.

1082
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,380
- What he's going to do?

1083
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,860
- What do you think's gonna happen to him?

1084
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,660
- He's gonna kill himself in prison.

1085
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:53,140
- What, why are you laughing again?

1086
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,740
thinking about Peter Mayhew.

1087
00:40:54,740 --> 00:41:01,940
- I'm glad we're closing out the year with this one.

1088
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,440
- Just Pat laughing for 20 minutes straight.

1089
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:10,260
- Now we have something to do better than,

1090
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,700
we're lowering the bar for the end of the year.

1091
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,060
So it's easy to have a good 2021.

1092
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,180
- Yeah, it's true, that's exactly what we're doing.

1093
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,780
- With this freaking dumpster fire of an episode.

1094
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,300
Well, but Pat's just, you know,

1095
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,580
some people's reaction to the trauma of 2020

1096
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:27,420
is just laughter.

1097
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,260
- That's true.

1098
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,080
- Yeah.

1099
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,920
- Laughter can actually--

1100
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,500
- I'm kinda like the comedian from Watchmen.

1101
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,020
I think everything's a joke.

1102
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,700
- People don't realize that like giggling

1103
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,540
can actually be a sign of trauma at times.

1104
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,300
- Yeah, it's been, that's so true.

1105
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,340
- It's like a common quote among psychiatrists

1106
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,940
and like astrophysicists that like,

1107
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:55,420
The man who chuckles may be the man with the most pain.

1108
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,780
- Yeah. - It's true.

1109
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,220
- Or the woman. - Or the woman.

1110
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,740
- That was one of like-- - Mostly the woman.

1111
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,540
- That was one of Freud's archetypes.

1112
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,180
- Yeah, it was basically-- - The sad giggler.

1113
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,620
- Basically, Freud and Jung came up with this idea

1114
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:09,860
that like a clown could die.

1115
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,180
- They came up with the Pagliacci joke.

1116
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,900
- Yeah, they came up with Joker.

1117
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,660
Joker is basically the myth that Joker was based on,

1118
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,980
which was called the Greek Joker.

1119
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,180
- Yeah. (laughs)

1120
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:22,260
- Yeah.

1121
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,060
- Yeah, he was half--

1122
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,700
- He was half Greek and half Roman.

1123
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:30,620
- Yeah, his dad was Zeus and then his mom was the Joker.

1124
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,320
(laughing)

1125
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:36,540
Yeah, he was a half guy.

1126
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,180
- Basically, they won't teach you that kind of stuff

1127
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,220
in school, but they will on BuzzFeed School,

1128
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,100
which is a new section they have on their website,

1129
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,940
which you guys should check out.

1130
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,060
- That's great, kind of a Khan Academy style.

1131
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,380
You can learn different.

1132
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,100
- You can go to buzzfeed.learn

1133
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:51,740
and you can learn a lot about trauma

1134
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:54,100
and different types of laughter and why.

1135
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,020
If you recognize your family's laughter

1136
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,060
based on whether it's your mom or your dad's laughter,

1137
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,420
that could mean your mom or your dad

1138
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,760
was abusive towards each other,

1139
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,180
you or your brothers or sisters,

1140
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,440
based on whether they were laughing

1141
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,260
when they were attacking you.

1142
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,660
- If you have ever been tickled,

1143
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:08,980
it could have been a traumatic,

1144
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:10,980
you could have had trauma in your past.

1145
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,420
- Do you wanna say something back?

1146
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:15,380
- If someone touches your tummy and you giggle,

1147
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,220
it could be that you have been depressed

1148
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,660
when you were a child.

1149
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,980
- One famous case study is like Santa Claus,

1150
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,300
his bowl jiggles like a bowl of jelly.

1151
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,500
- His bowl does?

1152
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
- His balls jiggle like a bowl of jelly when he chugs.

1153
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,980
- Oh. - Yeah.

1154
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,820
- Oh God.

1155
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,380
- And you don't-- - Wait, is that a sign of trauma?

1156
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,380
- It's because-- - Santa, believing in Santa

1157
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,820
is a sign of trauma, I heard.

1158
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:39,820
- Yeah, I heard basically, you can, what is this?

1159
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,940
- What did you just send us?

1160
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:44,020
(laughing)

1161
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:46,540
- Patrick just sent us an image that is a quote

1162
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,580
by Peter Mayhew.

1163
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,840
(laughing)

1164
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,220
- This is the best thing that ever happened to me.

1165
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,220
- What is he talking about?

1166
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,060
You think he's talking about dying?

1167
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:55,900
- He's talking about dying.

1168
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,720
- I don't know.

1169
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,560
(laughing)

1170
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,060
- That's his last word.

1171
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,340
This is the best thing that has ever happened to me.

1172
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,300
- 'Cause I forced him to dress up like a dog alien for--

1173
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,140
(laughing)

1174
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:06,960
- For years.

1175
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,800
For every fucking local--

1176
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,060
- Every time, yeah.

1177
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,740
- Every Memphis Comic Con,

1178
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:14,780
he had to show up dressed up as a dog.

1179
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,020
- Every time a show on the CW wanted to do

1180
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:21,060
like a Star Wars crossover episode or like a feat,

1181
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:24,180
like they wanna do an episode that's like a Star Wars parody,

1182
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,740
they're like, "Hey, Peter Mayhew's been stuck in the suit

1183
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,820
"since the '70s."

1184
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,100
(laughing)

1185
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,940
- Yeah. - You gotta go through this.

1186
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,100
- I'm sorry, I keep looking at fucking Peter Mayhew.

1187
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,700
- Just look at us. - Stop looking at them.

1188
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:40,740
- If you worked at Google instead of for me,

1189
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:43,220
you'd be in so much, you'd be in jail right now.

1190
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,660
*laughter*

1191
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:45,500
Stop!

1192
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,380
I hate you.

1193
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:48,880
*laughter*

1194
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,020
Look at the face!

1195
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,940
With my mask, I controlled all of the mouth movements with my own mouth!

1196
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,740
*laughter*

1197
00:44:58,740 --> 00:44:59,940
It's a quote!

1198
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:01,780
It's a quote, but it's over!

1199
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:05,700
It's over like a Microsoft default background and it says "Peter Mayhew".

1200
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,200
*laughter*

1201
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,060
Wow, thank you.

1202
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:07,860
With the episode.

1203
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,740
That's so good.

1204
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,660
That's a good quote.

1205
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,780
Yeah, that is really good.

1206
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,280
Thank you for that.

1207
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,540
(laughing)

1208
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,380
- That was really amazing.

1209
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,200
- It's totally inspiring.

1210
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,040
- Well, especially, you know,

1211
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,880
he died before they made him wear another mask.

1212
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,080
- Yeah, it's true.

1213
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,160
- He had to die.

1214
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,440
Do you think he would have just worn the Chewbacca mask?

1215
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,280
- Oh yeah.

1216
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,360
- When he went to Tesco?

1217
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,720
- He would have put a COVID mask over Chewbacca's mouth.

1218
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,220
- It should be, I think this should count as a mask.

1219
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,460
(laughing)

1220
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:38,080
- Oh, he's pantomiming eating pussy.

1221
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,480
- I think doing the finger, the peace sign that you eat,

1222
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,360
whatever that's called.

1223
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,840
- Yeah, it's called Delicious Peas.

1224
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,460
- It's called Delicious Peas.

1225
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,080
(laughing)

1226
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,840
- Are you saying, yeah, I think someone did that to me.

1227
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,280
Are you saying you love peas?

1228
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:52,480
- Are you saying you wanna lick peas?

1229
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:53,920
Yeah, I heard that, brother.

1230
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,760
- Yeah.

1231
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,920
- Number six, Michael Bloomberg ran for president

1232
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,960
and they have the video Nick Ciarelli made.

1233
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,800
- Yeah, that's a--

1234
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:01,880
- That's one of the funniest videos.

1235
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,240
- That's funny that they picked that

1236
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,940
and the Buzzfeed people were like, this is so real.

1237
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,780
- Yeah.

1238
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,440
Shout out to Nick, Nick Ciarelli.

1239
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,880
- Number seven. - Great comic.

1240
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,400
- Yeah, shout out.

1241
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,040
Number seven, all the prophetic

1242
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,360
Netflix reality shows that aired.

1243
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,200
- Yeah. - You guys remember,

1244
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,440
you guys remember in January 2020

1245
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:23,560
when they had that game show, Pandemic?

1246
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:25,280
- Yes, yes.

1247
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,240
- You guys remember that game show,

1248
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,840
Murder Hornets House?

1249
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:32,360
(laughing)

1250
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,240
- Yeah, remember in 2018 when they did that show,

1251
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,780
Peter Mayhew just died?

1252
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,040
It was prophetic, dude.

1253
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,880
- Yeah.

1254
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:40,700
- It's unbelievable.

1255
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,920
- Did they do like a,

1256
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,200
let's see, Peter Mayhew Memorial.

1257
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,800
Did they do some kind of like,

1258
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:51,400
like memorial thing for him?

1259
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,240
- Yeah, at the end of the Oscars they did that.

1260
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,960
- Dude, they made a memorial coin for him.

1261
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:55,800
- Whoa.

1262
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,720
- Chew-daka.

1263
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,040
- It's a beautiful coin.

1264
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,360
- I hope someone makes a beautiful coin when I die.

1265
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,260
- It's on jedibusiness.com.

1266
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:06,840
- That's just Jedi shit, you wouldn't understand, civilian.

1267
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,480
- Check out this coin.

1268
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:11,320
- Guys, just Google the Peter Mayhew Memorial Coin.

1269
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,280
- Google Peter's Coin.

1270
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,680
- Damn, that's a sick coin.

1271
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,220
- That is a pretty sick coin.

1272
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,160
- He looks like a rock star.

1273
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,280
- Along the edge of the coin is a quote,

1274
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,280
"If I see further, it is by standing

1275
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,120
"on the shoulders of giants."

1276
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,640
- Wow, Peter Mayhew.

1277
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,940
- Peter Mayhew said that.

1278
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:29,320
- Dude, was he tall?

1279
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,620
He was really tall, right?

1280
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,040
- I don't know.

1281
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,720
- Who knows, dude?

1282
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,800
- It's impossible to tell 'cause he was in a suit.

1283
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:37,840
- True.

1284
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,700
Number nine, Australia faced, no wait, we skipped one.

1285
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:43,320
Vanessa Hudgens couldn't understand

1286
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,700
why people dying from COVID was bad.

1287
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,540
Is that true?

1288
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:47,360
- Oh, I remember that.

1289
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,960
- I don't remember any of this, bro.

1290
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,340
- Yeah, she wanted to go to Coachella so bad

1291
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,200
that she was like, well, people are gonna die anyway,

1292
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,040
so what?

1293
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:56,660
- Yeah.

1294
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:57,500
- True, dude.

1295
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,120
- Yeah, that's not the first dumpster trash fire

1296
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:01,960
she's created.

1297
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,320
Well, if you guys recall,

1298
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,840
I believe she started a little something

1299
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,300
called High School Musical.

1300
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,480
Let's go.

1301
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,440
I believe she actually broke Zac Efron's heart

1302
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,000
by having her nudes leaked.

1303
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,240
So she's kind of a bitch.

1304
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,580
Yeah, she basically took Zac Efron's virginity

1305
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,500
and like toyed with it.

1306
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,880
And then again, she allowed naked photos of herself

1307
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,180
to be hacked off her phone, so kind of a whore.

1308
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,940
Come on, man.

1309
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,780
That's facts.

1310
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:28,520
Number nine, Australia faced devastating fires,

1311
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,160
then California joined them later.

1312
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,080
I did not care at all that Australia was on fire.

1313
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,900
I did.

1314
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:35,280
I didn't care about California either.

1315
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,760
Talk about a dumpster fire, dude.

1316
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,680
Those two states to the worst.

1317
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,360
The state of Australia.

1318
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:45,020
To the worst, most liberal states in the world.

1319
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:46,360
Yeah.

1320
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,040
It's like if you didn't wanna get caught on fire,

1321
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,560
maybe, first of all, don't live in a place

1322
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,800
where fire happens.

1323
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:56,640
Number two, don't build your house out of wood.

1324
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,440
That was literally in like the Three Little Pigs story book.

1325
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,880
That was nature's retribution for that video

1326
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,080
of that guy punching the kangaroo in the face.

1327
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:06,920
- Exactly.

1328
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,760
- Yeah.

1329
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,580
- Nature had to get back.

1330
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,560
- Australian nature got made a fool of.

1331
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,400
- Yeah.

1332
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,720
- And they had to strike back.

1333
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,160
- God heard the way that Australians were saying the word no.

1334
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:17,980
- Yeah.

1335
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,560
- And he came down on them with righteous wrath.

1336
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:23,520
- Yeah, and he said, wait I thought they're already in jail.

1337
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:24,360
- Yeah.

1338
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:25,180
- Oh wait, no, well, all right,

1339
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:26,280
I guess I'll set her on fire now.

1340
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,800
- Yeah.

1341
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:29,840
- Number 10, we started the year by making

1342
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,360
LOL World War III memes.

1343
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,120
- And here's a tweet from Boss Logic.

1344
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,040
Dude, I bet this guy's a beast.

1345
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,540
Let's check out Boss Logic.

1346
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,640
He's an artist and art director.

1347
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,240
That's my favorite kind of guy.

1348
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,960
Wow, and he has a--

1349
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,600
He posted pictures of Drake and the Simpsons.

1350
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,440
Whoa.

1351
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:49,760
That's sick.

1352
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,240
That's two of the coolest things a guy could like

1353
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,000
if you're a designer, an art director.

1354
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,840
(mimicking music)

1355
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,600
I'm tired too today.

1356
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,640
Yeah, I'm so tired.

1357
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:03,960
I'm just tired, y'all.

1358
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:07,020
Our president was impeached and inquited.

1359
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,860
- Yep.

1360
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,680
- Inquited.

1361
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:10,300
What the fuck did I just say?

1362
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,940
- You skipped so much.

1363
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,020
- What?

1364
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,220
- Oh no, you didn't.

1365
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,700
My bad. - Yeah, bitch.

1366
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,200
- I just said I was tired.

1367
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,680
This video looks like an ad,

1368
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,380
that's why I thought you skipped it.

1369
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:23,940
That's why I thought you skipped something.

1370
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:25,060
- No.

1371
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,860
- 'Cause it's not even in like, it's like a--

1372
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,940
- Right, they don't even have the list.

1373
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:31,060
They have another thing on Mashable.

1374
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:32,420
- Yeah.

1375
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:34,580
Number 12, we were risking it all to watch Cats,

1376
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,900
Doolittle and Sonic the Hedgehog in theaters.

1377
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:40,240
Not, no.

1378
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,080
- No.

1379
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,980
- No, I don't remember that.

1380
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:44,340
Number 13, we thought stockpiling on toilet paper

1381
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:45,700
would save us from the virus.

1382
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,100
- That was like the worst couple weeks.

1383
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,100
- I was gonna turn myself into a mummy and just wait it out.

1384
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,020
I was gonna wrap myself in toilet paper,

1385
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,460
jump in my sarcophagus and just wake up in 2021.

1386
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:00,420
- That was the week we were smelling DVDs, dude.

1387
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,980
- Yeah. - That's true.

1388
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:02,820
- Yeah.

1389
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,500
- Yeah, we can like directly see the effect it had.

1390
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,340
- That's a good point.

1391
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:07,940
- That's also the week we were talking about,

1392
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,860
Caleb was talking about eating a dog's pussy in his sleep.

1393
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,460
- It's true, yeah.

1394
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,300
- It was normal.

1395
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:15,780
- You can directly, that was the most stressful week,

1396
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,400
and it was also, we did the most worst things.

1397
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,860
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

1398
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:24,780
Tenet was in theaters, god this sucks.

1399
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,980
- I don't remember Tenet being in theaters.

1400
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,040
- Oh yeah, we did have a Super Bowl.

1401
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:31,880
- Did we?

1402
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:32,960
- Yeah.

1403
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,800
- Dude.

1404
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,400
That's awesome.

1405
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:37,240
- Yeah.

1406
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:42,000
- Man, Jared Leto and Big Brother contestants

1407
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,600
found out about the pandemic weeks after everyone else did.

1408
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:48,440
- Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

1409
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,840
Yeah, yeah, they were all pretending.

1410
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,680
I actually just found out, I've just been,

1411
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,520
I've been in my house, so I didn't notice.

1412
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,800
- I wish he fucking stayed in that desert facility.

1413
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,640
- That's right!

1414
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:01,560
- Yeah, I hate, I think--

1415
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:03,120
- Buddy, go back to it.

1416
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,520
- Go back to the desert.

1417
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:05,360
- Go back to the desert.

1418
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:06,680
Well, he's studying, he's doing,

1419
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,360
he's gonna play Gandhi next year.

1420
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,640
- Are you not gonna watch Morbius, the Living Vampire?

1421
00:52:11,640 --> 00:52:13,240
You're not excited for that?

1422
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,200
- He's getting into character, dude.

1423
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,000
- I fucking hate that guy, I think, more than any.

1424
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,840
I don't think I hate celebrity more than him.

1425
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,680
- I think he's swaggy.

1426
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,520
- Fight Club is such a good movie

1427
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,360
'cause they beat the shit out of him.

1428
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:24,520
- Yeah, 'cause he gets the fucking shit kicked out of him.

1429
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,600
- That's such genius casting, dude.

1430
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:31,440
- I think he seems like one of those guys

1431
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,840
that makes women sign an NDA when he has sex with them.

1432
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,320
- That's like all famous guys.

1433
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,760
- That's true, but his is a scroll.

1434
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,600
- Yeah.

1435
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,480
(laughing)

1436
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,000
- Yeah, you have to use a quill.

1437
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:44,840
You have to sign it.

1438
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:49,400
You have to prick your thumb and put blood on it.

1439
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,760
- Yeah, and then the scroll just vanishes

1440
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,600
in a puff of smoke.

1441
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:53,640
- Yeah.

1442
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:56,200
- And he goes, "Ee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee-hee."

1443
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,280
- Yeah.

1444
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,960
- My warlock will be contacting you

1445
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,120
if you breach this NDA.

1446
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:01,720
(laughing)

1447
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,400
You won't be hearing from my warlock.

1448
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,240
Yeah.

1449
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,480
(laughing)

1450
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,440
Number 17, Trump praised the coronavirus opinions

1451
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,240
of a doctor who believes there are demons in sperm.

1452
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,200
That was awesome.

1453
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,040
That was pretty cool.

1454
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,760
That was fucking sick.

1455
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,600
This is like the first year that I realized

1456
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,140
that doctors are just crazy.

1457
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:22,980
Yeah, most doctors are stupid people.

1458
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:25,040
I feel like there were so many doctors like this

1459
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,940
who just started talking about,

1460
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:30,220
- Just became like public figures out of nowhere.

1461
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:31,060
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1462
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:31,900
- And then it would come up like, yeah,

1463
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:35,900
they have, they like turned their kid into a dog.

1464
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:36,900
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1465
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:37,740
- Yeah.

1466
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,700
- They walk their kid on a leash.

1467
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:41,460
- Public figure doctors are always the most evil people.

1468
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,620
- Oh yeah. - Definitely.

1469
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:45,100
- 'Cause they don't give a shit about the medicine.

1470
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,940
- They don't give a shit about the hypnocratic oath.

1471
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,780
- Exactly. - Which is,

1472
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:50,780
all doctors and nurses, we've talked about this,

1473
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,780
they're cowards and they're bad people.

1474
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:55,860
- You should talk to a nurse or a doctor,

1475
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:58,380
you should talk to them, you should look down on them.

1476
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,700
You should talk to them with disdain in your voice.

1477
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:03,780
You should talk to them like you just found

1478
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:06,020
a dog with no legs in a dumpster,

1479
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:09,100
and it ate your trash and you're mad at it.

1480
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,820
That's the tone of voice to use.

1481
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,960
- Here's what a lot of people don't realize.

1482
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,300
You know what the beginning salary for a nurse is

1483
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,960
in any city in America?

1484
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,800
- One dollar.

1485
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,220
- A million dollars.

1486
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,060
- Really?

1487
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,900
- They're all millionaires.

1488
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:21,740
- I was way off.

1489
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:22,820
- They're all millionaires.

1490
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:26,580
And you know what, they get paid state taxes.

1491
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,420
But only from people who make less than 50 grand a year.

1492
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,540
All of their taxes go to nurses.

1493
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:33,380
Yeah.

1494
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,140
Yeah, so next time you feel bad for these sickos

1495
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,480
and these freaks, just remember they like it.

1496
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,020
You know how long their lunch break is?

1497
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,340
All day.

1498
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,260
Yeah.

1499
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,540
They don't even have a job.

1500
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:43,460
Yeah.

1501
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,980
They get paid to just dress that stupid.

1502
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,180
All they have to do is wear a pager.

1503
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,020
Yeah.

1504
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,060
And they don't have to answer it,

1505
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,420
they just have to wear it.

1506
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,260
Nope.

1507
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:56,820
for technically. Yep. All the other stuff is just because they choose to do it. Like if

1508
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:01,060
they put a needle in you, they just feel like needling someone. If they save anybody, it's

1509
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:05,740
completely accidental. And that's the truth. It's all luck. Yeah, the only thing that can

1510
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:09,500
save you every few days is fire. If a doctor saves a guy, it's just because he wants to

1511
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:17,380
get back to his sandwich. Exactly, yeah. His DVR is fucked up, and so he can't record Seinfeld,

1512
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:18,580
He's gotta get back.

1513
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,900
- Exactly. - Yeah.

1514
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:20,740
- That's the truth.

1515
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:22,480
- But if he lets someone die, it's on purpose.

1516
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,020
- Yes, exactly.

1517
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,620
Number 19, Kanye West not only ran for president,

1518
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:29,700
but was endorsed by Chance the Rapper and Elon Musk.

1519
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,100
- Oh, we skipped-- - What?

1520
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,340
I'm sick of this freak, Kanye.

1521
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,300
- We skipped Andrew Cuomo's nipples.

1522
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,620
- Well, I don't wanna talk about a man's nipples

1523
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,460
on the show.

1524
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,980
That's a-- - That's crass.

1525
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,700
- That's too far, that's crass,

1526
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:43,420
and it will ruin my edging streak.

1527
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:50,060
Kanye ran for president sure oh yeah he gifted Kim Kardashian a hologram of her

1528
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:55,100
own dead dad that shit is so sick that was the funniest fucking thing I think

Nobody remembered 4/20 and it wasn't

00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,500
because we were too high.

1561
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,820
What was it then?

1562
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,140
4/20 was a sad state of affairs this year

1563
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,820
as stoners everywhere grappled with unknown risk factors

1564
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,900
of smoking during the pandemic.

1565
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:31,740
I don't think--

1566
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,500
Mashable think people stop smoking weed during the pandemic

1567
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:44,300
Yeah, dude, I I've been completely clean and I haven't done any drugs this whole year yeah because I got scared

Bolivian orchestra was trapped in a castle by way

1573
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:10,420
That's actually a cool bit of news, okay, maybe this is the best year of all time

1574
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:15,100
Number 25 Chris Evans doxed his own dick what?

1575
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,020
What you don't know what doxing means?

1576
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:22,220
Nobody does anymore means you should just mean like post your personal information now

1577
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:25,700
It just means that if you say somebody's first name, would you yeah?

You have to dox it for me.

1593
00:59:58,700 --> 01:00:00,700

1594
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,700
You have to dox the chef.

01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,700

Oh yeah, she was the one with the crazy shaped face.

1599
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,700
She's so beautiful.

1600
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,700
She had the weird cheekbones.

1601
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:16,700
I publicly proposed to her.

1602
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,700
It was kind of funny that that was,

1603
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,700
I remember that, that people thought he was dead for a minute.

1604
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,700
Yeah. That was pretty funny.

1605
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:24,700
It's cool. It's true.

1606
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,700
Yeah, him faking his own death

1607
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,100
to see who was loyal to him.

1608
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:31,780
That's, he's the Kevin Gates of rulers.

1609
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:33,740
- I think I'm having a heart attack right now.

1610
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,580
- Yeah?

1611
01:00:34,580 --> 01:00:36,580
- Yeah, do you guys feel loyal to me?

1612
01:00:36,580 --> 01:00:39,380
- Yes. - Yes.

1613
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:41,020
- I'm so loyal, Cameron. - Maybe.

1614
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:42,060
- What? - I'm so sad

1615
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,140
that you're having a--

1616
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:44,060
- Well, guess what, Cameron?

1617
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,220
I'm alive and I wasn't having a heart attack.

1618
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:47,580
- I didn't say no.

1619
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,140
- And next couple times I see you,

1620
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:51,820
I'm gonna be, I might be a little rude.

1621
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:53,780
- Damn, you're rude all the time to me.

1622
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,660
- Whoa, best friend, slow it.

1623
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:57,500
- That's true.

1624
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,780
- Number 27, people honest to God believed

1625
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:02,740
in a baseless conspiracy theory about wayfair sex traffic

1626
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:03,580
in children through cat.

1627
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:04,420
- Okay, baseless?

1628
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:05,380
- Yeah, that was--

1629
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:07,540
- I hope that the further down on this list we get,

1630
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,800
it is like, yeah, people honest to God believed

1631
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,460
in a child sex ring run by Jeffrey Epstein.

1632
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,060
Honestly, these fucking internet freaks.

1633
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,500
- Dude, it's fucking, we're not even halfway

1634
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:19,020
through this list.

1635
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:19,860
- Oh Christ.

1636
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:20,700
- Oh my God.

1637
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,740
- And we're over an hour.

1638
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:23,060
All right, speed run it.

1639
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:23,880
- All right.

1640
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:24,720
- We're not even halfway through this year.

1641
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,960
- Okay, we'll take turns, lightning round, okay?

1642
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:27,800
- All right.

1643
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,680
- The multi-billion dollar Mulan live action remake

1644
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,440
premiered on Disney Plus, don't care.

1645
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:32,280
- It wasn't good.

1646
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,760
- Giselaine Maxwell was arrested.

1647
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,280
(laughing)

1648
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:39,120
- That's a great one-two punch, just an ad and then.

1649
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,080
(laughing)

1650
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,200
- All right, Patrick, go.

1651
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,600
- Trump claimed he was banning TikTok

1652
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:46,040
like seven different times and just forgot about it.

1653
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,420
- Didn't he do it?

1654
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,260
Did he not do it?

1655
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:49,620
Can't you not download it or something?

1656
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,100
I don't know, I don't go on TikTok.

1657
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:52,600
- Everything was cake, we will never trust again.

1658
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:54,240
- No, we're taking turns, Patrick.

1659
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,240
What do you not understand about taking turns?

1660
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,560
Everything was cake, everything was cake and we will never trust again.

1661
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,040
Yeah, because the cake is a lie.

1662
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,040
Twitter got hacked.

1663
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,480
Oh yeah, remember when blue checks couldn't tweet?

1664
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:06,480
That was funny.

1665
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,480
Yeah.

1666
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,840
Carol Baskin was a contestant on Dancing with the Stars.

1667
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:10,840
Oh my god.

1668
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,840
Is that true?

1669
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:12,840
Oh my god!

1670
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,840
Okay, stop the list.

1673
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:19,200
Did she really dress up like a lion?

1674
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,440
Why is she dressed up like a lion?

1675
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:23,600
This is the wrong fucking cat, you bitch.

1676
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:36,160
Fuck you. Oh my God. Go to hell you bitch. Get that gay guy out of jail. Go to hell.

Fuck you. A whole bunch of famous people got COVID that you totally forgot about. Trump

1678
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:49,800
bragged about passing a base of cognitive test. Pat, you're terrible at this bro. Patrick,

1679
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,920
I can't believe you.

1680

01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,760
- That's you.

1684
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,040
Quibi launched, then shut down only six months

1685
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,920
and 1.75 billion dollars later.

1686
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,040
That is, I'm really, Quibi is one of the funniest things

1687
01:03:07,040 --> 01:03:07,860
from this year for sure.

1688
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:11,520
- I think you guys were talking about,

1689
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,920
I think it's an episode without me,

1690
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,400
but I think you guys talked about

1691
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,520
how it was gonna shut down.

1692
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:17,360
- Quibi?

1693
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,200
- Yeah.

1694
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:21,120
- That's not an impressive prediction though.

1695
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,240
- That's true, yeah.

1696
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,800
- Yeah, I think that was like from the beginning

1697
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,680
people said that.

1698
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:25,740
- Yeah.

1699
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:28,160
- No, the only, the most impressive prediction this year

1700
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:30,840
was Cameron said that Nancy Pelosi was a ho-tip

1701
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,160
and then she wore the--

1702
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,000
- The kente cloth. - The kente cloth, yeah.

1703
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,640

01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,800
- I'm a prophet.

1706
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:38,640
- You are.

1707
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:41,600
I have to pee, we can't finish this.
