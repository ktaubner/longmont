1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
*Badass music*

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,140
*Ding*

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,640
*Ding*

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,140
*Ding*

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:12,440
That was a brolic ass clap.

6
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,440
What does brolic mean again? I thought it meant cold.

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:14,940
Strong.

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,440
Strong.

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,440
I think I'm saying it right too.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,440
Brolic?

11
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
It's not brolic. Yeah, it's brolic.

12
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,440
Brolic ass clap.

13
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,440
I'll lick a bra right now.

14
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,440
You'll lick the bra on the Forest Avenue stop.

15
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,440
You seen that one? New York, stand up!

16
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,280
- New York, stand the fuck up!

17
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,120
- What are you talking about?

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,440
- Forest Ave M train stop, there's been a bra there

19
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,480
for months in a tree.

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,160
- And you think that's hot?

21
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,600
- A tree wearing a bra?

22
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,400
- No, something really bad probably happened.

23
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,920
For a bra to get all the way up there,

24
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,520
somebody was confused, somebody thought it was a Mardi Gras.

25
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,400
- I'm thinking of a tree wearing a bra,

26
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,880
I don't know what kind of thing you're thinking of.

27
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,920
- I'm thinking that somebody got confused

28
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,520
and took their bra off.

29
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,360
- What if they took their bra off?

30
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,280
- What if the guys started getting undressed

31
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,080
thinking that they were in their house?

32
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,760
What if it was a blind woman?

33
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,600
- Yeah.

34
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,440
- And a blind woman felt the tree and she said,

35
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,880
"This feels exactly like my closet."

36
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,240
- There's a clothesline on that station.

37
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,840
- Well then you're burying the fucking lead.

38
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,120
Wait, at the station, who lives in the,

39
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,960
somebody lives in the train.

40
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,080
- There's a clothesline on the windows.

41
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:17,920
- Oh.

42
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,760
- You've seen this one.

43
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,580
- No.

44
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,420
- You've been to that stop?

45
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:22,360
- Not every day, bro.

46
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,560
Not every fucking day.

47
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,400
- Speaking of.

48
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,220
- It's every day, bro.

49
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,060
- It's every day, bro.

50
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,900
- Speaking of every day.

51
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,720
I've been listening to some--

52
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,920
Let's get some primes.

53
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,680
I've been listening to some--

54
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
Let's pause right now.

55
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,880
No.

56
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,800
They're hard to find, dude.

57
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,640
They're really hard to find in New York.

58
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,280
What are you talking about?

59
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,040
I can't find them anywhere.

60
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,320
I find them fucking everywhere.

61
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,200
OK, well hook me up with a line on a prime,

62
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,360
because I really like a popsicle flavor.

63
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,840
There's one by my apartment.

64
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,340
Really?

65
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,000
Bodega.

66
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,920
I think-- do they have the red, white, and blue one?

67
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,080
I've seen it around.

68
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,240
I've been pretty obsessed with Jake Paul's music,

69
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,880
or Logan Paul's music recently.

70
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,880
he has a song called 2020, Fuck You 2020 or something.

71
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:00,880
- I haven't heard that one.

72
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,700
- You never heard that?

73
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,540
- No.

74
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,920
- Oh my God, it's good.

75
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,000
Can you pull that up?

76
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,840
- Can we see this one?

77
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,640
- Can you pull up Fuck You 2020?

78
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,160
- Fuck You 2020 by Offbeat?

79
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,240
- It might not be called Fuck You.

80
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,080
- There is a--

81
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,920
- That's the, I would say that's her--

82
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,320
- There are a lot of songs called Fuck You 2020 out there.

83
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,800
- I would say that is more the theme of the song.

84
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,640
- Logan Paul 2020.

85
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,480
- It's just called 2020.

86
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,300
Of course it's just called 2020.

87
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,140
- Okay, let's hear this.

88
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,760
- But basically he tackles a lot of,

89
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,600
Do you remember how shitty that year was, bro?

90
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,760
Bro, don't even.

91
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,760
I went through the worst breakup of my life.

92
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,020
(laughing)

93
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,360
Yeah, it really did.

94
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,520
It was bad, dude.

95
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,560
2020 was not chill at all.

96
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,400

- Yeah, so he basically-- - Coachella got,

112

dude, this is literally 9/11.

113
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,560

Logan Paul, and his friends. - Yeah, it was pretty bad,

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,260
Speaking of the Coachella lineup this year.

117
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,040
- Did it get lit? - My friend, the Kid Leroy.

118

(both laughing)

119
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
- We should link up with the Kid Leroy.

120
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,440
- I've been trying, dude, I've been trying to get him

121
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,000
on the pod. - He did Adam 22,

122
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,360
he'll do us. - Yeah?

123
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,280
- Yeah, dude, we're way fucking cooler than Adam 22.

124
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,120
I got tattoos, you look like Lena the Plug.

125
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,460
If we put a skim on you.

126
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,360
- I got tattoos.

127
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,700
- If we put skims on you. - I have two tattoos.

128
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,640
Three tattoos, I have the Dr. Evil one here

129
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,560
and then the Spider-Web.

130
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,500
- Okay, what do you want, a fucking ink award?

131
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,300
- I wanna get more, I wanna ink my whole body,

132
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,720
I don't give a motherfucker.

133
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,960
- Dude, if you-- - Remember that song?

134
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,360
- No. - You remember Snapbacks

135
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,040
and tattoos? - Bro, if you get--

136
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,240
- That's what I'm trying to be on, wait.

137
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,760
- I don't wanna see you covered in,

138
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,040
that would break my heart.

139
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,500
I regret every tattoo I have.

140
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,340
I look like a fucking--

141
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,620
- You don't think this looks sick?

142
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,460
- No, that does look sick.

143
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,740
The snapback is a good look on you.

144
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,460
I like this, I've always liked the snapback on you.

145
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,900
- Wait.

146
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,740
- The tattoo, you gotta roll both up

147
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,700
or people know what you're doing.

148
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,660
- I only have one tattoo.

149
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,340
- I know, but you gotta roll both sleeves up.

150
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,180
- I got two.

151
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,420
- No, you're not--

152
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,340
- Imagine, okay, imagine like a moody,

153
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,220
black and white photo of me like this.

154
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,980
- That might be--

155
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,260
- I look like Wiz.

156
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,360
- Okay, well that'd be cool.

157
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,520
- Yeah, and then you could do like,

158
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,480
O-W-G-I-A-F-C, that could be your album.

159
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,520
- What's my, what's that?

160
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,960
- Only White Guy in First Class.

161
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,440
(laughing)

162
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,280
You could do that.

163
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,520
That would be cool.

164
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,360
- Yeah.

165
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
- That would be cool. - That would be cool.

166
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,240
- Yeah.

167
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,060
- I think that's the type of shit

168
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:38,960
I'm trying to be on this year.

169
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,280
I'm trying to bring back like a 2014 style swag,

170
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,640
or 2013 style swag.

171
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,800
- I would say you have a 2013 style,

172
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,080
you've never left that world.

173
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:48,920
- No, dude.

174
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,760
You got okay you guys made fun of me for my hat that I've been wearing

175
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,640
You know my birthday on the 50 year old head is terrible, okay?

176
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,960
You've been making fun of me for that, and I'm gonna say it cuz mommy's gone

177
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,960
And he's not here to defend himself so I had to talk shit about camera

178
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,200
Yeah, I'm about to talk shit about a hat that he's worn for a long time. It's the golden retriever hat is no

179
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,920
It's a different one or whatever when we first started the podcast and he had a hat that said pog

180
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,020
Mmm, damn.

181
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,840
And he wore that every fucking day.

182
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,480
Yo, get him.

183
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,320
Uh-huh.

184
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,160
Yo, that was whack.

185
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,440
He wore that every single day.

186
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,400
Do me now.

187
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,480
What do I wear that's poop?

188
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,320
You used to have hair.

189
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,800
Yeah, that's some real shit.

190
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,200
No, you're not gonna find this hat.

191
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,040
You're not gonna find it, no.

192
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,240
This is before we took photos, man.

193
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,840
I think you might be able to find that hat.

194
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,520
Cameron used to be such a pretty lady

195
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,720
back when we first started dating.

196
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,880
Now he looks like a man.

197
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,120
When we first started dating?

198
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:44,960
Or first--

199
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,220
(laughing)

200
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,720
- When he first started.

201
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,960
- This is Cameron?

202
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,320
- Yeah.

203
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,800
Wow, he looks good.

204
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,640
Guys, if you couldn't tell.

205
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,120
- That was a hand embroidered hat by himself, I think.

206
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,960
- Yeah, it is.

207
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,560
- Wait, look at that fucking ice cream photo.

208
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,820
(laughing)

209
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,480
- That's of me though.

210
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,720
(laughing)

211
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
That's an awful photo.

212
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,720
- You look like an uncle in that show Dinosaurs

213
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,320
- Yeah, it does look very lizard-y.

214
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,200
Guys, if you couldn't tell, Mommy is completely gone.

215
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,520
There's no Mommy anywhere to be seen.

216
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,360
- Mommy's gone.

217
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,280
- Wait, wait, where's Mommy?

218
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,120
Is Mommy not down here?

219
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,160
- Mommy don't know that Mommy's gone.

220
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,000
- Mm-hmm, keep going.

221
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,160
- And Mommy's gone.

222
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,980
- No.

223
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,800
- It's the third time we've done this.

224
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,880
- Mommy don't know that her sons are on,

225
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
on the podcast now, and she's in Mexico.

226
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,160
- Mexicali.

227
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,320
- Mexicali.

228
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,880
- He went to Tijuana 'cause he was gonna be

229
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,840
in a donkey show. - Mommy don't know.

230
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,120
- He's not in a donkey show.

231
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
Wait, one of the ones where they get a fucker,

232
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,760
they fuck a, they get a donkey fuck.

233
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,600
- He's the donkey.

234
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,500
- Oh, well that'd be lucky then.

235
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,920
'Cause don't you fuck a lady?

236
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,120
Isn't that the whole point of the donkey shows?

237
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,520
You get the hottest lady. - I thought that it was

238
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,360
reversed.

239
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,520
- No, they get like a-- - I thought that it's

240
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,080
a guy fucking a donkey.

241
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,320
- A female donkey?

242
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,420
- Yeah. - What's the fun of that?

243
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,280
Nobody likes, nobody wants to see that.

244
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,120
- You don't know that.

245
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,940
- I do know that.

246
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,400
Nobody wants to see, even Mr. Hands,

247
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,220
he's even the one where the guy is fucking an animal,

248
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,860
The guy gets fucked by the animal.

249
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,780
- Did you know Mr. Hands, the video of him getting fucked,

250
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,060
that's not when he died.

251
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,900
- No, he didn't die, no.

252
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,340
- That was a success. - He was fine.

253
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,160
He was fine. - That video is a success.

254
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,000
That's not the snuff one.

255
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,740
- That is an amazing success.

256
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,900
- But then there was another one, they deleted the tape

257
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,340
where it was like, used as evidence or something.

258
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,460
- Yeah, probably both of those.

259
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,940
- Yeah, probably.

260
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,740
- Yeah, used as evidence against the horse.

261
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,460
- Yeah, they were like, this horse is a murderer.

262
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,300
- Yeah, it's a horse.

263
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,980
- This horse is a murdering piece of shit.

264
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,260
- What do they do with the horse?

265
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,180
Is that horse at a petting zoo now?

266
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,220
Is that horse giving little kids

267
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:45,900
like their first riding lesson?

268
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,900
- They probably took that horse to horse therapy.

269
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,960
- The horse doesn't know that it fucking killed a guy

270
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,420
with its massive cock, right?

271
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,700
- I think it knew.

272
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,540
- Maybe.

273
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,660
- I think that that horse was like,

274
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,940
all right, they keep making me--

275
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,940
- You thought it was on purpose.

276
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,180
You thought it was premeditated.

277
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:01,900
- That horse had a look in its eyes.

278
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,180
I've never seen Mr. Hans.

279
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,180
That's the one I haven't seen.

280
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,420
I've seen pretty much all of those.

281
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,140
- I've seen almost none of the ones where people get hurt.

282
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,860
I've never seen the one guys one jar. I've never seen the two guys and a hammer

283
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,360
I've never that's the one that my neighbor showed me when I was a factory or whatever you watch two guys with a hammer when you

284
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,180
Were one nine or nine yeah my neighbor

285
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,120
Not like he used to make works bombs

286
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,740
Well one in a bottle you put all the aluminum foil with the works clean. Yes. Yes. Yes, I'm familiar

287
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,180
he used to make those and then he was a kid in the neighborhood who had the dune buggy and

288
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,660
He took by the way when you say neighbor

289
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:42,880
I think me and everybody else is listening when you say I was a kid and my neighbor showed me

290
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm thinking grown man. He was my sister's age so when I was nine. He was four years older than me, so he was 13

291
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,740
Yeah, he's a kid oh he's old in my head

292
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,900
So it's not his fault that he like showed you something crazy like you know no I didn't think he thought it was

293
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:02,320
He died is gonna impress you yeah, yeah

294
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,160
- Yeah, he was like the dune buggy kid.

295
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,820
- My version of that is that I saw the Scary Maze game.

296
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,660
- Yeah.

297
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,920
- And that honestly, probably--

298
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,760
- That's not as fucked up.

299
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,040
Two guys, one hammer is just a snuff film.

300
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,360
- It's a Scary Maze game, it's probably--

301
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,280
- It's a scary enough film.

302
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,120
- I think that's a dead body.

303
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,720
I think that's a real photo of a dead body

304
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
on a Scary Maze game.

305
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,720
So, explain that.

306
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,480
And also the scream is probably also taken

307
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
from a woman being killed.

308
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,600
- The scream, it's like a blowout situation.

309
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,140
Exactly where they recorded that scream from an actual dying. Yeah, I think that's true. Yeah. Oh damn. I'm sorry if you haven't seen blowout

310
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:45,640
You spoiled the I spoiled the whole movie. I don't think that's a whole movie. That's the ending of blowout really

311
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,680
I haven't seen it. I only row I fucking spoiled it you did spoil it for me. I'm not such a good movie that Michael, man

312
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:57,140
No, that is Brian Brad to Paul or Brian Brian did blah blah yeah, Tommy De Palma. There's a dragon Nona

313
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,960
Let's make that a movie.

314
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
- What's "Streg-a-Nona"?

315
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,320
- It's a book about a nona who keeps making a bunch of pasta.

316
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,440
- I wanna slag your nona.

317
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,840
- You're not gonna streg my nona.

318
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,880
- No, I wanna slag her.

319
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,720
- Slag my nona?

320
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,640
- I wanna slag her, your mom.

321
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,280
- Slag? - Your nona.

322
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,440
- Slag is F, right?

323
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,880
- I think slag is F.

324
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,580
- Okay. - Yeah.

325
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,720
- All right, you're gonna F my grandma?

326
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,280
- It's about what I'm getting at, yeah.

327
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,440
- We're gonna put this in American English,

328
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,960
you're gonna F my grandma.

329
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm not as comfortable saying it in--

330
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,760
In Samuel Adams English.

331
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,760
I'll say it in the King's English all day.

332
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,640
But in Sam Adams English--

333
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,680
In Washington's English, I'm not as comfortable saying it.

334
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,400
No.

335
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,040
I'll say it in Spanish.

336
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,440
Yeah.

337
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:49,920
Su abuelita es mi comerculo.

338
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,760
Yeah, exactly.

339
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,560
[LAUGHTER]

340
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,800
[INAUDIBLE]

341
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:55,760
Yeah.

342
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,600
What the hell?

343
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,800
That would be so disrespectful.

344
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,880
Is there constantly a bar falling on you

345
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,960
on this side of the table?

346
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,920
Yeah, do you ever see me fucking complain about anything?

347
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:03,920
No. No.

348
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,620
Well, I have a nail that I play with.

349
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,540
Is that what you're always,

350
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:08,840
I always think you're touching your penis.

351
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,400
No, I'm just touching the tip of the nail.

352
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,240
Really?

353
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,880
Wow, I have to do something about that.

354
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,520
That is really sharp. I see my thumb.

355
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,440
Oh my God!

356
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,400
Well, that's from grip tape, but.

357
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,120
Oh, okay, well don't show to me,

358
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,720
like don't say you see my thumb.

359
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,680
It's calloused enough that I can just touch that

360
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,320
with my thumb and nothing happens.

361
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,080
There is a few times where it has punctured it,

362
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,980
and I don't know if, you can probably

363
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,820
scrabble back through a couple episodes.

364
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,080
- You probably go like, ow!

365
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,920
I thought you--

366
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,980
- There's a few where I go like.

367
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,760
- I thought you felt something good

368
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,600
about your balls or your penis.

369
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,420
- No, no, no, no.

370
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,260
- So you did that.

371
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,080
- I am fully putting my thumb on that nail.

372
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,440
- That's not so smart, Patrick.

373
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,280
I'm gonna be putting my nose--

374
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,880
- No, but it's in front of me, so I have to touch it.

375
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,760
- And if you guys are wondering,

376
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,200
I went today with the Unsweetened Bold green tea.

377
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,920
- Okay, that's the stuff my girlfriend drinks.

378
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,320
- I never tried this one before.

379
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,220
This, I think, is probably gonna keep me up all night,

380
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,520
so I'm a little bit worried about it.

381
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,040
- I went with the Monster Sunrise,

382
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,400
which has a little bit more caffeine than a usual monster.

383
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,480
This has 165.

384
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,880
- What's something that when Mummy is here,

385
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,360
she looks down on?

386
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,640
- Well, talking about the visual stuff.

387
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,920
- Well, yeah, but we already did that,

388
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,760
and now that I think about it,

389
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,800
it's probably not a good idea.

390
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
- Yeah, it's definitely not a good idea.

391
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,760
- What is a topic that Mummy always shuts down

392
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,840
because she maybe thinks it's too obtuse?

393
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
That's a word she would use.

394
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,360
- Yeah. - Yeah.

395
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,720
- I don't even know.

396
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,280
- What does mummy not like? - I can't put myself

397
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,440
in mummy's clothes.

398
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,320
- It's too, well, we do that when she's gone.

399
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,160
- Yeah, when mummy's gone. - We've been doing it

400
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,040
basically the whole weekend that she's been out of town

401
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,880
on a work trip.

402
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,600
- Oh my God, yeah, I wear her pog hat.

403
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,440
- Yeah.

404
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,700
(laughing)

405
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,320
Yeah.

406
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,000
- Was that, is that on this one or did we delete that part?

407
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,520
- By the way, when Cameron isn't here,

408
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,400
we instantly fail all the time

409
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,720
because of your five minutes of the video.

410
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,120
- Somehow we have a five minute episode

411
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,720
that is just never gonna see the light of day.

412
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,040
- So that was mummy's gone three,

413
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,880
So this is four now.

414
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,700
- This is four.

415
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,760
- This is four already, so we'll call it Mummy's Gone Four.

416
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,640
- Yeah.

417
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,440
We have a five minute Mummy's Gone Three.

418
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,960
- Yeah, probably won't ever see the light of day.

419
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,560
It was mostly us trying to figure out,

420
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,200
I was mostly adjusting levels and looking at pictures.

421
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,840
But we got that out of the way.

422
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,580
And now we're back in a real podcast.

423
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:12,360
Let's talk about, let's rate all the girls we know.

424
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,440
(laughing)

425
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,640
That would piss Mummy off so bad.

426
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,480
- Yeah.

427
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,520
Just girls that we have never had on the podcast.

428
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,020
No, girls that we barely even have talked to.

429
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:24,860
We don't like--

430
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,180
We've met a couple times.

431
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,100
Yeah, met once or twice.

432
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,680
Yeah, and let's just say like five.

433
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,760
Out of five?

434
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,600
No, out of 10.

435
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,060
Let's just like randomly to these girls.

436
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,060
Out of 100.

437
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,460
Say like five or four.

438
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,580
I don't think we should do that.

439
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,420
You know what?

440
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,700
You know what we can do?

441
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,220
We can rate the guys though.

442
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,960
I do have, because mommy's gone.

443
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
Yeah.

444
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,080
Okay, I do have something for you.

445
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,060
What the hell, what is it?

446
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,660
I saw this at the store today. I was out. I was on a shopping spree.

447
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,160
Okay.

448
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,960
I don't remember...

449
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
With her credit card?

450
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,160
With mommy's credit card.

451
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,760
Bro, chill.

452
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,960
I don't remember if...

453
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,560
We already talked about my shopping spree.

454
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
You went on a shopping spree.

455
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,460
I went on a shopping spree.

456
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,860
You got skateboards, so it's not that important.

457
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,260
Yeah, not really important at all.

458
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,660
What's important is that I went on a shopping spree.

459
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,860
I saw this thing.

460
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,060
Okay.

461
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
You're making me so nervous, man.

462
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,380
I looked at it and I said to myself immediately,

463
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,540
"This is so Caleb."

464
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,300
- I was really-- - It's not even funny.

465
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,540
- I really was hoping that you would say,

466
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,460
when you said that you looked at it, you said something,

467
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,340
I was really hoping it would be, "This is so Caleb."

468
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,260
Because I've never had anybody give me something

469
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:38,620
and say, "I wanted to buy this because it's so you."

470
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,900
So I'm actually getting, I'm almost tearing up at the--

471
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,460
- Okay, close your eyes, close your eyes.

472
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,300
- Okay, my eyes are closed.

473
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,120
Okay, should I hold my hands out?

474
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,780
Or will it even fit in my hands?

475
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,660
- Yeah.

476
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,160
Okay.

477
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,660
Just put that...

478
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,660
Just gonna want to just put it on.

479
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,660
I'll just put it on first?

480
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,160
Yeah.

481
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,660
Okay.

482
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Now...

483
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,660
Oh! Wait!

484
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:03,660
Mm-hmm.

485
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
That's my initials!

486
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
That is his initials.

487
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,160
CB!

488
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:07,660
Uh-huh.

489
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
That is so dope!

490
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,660
I saw this and I was like, "Yep."

491
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,660
I love this!

492
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
Uh-huh.

493
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,660
I love this!

494
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,660
This is amazing!

495
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,140
Yeah, I love this. Why don't you change hats?

496
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:26,380
Take the hat off and take the earth take your your on the hat under off and then change it to the new one

497
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:29,220
See now everyone will know

498
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:36,340
You wearing this and they're gonna be like wait who that who that? Oh, that's a way that CP coming down the street

499
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:42,340
You know I'm seeing CP everywhere there. He's over there. He's over. He's all around the city. I was just watching CP on Twitch

500
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,340
Yeah, exactly

501
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:46,580
(laughing)

502
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:59,100
- Damn, CP just popped up on Instagram Live.

503
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,140
Just tap in, dude.

504
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:04,540
- We have to tap in.

505
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,660
- CP and PE Doran.

506
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,740
CP and PE Do are just.

507
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,980
(laughing)

508
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,240
- They're just chillin'.

509
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,580
- They're chillin' on Rumble.

510
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,340
(laughing)

511
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:27,100
- I just saw CP and PE going over on Triller.

512
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,860
I just saw them on Triller.

513
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,800
- CP on Periscope, that's me.

514
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,640
(laughing)

515
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,780
If you ever see me pop up on Periscope,

516
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,400
you'll be going, "Mom, I just saw CP on Periscope

517
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,060
"and it was fucking amazing."

518
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,540
Man, I bought that and the lady behind the counter

519
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,260
at the store that I bought that.

520
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,460
She said, "Oh, Caleb Bitts."

521
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:52,540
I put the first item down, my new Crocs.

522
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,380
But those--

523
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,200
That's how you do it?

524
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,320
You put one item down at a time

525
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,980
and then you build to the funniest one as you go?

526
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,800
No.

527
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,640
How do you do it?

528
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,340
I was just, I just put it down.

529
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,940
She picked them up and went, "Oh my God, I love these."

530
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,380
And then picked that up and looked at it

531
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,860
and went and just put it in a bag and just stopped talking.

532
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,980
Wow.

533
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,460
How much was this hat?

534
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:17,680
I don't even want to say it was way too much. Yeah, I was worth it cuz I wrote badass initials guess

535
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,780
Guess how much this is guess how much it is $11

536
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,780
More than that you spent on my CP hat

537
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,100
15

538
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,000
20 no way you're joking 25

539
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,180
30

540
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:35,600
No 35 40 50

541
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,820
60

542
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,660
- 55? - 58.

543
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,220
- This hat was $58? - Mm-hmm.

544
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,480
(laughing)

545
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,360
- I can't believe I believed that.

546
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,300
I was like, it feels nice, it feels like a nice hat.

547
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,420
- That hat was like $7.

548
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,780
I have no idea, I don't know 'cause it was at like

549
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,820
a fucking Beacon's Closet or whatever.

550
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,540
I have no idea who, somebody came in with that hat.

551
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,380
- And was like, I gotta get rid of this.

552
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,500
- And they were like, we have to buy this.

553
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,380
- This thing is so fucking badass, dude.

554
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:10,380
I need to buy this so quick.

555
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,380
Dude, I didn't know you were doing gifts. I would have got you something.

556
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,380
Well, it's fine that you didn't get me a gift, I guess.

557
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:20,380
You should get a matching hat that's your first initial, second initial, and the first two letters of your last name.

558
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,380
I think that would be an amazing combo.

559
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,380
Yeah.

560
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,380
And then we can get... Mommy comes back and we can see we have this CP and PETA hats.

561
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,380
[Laughter]

562
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,380
What's up?

563
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:35,380
Well, he did give me that hat that has the adjustable...

564
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,380
Oh yeah, you can just put that on that.

565
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,300
- Yeah, I can put my initials on that.

566
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,620
- Yeah, we can just rock like this.

567
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,140
- Uh-huh, yeah.

568
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,980
- And that would be kind of,

569
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,500
it'd be CP and Pedo in the morning.

570
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,340
(laughing)

571
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:47,220
And we'll be doing like morning zoo stuff.

572
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,060
- Yeah.

573
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,880
- It's not a bad idea.

574
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,720
- Uh-huh.

575
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,560
- Well, that was amazing.

576
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,140
I haven't bought anything good recently.

577
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:52,980
- Yeah.

578
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,800
- I'm trying to think of what I,

579
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,620
you know what I've been doing all week?

580
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,460
- What have you been up to?

581
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,340
- Every single day I eat a pound of ground beef.

582
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,220
- You're doing that?

583
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,020
- No, no, I eat it with other stuff.

584
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,860
- Okay.

585
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,620
- But it's just a cheap way to eat a lot of meat.

586
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,460
And so I've been eating--

587
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,720
- You're trying to bulk up?

588
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,640
- Trying to get as big as a fucking truck.

589
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,120
- You know what-- - What?

590
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,840
- Could help you out?

591
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,680
- More meat?

592
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,520
- No.

593
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,680
- Working out instead of just,

594
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,280
I just eat the meat and play video games.

595
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,120
(laughing)

596
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:17,940
I don't work out.

597
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,960
- You know what could help you out?

598
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,800
- What?

599
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,720
- But I don't even think I can talk about it.

600
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
- You're talking about-- - I don't even--

601
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,880
- You think I should pop my legs?

602
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,140
- What does that mean?

603
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,980
- Pop 'em.

604
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,000
- What do you mean by that?

605
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,600
You want, do you think that I wanna fuck you

606
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
for to gain weight?

607
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
- You wanna pop me?

608
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,840
- I don't think I wanna, no.

609
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,680
- You wanna beat me?

610
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,160
- I can't talk about it because someone in here

611
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,420
on the production side may not want to acknowledge it

612
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,800
for some reason.

613
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,360
- Oh, wait.

614
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,760
Wait a second, okay.

615
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,480
So this is actually very interesting.

616
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,320
- Yep.

617
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,160
- Do you have this pulled up somewhere?

618
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,120
- I have it on my phone, I can bring it up.

619
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,560
- Okay, so Patrick, I did ask Patrick,

620
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,840
'cause I've already told Patrick this, it's all fake.

621
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,320
Like all of the, any revelation that I,

622
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,120
- So Patrick already knows everything about me.

623
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,360
So when I tell him that I've been eating ground beef,

624
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,400
he already is one step ahead and he actually designed

625
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,840
the entire meal plan for me.

626
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,240
And I'll let you explain it.

627
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:18,240
- Okay, so what it is is a 10 day healthy eating challenge

628
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,160
that will revolutionize, I mean,

629
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,800
not revolutionize or anything, it's mostly just I know--

630
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,640
- It will oosh-enize.

631
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,560
- It will oosh-enize, it'll oosh-enize,

632
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,320
and it will, I know you're trying to bulk up.

633
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,160
- Trying to get as big as the sun.

634
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,400
- You're trying to become jimungas.

635
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,240
- I'm trying to be--

636
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,400
- Which is a combination of gigantic and humongous.

637
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,320
- I didn't even catch that.

638
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,440
- Yeah, jimungas.

639
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,280
- Wow.

640
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,120
- Write that one down, Urban Dictionary.

641
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,640
- Yeah, put that in the UD.

642
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,480
- Jimungas.

643
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,920
- Yeah, that's gonna be probably the new big word.

644
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,960
- So this is the 10 day healthy eating challenge, okay?

645
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,800
- Yeah, so let me hear it.

646
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,640
- This is day one.

647
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,400
- I haven't heard this yet, he told me that he did it.

648
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,960
And by the way, we tried to bring this up to Jubio

649
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,800
for some reason, he doesn't wanna have anything to do with it.

650
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,240
- He just won't even look at me when I talk about it.

651
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,800
- So Patrick and him have been beefing,

652
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,520
they have not been talking, you know, speaking of beef.

653
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,200
- I have to text him through a telegram.

654
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,660
- He's been texting me, well, he's been texting me

655
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,680
to text Jubio, he said, here, I'll read it.

656
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,280
Do you have that pulled up, though?

657
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,260
- Yeah, I have it, I have it right ready.

658
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,000
- Patrick said, I'm not talking to Jubio

659
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,580
until he recognizes my challenge.

660
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,880
I'm at the office, he sent me I'm at the office

661
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
so that I could let Jubio know--

662
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,120
- That we're ready. - That we're ready.

663
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,600
- So here's the 10 day healthy eating challenge.

664
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,300
Breakfast, fruit salad with a mix of seasonal fruits.

665
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,140

- Okay.

669
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:41,700
- Snack, a handful of raw almonds and a cup of green tea,

670
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,540
which--

671
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,360
- I already have a cup of green tea.

672
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,200
- He's already got it.

673
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,740
- This is sounding so healthy so far.

674
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,020
- Dinner, baked salmon, roasted veggies, one candy cane.

675
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,300
- That sounds amazing.

676
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,880
- Yeah.

677
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,680
Day two, scrambled eggs with whole grain toast,

678
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,080

One candy cane.

682
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:05,460
For a snack, a sliced apple with almond butter.

683
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:06,740

Two candy canes.

686
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,100
- Wait, are you saying candy cane?

687
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,340

688
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,820

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,700

- Okay, wait, can I just stop you really quickly?

696
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:36,580
This sounds to me like a lot of seafood so far.

697
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,460
- Well, that's 'cause of the proteins.

698
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,440
- Okay, that's fine, yeah, continue, sorry.

699
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,600
- What day was I on?

700

00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,180

713
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:22,180
Lunch, a turkey and cheese sandwich on whole grain bread with mixed veggies, 3 candy canes.

714
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:26,180
I can't eat bread, I can't eat bread, I'm gluten free.

715
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:30,180
I'm sorry. I'm maybe just a little bit free. Yeah. Yeah.

716
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,180
Snack sliced cucumber with tzatziki sauce, three candy canes.

717
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:35,180
Those don't go together.

718
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,180
What?

719
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,180
I don't. I'm never going to eat sliced cucumber with tzatziki.

720
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
With tzatziki.

721
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,180
But there's already sliced cucumber.

722
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
It just doesn't go together.

723
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
Okay. So I guess just a spoonful of tzatziki and three candy canes.

724
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
You would eat chips with tzatziki or put it on something.

725
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:53,180
I'm not going to use it. Like, why would I add more cucumber?

726
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Okay. All right.

727
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,180
Sorry.

728
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,580

Lunch, a quinoa and black bean bowl with avocado and salsa.

735
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,440
- Oh, this is my favorite day so far.

736
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,580
- Snack, sliced apple with peanut butter.

737
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,420
- Mmm.

738
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,540
- Dinner, baked salmon with steamed green beans

739
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,120
and 16 candy canes.

740
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,380
(laughing)

741
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,060
- Okay.

742
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,980
- Day nine.

743
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,020
- Okay, there's two more days?

744
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,980
- It's the 10 day healthy eating challenge.

745
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,680
- Oh, okay, you're right, I forgot what it is.

746
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,720
Day nine, scrambled eggs with whole grain toast

747
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,240
and four candy canes.

748
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,240
Lunch, a Greek salad, mixed greens,

749
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,840
feta cheese, olives, and four candy canes.

750
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,320
Snack, six candy canes.

751
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,040
Dinner, four candy canes.

752
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,120
Day 10, five candy canes.

753
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,000
- Wait, that's the breakfast?

754
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,320
- Breakfast, five candy canes.

755
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Lunch, five candy canes.

756
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,840
Snack, a grilled chicken Caesar salad

757
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:28,680
whole grain croutons. And for dinner, ten candy canes.

758
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,680
Wow.

759
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
So that's the ten day healthy eating challenge.

760
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,680
You know what, I would barely call that a diet because it seems like I would be able

761
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:42,680
to eat everything I want on a diet. So I don't know.

762
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:49,680
And for some reason, Juvio is so apprehensive to acknowledge this. What?

763
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,920
- Whoa, okay, and now he's lashing out.

764
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,560
- Now he's lashing out with his production stuff.

765
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,440
- Great, we get it, you're God, okay?

766
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,360
- Yeah, we get it, you're in control of us

767
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,720
all the time, constantly.

768
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,920
- Great, yeah.

769
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,400
Don't do that.

770
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,440
- Don't make it flash.

771
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,240
- Don't make the word racist flash.

772
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,200
- Don't make it flash over me.

773
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Jubio, can you, why are you so apprehensive

774
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,640
to even acknowledge the 10 day health study?

775
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,160
- Because this is complete nonsense.

776
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,120
You're not a serious person.

777
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,600
- How is that not, how is that,

778
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,720
- Okay. - How is that unsteer,

779
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,600
a grilled chicken Caesar salad with whole grain croutons?

780
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,480
- This guy doesn't like shrimp skewers.

781
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,640
- Oh. - Or something.

782
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
- Yeah, is it 'cause of the seafood?

783
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,900
- There is a lot of seafood, I will say that.

784
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,400
If you're not into that kind of stuff.

785
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,680
- That's true, are you like allergic to shellfish?

786
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,800
'Cause I'm-- - I'm just not gonna

787
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,560
acknowledge it until you do it.

788
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,720
- Okay, okay, I'll do it.

789
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,320
Me and Caleb will do the 10 day healthy eating challenge.

790
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,840
- Fuck it, I'll do it right now.

791
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,680
I'll do the whole, I'll do all 10 days.

792
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,640
- Look, he's already starting with the green tea.

793
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,920
- Yeah, guess who started it today?

794
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,040
Me. - Yep.

795
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,360
- And I'm about to get shredded.

796
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,080
- He's about to get swole as fuck.

797
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,400
- This is gonna be the new Weight Watchers,

798
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,760
the new Atkins diet.

799
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,120
- Yeah, and if you're not on this ship right now,

800
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,240
- Yeah, you're about to be.

801
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,240
- You're about to be, 'cause it's about to set sail.

802
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,840
- Yeah, and you could lose upwards of fucking 40 pounds

803
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,200
in a month doing this.

804
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,120
- You know who did it?

805
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,960
- Who?

806
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,880
- I don't know.

807
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:20,320
- Wait, wait, hold on, you are looking suspiciously trim.

808
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,360
What'd you clock in at today on the scale?

809
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,200
- 110.

810
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,600
- 110 pounds because of this new diet.

811
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,560
- Yeah, because of the 10 day healthy eating challenge.

812
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,760
- I have to fucking tell you.

813
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:34,160
- You lose 10 pounds in 10 days.

814
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,840
- You weighed 120 before this?

815
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,720
- Yeah.

816
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,560
- Wow.

817
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,960
- Well, I started this months ago.

818
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,200
- Oh, so you've been doing it for many 10 days.

819
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,880
- I've been doing it a long ass time.

820
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,720
- And none of us noticed--

821
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,280
- I used to weigh, guess how much I used to weigh?

822
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,120
- How much?

823
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,960
- 380.

824
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,380
- 380 pounds you used to weigh.

825
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,220
- At my heaviest.

826
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,180
- At five foot five.

827
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,020
- Yeah.

828
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:54,840
- You weighed 380.

829
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,680
- Five foot nine.

830
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,140
- Or whatever.

831
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,040
You weighed 380 pounds.

832
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,340
That's mighty hefty.

833
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,180
- Yeah.

834
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,000
- But you've been doing it,

835
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,840
and this is what a lot of people

836
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:03,680
don't understand about diet.

837
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,900
If you do these crash diets,

838
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,800
you're gonna fail.

839
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,640
- You're gonna fail.

840
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,740
- You're gonna fail because as soon as you get

841
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,740
to the end of that low carb, 1,000 calorie a day diet,

842
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,980
you're gonna immediately want Oreos.

843
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,820
You're gonna be reducing.

844
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,860
- The craziest thing about this diet,

845
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,100
every single day, every single,

846
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,580
'cause I didn't even talk about portion size or whatever,

847
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,300
every single day you were eating

848
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,780
close to 5,000 calories a day.

849
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:29,340
- Really? - Yeah.

850
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,480
Because of the portion sizes,

851
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,500
but it tricks your body into thinking

852
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,900
that you're hibernating.

853
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,300
So it needs to, so it's gonna trick your body--

854
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,900
- So it's gonna start burning, it's like ketosis.

855
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,020
- Yeah, it's burning fat because it thinks

856
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,820
you're like dead asleep.

857
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,820
- Some kind of kynosis that puts you into.

858
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,660
- Yeah.

859
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,380
- So that's what I love about this diet also,

860
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,220
is that you kind of can eat what you want,

861
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,740
but there's so much protein in it,

862
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,900
that's the trick of the diet,

863
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:58,500
there's so much protein in it,

864
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,620
that your body is,

865
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,180
protein's the most thermogenic macronutrient.

866
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,260
Did you know that?

867
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,100
- I'm a nutritionist.

868
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,860
- Oh, and I know you are, I know you are.

869
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,700
So of course you know that.

870
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,140
So you're eating all this protein,

871
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,540
and so your body's just burning,

872
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,940
It takes more calories to burn that,

873
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,980
to use that energy, to process that energy.

874
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,700
- Yeah, you're telling me stuff I learned in--

875
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,940
- I'm just explaining for these lay people, right?

876
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,020
Where did you learn that, by the way?

877
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,620
- Lakes Region Community College in Laconia, New Hampshire.

878
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,460
- Where you studied nutrition.

879
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,740
- Where I studied nutrition, yeah.

880
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,060
- Wow, yeah, see, and I think the only thing

881
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,500
that's lacking here is some kind of

882
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,660
accompanying workout plan that we could sell on a DVD.

883
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:36,460
- That is such a good fucking point.

884
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,100
- You know, maybe something like--

885
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,740
- That is an amazing point.

886
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,460
- And that kind of brings me to my idea,

887
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,460
which is a full workout, full workout plan,

888
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:50,480
that really just entails you every single day,

889
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,380
all I want you to do is spend about four hours skiing.

890
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,340
Every day.

891
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,500
If you spend about four hours skiing, you will see--

892
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,980
- Honestly, this is perfect for, I mean, you know,

893
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,140
I don't know if you know anything about New Hampshire,

894
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,220
but we have the White Mountains.

895
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,100
- Oh yeah, that's amazing.

896
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,100
- I could have been skiing every single day

897
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,400
when I was studying this program.

898
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,240
- Yeah, I think you could've--

899
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,380
- I could've been going up to Killington,

900
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,500
I could've been going up to Loon

901
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,180
and just skiing my fucking ass off.

902
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,660
- Four, five, six hours of that.

903
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,840
Then that's, by the way, that's,

904
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,060
and a lot of people think of skiing as just a workout.

905
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:24,300
I think that eventually you get a kind of a skiing high.

906
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,140
- Oh yeah.

907
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,160
- Where you've been skiing for so long

908
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,180
that you start feeling good and actually enjoying it.

909
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,080
- There is footage, and I think you may remember it,

910
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,320
there is footage of a man skiing so much

911
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:37,380
that his body was set on fire

912
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,620
from how much he was skiing because of the friction.

913
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,460
- Really?

914
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,280
- Because of the friction, yeah.

915
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,120
- Well, that's the danger of a skiing high, I think.

916
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,420
- And they used the clip in the intro

917
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,420
to Malcolm in the Middle.

918
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,220
- That's the danger of the skiing high.

919
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:49,180
- Which, I mean, you know, that's why you need,

920
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,300
so, I mean, you see the footage of that guy.

921
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,140
- Yeah. - Look at him.

922
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,580
He's skinny as a twig.

923
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,420
- Yeah.

924
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,240
- He's skinny as a twig.

925
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,460
- Because he's already burned all his calories

926
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
and now the body's just burning itself.

927
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,260
- But that's 'cause he's not on this diet.

928
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,100
- Yeah, 'cause this is a high--

929
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,780
- When you lose 10 pounds in 10 days, yes,

930
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,380
but when you combine it with skiing,

931
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,380
you're building up muscle.

932
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,220
He's not like--

933
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,060
- Total body recomposition is what they call it.

934
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,580
- He's not getting like any muscle at all.

935
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,780
The guy is not muscular.

936
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:16,060
He's almost as skinny as his ski.

937
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:17,980
- And he seems like a fucking twat.

938
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,080
- Yeah. - The way that he acts

939
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
in the video.

940
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,580
- He's a total douche nozzle.

941
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,840
- He seems like a todger. - He's a fuckwad.

942
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,680
- He seems like a todger to me.

943
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,820
- He's a fucking fuckwad.

944
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,660
- He's a fuckstick.

945
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,940
I just don't like him that much.

946
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,940
- I'd call him fuckface von clownstick.

947
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,380
- Yeah, if I was into that.

948
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,940
- Clownsticks, 'cause he's holding two ski sticks.

949
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,420
- Did you know that I always thought that

950
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,900
that was Trevor Noah that came up with that.

951
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,140
That was Jon Stewart that said fuck face on clowns.

952
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,380
- Oh yeah, I've seen that.

953
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,300
- Dude.

954
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
- Jon.

955
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,820
- Jon, don't hurt him.

956
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,660
- Don't hurt him, Jon.

957
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,700
- He's already down, don't kick him while he's down.

958
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,540
- I was under the impression, and I thought--

959
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,860
- He's in jail right now.

960
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,020
- And I just thought, I didn't even know Jon Stewart

961
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,420
did comedy, I thought he was a director.

962
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,260
- Yeah.

963
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,580
- And then it turns out that he actually

964
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,180
completely owned Donald Trump.

965
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,620
- The president, no less.

966
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:05,660
and I had to go to the New York court today

967
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,020
to settle some business.

968
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,380
I'm not gonna get so into that.

969
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,340
That's my personal stuff.

970
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,900
- Which is why I gave you your gift.

971
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,100
- Yeah, which is very, very nice of you, thank you.

972
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,660
But there was a million people there

973
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,620
and they all had the cameras pointed

974
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,020
and I said, "Guys."

975
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,020
- No photos.

976
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,440
- It's not that big of a deal.

977
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,340
- No photos, please.

978
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,120
- It's not, everybody parks in front of a school bus

979
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,580
every once in a while, right?

980
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,480
You don't have to come and take

981
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,040
all these celebrity photos of me.

982
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,720
- They were waiting, 'cause I mean--

983
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,560
- But apparently--

984
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,760
- You can't see what he's wearing under this table,

985
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,160
but they were trying to get that snatch shot.

986
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,980
- They did--

987
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,700
- They were waiting to see his sliz

988
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,360
while he's getting out of his Escalade.

989
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,020
- I did actually get street fashion photo'd today.

990
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,860
- Really?

991
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,080
- Yeah, and the guy, it was while I was running,

992
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,840
'cause I was late for an appointment at the court,

993
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,720
and a guy took a photo, I like saw him,

994
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,080
and I was like, dude, this guy's gonna,

995
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,840
he's gonna at least talk to me or look at me.

996
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,680
Like, you know when you just see a dorky white guy

997
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,480
and you're like, this guy's gonna be way too comfortable

998
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,680
and like-- - Stopping you.

999
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,360
- Yeah, well-- - I got stopped today too.

1000
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,600
A guy said, "We're trying to stop people

1001
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,480
"who look friendly."

1002
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,040
And I said, "Man, I can't do this right now."

1003
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:11,880
- It was that kind of thing.

1004
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,960
It's like the only reason this guy would be in this area

1005
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,640
is because he's doing something

1006
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,960
where he wants to stop guys

1007
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,440
and stop them and get in their way.

1008
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,880
And so I'm running and he takes a photo of me

1009
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,600
out of nowhere and says, "There he is."

1010
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,220
And dude, I lost my shit.

1011
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,260
Yeah, you screamed at him?

1012
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,860
No.

1013
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,540
I just kept, I ran, even.

1014
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,380
But basically for me, that's losing my shit.

1015
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,220
Yeah.

1016
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,040
Yeah.

1017
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,100
A lot of people would assume that I'm somebody

1018
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,860
who gets into traffic and is, I'm honking the horn.

1019
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,220
I'm scared to go outside.

1020
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,500
I'm scared to go outside.

1021
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,180
I don't wanna be out there.

1022
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,360
Every time I go outside, I'm thinking.

1023
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,580
Agoraphobia, you have?

1024
00:33:54,580 --> 00:34:01,380
I thought that was something about going underwater. No. But I am going outside

1025
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,500
every single day. I'm scared of antifa and Molotov cocktails. Especially today. Yeah.

1026
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:12,200
At the New York City courthouses. And the thing is I look like Trump. Let's be real. I look

1027
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,620
pretty similar. If you had his hair. If I had his hair and his. You look exactly like

1028
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:20,260
him. Pretty much like Dead Ringer. And I had a hat on so they couldn't tell. Yeah. So that's

1029
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,340
That's what I was a little bit worried about,

1030
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,820
is maybe some sort of assassin-style killer

1031
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,740
was going to walk up to me and say,

1032
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,740
"This one's for freeing Kodak Black

1033
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,100
"and put 10 bullets into my chest."

1034
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,940
Yeah.

1035
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,280
But luckily, it was just a nerd took a photo of me.

1036
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,940
That's what happens in New York, honestly.

1037
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,780
It's basically as crazy as--

1038
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,660
Just this fucking crazy melting pot.

1039
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,900
It is fucking crazy, dude.

1040
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:49,000
Speaking of melting pots and diets, food,

1041
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,740
here, we have a list today.

1042
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,660
- Oh yeah.

1043
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,260
- We have a list today of--

1044
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,860
- Will you please pull up the list?

1045
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,820
No, we don't want that photo.

1046
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,240
- These are the top 10 crazy ways

1047
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,540
to get free food in the UK.

1048
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,380
- Wait!

1049
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,260
This just says weird stuff on it.

1050
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,780
- Yep, it's weird stuff.

1051
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,180
It's definitely weird stuff.

1052
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:12,420
- This is amazing because we do a lot of these lists

1053
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:16,260
and a lot of people say, you can't use these as sources

1054
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,660
when we submit these for peer review and stuff.

1055
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,620
but this is actually, luckily, this has been fact-checked.

1056
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,180
- Look at that bottom right corner.

1057
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,860
Fact-checked by Jamie Frater.

1058
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,700
- Jamie Frater, who if you know anything about fact-checks,

1059
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,940
this guy is the Pinocchio giver of Pinocchios.

1060
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,500
- Jamie Frater is basically the truth,

1061
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,200
they call him Jamie Frater the truth raider.

1062
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,860
- Yeah, they do call him that.

1063
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:39,900
And he's been working as a Pinocchio giver for--

1064
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,780
- Night and day.

1065
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:42,900
- Night and day, for one night and one day.

1066
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,100
So he's basically an expert.

1067
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,180
So let's get into this.

1068
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,100
- Yeah, so this is the top 10 crazy ways

1069
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,500
to get free food in the UK.

1070
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,660
- Yeah.

1071
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,580
- Some say there's no such thing as a free meal,

1072
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,620
but those people just haven't tried hard enough.

1073
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,820
- Let me tell you real quick,

1074
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,820
guess who says there's no such thing as a free meal?

1075
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,660
- Who?

1076
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,480
- The Tories.

1077
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,320
- Yep.

1078
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,340
Those fucking bell ends.

1079
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,940
We have Dunkin' Donuts mics today.

1080
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,820
- Holy fuck.

1081
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:08,860
- And we're about to dunk on these donuts in the UK

1082
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,420
with our fucking riffs. - They do say donuts.

1083
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,340
You fucking donut. - You donut.

1084
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,860
- Okay, continue. - You fucking donut.

1085
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,740
- The ancient Romans said that the public

1086
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,820
could be entertained with bread and circuses

1087
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,980
and giving away free food has always been a good way

1088
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,620
to ensure popularity.

1089
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,500
Over the centuries in the UK,

1090
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,660
over the centuries the UK has built up a huge number

1091
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:29,820
of traditions that result some lucky people

1092
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:30,980
ending up with free food.

1093
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,820
- Wow.

1094
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,580
- 2020 has been a tough year for everyone,

1095
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:36,580
so here are the top 10 ways you can get fed for free.

1096
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,420
- Logan Paul vibes.

1097
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,660
- Logan Paul, we circled it back.

1098
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,500
- Yeah.

1099
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,820
- We circled that shit back.

1100
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,740
All right, let's look at number 10 here.

1101
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,740
St. Briavelle's.

1102
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,500
- What's that?

1103
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,500
- That is a church in St. Briavel's.

1104
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,260
You will get pelted with bread and cheese

1105
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,200
because of some tradition.

1106
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,620
A vicar is invited to deliver a sermon

1107
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,620
in which they only get paid

1108
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,240
if the congregation cheers at the end.

1109
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,580
Then in tradition dating from the 12th century,

1110
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,120
the locals take baskets containing small cubes

1111
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,240
of cheese and bread to the top of the wall,

1112
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,860
known as the pound wall,

1113
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,100
and dole climbers then gather at the base of the wall

1114
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,520
and wait for the food to rain down on them.

1115
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,660
Some people use upturned umbrellas

1116
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,200
to ensure that they catch something

1117
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,640
without the food touching the ground.

1118
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
- They are so stupid.

1119
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,480
- This is some fucking Wallace and Gromit bullshit.

1120
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,360
- Use a bucket!

1121
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:32,920
- Use a bucket, use a trampoline to bounce the food back up.

1122
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,320
- Into your house.

1123
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,920
These people are dumb as--

1124
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,560
- Dumb morons.

1125
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,400
- They're dense.

1126
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,560
I'll say it, they are dense.

1127
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,400
- Strangely, most don't actually eat the bread or cheese.

1128
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,040
They're not even eating the fucking food.

1129
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,920
They put them in little match boxes like they're borrowers.

1130
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,760
- That is awful.

1131
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,440
- This town, St. Briavels,

1132
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,460
should be called the borrower's large.

1133
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,440
- The borrower, what do you mean, like they're big borrowers?

1134
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,280
- Yeah.

1135
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,100
- But that's not a borrower at all.

1136
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,080
- That is some borrower-ass shit.

1137
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,060
What would a borrower's ice box look like?

1138
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,600
A match box with a tiny ice cube in it.

1139
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,440
- Oh, that's true.

1140
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,280
- Uh-huh. - Yeah.

1141
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,720
- And they put them under their pillows.

1142
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,020
They put the cheese and stuff under their pillows

1143
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,720
to allow people to dream about the future.

1144
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:20,940
- Man, honestly, this country is over.

1145
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,940
This country, our country, the UK, is over.

1146
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,860
- It's completely over.

1147
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,380
- I don't want anything to do with it anymore.

1148
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,220
- Can you imagine?

1149
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,060
- I'm never going back.

1150
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,700
- Can you imagine being like the ruling empire for years?

1151
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,540
- Yeah, I can imagine that.

1152
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,700
- And you're doing all this kind of dumbass little bullshit

1153
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:36,940
with umbrellas and cheese.

1154
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,860
- Dude, they just fell off in such a major way.

1155
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,700
- They fell off hard.

1156
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,340
- They used to go into every single country.

1157
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,860
- They used to make the Irish slaves.

1158
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:45,780
- They would slave the Irish, they would go into--

1159
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,980
- And they did that to the Indians.

1160
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,820
- They would go to every single--

1161
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:50,140
- Pretty much every single country was their slave.

1162
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,420
- At one point, and they had every single island,

1163
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,260
and they were sitting there

1164
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,960
and they were eating coconuts and shit,

1165
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,020
and they all were dressed up like Monopoly clothes.

1166
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,580
And then the whole place fell off,

1167
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:03,700
and now you have what, Sherlock, Benedict Cumberbatch?

1168
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,140
- Yep, that's pretty much all they have.

1169
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,580
They're one export.

1170
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,420
- Fuck that guy.

1171
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,260
- Yep.

1172
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:09,100
- I don't, and also, oh--

1173
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,900
- He looks like, he smells like milk.

1174
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:14,080
Guess what we made, a witty show.

1175
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:14,980
Suck my balls.

1176
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,300
- You know what, they do, they do.

1177
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,800
- Hey, here's an idea, UK.

1178
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,180
Okay, what are TV channels in America?

1179
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,020
What are they?

1180
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,700
- 200, 206.

1181
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,180
- 200, 206, AMC, Comedy Central.

1182
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,220
Right, they have names.

1183
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,800
You go over there. - And we have a lot more.

1184
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,820
- Channel 5, shut the fuck up.

1185
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,260
- Channel 4, The Beeb.

1186
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,100
- Yeah.

1187
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,920
- The Beeb.

1188
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,020
- Fucking kill yourself, bro.

1189
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,700
- The Beeb's, fucking Justin Bieber-ass TV shows.

1190
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,140
- It's worse than that.

1191
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,060
I just think if you're gonna make a TV channel

1192
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,940
and purport to be somebody who's creative enough

1193
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,220
that somebody should watch what you make,

1194
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,420
I think you can come up with something

1195
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,260
a little better than a number.

1196
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,100
Am I right?

1197
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,480
- But that Mr. Bean is funny though.

1198
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,060
- Mr. Bean is above everything, the whole thing.

1199
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,960
- Mr. Bean is not British. - Mr. Bean is the last thing

1200
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,800
that they did.

1201
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,260
- He's not British, he's Bean.

1202
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,100
- That's what I think.

1203
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,500
He's everybody.

1204
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,340
- He's everyone.

1205
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,140
There's a Mr. Bean in every country.

1206
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:04,980
- Oh yeah, except America.

1207
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,220
- We've discussed this, yeah.

1208
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,740
Who is America's Mr. Bean?

1209
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,580
I don't know.

1210
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,420
(imitates farting)

1211
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,680
(laughing)

1212
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,540
- Number nine, farthing loaf day.

1213
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,200
Yeah, farting loaf day in regards to your king,

1214
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,400
that farting loaf.

1215
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,340
- Who's your king now?

1216
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,320
- Charles.

1217
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,160
- Chuck.

1218
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,220
- Chuck, King Chuck.

1219
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,020
- If I met him, you know, I'm such a fucking

1220
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,840
get a beer with these guys type dude.

1221
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,260
I'm such a salt of the earth guy.

1222
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,280
I'd meet him and say, hey, nice to meet you Chuck,

1223
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,120
I'm Caleb.

1224
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,940
- Yeah.

1225
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,780
- And he'd probably--

1226
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,660
like, "Holy heavens."

1227
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:40,500
- Ewok.

1228
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,340
- Yeah.

1229
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,160
- Yeah.

1230
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,000
(laughing)

1231
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,060
(grunting)

1232
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,900
- He'd do that.

1233
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,720
He wouldn't even say anything.

1234
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,180
- Did you see the video of the inbred people?

1235
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,220
- No, I gotta look that one up.

1236
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:51,940
- Dude, it's fucking really sad.

1237
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,860
- Was it nice seeing your family on TV?

1238
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,600
- So, what's Farthing Loaf Day?

1239
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,700
- In Kittermeister, an old widow

1240
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:01,820
lived on Church Street,

1241
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,620
left a sum of money in her will

1242
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,580
to ensure there is always a sense of community on the street.

1243
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,860
Unfortunately, the name of this generous old maid

1244
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,460
has been forgotten.

1245
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,580
On a midsummer eve, anyone who was born on the street

1246
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,060
was welcome to come and join a feast

1247
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,180
that was known as Farthing Loaf Day.

1248
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,500
Unfortunately, the money ran out due to bad investment,

1249
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,180
but John Brecknell of Church Street,

1250
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,100
whose name is remembered, left 150 pounds

1251
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,940
to the charity in 1776.

1252
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,700
Yeah, 1776, the year they lost their greatest colony.

1253
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:29,540
- That's right.

1254
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,380
- Fuck y'all.

1255
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:33,220
He wanted a Tum Penny plum cake.

1256
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:34,060
- God, a Tum Penny plum cake.

1257
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,700
- He wanted a Tum Penny plum cake

1258
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,180
- That's an amazing name. - To be given to every child

1259
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:39,460
and unmarried woman on the street, as well as the bread.

1260
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,060
He also gave pipes, tobacco, and ale

1261
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,460
to the men who he met in friendship.

1262
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,980
- Wow, that's adorable.

1263
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,300
- A Tup Penny plum cake.

1264
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,820
- How fucked up is it that these days

1265
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,880
you can't even leave money on the street

1266
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,020
for people to take because people will take it?

1267
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,060
- People will take it and they will spend money

1268
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,780
on Tup Penny plum cakes.

1269
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,340
- Yeah, fuck that.

1270
00:41:58,340 --> 00:41:59,700
- They should be given out for free.

1271
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,860
- What's a Tup Penny?

1272
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,540
That's two. - Tup Penny is half a penny.

1273
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:05,280
- Oh, it's half a penny. - No, that's a hay penny.

1274
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,020
- That's me with my fuckin' neighbor.

1275
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,860
- Yeah.

1276
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,680
- Hey, Penny.

1277
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,280
(laughing)

1278
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,120
I don't know.

1279
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,000
- Number eight, Tishborne Dole.

1280
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,840
- What's that?

1281
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,240
- Um, well, we'll find out.

1282
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,040
- Why do you, you can't just say all the,

1283
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,280
I mean, just get to it.

1284
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,580
- Tishborne Dole.

1285
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,400
When Lady Mabella Tishborne lay dying in the 13th century,

1286
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,380
she asked her husband for a relatively minor favor,

1287
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,560
distribute food to the poor.

1288
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,960
Her husband agreed, but on one somewhat harsh condition,

1289
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,520
he would provide land for corn to be grown on that,

1290
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,280
to be grown on that would be used to make bread for the needy.

1291
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,840
This must be Queens English spelling.

1292
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,660
Or I may honestly just have dyslexia.

1293
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,480
- Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at it right now

1294
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,880
and I'm gonna be completely real with you, Patrick.

1295
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,800
Everything is spelled in a normal American way.

1296
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,960
And you made the text just about as big as it would go.

1297
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,800
- Yeah.

1298
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,620
- So, but--

1299
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:58,000
- I forgot my glasses because I, again,

1300
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,440
was on a shopping spree and I found an amazing hat for you.

1301
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,560
- Yeah, that was very, very sweet of you.

1302
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,680
He would provide land for corn to be grown

1303
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,680
and that would be used to make bread for the needy,

1304
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,360
but he would only provide as much land

1305
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,880
as a sick lady could crawl around

1306
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,040
while holding a burning torch.

1307
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:16,800
Miraculously, Lady Mabella managed to cover 23 acres

1308
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,960
and that land is still known as the crawls today

1309
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,680
and provides flowers for the Tishporn Dole,

1310
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,040
which is given out on every Lady Day.

1311
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,520
- This is the worst country in the world.

1312
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,000
- The Tishporn Dole given out on Lady Day.

1313
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,560
- Lady Day.

1314
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,120
- In the past, loaves of bread were given out,

1315
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:33,100
but today anyone who attends will be given a measure

1316
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,100
of flour to bake with for themselves.

1317
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,720
- Wow, so they even downgraded it.

1318
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,680
- It went woke.

1319
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,640
- Yeah, they woke it because they're like--

1320
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:40,480
- They went woke.

1321
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,000
- What if somebody has a gluten intolerance allergy?

1322
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:43,840
- Yep.

1323
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:44,660
- Right?

1324
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,080
- Mess the hell up.

1325
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,320
- I'd like to dump a bunch of,

1326
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,680
you know what I would love to show them?

1327
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,520
- What?

1328
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,960
- Is the pure power of American craftsmanship.

1329
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,800
- Yeah.

1330
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,960
- And I would like to dump fucking 50 mags of AR-15 bullets

1331
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,520
directly into all the flour and see just the dust

1332
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,360
go everywhere, you know?

1333
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,180
It'd be really cool.

1334
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,560
I'm showing them true American ingenuity,

1335
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,020
true American strength.

1336
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,860
- Yeah.

1337
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,980
- I'm going in there with my flamethrower

1338
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,260
from the Boring Company.

1339
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,100
- That's right.

1340
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,360
- I'm burning up that field

1341
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,520
and I'm sending it to the moon.

1342
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,360
- That's right.

1343
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:16,180
- In a doge rocket.

1344
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,080
- Oh, you like the Office UK version?

1345
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,700
Try this, pop in the VHS, ridiculousness, right?

1346
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,620
And then they're watching fucking amazing videos.

1347
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,860
- I'm walking around there, I'm dressed up like Jim Halpert.

1348
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,700
- That's right.

1349
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:36,660
doing this yeah yeah you're not allowed to do that in the UK by the way yeah and

1350
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,220
all you know what else you're not allowed to do there is have a Stanley in

1351
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,440
the show because they are racist and they did not have a Stanley it was no Stanley

1352
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:50,100
there was no Stanley Stanley no Darryl yeah big fucking surprise see this I have

1353
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:55,140
my arms crossed and I'm tapping my feet Ricky Gervais yeah so suck on that great

1354
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:01,540
Ricky Gervais is almost the, I mean we'll say it's a pretty brave soldier on the frontier

1355
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,060
of Wokeness and SJW-ness.

1356
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:08,620
But I think maybe he could have put one Stanley.

1357
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,620
You're right.

1358
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:16,740
I think if they did have a Stanley over there, his name would probably be Jefferson.

1359
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,820
It would probably be Jefferson or Stanford or...

1360
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
Bluntly.

1361
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,820
Bluntly.

1362
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,820
Bluntly, crips.

1363
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,820
Yeah, blackly.

1364
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,620
(laughing)

1365
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,860
Or something like that.

1366
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,580
'Cause that's how racist they are.

1367
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:33,220
- So then this next one here is scrambling cakes.

1368
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:34,060
- Okay.

1369
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,800
- And this one is about,

1370
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,000
if you were lucky enough to live in Twickenham in 1367,

1371
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,060
you might have been eligible for a lovely dole of free food.

1372
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,620
- What an amazing-- - Some peas or beans.

1373
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,900
Some peas or beans.

1374
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:48,980
- What an amazing sentence.

1375
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:53,260
If you were lucky enough to live in Twickenham in 1367.

1376
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:54,820
- A dole of free food. - That's my version

1377
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,820
of Midnight in Paris.

1378
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:56,660
- Yeah. (laughs)

1379
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:59,060
- 'Cause I'm like, I'm like, "Oh, you know, it's okay here,

1380
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,900
"but if only I could be in Twickenham in 1367,

1381
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,060
"have peas and beans."

1382
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,420
- And then you like turn the corner

1383
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:07,900
and you're on some like shitty fucking like town.

1384
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,740
- Yeah, it's just a bunch of--

1385
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:09,560
- You're in some shitty town,

1386
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,400
there's like some guys throwing

1387
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,740
his chamber pot out the window.

1388
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:14,740
- Yeah, it hits me right on, I go, "Oh, this is amazing."

1389
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,020
- Yes, finally. - And I'm there with

1390
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:18,340
fucking Margot Robbie or something.

1391
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,820
- And someone's like, "Get your dole!"

1392
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,460
- Yeah. - "Come get your dole!"

1393
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,200
- Peas and beans. - Peas and beans for me.

1394
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,540
- Unfortunately, this food distribution was stopped,

1395
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:31,140
but a tastier one was started when the two great cakes

1396
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:33,420
were tossed to the poor each Easter Sunday.

1397
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:37,500
But as will happen when you throw two cakes to a crowd,

1398
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,380
a riot would often result.

1399
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:42,020
- Why was cake so, people loved cake.

1400
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,740
- Well, this is the British cake.

1401
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,180
This is the British cake, where it's just like a cake

1402
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,340
with no frosting or anything.

1403
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,860
- Yeah, so why is it, I feel like any time I hear

1404
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:53,420
some story about, like two cakes,

1405
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,500
people are doing a riot for a cake.

1406
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,340
- Well, I mean, you gotta think about

1407
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:58,900
twicking 'em in 1367.

1408
00:46:58,900 --> 00:46:59,900
- You're eating peas and beans.

1409
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,740
- You're eating peas and beans, yeah.

1410
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,820
That's pretty much all you have is food.

1411
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,660
- I don't want cake.

1412
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,140
- Food that's that big, right?

1413
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,300
Now imagine that food maximized 10 times

1414
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,140
the size of a cake.

1415
00:47:09,140 --> 00:47:10,840
- Well, also, this is before GMOs as well,

1416
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,380
so the peas were probably--

1417
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,700
- Peas were probably the size of a kidney stone.

1418
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,860
- I never thought about that.

1419
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,140
Peas were so small.

1420
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:19,540
- Peas are small now.

1421
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,540
Beans are small even.

1422
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,940
- I'm probably bigger than a pea.

1423
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,340
- Beans were the size of peas.

1424
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,180
- Yep.

1425
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:25,500
- And peas were probably the size of fucking nothing.

1426
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,900
- Now the beans are bigger and the peens are getting,

1427
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:28,740
the peens.

1428
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:29,560
- Yeah, peens are getting larger.

1429
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,580
- The peens were small.

1430
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,420
- Yeah.

1431
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:32,540
- Peens were not even beans.

1432
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:33,420
- Yes, I've heard this.

1433
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,860
- And now it's tall.

1434
00:47:34,860 --> 00:47:35,700
- Yeah, I think.

1435
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,180
- And that's an old British riddle.

1436
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,100
(laughing)

1437
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:40,580
- What else happened in Twickenham?

1438
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,620
- A later tradition in Twickenham

1439
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,440
may be related to the scrambling for cakes and loaves.

1440
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:49,240
The Vicar's Day charity saw a local priest climb a church tower

1441
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:51,520
and throw loaves of bread to children below.

1442
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,880
Their scrambling for food was apparently sufficiently decorous.

1443
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,520
Yes. I don't know what the hell that is.

1444
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,240
What? A bunch of ...

1445
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,640
Some Catholic priest with a fishing rod throwing ...

1446
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,800
Throwing bread down and then ...

1447
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,080
Just to kids and try to catch it. Yeah.

1448
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,240
Yeah, come on. I don't ...

1449
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:08,280
What is decor ... Oh, the number six is the Wayfarer's charity.

1450
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,760
Which this ... Wayfarer's charity sounds like a book

1451
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,480
that you see your uncle reading really hard.

1452
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,840
Yeah, one of those paperbacks from Walmart.

1453
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,040
- He's got a paper bag and he's just going.

1454
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:18,840
- Yeah, and he reads it in like one day.

1455
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,520
- Yeah, and he's like, he puts it down,

1456
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,280
never thinks about it again.

1457
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,800
Never thinks about that fucking book.

1458
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:25,760
- No, it was just a story.

1459
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,480
- Yeah, one other time in his life.

1460
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,040
If free food is good, then free booze is even better.

1461
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:34,160
It used to be that a traveler crossing Britain

1462
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,140
could expect to find charity if they needed it

1463
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,560
in most towns and villages.

1464
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,320
Religious institutions fed people

1465
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,840
and often offered them accommodation.

1466
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,000
After the dissolution of the monasteries, however,

1467
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,700
this tradition mostly died out.

1468
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,560
In Winchester, however, there is still one place

1469
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:51,420
where anyone who wants it can turn up.

1470
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,480
- Wait.

1471
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,720
- Yup.

1472
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,560
- I want to.

1473
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,120
- Turn up on a weekend.

1474
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,600
Turn up and get a piece of bread and a mug of beer.

1475
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,760
Yeah, you give me a piece of bread and a mug of beer,

1476
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,360
I'm definitely gonna turn up.

1477
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,200
- That's right.

1478
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,020
- Uh-huh.

1479
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:04,860
- I'm gonna get crazy.

1480
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:05,680
- I'm gonna make it a problem.

1481
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,520
- Beer is one thing.

1482
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,360
I might turn up a little bit on the beer.

1483
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,180
- Yeah.

1484
00:49:08,180 --> 00:49:09,020
- What the bread?

1485
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:09,860
- What the bread, though?

1486
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:10,680
- Wait.

1487
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:11,520
- Woo-wee.

1488
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:12,360
- I'm gonna eat that.

1489
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,200
Hospital of St. Cross and Elms House of Noble Poverty was a charitable house

1490
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,300
founded in 13th in the 1130s a

1491
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:26,500
French monk who brought over the custom of distributing bread and wine to the poor but beer was thought to be more of an English

1492
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,640
drink

1493
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:32,180
Today if you want to get a small meal for free all you have to do is request it at the Porter's Lodge

1494
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:36,020
Alternatively you could become one of the 25 brothers of the house

1495
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,460
Receive an apartment to live in at a reduced rent and a subsidized two-course lunch

1496
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:46,500
And that's so sick you can just fucking like if you're just related to this family you can just live

1497
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:51,620
In a house and get to two courses for lunch a day

1498
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:56,400
I would say that's how a lot of families are though. Yeah, they get to live in a house and get to me

1499
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:03,300
Yeah, but 25 brothers. Well. This is a fuck. This is an amazing movie. Yeah, but 20 foot you've seen four brothers

1500
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,100
I have uh-huh now since you multiply multiply that by

1501
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,820
Add one then multiply it by five

1502
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:15,720
25 brothers and that's the tagline of the movie

1503
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,620
That's a good idea for brothers was about four brothers

1504
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:24,860
Like killing there was a fifth. There's a fifth brother in four brothers

1505
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:30,200
I think there's only something and then they go and look for the guys who killed the fifth brother

1506
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:35,100
So imagine if that fifth brother stayed alive, okay, and they all live in one big-ass

1507
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:40,980
Apartment together with four sets of clones with four sets of clones, and they just drink beer and eat bread all day

1508
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,340
Well not all day. It says I have one

1509
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:49,940
Mug of beer and one piece of bread one loaf okay, so one by the way. That's a terrible ratio. I

1510
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:52,860
Don't want a whole loaf of bread ever

1511
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:57,140
Let alone a whole loaf of bread not with one beer to wash it down

1512
00:50:57,140 --> 00:51:01,560
I'm drinking one sip of beer for like four slices of bread that is like

1513
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,080
The first course of a Texas Roadhouse meal. What are you talking about?

1514
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:10,780
That's not a whole I'm not eating that whole loaf at Texas Roadhouse by the way if you're by yourself

1515
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:13,660
No, no and also. I'm not a tech. I don't like the bread there

1516
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,580
I like the peanuts and if we're talking bread

1517
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:21,900
I'll get brown bread and Ruby Tuesday's or I'll get brown bread at Cheesecake Factory

1518
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,260
They have brown bread at Texas Roadhouse. They've never told me about that you can get that there

1519
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:30,980
Well, I didn't order that asshole. I ordered the normal. I just get what's normal, and then I get peanuts all right

1520
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,780
Well, maybe you could order this the Butterworth dole that would look it's actually pretty good

1521
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:40,180
You know what those are that is a bun with it looks like as custard on M&Ms on it

1522
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:48,700
At the church in St. Bartholomew in Smithfield there are 21 widows who once provided with the sixpence

1523
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:54,340
Each every good Friday the widows would wait in the churchyard where the coins were laid out on a tombstone

1524
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,540
They would then walk over and take their dole

1525
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,340
"No one can say who founded the tradition

1526
00:51:58,340 --> 00:52:00,180
"or when it began because of the paperwork

1527
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:04,020
"the church was burned in the great fire of London in 1666."

1528
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:04,960
- Scary.

1529
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,100
- "Over time, fewer poor widows turned up

1530
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,680
"to claim their coin and the charity died out

1531
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,840
"when the money was left to retrieve the charity

00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,160
"in the 19th century by G.W. Butterworth

1533
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:16,640

1534
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,040
"and food to poor widows.

1535
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,740
"When the widows once dried up."

1536
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,580
- No way.

1537
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:21,620
- "Dried up."

1538
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,920
"When the widows once again dried up it,

1539
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,840
the charity, what?

1540
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:27,880
- That one's not on you.

1541
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,320
- Yeah, what the fuck?

1542
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:31,200
When the widows once again dried up it,

1543
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,360
the charity changed to a free dole of hot cross buns.

1544
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:35,200
- Wait, that's what those are like.

1545
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,520
- That's hot cross buns.

1546
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,960
- I've never, I didn't know those were real, man.

1547
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,280
What's in a hot cross bun, do you know?

1548
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:44,500
- Looks like M&Ms and a hot cross.

1549
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,440
- But what is the, that's frosting, right?

1550
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,280
- Yeah, I think it's probably custard.

1551
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,280
Maybe it's tubby custard, dude.

1552
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:51,920
- Custard is a food that just,

1553
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,640
you don't get that much in the universities,

1554
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:55,920
- Or the-- - Universities?

1555
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,480
- Or the United States, I mean.

1556
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:58,320
(laughing)

1557
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,760
- Universities of America.

1558
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:04,160
- The United States, that is more of a United Kingdom

1559
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,620
kind of food.

1560
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,940
We don't deal with custards here.

1561
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:11,360
- Uh, Shake Shack may beg to differ.

1562
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,200
- Well, but that's, brother, that is frozen.

1563
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,800
I'm talking about, they eat that shit

1564
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,040
straight out of the fridge, and it's yellow.

1565
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:20,840
- It's yellow 'cause it's like, gone bad.

1566
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,440
- It's yellow, no, it's got eggs in it.

1567
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,000
- It's yellow, that's what custard is over there.

1568
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,980
For us, we're thinking that that's gonna be

1569
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,440
some delicious frozen treat.

1570
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,020
- Basically it's an ice cream over there.

1571
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:33,360
- They don't freeze that.

1572
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:34,540
It's a full pudding.

1573
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:36,060
- They're pretty, fuck off.

1574
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:38,800
They're pretty lenient with what they call pudding

1575
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,040
over across the pond too.

1576
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,240
- That's true, black pudding and white pudding.

1577
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,360
Is that what it is, right?

1578
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:44,600
- I don't think there's a white pudding.

1579
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,680
- Yeah, the sausages, there's white pudding, I saw this.

1580
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,840
- I saw white pudding in my shorts when I woke up.

1581
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,100
- No you didn't.

1582
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:53,520
I had a dream.

1583
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,360
- No.

1584
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:56,280
- I had a dream that I was Dua Lipa's slave.

1585
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,940
(laughing)

1586
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,780
- Dua Lipa?

1587
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:02,420
Her slave?

1588
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:03,260
That was your dream?

1589
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,540
- Number four, beating the bounds in Leighton, Busset.

1590
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,780
(laughing)

1591
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,540
- These are so bad.

1592
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:11,360
- Bro, beating the bounds.

1593
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,940
Edward Wilkes built 10 almshouses

1594
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,500
to provide shelter for the poor in 1630

1595
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,060
in memory of his father John.

1596
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,140
When Edward died, he asked that beer and bread

1597
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:24,080
be given out every Rogation Tide,

1598
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:28,120
and the tradition of the Wilks Walk originated to honor him.

1599
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:28,960
- The Wilks Walk.

1600
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,320
- You know the Rogation Tide?

1601
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,600
- I've been to every single one in my entire life.

1602
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,960
- Oh yeah, I do a Wilks Walk every year.

1603
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,320
- I grew up with Wilks Walks.

1604
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:37,400
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1605
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,760
- Yeah, well, Rogation days are often observed

1606
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,200
with a beating of the bounds when a procession is made

1607
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:45,360
around the borders of a parish to ensure

1608
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,880
that the memory where the boundaries lay was continued.

1609
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,760
On Rogation Monday in Leighton Buzzard,

1610
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:53,260
"The procession leaves All Saints Church,

1611
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:56,060
"passes the almshouses, and into the market square.

1612
00:54:56,060 --> 00:54:58,320
"To make it memorable, while the clerk reads

1613
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,300
"from Edward Wilkes' Will, a choir boy

1614
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:03,560
"is hoisted by its ankles."

1615
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:05,520
- No, here's what I never wanna hear again.

1616
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:07,840
Here's a word I never wanna hear again, parish.

1617
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:08,680
- Yeah.

1618
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,000
- Unless it has to do with--

1619
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,040
- With the church?

1620
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,280
Damn, you're getting atheistically awesome right now.

1621
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:15,640
- I would like to see the church parish,

1622
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:18,360
but when it comes to, it's called a county, okay?

1623
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,600
I don't wanna hear about a parish.

1624
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,040
Louisiana get the fuck out of my face you are a backwards at by the way

1625
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,920
And I don't mean I don't know if anyone said this to you guys before in Louisiana. You look like a boot

1626
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:34,040
Bro be careful, I'm sorry so you can someone's gonna. What are you gonna? Do you gonna put butter?

1627
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,560
You're gonna. Give me butter people is Shreveport are gonna rise up and beat the fuck out of you

1628
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,560
Yeah, they're gonna be

1629
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:42,280
They're gonna shriek and fort they're gonna shriek and they're gonna

1630
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:49,240
About stinking mad they are what I said about them because all that crawfish atoufee

1631
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,240
They yeah, stop eating that bullshit get that out of your mouth rice is supposed to be chewy

1632
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,120
Mm-hmm stop make it in a fucking pudding actually like that

1633
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,440
I'm actually down with that

1634
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,820
Buns and beer were once given out, but it was found beer made for two festive in event. Oh, and it was buns and lemonade

1635
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:10,920
They're putting they're putting lemonade on a choir boys buns and over there. They need to chill

1636
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,120
- They need to chill.

1637
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,320
- It was stopped when thousands of buns were consumed

1638
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:16,000
and the ladies of the parish could not keep up.

1639
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,720
Now the buns are even out in church.

1640
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:19,880
- The next one here, bull baiting.

1641
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:20,880
- Bro.

1642
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,400
- Guess what this one's about.

1643
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,920
- Probably about boxing.

1644
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,600
That's what I think, anytime I see meat hanging

1645
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:26,800
from a thing I wanna punch it.

1646
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:27,880
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1647
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:30,460
- That's a good, I also wanna do that.

1648
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:32,920
Sometimes charity, no matter how well intentioned,

1649
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:33,760
can do harm.

1650
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,360
When George Staverton died in 1661,

1651
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,480
he left a sum in his will so that poor,

1652
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,720
the poor people of Wokingham--

1653
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,000
Wait, wipe it off the map.

1654
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Take it away from me.

1655
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,200
We're going to go full preemptive strike on Wokingham.

1656
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,700
Yeah.

1657
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:50,240
I don't know if you guys have ever seen a little movie called

1658
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,320
Hot Fuzz, but we will be doing that in Wokingham.

1659
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,360
We're going in there two guns a blazing.

1660
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,000
Yes.

1661
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:56,720
Going to just--

1662
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,760
[GUNFIRE]

1663
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,240
--all over that damn town.

1664
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,080
Yes, sir.

1665
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,400
Fucking blue hair town of Wokingham.

1666
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,840
I don't even want to see a--

1667
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:07,360
wait, wait, Jubio, can you look up a picture of Wokingham

1668
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,280
real quick?

1669
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,080
Yeah, let's see it.

1670
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:15,320
I do when I have a strong feeling that I know what exactly what this is gonna look like Williamsburg in 19 wait

1671
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,640
Okay, so two dozen. Yeah. Yeah. Oh of course. That's let me guess. That's where the adults go to work

1672
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,280
It's a playground and look they're feeding click go back over there

1673
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:30,880
They're waiting a lion to all these kids to a lion wait go back one look at the name of this park

1674
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:37,080
California Country Park in Wokingham, they're so woke. Oh, they're naming their shit, California

1675
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,480
This is disgusting.

1676
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,160
Joel Park, that's probably a girl's name.

1677
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:42,880
That's probably a guy.

1678
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,320
That's probably a guy who lives there.

1679
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,280
Joel Park.

1680
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,040
Cantley Park.

1681
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:48,800
Bear Wood.

1682
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,240
They think bears should be in the woods instead of the zoo.

1683
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,800
The bears should be in the zoo.

1684
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,560
Get the bears back to the zoo.

1685
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:58,040
That's where the bears should be.

1686
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:00,000
Wokingham Resident, I don't even want to see a picture

1687
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,640
of these people.

1688
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,680
I don't want to because I bet they have blue hair.

1689
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:03,440
Oh my god.

1690
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,440
This Wokingham resident has a headache

1691
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,940
because of all the frickin' pronouns they have to hear.

1692
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,600
- That is probably the only patriot

1693
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,900
in the whole fuckin' parish,

1694
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:13,160
and I don't even like to use that word I just said.

1695
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,660
- And look.

1696
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,060
- And look, that guy thinks it's cool

1697
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:19,580
to be in a wheelchair in Wokingham.

1698
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,820
(laughing)

1699
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:25,680
- Look at this SJW with the blue hair.

1700
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,520
- Well, and you might think,

1701
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,820
oh, this person is probably in their 90s.

1702
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,660
That guy's 15.

1703
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:33,520
That's just what wokeness does to the human body.

1704
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,600
That is a 15-year-old guy.

1705
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,560
Don't-- or ignore the--

1706
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:38,600
And look at his hair that he dyed silver.

1707
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,520
Oh, and of course, they shop at REI.

1708
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,020
Yeah.

1709
00:58:41,020 --> 00:58:42,200
[LAUGHTER]

1710
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:43,640
He has another Wokey.

1711
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:45,240
He has another Wokey.

1712
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,000
OK, sorry.

1713
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,600
All right, that's enough about Wokey.

1714
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:52,320
Yeah, so basically what happened here

1715
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:54,240
is that every year just before Christmas,

1716
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,920
they would bring a bull into the center of town.

1717
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,560
Oh, no.

1718
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,720
And bull baiting was a practice where they would just

1719
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,720
unleash like bulldogs and shit up to fight these bulls.

1720
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,560
(laughs)

1721
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:08,720
- Bulls versus dogs?

1722
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,040
- Bulls versus dogs.

1723
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,340
So the bulls, they saw tethered bulls pitted against dogs

1724
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:14,240
in vicious fights.

1725
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,360
Many dogs were gored to death before the bulls--

1726
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,200
- Oh my god.

1727
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,580
- The bulls eventually succumbed to their wounds.

1728
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,840
Then their meat would be handed out to the hungry.

1729
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,520
So they'd have a bunch of dogs in the middle of this town

1730
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,240
just biting the shit out of this bull.

1731
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,880
- And people's dogs are just flying everywhere,

1732
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:28,720
breaking their necks and--

1733
00:59:28,720 --> 00:59:32,220
Oh my god, the bull is like horn into the thing,

1734
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,560
into this dog.

1735
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,800
And these are not, by the way,

1736
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:36,240
these are not American bullies.

1737
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,080
No, no.

1738
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,200
These are basically still wolves.

1739
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,900
Yeah, oh yeah.

1740
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,440
So then they would just like,

1741
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,480
then they finally stopped doing it in 1821.

1742
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,200
Or maybe corgis now that I think about it,

1743
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,040
'cause of the way they are.

1744
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:47,960
'Cause of the queen.

1745
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,980
Yeah, what is this next one here?

1746
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:52,440
Thomasing?

1747
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:54,080
What is Thomasing?

1748
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,080
Thomasing is a tradition, blah, blah, blah.

1749
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:00,680
It's also known as gooding, corning, doling,

1750
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:05,400
washaling, Christmasing, gathering, mumping, moping.

1751
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,900
So basically what you do is you go door to door

1752
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:10,040
and you beg, sometimes you get booze.

1753
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,120
Mostly it looks like you get potatoes and pudding and shit.

1754
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,800
- Okay, I've been thinking about this for a long time.

1755
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:17,800
There needs to be a year-round trick-or-treating for food.

1756
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,160
- Yep, well this is Christmas trick-or-treating

1757
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:21,780
and it's called Thomasing. - Oh shit, okay.

1758
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:22,880
Well that's better.

1759
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,160
Yeah, I guess a year-round--

1760
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,600
I guess there was an old lady who tried to go out and do

1761
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,440
Thomasing in the 90s.

1762
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,040
She went mumping for spuds, and the farmer

1763
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,720
told her to clear off.

1764
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,920
And then she said, you're not going to get a good crop

1765
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,680
next year, and then he didn't.

1766
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:41,280
So that was a news story in the UK.

1767
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:41,960
Yeah.

1768
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:43,880
In the UK, they were like, an old lass

1769
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,840
went mumping for spuds.

1770
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,800
And the farmer told her to clear off.

1771
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,200
And that's the biggest news story of the year.

1772
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:51,700
Wow.

1773
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,800
That is an amazing country.

1774
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,800
- This happened, the thing, the reason--

1775
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:57,340
- This is what UK Drill is about.

1776
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,560
- Yeah, this is like, oh, I went mumping for spuds.

1777
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,720
- Said clear off.

1778
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,240
- Getting a tub, getting a tub coming in spuds, sluds.

1779
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:08,600
- Yeah, and they don't have a gun, so it's the sounds of--

1780
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,360
- SpongeBob, got the suds.

1781
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,760
- I mean, what else is there to rap about, right?

1782
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,180
- This happened, what I read is that this happened,

1783
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:19,200
we didn't hear about this in the States because--

1784
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,760
- And you didn't hear about this from me.

1785
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:25,160
- The day after they did Diana.

1786
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,240
- They did her dirty.

1787
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,320
- They did her dirty in that car.

1788
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:31,280
Somebody shot her through a window in that car.

1789
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:33,800
- I don't remember, I honestly don't even know

1790
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:34,640
who that is almost.

1791
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:35,460
- Princess Diana?

1792
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,640
- Barely 5% do I know who that was.

1793
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,880
- I know that she danced with John Travolta,

1794
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,080
but that's because my mom had a coffee table book

1795
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,920
of John Travolta photos.

1796
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:46,320
- You were thinking Uma Thurman.

1797
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:47,160
- No, no, no, no.

1798
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,880
- You're literally thinking of, like dance like this,

1799
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:51,340
like back and forth in a club.

1800
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,560
- In a 50's diner?

1801
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,280
- Yeah, that was Uma Thurman.

1802
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,520
That's not Princess Diana at all.

1803
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,340
Princess Diana, Uma Thurman almost died.

1804
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:59,080
Quentin Tarantino almost killed her with a movie

1805
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,660
and that's why they don't work together by the way.

1806
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,040
If anybody wants to Hollywood fact check me,

1807
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,520
go ahead, I'll pass every test.

1808
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:06,480
But yeah. - You're telling me.

1809
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,320
- That's Uma Thurman.

1810
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,560
- Quentin, or Princess Diana.

1811
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:10,400
- She did not try to kill Bill.

1812
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,380
- She doesn't have black hair.

1813
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:14,220
- No.

1814
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:15,760
- And she's not, you know.

1815
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:16,960
- I mean she probably did.

1816
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,800
- Yeah.

1817
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:22,920
real reason she died. Oh, she overdosed in the car? I don't, I was, yeah, probably some

1818
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:26,520
kind of fentanyl situation. And then she died, she killed her friend too. That's

1819
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,960
sad. Yeah, it is pretty sad. She got flattened like a pancake. Yeah. And then number one

1820
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,720
here is cheese rolling. Boy, this actually looks so fun. What this is, they fling

1821
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,800
themselves down a hill and they just want to roll up the double Gloucester

1822
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:45,200
cheese. Isn't that what Wallace wants? Wallace? Wallace and Gromit, he wants double Gloucester.

1823
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,500
- Wallace wants bones, he's a dog.

1824
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,580
- No, Gromit's the dog.

1825
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,140
- What kind of name is Gromit for a dog?

1826
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:54,940
- You think Gromit's the name of a man?

1827
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:57,700
- More so than a dog, Gromit.

1828
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,140
- You think that Wallace is the dog?

1829
01:03:00,140 --> 01:03:03,300
- I don't think, I know that he's the dog.

1830
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:04,140
- No.

1831
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,900
- Yeah, it's Gromit. - That's not true.

1832
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,460
- It's Gromit.

1833
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:11,460
- You're completely fabricating this.

1834
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:14,420
- No, he's the, no, Gromit wants,

1835
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,700
By the way, what is a better name for a guy

1836
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:18,200
who's like fucking addicted to cheese,

1837
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,620
such a slob, than Gromit?

1838
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,880
- It's a dog's name.

1839
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:23,020
- It's his last name.

1840
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:23,860
Of course it's his last name.

1841
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,900
- His name isn't, his name, his last name is not,

1842
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,500
his name isn't Wallace Gromit.

1843
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,020
- No, Wallace is the dog.

1844
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:29,840
His name is probably--

1845
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,020
- His name is Gromit Wallace?

1846
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,700
- No, his name is, his last name is Gromit.

1847
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:33,820
He goes by Gromit.

1848
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:37,100
- What's the, what's his first name then?

1849
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:38,300
- They don't say, it's kind of a mystery.

1850
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:39,460
It's like the whole point of the show.

1851
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:40,900
- The whole point of the show--

1852
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:41,740
- Not the whole point.

1853
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:44,540
the moon to get cheese.

1854
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,420
Is Gromit the dog?

1855
01:03:48,420 --> 01:03:49,420
It says no.

1856
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,420
Gromit is...

1857
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:51,420
No, it says he is!

1858
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:52,420
It says he's a beagle.

1859
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,420
And he graduated from Dogwarts.

1860
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,420
Okay, so you tell me...

1861
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:57,420
Being a pun on Hogwarts.

1862
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,420
Okay so...

1863
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,420
Wikipedia...

1864
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,420
Wait, that's Wikipedia.

1865
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:01,420
Wikipedia is not a source, honey.

1866
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:02,420
Gromit.

1867
01:04:02,420 --> 01:04:05,060
Oh look, there they are.

1868
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,340
There's Gromit and Wallace.

1869
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:09,340
Yeah, Wallace is the guy.

1870
01:04:09,340 --> 01:04:10,340
There he is.

1871
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:11,340
That...

1872
01:04:11,340 --> 01:04:15,180
So they, they, uh, only one person can get the double Gloucester.

1873
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,020
And, uh, no one knows when it first started, but during COVID,

1874
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:21,660
they just rolled cheese down the hill.

1875
01:04:21,660 --> 01:04:24,100
I'd be at the bottom of that hill.

1876
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,580
I'd be my bottom job, my top job and trying to eat the whole

1877
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:30,700
everybody's screaming. You put your mask on, put your mask on.

1878
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,180
Cause it was like probably at a time where I bet they know much about what was

1879
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:34,700
going on.

1880
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,660
Okay. I would like to say this to the UK people right now,

1881
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,820
when you guys are wearing masks, we,

1882
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,100
everybody in the United States was just pretending to.

1883
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:42,940
- Yep.

1884
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:43,980
- None of us actually wore that shit.

1885
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,580
- We were so happy that you started putting your masks on

1886
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:48,700
over there. - To cover that shit up.

1887
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,900
- To cover up these things.

1888
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:51,060
- Yeah, and by the way,

1889
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,140
take it from two people with perfect teeth.

1890
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:54,660
- Look at my teeth.

1891
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:56,780
- You people are disgusting to us.

1892
01:04:56,780 --> 01:05:00,420
- There's nothing, there's not a single thing wrong

1893
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:01,380
with any of my teeth.

1894
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,220
- I really don't like that the--

1895
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:04,300
- And here is the video of the cheese rolling.

1896
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,140
- Okay, let's look at this real quick.

1897
01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:06,940
- 'Cause this is actually dope.

1898
01:05:06,940 --> 01:05:08,020
- It's a compilation.

1899
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:14,820
a compilation of cheese rolling. Best Top! And it's from Best Top. Is it B-Stop or Best

1900
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:20,740
Top? I think that's Best Top. Best Top. Okay, so there's a big hill. Uh huh. Oh my god. And

1901
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:26,500
suggested as Big Parkour Fails compilation. This looks so incredible. Which I'm kinda,

1902
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:31,460
I'm maybe gonna watch that later. Wait, people are already rolling. Or falling. Yeah, is

1903
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:36,420
the point to roll down the hill? Yeah, oh these guys are getting really hurt, man. Yeah. Okay,

1904
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:39,320
I don't man. I don't want to see this. These are probably migrant workers

1905
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:43,740
Who are trying to make a quick buck or they are gonna resell the cheese?

1906
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,500
Do you yeah, do you think that they have these people are dead?

1907
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:52,860
Do you think that they have like rich guys in the UK who pay a migrant worker to roll down the cheese hill for them?
