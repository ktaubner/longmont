8
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,800
- Ooh.

9
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,960
Ooh, that smell.

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,800
Remember that Leonard Scanner song?

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,640
♪ The smell again from around you ♪

12
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,080
- Such a sick song, dude.

13
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,920
- What song?

14
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
♪ Ooh, that smell ♪

15
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,680
♪ Can't you smell that smell ♪

16
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,520
- I don't know that song.

17
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,960
♪ Smell the shit and bad things ♪

18
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,960
- In the 70s, like, you didn't have to

19
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,760
like all the songs you just come up with like one sentence.

20
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,600
Yeah, they didn't know like about lyrics really back then.

21
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,200
It didn't have to be about anything at all.

22
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,480
Yeah, that's why Blue Orester Colt wrote "Guts" a lot.

23
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,200
Lyrics had just been invented. It was basically like Beethoven and then Skinner and the Beatles

24
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,040
and the Beatles tried to make it all about doing drugs and Skinner were just like,

25
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:55,160
"Y'all smell that? Wait, start playing guitar. Ooh, that smell." It's one of the best songs ever.

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,640
Yeah.

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,120
Yeah. He also made that song about a homeless guy.

28
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,840
What's it called?

29
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:04,660
Sweet Home Alabama. Curtis Lowe? No. Sweet Home Alabama. Sweet Home Alabama is not about a

30
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:09,660
homeless guy, it's about a state. Nah. Who did Free Bird? Did they do Free Bird? Yeah, Free Bird.

31
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,860
I saw them live in like 2011. Really? One of the sickest concerts ever. Yeah, half of them are

32
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:19,260
dead. Yeah, they're all dead. Also, they did this, like, they interrupted one of their

33
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,900
songs themselves to pull out a giant Confederate flag and be like, "We're sorry

34
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,120
if this offends any y'all we really like we're not into they said we're not into

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:37,000
slavery or nothing he's like you're like this is just we just think this is but

36
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,440
just about the coolest flag there is everybody we went before I was losing my

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,880
mind it's so funny to see a band like that what like like that late like I

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,680
remember my my neighbor who is like a year younger than me it was like bragging

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,620
to me in like like twenty like

40
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:56,120
nineteen that he saw the dead

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,840
Kennedy's.

42
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,500
Yeah, it gives a shit about the

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,920
dead. It's a funny like seeing

44
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,240
the dead.

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,960
You can have like twenty nineteen.

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,840
Yeah, like what the fuck is that

47
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,760
specifically funny because

48
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,320
Leonard Skinner only they were

49
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,400
only all alive for like four

50
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,680
years and then they all died in a

51
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,760
plane crash and then like it was

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,520
and I don't think there's a

53
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
single original member now.

54
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,480
It's like everybody's brother

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,720
now. Yeah, yeah. Isn't it? And they're just fucking, they suck. But it was awesome. It

56
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,520
doesn't even say, it's like seeing AC/DC now. Yeah. It's like the worst, like, yeah.

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:34,840
It's like going to see like Mozart now. Yeah, exactly. It's like this guy, it's like, that's

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,040
not even the real one, you fucking idiot. Going to see, you're seeing 50 people. Half

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,440
the guys from Mozart are dead. That's my problem. All right. So you go to see Mozart or Beethoven

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:48,400
now, right? Now it is 50 people, takes 50 people to do the job of one guy. Yeah. Back

61
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,280
in their heyday it's just Mozart. Now you got to get there's a little

62
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,880
there's like a 15 year old Japanese kid with like a violin and shit.

63
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,720
He used to do all, he was a one man band. Beethoven used to do that shit when he was deaf too.

64
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,520
Yeah he was deaf and blind. He was deaf and blind and he was stupid too actually.

65
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,760
He was medically stupid. He was one of the stupidest people of all time.

66
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,840
He ate too many like paint chips. You know what people don't know about him?

67
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,040
he had no arms or legs.

68
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,440
- Yeah.

69
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,160
- And he ate the paint chips.

70
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,000
- He couldn't play an instrument either.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,960
- Yeah, yeah.

72
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,760
- He would bite the paint chips and then like,

73
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,400
as soon as like the,

74
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,320
they would come off the wall,

75
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,400
it would start making sounds.

76
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,380
- And the thing about that is the most beautiful thing

77
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,220
I've ever heard.

78
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,160
- Back then they didn't even have paint,

79
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,280
so he was just eating wood.

80
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,120
- Yeah.

81
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,940
- Yeah.

82
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,120
- And he had no arms and legs, so he--

83
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,960
- Well he had no arms and legs,

84
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,640
but a lot of people don't realize is that,

85
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,120
he came up with MC Escher, right?

86
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,640
That was like his favorite rapper and shit.

87
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,480
- Yeah.

88
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,480
basically designed you know his funny staircases that go forever? He designed one of those

89
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,480
and he had piano keys. So the way that it would happen is he would just push him down

90
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,480
that and he would just fall and hit all the correct notes.

91
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,480
It was like the most beautiful thing ever. And nowadays fucking Skrillex

92
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,480
hits his space bar on his laptop and he writes the whole song for him.

93
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Skrillex sits up there. A hundred guys who work for him who writes

94
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:13,480
the songs. Sits up there and presses a staples button. That's his whole job now.

95
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
That's a band.

96
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,160
- Oh my God, yeah.

97
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,520
And don't get me started on his hair.

98
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,880
It's like, why don't you get some

99
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,000
on the other side of your head too?

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,180
- Yeah, also, why don't you,

101
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,120
while you're at it, why don't you grow some huge boobs

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,680
and a giant beautiful ass to be a little bit of a girl?

103
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,200
- Yeah, exactly.

104
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,680
How about you try picking up a guitar once in your life?

105
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
- He's a good Skrillex.

106
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,680
If you're gonna do this, just put a bikini on.

107
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,320
You gotta stop spending those turntables

108
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,720
and breakdancing, Skrillex.

109
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,080
- Yeah, it's disrespectful to the audience.

110
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,720
- It's disrespectful to the vinyl.

111
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,280
- Put your pants up, Skrillex.

112
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,540
That's not what I was drawn with.

113
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,540
Oh, I am.

114
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,740
Skrillex, pull your pants up.

115
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:47,740
Damn it.

116
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,040
Unless you're showing me a beautiful surgery that you got to look like a...

117
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,040
You can lead a horse to water.

118
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
You can lead Caleb into a racist pit.

119
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
How's that racist?

120
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,040
He's white.

121
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Fucking idiot.

122
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
It's not even racist.

123
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Yeah, it is.

124
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Do you know what Skrillex looks like?

125
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,040
Yeah.

126
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,040
He's a white guy.

127
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
What does he look like to you?

128
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
He's Colombian.

129
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Is that Colombian?

130
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Yeah, he is.

131
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
No, he's not.

132
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,040
Yes, he is.

133
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Skrillex?

134
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,040
Uh-huh.

135
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
It's not even a Colombian.

136
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,040
You're not rolling the Ls.

137
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040

Yeah, it was originally supposed to be the song that the popcorn comes out and dances to before the movies

146

That's what the Beatles wrote yeah, and then Skrillex is like I'm gonna steal this real quick and

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,780
You fucker.

169
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,780
Yeah. Hey, while we're at it, use a smaller computer. You got a giant machine up there.

170
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,780
Yeah, exactly.

171
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,780
You know how many children built that in the third world?

172
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:46,780
Do you know how many people got shot in the back of the head to harvest those silicon chips to make that giant machine with a hundred knobs?

173
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,780
You don't need all those knobs. A guitar has, what, four or five strings? That's all you need.

174
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:57,780
Plus, this fucker's playing 30 seconds of a song and then starts blending a smoothie and a Vitamix for the rest of the fucking duration of the song.

175
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,460
duration of the concert.

176
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,100
- That's right. - I wanna hear that.

177
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,620
- You know how hard it is to find those

178
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,500
silicon chips in the mine?

179
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,060
They're fully formed in there.

180
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,360
- Yeah, yeah.

181
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,300
- We're just finding the RTXs down there.

182
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,260
- That's why it's so hard.

183
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,340
- That's why it's so hard.

184
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:14,420
People are getting fucking shot in the back of the,

185
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:16,700
they're finding full RTXs in those mines.

186
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:20,900
- I wish they did like how Jordans were in the 90s

187
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,620
where kids are getting killed on the street.

188
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,300
They should start doing that for graphics cards.

189
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,260
- They should start doing that for them?

190
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,100
- For graphics cards, yeah.

191
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,900
I'm sure people in the '30s and '90s.

192
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,260
I'm sure that's happening, actually.

193
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,100
You think so?

194
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,060
Yeah, I think that's actually happening.

195
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,100
It's happening, but it's not like that.

196
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,420
It's just like you just get swatted.

197
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,260
True, yeah.

198
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,260
Your house gets swatted by someone at the FBI

199
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,100
who wanted one.

200
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,660
That would be pretty smart to swat someone,

201
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,540
and then you go to like fucking Halloween and more,

202
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,980
or whatever, pick up a swat outfit,

203
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,060
and you just walk in with them.

204
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,220
'Cause they all got their faces covered.

205
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,620
They're not gonna notice you, right?

206
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,500
You're gonna blend in with all the stock guys.

207
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,340
I'm McDonald's. That's my...

208
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,060
We need to check all his food for anthrax.

209
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,620
And he started eating everything out of the guy's fridge and shit.

210
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,900
-Pretty smart. -Then you take his RTX out of his computer.

211
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,740
What if his N64's a bomb? We have to test it.

212
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,500
Yeah, we have to test this by playing Clayfighter.

213
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
Yeah.

214
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,180
-It's pretty smart. -That is smart.

215
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,380
Look, take that Clay... Look, he has a copy of...

216
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,100
-He has the rare copy of Clayfighter. -Clayfighter is a smart game to be a bomb

217
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,540
because nobody's coming over to your house and going,

218
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,980
"Yo, let's play Clayfighter."

219
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,300
Yeah, what's a clay fighter 63 and a third the director's cut he has that in the box

220
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,980
We have to open that one up. I've never got that we have to open up in front of him

221
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,140
So we just to make sure that was a 64 game

222
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:39,500
Yeah, that was bad in 64 was like I feel like the last thing what it's called. I don't play for you

223
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,780
It's clay for clay fighter or fuck. I might be thinking there's one with the with the dots, too

224
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,220
Do you know the ones where it's like if they all look they're all made of like a game where you play glove?

225
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,500
Yeah, over yeah, it's coolest game ever a glover before

226
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,340
- That was so cool.

227
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,160
- You guys ever played West 64?

228
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,000
- Dude, what was the name of,

229
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,740
do you know the name of the dots fighting game?

230
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,020
The one where they're like all just dots floating around?

231
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,260
Somebody will know, somebody will message it to us.

232
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,380
- Oh, that was Dots Fighter.

233
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,140
- It might have been Dots Fighter.

234
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,540
But that's so funny 'cause they were like,

235
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,740
oh, let's see, Street Fighter's super successful,

236
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,620
like Mortal Kombat's super successful,

237
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,620
like let's make a version of these games

238
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,940
where instead of having any characters,

239
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,820
we'll just put a bunch of dots on the screen.

240
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,820
(laughing)

241
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,100
- It's smart, dude.

242
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:26,100
That was like, that was the era where you could just make any game, because like nobody knew what was a good game then.

243
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
Oh yeah, dude, there's this one...

244
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,100
I had no clue.

245
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,100
There's one game for like Atari Jaguar, I never played it but I remember it from an AVGN review,

246
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,100
where like, it's like a dinosaur or some shit and he's fighting like a Scottish guy,

247
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:45,100
who one of his attacks is he lifts up his kilt and a fireball comes out of his dick.

248
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:47,100
Daaaaaaamn.

249
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,100
That's sick.

250
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,100
That is sick.

251
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:52,220
yeah they need to bring shit like that back but there's a thing like they have

252
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,900
shit like that still

253
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,860
but it's like

254
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,260
not good

255
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,700
for usually not a good game

256
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,380
so i guess it's never really left

257
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,860
it's also free on steam i mean like you can't get one of those games

258
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,780
on like the xbox what's the newest one xbox 360

259
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:11,660
one thousand yeah you can't get it on the xbox 360 no no no playstation 3

260
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,580
it's called balls with a z

261
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,300
no look at these characters this is what the characters look like in this

262
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:22,460
fighting game. It looked like... That was on Super Nintendo? Yeah. Oh, so that must have

263
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,880
been just to show like... Fighting at its ballsiest. Is it? Yeah, it's like a 3D

264
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,180
Super Nintendo game. Look at these. But they had like Street Fighter and shit on

265
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,620
the Super Nintendo. Like it's not like they couldn't make like characters.

266
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:38,460
They're already 3D. That was just to show off that Super Nintendo could be

267
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,980
graphically impressive at all. It could make a ball. But then it still looks like shit because they're made out of

268
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,340
balls. Yeah. They're just different colored balls. It's impossible to tell

269
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,220
what's going on in any screenshot too because they don't have any like

329
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,980
- They're carding kids for L-carnitine now?

330
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,140
- That's what she said. - What's L-carnitine?

331
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:39,980
- It says it on the can. - Nothing.

332
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,500
It's just one of those things that they put on a thing

333
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,140
that is like, just--

334
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,660
- She was like, "Yeah, I think it's 'cause of that,

335
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,020
"but I need to card you for this."

336
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,860
And I was like--

337
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,500
- So the computer was telling her to card you?

338
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,500
- I think so, yeah.

339
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,420
- What the fuck, which store was this?

340
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,260
- The one--

341
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,100
- The Walgreens?

342
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,080
- Yeah, the Walgreens.

343
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,880
- What in God's holy name is happening to this city?

344
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,720
- Yeah, that's not okay.

345
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,260
- First they ban the 64 ounce soda.

346
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,100
- Yeah.

347
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,540
- Which is like, come on bro.

348
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,060
- I mean, that's all right.

349
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,340
I don't care too much.

350
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,940
- 64 ounces of soda?

351
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,940
- 64 ounces, like I could do 40 ounces of soda,

352
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,980
but 64 ounces, I think I'm getting old,

353
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,340
that'll just give me a tummy ache.

354
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,360
- It's called an all day pop.

355
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,420
- Nah, not for me.

356
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,700
- It's an ADP.

357
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,700
It's not for me.

358
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,180
Yeah, dude, walk, get a Diet Coke.

359
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,540
Yeah, but then the ice melts and then it's just like watered down.

360
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,540
Don't.

361
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,740
Who's getting ice in their soda?

362
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Me.

363
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,380
It comes out cold.

364
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,820
It comes out cold, but it doesn't stay cold.

365
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Drink it fast.

366
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
Drink it too, yeah.

367
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
Yeah.

368
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,620
I'm not going to sit there drinking a soda all day.

369
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,620
What the fuck?

370
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,180
It's called an all-day pop.

371
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,180
What the fuck?

372
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,180
It's just a name, you idiot.

373
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,180
It's no, no, no, no, no.

374
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,180
It's just the name of the...

375
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,180
It's just the name of the cup size.

376
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,180
Fuck you.

377
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
No, you can't change it now.

378
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,180
It's a name.

379
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,180
You're not making any sense.

380
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,180
You're not making any sense.

381
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:58,180
You said you're not going to drink it all day.

382
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,180
You know those beers, the all day IPA?

383
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:05,180
What do you start drinking at 6 in the morning and finish them at midnight?

384
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:06,180
No.

385
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:08,180
It's the same thing with an ADP.

386
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:10,180
What's an all day IPA?

387
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,180
It's like a low alcohol IPA.

388
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,180
There's almost no alcohol in an ADP.

389
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,180
I mean, you can put some in there.

390
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,180
Shit, here's the move.

391
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,260
- That's why you got carded.

392
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,100
- Here's the move for the ADP.

393
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,780
I mean, well, it's gone now in New York.

394
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,100
So, hold on.

395
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,500
- Here's what would be the move.

396
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
- Here's what would be the move.

397
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,240
You fill it up halfway, go to the liquor store next door,

398
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,900
put like a thing of one of those smaller bottles

399
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:46,620
of vodka or Jameson in it, then you got all day partay.

400
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,460
- Okay.

401
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,280
- Ah, different ADP.

402
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,860
I will say, if you're filling it up halfway,

403
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,360
you're gonna put 32 ounces of vodka in it?

404
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,160
- Okay, three quarters of the way.

405
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,000
Three quarters of the way.

406
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
- 16 ounces of vodka in it?

407
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,480
- Yes.

408
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
It's an all day partay.

409
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,560
- That's true.

410
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,640
- It's gotta last you all day.

411
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,960
- I cannot argue with that.

412
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,800
- That's a very good point.

413
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,680
- 16 shots of vodka during the day.

414
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,640
- Yep.

415
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
- Sounds pretty good actually.

416
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,120
- Yeah, you're not gonna be drinking it all day though.

417
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,760
- Over the course of the day.

418
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,640
- Yeah, go to work and be like,

419
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,920
- Listen baby, I'm a fucking sanitation man.

420
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,240
I gotta get through this day somehow.

421
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,800
- Man, I gotta drink just 'cause I hate the smell of my job.

422
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,080
- I bet going to work-- - Just my normal big soda

423
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,400
for the day. - I mean those guys,

424
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,280
they're stupid if they don't just get drunk all day, right?

425
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,680
- Who, who? - Sanitation guys?

426
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,000
- Well I guess the guy in the back of the truck

427
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,080
can get drunk.

428
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,560
- Yeah, well he's like literally on a rock.

429
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,040
He's on the stinkiest roller coaster they have.

430
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,800
- Exactly, yeah, you get drunk on that thing,

431
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
it becomes a roller coaster.

432
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,240
- You know that people in New York,

433
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,540
people die like all the time as garbage men because there's like

434
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,940
two garbage men that you can be you can work for the city and

435
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,040
have like normal hours where you collecting garbage at like 6

436
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,040
in the morning and it's pretty normal or you can work for one

437
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,340
of these like these like evil private garbage companies that

438
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,740
like tell these guys are like you have to pick up trash at

439
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:09,640
like 4,000 houses in one hour and they're like why go go go

440
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,640
go go go and they just fucking all of them die Jesus. Yeah,

441
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
That's so cool.

442
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,640
That's sick.

443
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,320
Being a garbage man does sound like...

444
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
High stakes.

445
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
Like, yeah.

446
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,840
It's the most respectable job.

447
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
Well, here...

448
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
What?

449
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,840
I smell like shit all day.

450
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
My dad used to be a garbage man.

451
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
He told me...

452
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,240
This is something that really excited me about the occupation is that when they collect...

453
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,280
Like if people leave furniture, like couches or stuff, when they pick it up, they go through

454
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,960
all the cushions and get all the change.

455
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,280
And then they get to saw the couch up into pieces and throw it into the truck.

456
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,280
That is so cool.

457
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,120
- That's awesome.

458
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:43,960
- That is actually so sick.

459
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,580
- Just imagine finding like 20 bucks

460
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,520
that someone forgot to take the cushion off.

461
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,960
Like that would be the coolest thing ever.

462
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,640
- A friend of mine, he was a garbage man for one day

463
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,800
and he like went, it's so stupid,

464
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,140
he like got in his car, drove to the dump,

465
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,800
got out and just smelled it and vomited.

466
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,720
(laughing)

467
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,440
And he just left.

468
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,620
- Damn.

469
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:07,460
I think--

470
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,460
- So funny.

471
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,760
- My uncle Kevin, when he was a garbage man,

472
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
He was like living with us at the time.

473
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,000
And I think he was for like two weeks

474
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,080
and then quit but didn't tell my mom that he quit.

475
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,160
But then was just pretending to go to work as a garbage man

476
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,920
and would just sit at the beach all day.

477
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,000
And then come home, he would pack himself a lunch

478
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,600
and then sit at the beach all day.

479
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,160
- And then before he came home though,

480
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
he'd have to roll around in trash

481
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,520
to make sure it was full.

482
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,480
- Yeah, he jumps in the dumpsters

483
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,320
covered in vomit, banana peels.

484
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,160
Oh, another hard day.

485
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,520
- I puked again today.

486
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,640
"Oh, it's the fucking worst! I can't, this is the fucking worst job! Oh, it sucks, I wanna quit!"

487
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,920
I feel like...

488
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,800
"I wanna quit so bad! Oh my god, it's the fucking worst!"

489
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:55,600
He doesn't think it through and he covers himself in trash before he goes to the beach.

490
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,440
The pigeons are just like shitting on him.

491
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,760
That's how I used to get copies of Thrasher, though.

492
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,520
He has beach trash on him, though.

493
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,240
Like a beach ball underneath his shirt.

494
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,900
Yeah, he's part of a-- He's wrapped in a volleyball net.

495
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,380
Oh, there's garbage all over him.

496
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,380
He's got seaweed all over him.

497
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,380
The fucking guy's like drenched too much.

498
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,380
He looks like a shipwreck.

499
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,380
He's got like--

500
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,380
He's wearing like flippers too.

501
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,380
Oh, I had to pick up so many treasure chests today.

502
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,380
Oh, fuck. Oh, it was the fucking worst.

503
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,380
Another fucking whale washed up on the beach.

504
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,380
God damn it. I had to pick up that thing, throw it in the truck.

505
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,900
Did they call did they call like the garbage?

506
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,780
Super team when a whale comes because a whale is garbage dude

507
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:42,760
They get they get scientists to come and make sure that it doesn't blow up

508
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,880
Oh, yeah, cuz they blow up cuz they have like gas inside

509
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,240
Yeah, so if you're not careful

510
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,020
They can just explode so they have people in like who like dress up in like crazy suits and come and like cut them open

511
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:58,740
They have a bomb squad. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, holy. I would love to see a whale explode. You can see a video

512
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,600
I'm gonna pull that up. Yeah, there is a video of it

513
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,740
Yeah, it's pretty cuz I saw it and it was in Reno 9-1-1 Miami

514
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,200
And I thought that the joke was that somebody put an explosive in it. No, they do that. They just do it man

515
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:15,460
Oh, no, no, no, wait. No, they they do put an explosive in it, right? I have to rewatch my man. I'm in Miami

516
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:20,860
That's a good movie. Let's see which video here. We're gonna watch. How big is the explosion warning?

517
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,580
This video contains footage like a new year's may your mom disturbing really? Yeah

I wanted to see if they like play it back in slow motion these types of videos will always play it a second

527
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:00,140
He hit that white thing and it did it. Yeah, that was so fucking cool. It's sick dude. Look at that. What the fuck?

00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,420
Man, that's like a cherry soda

531
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:19,100
And get this it's because it's like the it's methane gas that blows up. So it's like a hard to the whale. Yeah

532
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,740
You can't a whale party. I didn't

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
Explodes.

534
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Whoa.

535
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,300
Holy shit.

536
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,860
You know how you think that smells.

537
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,860
Yeah, that smells.

538
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Ooh, that smells.

539
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Maybe it's about this.

540
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:30,860
God damn, dude.

541
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Did we crack the case?

542
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
That's so fucked.

543
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
How the fuck?

544
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
How the fuck can you not believe in God after seeing that?

545
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,860
Look at this.

546
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,860
Hold on.

547
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:37,860

559
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,860
Paul Lindner.

560
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
Paul Lindner.

561
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,860

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,980
Think they blow this one

566
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,380
70s were like the most humane thing was to just throw a

567
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:21,200
- And any time a deer was stuck in a well,

568
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,540
they would just blow it up.

569
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,560
Wait, this is gonna be so cool.

570
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,560
- Six, five, four, three, two, one.

571
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,740
- Holy shit. - Yeah, they just

572
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,420
straight up blew it up. - Oh my God.

573
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,340
- That's not even like the methane thing.

574
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,820
- They just red misted that well.

575
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,020
- Yeah, that thing is huge.

576
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,220
Dude. - Dude, I know.

577
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,060
You guys, you know that--

578
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:41,880
- Do you think they thought

579
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,420
that it was going to explode? - Imagine not getting

580
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,100
the memo and being out surfing.

581
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,540
And you get like a, yeah.

582
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,540
also like definitely somebody got like a whale tooth to the fucking eye.

583
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,540
For sure.

584
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
It's all over somebody's teeth.

585
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
Aren't their teeth like tiny?

586
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,500
My cousin, the cousin, I don't know.

587
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,000
My cousin, the one you guys met.

588
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,660
Not sperm whales, sperm whales are toothed whales.

589
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:06,780
When he was like 16 or 17 he went to, they were exploding like an old mall in Bakersfield

590
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:10,500
and Bakersfield obviously like they don't, they're just like stupid about everything

591
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,660
so they were like, hey like anyone in the town who wants to come like watch the explosion,

592
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,460
"Yeah, come on, there's blowing up a building."

593
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,100
And they're like, "Just make sure you stand like a hundred feet away."

594
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,900
So they giant, I mean it's Baker's, that's all there is to do is like watch

595
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,780
something explode. They go, everyone in the town is basically like fucking

596
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,740
circled around this building a hundred feet away. They blow up the building and

597
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:40,340
right next to my cousin a giant piece of shrapnel cuts a guy's legs off.

598
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,900
- Oh my God. - Holy flies.

599
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:44,840
- It just instantly, legs just gone, dude.

600
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,940
So cool. - Holy shit, dude.

601
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,580
- And now that guy's like the richest guy in Bakersfield.

602
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,180
- Yeah, that's like how you get rich there.

603
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,700
You either start corn or you get your legs blown off.

604
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,580
- You invent a new type of corn that has a fatter kernel

605
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,780
or you get really hurt. - What are you talking about?

606
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,860
- Fatter kernel.

607
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,420
(laughing)

608
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,740
- Corn from Bakersfield, the band.

609
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:11,580
Oh, it's also a big farm in town.

610
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,380
You guys, I spent a lot more time in Vegas.

611
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,660
So there's a big corn industry there.

612
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,900
Yeah, that's where the people are from.

613
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,740
Yeah, they are all from there.

614
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,180
I didn't think about that.

615
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,020
Fatter Colonel.

616
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,220
That you need a fatter Colonel.

617
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,060
Monsanto's.

618
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,100
(laughing)

619
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,420
Fatter Colonel.

620
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,300
You said that so much.

621
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,180
Yeah, you were like, oh yeah.

622
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:32,900
You really are a fatter Colonel.

623
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,380
I'm not really into rock and roll.

624
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,500
I'm more of an agriculturalist.

625
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,500
God damn it, dude.

626
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,900
I'm sorry. You guys are all on your hippity hop rock thing.

627
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,860
I'm just a simple man. Just give me a bigger circle.

628
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:53,300
I've been thinking of the most famous thing out of Bakersfield is corn.

629
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,820
Yeah, the fucking food. It's and almonds.

630
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,580
Corn and almonds. It's like all there is. No, you know, it's funny.

631
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,540
Your cousin did the same exact thing when we met up at Carmello's. Really? Yeah.

632
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,380
I think I made a joke about Cor and he was like, "Oh yeah, you know, it's a big farming town."

633
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,540
I was like, "Man, no, my bad."

634
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:16,900
We're simple people. I come from a simple family.

635
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,460
Yeah.

636
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,060
We don't even... all those masks.

637
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,860
You got to get your cousin back out here. That dude's good hands.

638
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,420
He's the man.

639
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,700
I've had a really rough 48 hours.

640
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,900
Yeah? In what way?

641
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,740
They're cooking me, man. They're still going.

642
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:30,980
Oh, they are.

Oh, yeah.

644
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,020
They're still going?

645
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,060
You talked about it at the show last night.

646
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,180

Fucking stupid ass, bald piece of shit.

Maybe what you gotta start doing is like doing like...

You tell me every day that I should do drag.

You should do male drag, right?

667
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,920

Just the most normal crap ever.

747
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,980
Just support.

748
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:46,980

Yeah.

753
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980
Video games.

754
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,980
This could take place at a barcade.

755
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
Could take place at a barcade.

756
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Could be at a barcade.

757
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,980
Yeah.

758
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,340
Yeah, could be at an axe throwing bar.

759
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,340
Yep.

760
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,340
Could be in a farmhouse.

761
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,300
We should do a... you know what we should do?

762
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
We should host a lock-in.

763
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
Remember the lock-ins?

764
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,300
No.

765
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
What's that?

766
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,300
Oh yeah, yeah.

767
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:08,300
They would have them in Rye Airfield.

768
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,900
They would do like church and shit.

769
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,100
- Yeah, it would get like a bunch of like,

770
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,780
like all the kids would, they'd lock 'em in a room.

771
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,340
- Yeah, you lock 'em in a room overnight.

772
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,180

I don't know what this is.

776
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,620
- Like church youth groups and shit.

777
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,580
It'd be like a lock-in, where it'd be like,

778
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,300
you just stay the night on the floor in the church.

779
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,580
- Okay, so is it like when you like go like stay

780
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,140

- Yeah, it's so cool, dude.

784
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,780
- Yeah, I never did anything like that.

785
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,300
- I never got to go to the lock-ins in Rye.

786
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
We need to do the male drag lock-in.

787
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
Yeah.

788
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,780
We could have more adult male sleepovers.

789
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,780
I agree.

790
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
Yeah.

791
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,780
Everyone makes fun of me.

792
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,780
It's an upliftment.

793
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:54,220
Jan always makes fun of me because if somebody is going to stay at our – I can't get

794
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,660
this out of my head for some reason.

795
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,540
Somebody is going to stay over at our house.

796
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:02,900
The other night John was going to sleep over because the couch he couldn't get in touch

797
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,100
with the person he was staying with.

798
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:15,460
I was like I think Johnson come over have a spin the night I don't know man I

799
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:22,980
don't know why I can't. She's probably made fun of me for that a hundred times and I still like just

800
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,940
instinctively I'm like yeah is it cool to be like has a spin the night? Has a spin the night?

801
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,740
I've never heard that before in my life. Has anybody ever said that? Is that

802
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,820
like what your mom would say? I guess like something like I would say when I was

803
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:44,540
like little kid. Oh yeah. Oh you would say it. Yeah. No there's some shit that I used to I think I've

804
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:48,020
outgrown a lot of it but there's some shit I was saying until I was like

805
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:56,020
probably the age of 20 that I said mommy daddy goo goo ga ga. Yeah. I'd say I would

806
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:01,740
I'd be at a bar and they'd be like hi what can I get you? I'd be like one Bubba.

807
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:09,020
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

808
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:15,020
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

809
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:21,020
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

810
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:27,020
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

811
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,700
him by one hand and I waddle around with him. Yeah. Yeah. He's basically my best friend.

812
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:37,180
Don't touch his wet leg. Don't touch my frog's wet leg. I make it wet at night, okay? Alright,

813
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,820
it's what I do with him. It's a playing thing I do. Yeah, it's literally playing, okay?

814
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:48,300
How long did you guys pee the bed? I was not a bed wetter ever. Really? Lucky you. I would

815
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,540
- I was such an awesome, horny kid that I would like have a wet dream though almost

816
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:58,740
every night. You did not have a wet dream. Swear to God. As a seven year old. I'm not a seven year old.

817
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:06,600
Yeah. How old were you? I was like fucking 18. You said... Weird. What? I don't want to... No, I was

818
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:11,940
probably 11. Okay. I was just every single night just waking up. I had a different kind of wet

819
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:17,540
dream every night until I was 11. Yeah? Yeah. I peed the bed till I was 11 years old because I was

820
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,940
such a deep sleeper. I was an extremely deep sleeper. Doesn't that mean you're like a serial killer?

821
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,380
It's like a serial killer thing.

822
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,380
Is it?

823
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
Yeah.

824
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,380
Yeah.

825
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Nah.

826
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,380
Yeah.

827
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Yes.

828
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,380
And it's also, you know what I mean?

829
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,380
It's so funny that that's like one of the signs.

830
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,380
Yeah.

831
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:36,340
It's like you were such a stupid pussy growing up that you wet your bed all the time.

832
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,540
If you poop your pants more than three times.

833
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,540
Yeah.

834
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
It's like, right.

835
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,540
Yeah.

836
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,540
Sorry.

837
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
I think you're a serial killer.

838
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,540
And they tell parents to watch out for that too.

839
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,540
And it seems like that criteria is arbitrary and it doesn't make any sense.

840
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,500
I think that it makes perfect sense and it has a 100% hit rate as far as the accuracy

841
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,780
of that. It's a good barometer.

842
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,700
It's just a deep sleeper.

843
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
Yeah.

844
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,700
I'm still...

845
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,700
You're dreaming of murdering women every night?

846
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,700
No.

847
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,700
No?

848
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,780
But you guys ever drool in your sleep as a grown man?

849
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,780
Oh yeah.

850
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:06,780
I did this morning.

851
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:07,780
Drool in my sleep horribly.

852
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
I woke up...

853
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:15,260
Dude, I did it on the plane to Seattle. I woke up on the seat. Thankfully it was the flight

854
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,260
home where I like...

855
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Yeah.

856
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:21,260
in your sleep is normal you don't like grow out of that. Were you drooling on

857
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:26,180
the person next to you? No, so the flight... So you're a big fat guy?

858
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:31,260
Drooling on his shoulder? Oh, Grant. The flight there...

859
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:37,780
Oh, I never talked about the fucking the flight to Seattle. Where you just sat on

860
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:44,700
the plane? I was stuck on the plane for four hours. I forgot about that. I was stuck on the runway for four hours.

861
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,500
and they pretended you were in the air the entire time yeah yeah like oh oh no

862
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,660
here comes a turbulence oh yeah they were shaking my seat yeah I did I fell asleep

863
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,980
as it was like about to like take off and then woke up to the pilot saying

864
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,820
like folks we still have not left the ground there was a problem with the

865
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,840
bathroom the toilets are clogged you were not supposed to use the toilets

866
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,460
before we get in the air and like somebody's toilet was clogged that we

867
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,860
couldn't fly because the toilets were clogged.

868
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:14,260
Whoa.

869
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:18,100
On the plane. So they had to take, took like four hours for them to unclog it.

870
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,060
And then they like, dude, I want to be the guy that did that.

871
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:24,900
They let us all off the plane one by one. If you needed to use the bathroom.

872
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,460
Yeah.

873
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:30,580
And like, because of COVID, like they were like, we can only let you out one by one stupid

874
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:36,980
fucking arbitrary rule. A guy came back with a hamburger. I came back with a burger and I was

875
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,120
I was like, that's the guy that clogged the toilet.

876
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:44,200
- But can you imagine the power that you would feel

877
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,060
if you were responsible for that?

878
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,060
- Grounding a plane?

879
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:47,900
- Yeah.

880
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,740
- That's an act of terrorism.

881
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,360
- I feel like it's hard to clog an airplane toilet too.

882
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,420
- Clogging an airplane toilet,

883
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,440
then the whole flight just being like,

884
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,420
man, I hate the guy that clogged the toilet.

885
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,480
No, aw!

886
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,640
- What does he push out?

887
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,580
Like perfect circular heavy poops

888
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,220
that are just the exact size of the tubes in the toilet?

889
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:10,620
too strong at pooping and he's strong enough that a plane can't take it with

890
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,340
this guy actually eat a bathtub stopper two days ago and he just got it out oh

891
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:19,860
that is a very like he must be so he must have such good gut health assuming

892
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:23,140
that it was a guy like on your flight and not like something to happen before

893
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:28,220
the flight it's very funny to like get like board the plane and immediately like

894
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:34,020
take a giant clog the toilet like getting the also yeah not like going into

895
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,560
the bathroom in the airport or anything.

896
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,340
Thinking about it, like this guy probably cost JetBlue like $400,000.

897
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,840
Yeah, like so many flights.

898
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,340
Delaying a flight that long?

899
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,340
That's crazy.

900
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,340
Four hours.

901
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,340
And then it was a six hour flight.

902
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,340
Like a gate, nobody can use that gate.

903
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,340
Yeah.

904
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:52,140
They have to move all the places around, everything gets, they're probably still dealing with

905
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,140
that.

906
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,140
Yeah.

907
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
Because this guy's shit.

908
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:59,020
We had to wait, we had to wait 20 more minutes because the other flight had to take off that

909
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,260
was supposed to be at our gate.

910
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:04,880
So we had to wait another 20 minutes as soon as we landed in Seattle, but like the fucking

911
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
toilets were clogged before we were leaving.

912
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,720
You got fucking owned, man.

913
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,520
Yeah, I got owned by some guy with powerful shits.

914
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,520
Yeah.

915
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,880
He must have been dropping a bazooka in that thing, dude.

916
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,880
Yeah.

917
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,880
Yeah.

918
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,040
'Cause you can't suck out the vacuum shit.

919
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,760
One of the worst things ever, though, is clogging a toilet.

920
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,760
Clogging a toilet...

921
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,760
It happens to the best of us.

922
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,760
I've never done it.

923
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
You've never clogged a toilet?

924
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
I've never clogged a toilet.

925
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,760
You clogged a toilet and then someone's going in after.

926
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,760
Someone going in immediately after you is the worst.

927
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
Yeah.

928
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,760
I mean if you clog it and you have enough time to run a getaway, no skin off my back.

929
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I don't care.

930
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,200
If I clog a toilet at a cafe because I'm like, "Oh, I accidentally ate too much McDonald's,"

931
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,760
and I just need to go into...

932
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:50,120
Well, you can accidentally eat too much of anything.

933
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:52,120
You accidentally ate too much McDonald's?

934
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,120
You know, sometimes you get...

935
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,640
I will say I've never been in that situation.

936
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,760
I don't know that I have either.

937
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:58,160
I feel like I've intentionally eaten too much McDonald's.

938
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,880
I don't know that I've ever done it by accident.

939
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,840
Well, you know, you think like you can pace yourself and you realize like,

940
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,680
"Oh, this is not today. This is not a good day."

941
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,160
So you just ate too much McDonald's? You ordered too much?

942
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,800
You order like a large instead of a medium?

943
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,920
You can't... A large is too much for you?

944
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,120
Sometimes now, yeah.

945
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,960
A large of what?

946
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,800
Dude, I swear I got IBS or something.

947
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,040
Large water?

948
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:19,840
Large.

949
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,760
I got IBS?

950
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,240
Yeah.

951
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,800
Everybody has fucking IBS now.

952
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,560
I think I still do.

953
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,600
It's so annoying, dude.

954
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,840
Yeah, it's not true.

955
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,180
Now every girl in the world has IBS now.

956
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:33,940
Maybe, here's my thought, maybe it's the makeup.

957
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,100
- Maybe.

958
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,940
You might be onto something there.

959
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,000
- Maybe it's the makeup.

960
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,840
- Maybe.

961
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,080
- Could be giving you IBS.

962
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,760
- Is bitches shitting?

963
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,840
- That's right.

964
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,400
Is they shitting?

965
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,240
- Are they lying about this?

966
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,080
- I will say.

967
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,680
- I think they're all lying about IBS.

968
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,640
- Me getting owned online and everybody hates me

969
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,240
and they want me dead and they want me to be an egg

970
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,720
that they crack.

971
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:59,080
probably would be a little bit different if I was the most beautiful woman in the

972
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:04,680
world. That's a good point. Right? Yeah, you would have been stalked and killed. No, I

973
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:08,640
think they would have been nice to me if I was... Think about it. Instead of being an

974
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,400
ugly piece of shit with no hair, if I was the most beautiful woman in the entire

975

that's the best name. That was the best name we've ever heard. It was really like

996
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:08,020
I thought about it for a long time. I should have written it down. It was so funny.

997
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:13,680
Yeah. Oh it was so good. It just took me off guard. Yeah. You know it's just yeah.

998
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,900
It's pretty good. We couldn't even stay to watch with the name stuck. The name

999
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,020
was stuck with us for at least an hour after. I was whispering it under my

1000
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,040
breath like a spell. Yeah. We just don't remember it. No and I just don't know anymore.

1001
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:32,600
I have a really bad memory. Last night I had a dream that I was like, "Okay, I'm bald.

1002
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:38,600
What do I do about my head?" And I so I got I went to go get a giant tattoo on my

1003
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:45,960
head. Of hair? Of hair. Yes. And then the guy was like, "That'll be $15,000, not $20."

1004
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,080
Yeah. And I said, "Can I be on a payment plan?"

1005
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,440
- He's pretty good.

1006
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,520

1007
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520

1008
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,000
- Jet black, but like what style?

1009
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,200

1010
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,160
- Yeah, like mow.

1011
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,960
- Yeah, mowed up.

1012
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,800
- Yeah, pretty good.

1013
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,040
- No, it's just like exactly just following

1014
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,560
a hairline I never even had.

1015
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,400
- Yeah.

1016
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,920
- You know, the steps, I had the steps up.

1017
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:12,760
- Uh-huh.

1018
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,580
- Yeah.

1019
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,420
- That's pretty cool.

1020
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,260
- I had the steps on.

1021
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,760
- I wish I could, I wish I could like

1022
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,180
get a lineup or something.

1023
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,280
- I'll line you up.

1024
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,600
- No, dude, my hairline's at full M now.

1025
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,760
I can't do that.

1026
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:24,680
- Let me see. - What?

1027
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:25,520
- Yeah.

1028
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,160
- Oh yeah, you got the M.

1029
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,000
- Yeah, yeah.

1030
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:29,820
- I'm rocking the M.

1031
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,920
- Yep.

1032
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,560
Yeah, I don't know how much time I have left with my hair.

1033
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:35,560
- You can, you're one of those guys, you could be--

1034
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,400
- You could pull it off forever.

1035
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,160
- You could pull off the balding forever.

1036
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,120
- Yeah, it looks good.

1037
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,600
- I mean, that's what my grandpa does.

1038
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:42,440
- Yeah, no, it's fine.

1039
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,160
- You could literally just keep that exact hair

1040
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,800
until you're like 70, it'll be fine.

1041
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,200
- Yeah. - It'll look good.

1042
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,800
I mean, I'll just, I mean, I wear a hat most of the time.

1043
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
Plus you have facial hair, so it's fine.

1044
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,100
You know, as long as it adds up to one full head of hair on your face.

1045
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:01,300
Dude, it's just like, I'm straight up getting hairier everywhere else,

1046
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,800
and I'm losing so much hair on my head.

1047
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:04,900
You're high T, dude.

1048
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,400
Yeah.

1049
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,200
God, it sucks being this high T.

1050
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,200
Well, I think like, like, like crazy, like, like,

1051
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,800
Albert Einstein balding hair is like the coolest hairstyle a guy can have.

1052
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:17,400
Yeah, I wish I had that. I wish I just had the thing that just went back.

1053
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,360
Yeah, that's cool. Just I like yeah, just hair that's just like

1054
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:27,880
Super thin like halloween mask hair very yeah. I love that. Yeah, it looks like a back to the future doc mask. Exactly

1055
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,160
Yeah, yeah, that is a good hair. It's great. Yeah. Yeah, that's what i'm. I think that's what i'm gonna have

1056
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,720
He's got a good hair. I'm saying it's gonna look sick as hell

1057
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,240
Yeah

1058
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:41,160
I mean, it'd be nice to get plugs. You look like the skating professor you would get plugs

1059
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:46,520
I'd get plugs just to like push it. You know that you have to take medicine every day

1060
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,840
- Yeah, but I would push the--

1061
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,040
- You know you have to do something every day.

1062
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,880
- Horrible.

1063
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,720
- You have to remember to do something.

1064
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,000
- He would just fall back out.

1065
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,040
- I would push, just to push the hairline up

1066
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,240
a little bit more.

1067
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,840
- You know what, the recovery is like a year.

1068
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,800
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1069
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,080
You have a fucked up head for a year.

1070
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,080
You have to walk around like a lady with cancer

1071
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:07,720
with a scarf on your head.

1072
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,920
'Cause you can't even wear a hat 'cause it'll damage it.

1073
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:12,000
- I think I'm just gonna go gracefully then.

1074
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
But I would, I mean theoretically,

1075
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,880
would get plugs just to push it up like an inch.

1076
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,320
- Until they literally, that'd be funny,

1077
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:23,000
and then you keep balding and there's just this weird gap.

1078
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,840
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1079
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,680
- Do you know what the plugs were?

1080
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,000
- Yeah, yeah.

1081
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,000
- I think, until they make a literal chia pet hair thing,

1082
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,200
I'm not doing it.

1083
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,040
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1084
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,520
- I love being bald.

1085
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,340
- I miss it.

1086
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:39,720
I can't be bald because of you.

1087
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,800
- My head gets so cold.

1088
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,840
You can't have two bald guys.

1089
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,680
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1090
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:47,320
I was the smartest thing I ever did was shave my head. I know before so you can't

1091
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:51,080
do you know I would have dude I would have been able to fucking pull it off

1092
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:57,480
yeah I mean I think my head's too round cam can shave my head what's why can he

1093
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:01,440
shave his head cuz I'm not afraid you're wrong you've also I'm not a coward he's

1094
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:12,640

1095
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,480

1097
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:15,140

1099
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:16,820

1100
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:18,900
- So yeah, you're a Sugma dog.

1101
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,980
- Alpha, alpha, like just...

1102
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,440
- You're a wiener dog.

1103
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,280
- Piece of shit.

1104
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,860
- Wiener dog, dude.

1105
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:25,680
- Farta.

1106
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:29,680
- I've been looking at pets online.

1107
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,180
I've been going on Pet Finder.

1108
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,020
- Really?

1109
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:32,840
- I'm thinking of...

1110
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,680
- Not me, I'm too alpha for that.

1111
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,520
- Yeah.

1112
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,340
- I probably, if I saw a pet...

1113
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,920
- I was thinking about getting a little wiener dog.

1114
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,140
- Yeah, I pretty much get every pet I can

1115
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,140
'cause I just like to like dominate them

1116
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:41,980
and be their pack.

1117
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,700
like a dominating dog. I would probably get pack leader.

1118
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:45,820
So you wouldn't understand.

1119
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,940
You would get 50 of them and just get them behind me and walk in a triangle.

1120
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:50,380
I mean, I understand you're kind of like more submissive.

1121
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,380
You're more like submissive towards your pets.

1122
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,260
Cameron had sex with dogs.

1123
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:53,980
Excuse me?

1124
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:54,380
What?

1125
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,220
Yeah, you probably like bow down to your pet.

1126
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:56,940
Yeah, no, I mean, you're the...

1127
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,820
Cameron had sex with dogs.

1128
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:01,980
So does a pet like find you food and then bring it to you because it has to take care of you?

1129
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,020
Cameron said he had sex with dogs.

1130
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:05,100
Patrick, Patrick kneels down on the ground.

1131
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:05,580
To dominate.

1132
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:09,260
And he acts like he's wagging his tail because he wants his cat to fuck his ass.

1133
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:09,740
Because he's...

1134
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:10,140
I don't have a cat.

1135
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,140
That's how far away from an alpha dog you are.

1136
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,140
You've been looking at ones and you've been saying...

1137
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:17,140
No, I've been looking at dogs this time.

1138
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,140
Is this cat hypoallergenic?

1139
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,140
Yeah.

1140
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,140
Will he fuck me in the butt?

1141
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:22,140
May I see a picture of the dog's rocket before I purchase?

1142
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,140
Please?

1143
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:26,140
Here's what you do.

1144
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
Is it aggressive sexually?

1145
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,140
Does it hump?

1146
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,140
Here's what you would do with your dog.

1147
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,140
No, I could never get a dog.

1148
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,140
You would sit your dog down...

1149
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,140
Especially in the city, I feel like that's tough.

1150

00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,500
We're done with this bit.

1175
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,460
That was, that was too, that was too good.

1176
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:24,780
You can't keep going from there.

1177
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,780
That was pretty good.

1178
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,780
I like that.

1179
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:27,780
You can't, it's, yeah.

1180
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,780
God damn it, dude.

1181
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,780
I couldn't even participate in that.

1182
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,780
It sucks.

1183
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,780
I'm anticipating that. It sucks.

1184
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,780
Alright, yeah.

1185
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:34,780
Alright, fine. We'll move on.

1186
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:36,780
No, no, no. You can do it with me.

1187
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:39,780
Oh, yeah, guys. I have sex with the most beautiful girls in the world.

1188
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,780
Me too.

1189
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,780
What?

1190
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,780
You're supposed to make fun of me for that.

1191
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,780
Oh, wait. You have sex with a girl? That's gay.

1192
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,780
Oh, come on, man. Seriously?

1193
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:53,780
Yeah, what do you have? Patrick has the canine sutra.

1194
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:57,780
[Laughter]

1195
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,780
We're nearing the end here, but I did want to bring up

1196
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,780
We're recording this on National Podcast Day today.

1197
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:05,780
Yeah.

1198
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:07,180
It won't come out on National Podcast Day.

1199
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:08,180
No, it'll come out today.

1200
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,180
I just wanted to say that.

1201
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:12,260
I feel like we should maybe get some money.

1202
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,780
I think we should get some money.

1203
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:20,420
Or maybe, if somebody wants to text me a question about podcasting in the next eight minutes,

1204
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:21,420
I'll answer it.

1205
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:22,420
Okay.

1206
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,100
And now we wait.

1207
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:31,620
So what's going on?

1208
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,220
Do we have anything coming up?

1209
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,660
Oh wait, no it's not over.

1210
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:37,660
Fuck.

1211
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:42,580
Are you guys going to see the Sopranos movie?

1212
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:43,580
When's that coming out?

1213
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,580
I haven't seen the Sopranos yet.

1214
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,580
Oh really?

1215
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,580
Tomorrow.

1216
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,580
Oh, you know what?

1217
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:48,580
I'll watch it.

1218
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,580
I don't want to go see it in theaters.

1219
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,580
Yeah.

1220
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,580
Yeah.

1221
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,580
Look, I mean, if you're not afraid.

1222
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,580
My hair's really bad.

1223
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:56,580
Yeah, should I see it without having watched the show?

1224
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:57,580
Yeah.

1225
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:58,580
Whoa, hold up.

1226
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,580
Yeah, that'd be great.

1227
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:00,580
What?

1228
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:01,580
Hold up.

1229
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,580
Speaking of National Podcasting Day.

1230
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,580
Yeah, what's up?

1231
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,180
Just got something kind of big.

1232
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:06,180
What is it?

1233
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,180
Kind of big news.

1234
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:08,180
Sprint.

1235
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,820

1236
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,820
Get details.

1237
00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:11,820
Okay.

1238
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,820
Whoa.

1239
00:53:12,820 --> 00:53:13,820
Wow.

1240
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:14,820
Sprint just upgraded me.

1241
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:15,820
I just got an email.

1242
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:16,820
Or something.

1243
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,380
Now, let me see what's in my inbox.

1244
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,260
Oh, this one's from Capital One.

1245
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:21,260
Whoa.

1246
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:22,260
Oh, here's...

1247
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:23,760
Important information about your account.

1248
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,760
That's cool.

1249
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:25,760
I actually have a lot of...

1250
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:26,760
Closing your cards in 30 days.

1251
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,440
I have a notification right here.

1252
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,560
Low power mode turned off, battery sufficiently charged.

1253
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,560
Whoa!

1254
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,560
Damn!

1255
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,560
Holy shit.

1256
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,560
That's pretty amazing.

1257
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,560
That's pretty amazing.

1258
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,560
We're doing...

1259
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,560
We're doing good.

1260
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,880
These brands are being so nice to us for National Podcasting Day.

1261
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,760
They said that I have 60 days until it goes to collections.

1262
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,480
Whoa!

1263
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,880
My package was delivered.

1264
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:47,880
Whoa!

1265
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,880
Is that true?

1266
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,040
Actually, you know what?

1267
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,160
My package was delivered.

1268
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,840
I got a t-shirt and it was either stolen

1269
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,560
or my mailman is so bad.

1270
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:57,840
- Do you guys get packages stolen a lot?

1271
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,640
- I don't know if it's, 'cause you know what?

1272
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:02,060
I fuckin', I got this t-shirt.

1273
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:05,540
I bought Matt's t-shirt that he did,

1274
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,280
the super mega Chinatown Market one,

1275
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,120
bought that, support my boy.

1276
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:14,840
And I bought that and then it said it was delivered

1277
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:18,260
and then I was like, oh fuck, it's not here,

1278
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:19,900
it definitely got stolen.

1279
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,660
And then I messaged Market and then I got a new one.

1280
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:26,440
I got a new shirt, different shirt.

1281
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,780
And then two days ago, that one shows up.

1282
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,460
Now I have two shirts from them.

1283
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,260
- One of them for free or did you buy?

1284
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,740
- Well, one of them I got for free

1285
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:39,440
because it was supposed to be like a refund thing.

1286
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,280
- So you scammed them?

1287
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,860
- I didn't mean to. - You scammed Matt?

1288
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,580
- No, my fucking mailman. - You're admitting

1289
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,120
you're scamming Matt on-- - My mailman delivers

1290
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,160
my mail whenever he feels like it.

1291
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,000
- Yeah.

1292
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,780
I mean, I feel like you, that,

1293
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:52,040
I wouldn't try and get a refund immediately.

1294
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,520
- That's not from my friend.

1295
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:57,020
I ordered it in August, and then it was shipped.

1296
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,920
- When did it say, when did it say it was,

1297
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,320
what I'm saying, if it said it was delivered,

1298
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,280
I would wait like a week before I did anything.

1299
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:03,120
- Why?

1300
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,700
- Because that happens all the time.

1301
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,540
- Yeah.

1302
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,120
- The delivery thing's like shitty.

1303
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,800
Sometimes it'll like show up later that day.

1304
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,280
- I've never had a package stolen.

1305
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,120
- Really?

1306
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:11,940
I don't know, I don't think,

1307
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,400
I think we had one package stolen in Boston.

1308
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,240
- Yeah.

1309
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:16,880
- Or it wasn't even stolen, I think the guy just like,

1310
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,880
the delivery driver like said he the delivery driver just left it at like a random house or

1311
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:27,520
something. It said it was delivered 24 days ago and it showed up so it was 22 days. So obviously

1312
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,080
that's like... The point is you still scammed Matt. I didn't scam Matt. You scammed him. No. You did.

1313
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:37,520
And I have to I'm going to message them again and tell them I'm sorry. You should and tell them

1314
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:41,760
neither of them showed up. I think I need another one. You should send two this time just in case

1315
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,560
another one gets lost. Yeah. Also I think I ordered I think I ordered a couch from you guys and it

1316
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,240
and it never showed up too.

1317
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,080
- I ordered a flashlight from you guys.

1318
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:51,360
- I ordered a laptop from you guys too.

1319
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,200
I ordered a bunch of crap.

1320
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:54,000
- I think I ordered your personal laptop.

1321
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:54,840
- Yeah, yeah.

1322
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,660
- It didn't show up.

1323
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,500
- And it never showed up.

1324
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:57,960
Can I see what's on your laptop?

1325
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:58,800
Can I see it please?

1326
00:55:58,800 --> 00:55:59,620
- But I mean, this other shirt,

1327
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:01,520
I'm pissed off that it's not delivered.

1328
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:02,760
It was a good shirt.

1329
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,760
So now, either I have to wait a month.

1330
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,600
- I thought you got them both.

1331
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,600
- Yeah, just wait a month.

1332
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,560
- No, a new shirt.

1333
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:09,480
- You gotta, you gotta.

1334
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,440
- Oh, that one didn't come yet?

1335
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,480
Yeah, then that one will come,

1336
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,020
'cause the first one came.

1337
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,740
- Yeah, but I don't even know at this point.

1338
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,860
It could be a different-- - Why not?

1339
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:17,100
It came.

1340
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,180
- The other one did.

1341
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,900
- Yeah, so why wouldn't the other one too?

1342
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,260
- Pat's talking about his dogs right now.

1343
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,020
- No, no, no, no.

1344
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,020
- One came, the other one, not so much.

1345
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:25,860
- He's still working on it.

1346
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,780
- Okay, you know what?

1347
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,700
You know what? - He's working on it

1348
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,380
right now in front of us. - I'm gonna get a dog now

1349
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,180
just so I can have it attack my mailman.

1350
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,820
It's natural enemy.

1351
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,020
- Dogs love mailman.

1352
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:34,860
Are you stupid? - No, they don't.

1353
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:36,100
- They hate mailman. - They love mailman.

1354
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,420
- No, what are you talking about?

1355
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,260
- I'm gonna get an army of dogs.

1356
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:41,840
- I'm gonna have an army of dogs attack my mailman.

1357
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:43,340
- They don't follow them, they attack them.

1358
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,180
- They follow them behind them.

1359
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:47,100
- I'm gonna get the most aggressive.

1360
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,420
I'm gonna go on Pet Finder.

1361
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:50,720
- Have you ever read The Far Side?

1362
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,100
- No, oh, the tome?

1363
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:52,940
- Have you ever, do you know,

1364
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,760
have you ever seen a cartoon TV show?

1365
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:56,820
- You're right, The Far Side actually

1366
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:58,500
does have a lot of knowledge.

1367
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,340
- It does, dude.

1368
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,100
That's literally, it's about how the world works.

1369
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,140
- You know what, I thought about A Far Side cartoon

1370
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,860
the other day, 'cause I was on a safari, right?

1371
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,900
I was on a safari.

1372
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,460
I was looking around and I was like, "Where's Bob?

1373
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,300
We're missing this guy Bob."

1374
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,300
Right?

1375
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,300
Look around, outline of him in a snake.

1376
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,660
Damn.

1377
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,620
He got swallowed by a snake.

1378
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:25,300
Yeah, speaking of, my mailman didn't even deliver my fucking cow tools.

1379
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,300
It's annoying, dude.

1380
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,580
I was hanging out, I was saying, as far as I did, I was hanging out with some giant bugs.

1381
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,580
Yeah.

1382
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:32,580
They're huge.

1383
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:33,580
Yeah.

1384
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:34,580
And I was like, "Well, they're probably, what are they going to do?

1385
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,580
They're bugs probably going to eat sugar water or something."

1386
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:37,580
Yeah, yeah.

1387
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:43,780
human shit they're raising it they're swaddling a larvae yeah yeah this is some

1388
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:49,040
far side shit right now I saw the gram check yeah I saw this like big this fat

1389
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:54,680
guy mm-hmm and his he just he had he he had his eyes were aligned it's just a

1390
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:59,860
line yeah right it's like what is yeah I saw a guy there was a guy on the street

1391
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:06,940
speaking of far side guy in the street he said it's 1995 really yeah Wow I was

1392
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:11,540
like no it's not what's not making it's not 1995 no have you see if you guys read

1393
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:16,460
the far side one where he the Jane Goodall does an intro for it I think so

1394
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,860
I guess like they're best friends is that the prehistory of the far side I

1395
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:24,780
think I have that book on there yeah yeah yeah Jane Goodall does it intro for

1396
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,780
the does it the first I thought that guy was bananas Gary Larson he was but

1397
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,900
apparently she took him to the monkey place yeah took him to the monkey place

1398
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,060
I showed him all the monkeys.

1399
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:35,900
- You know he got a--

1400
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,580
- Well, where else is he gonna get inspiration?

1401
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,300
- Well, that's when he entered his monkey era.

1402
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,140
- Yeah.

1403
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:41,820
- Yeah, you know all the artists have eras.

1404
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:44,100
- They named a louse after him.

1405
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,300
Like some scientists were like a big fan of his,

1406
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,540
and they're like, "Hey man, we're gonna name

1407
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:51,260
"a discovery after you."

1408
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,860
And it was like a fucked up ugly bug.

1409
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,180
(laughing)

1410
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,300
- That's awesome, dude.

1411
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,580
I hope we get there, Wanda.

1412
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,420
- Yeah.

1413
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,260
- I would love--

1414
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,080
- What animal would you--

1415
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:01,920
- A frog.

1416
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:02,760
- Yeah, it's gotta be a frog.

1417
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,820
- A new species of frog.

1418
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,900
got to be a frog. I mean, to be honest, of course I would take any animal.

1419
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,700
I don't want it to be called like... It's got to be an animal though. I don't need, I don't

1420
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,140
need, I don't want a fucking plant. Okay, if you're a plant scientist, I'll start discovering plants.

1421
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,620
Unless it's like a Venus flytrap.

1422
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:20,140
Well, these are two different directions, I think, that we're going in.

1423
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,620
Yeah, well, I don't want to be a plant named after a man.

1424
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,820
Like a new type of corn.

1425
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:25,420
They discovered a penis guy trap.

1426
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:26,620
Bigger than Patrick.

1427
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:27,820
Yeah, fat kernels.

1428
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,460
Fat kernels.

1429
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:29,420
Probably be called the Caleb.

1430
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:32,540
Yeah, because they're juicy and succulent.

1431
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,260
Easy to grow too.

1432
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,660
We would all get named after the corn?

1433
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:36,260
No, why would you guys get named after the corn?

1434
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:37,660
Maybe we could each get one of the kernels.

1435
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,660
I don't know, maybe you guys could get like a stupid band named after you or something.

1436
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,160
No.

1437
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,460
But the corn itself would be named after Awesome Caleb.

1438
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,460
It'd be called the Awesome Caleb Corn.

1439
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:47,360
It wouldn't be called that.

1440
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,260
I just came up with that.

1441
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,660
That's pretty good.

1442
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:53,660
I think if we had a corn named after us, what color would the corn be?

1443
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:55,360
Probably yellow. Most corn's yellow.

1444
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,160
Yeah, but if it's like a new corn.

1445
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:58,260
Or the leaves are green, if that's what you mean.

1446
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:00,560
The patch of corn would probably be real red and thin.

1447
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,960
my corn

1448
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,040
uh... cornwood

1449
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,680
uh...

1450
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:10,600
uh...

1451
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:15,160
and i don't know how you put it out of that fucking house no no no no urge

1452
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,360
out of the house but the great but i think the second episode in a row where

1453
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:20,800
we talked about corn

1454
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,920
we are corn on the broader you know what i do you gotta go to a shrimp a big

1455
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,600
cajun shrimp oil

1456
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:31,720
i'll say it did get some corn and seafood boils sucks shit really horrible

1457
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,000
I've actually never been to one.

1458
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,400
They're fucking dog shit, dude.

1459
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,400
Yeah?

1460
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:38,360
You know what it is, it's probably because you're eating the newspaper.

1461
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,840
I'm trying to get smarter, man.

1462
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:43,840
Yeah?

1463
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,840
Yeah.

1464
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:47,880
You see those far side cartoons in the newspaper, you go at them.

1465
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,240
Y'all still read the funnies?

1466
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
No.

1467
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
No?

1468
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,240
I don't get the newspaper.

1469
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,240
It's Foxtrot, right?

1470
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,240
That's that like the little kid one.

1471
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,240
Foxtrot, yeah.

1472
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
It's funny like...

1473
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,240
It's like written by like a very conservative man.

1474
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,240
The far side...

1475
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,640
Which one of my family circus?

1476
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,640
I think it might be the...

1477
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,760
they're all written by conservative yeah that's you have to be conservative

1478
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,200
yeah yeah Gary Larson is the only like this far side is the only like

1479
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,200
non-political one he doesn't even do that anymore

1480
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,920
yeah yeah so sad end of an era mm-hmm far so it's a bit all the other ones are

1481
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,800
like like what if there's a right-wing aunt

1482
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:22,240
yeah and he comes out yeah it's all they all want to make it about like like

1483
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:27,520
teenagers be crazy nowadays yeah like all these heathcliff ones

1484
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,720
The Heathcliff ones are crazy.

1485
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:30,720
I love Heathcliff.

1486
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,440
Well, the new, the recent Heathcliff.

1487
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:33,440
What's Heathcliff's thing?

1488
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,000
He's like Garfield's brother?

1489
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,520
He's like Garfield, but like he had a traumatic brain injury.

1490
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,400
It's like it makes no sense.

1491
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,920
All the jokes are about like it'll be like Heathcliff walking around wearing a helmet

1492
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:52,240
that says meat on it and then the person is like, "I guess he likes meat."

1493
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:53,360
And that's like the comic.

1494
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:54,360
But there's like a whole bunch.

1495
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:55,360
That's pretty funny.

1496
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,360
They're great, dude.

1497
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,360
It's like power up.

1498
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:58,360
I love those.

1499
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,360

It's like the only good webcomic in so long.

1504
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,360
I mean it's been around forever but yeah.

1505
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:05,360
Classics.

1506
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,360
That I heard of.

1507
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,360
That one's a classic.

1508
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,360
The best one, I mean the best one is when they're like, "Hey Shadow, what do you think

1509
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,360
of gay marriage?"

1510
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:10,360
And he says, "In my opinion, all marriage is gay marriage."

1511
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,360
That's the best shit.

1512
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,360
So good.

01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,360
I do.

1520
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,360
I do.

1521
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,360
I do.

1522
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:22,360
I do.

1523
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,360
I do.

1524
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:24,360
I do.

1525
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:25,560
That's our plug for the--

1526
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:26,520
Oh, wait.

1527
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,360
But you also do have a plug, don't you?

1528
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:28,920
Yeah.

1529
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,280
Boston, Caleb's performing.

1530
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,280
Caleb's doing his one-man show in Boston.

1531
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,800
Yeah, Laugh Boston.

1532
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:38,680
Brandon Wardell is opening for my one-man show at Laugh Boston.

1533
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:39,680
I'm going to probably--

1534
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:42,320
I'm going to come out completely naked at the end,

1535
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,040
just to make you laugh.

1536
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,560
And I'll probably do some body paint.

1537
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,040
So come check that out.

1538
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:47,800
Sounds good.

1539
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,000
We're going to paint--

1540
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,500
Cover myself in silver like 10 men.

1541
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,640
We're going to paint the top of Caleb's head.

1542
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:52,160
Yeah.

1543
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,120
And we get to pick what's on the top.

1544
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:58,200
Also, I'm bringing it. I'm bringing it up and Halloween's coming up.

1545
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,400
So check that out, too. Yeah. Check out Halloween. Check out.

1546
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,080
Oh, I'm going to be at McDonald's.

1547
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,480
Oh, yeah, I'm probably going to get a taco after this.

1548
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,440
Yeah, I'm probably I'll be hanging out later.

1549
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:12,720
I'm going to be at the Hollywood Burger King in Bushwick.

1550
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,960
OK, we should go there right now.

1551
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:17,800
I already went there today. Fucking press stop. OK.
