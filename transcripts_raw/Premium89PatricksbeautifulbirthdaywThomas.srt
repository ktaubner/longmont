00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,940
Pip pip, this rum's scrumptious.

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,940
I want to go on like a Food Network show and just like have an aneurysm.

144
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:48,940
Dude, I want so bad to be, as a guy who like doesn't like food that much, I want to be a judge on like a cooking show so bad.

145
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,940
Just be like, "Yeah, I don't really like this."

146
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,940
I don't like any of this stuff.

147
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,180
You know, I'm not very hungry.

148
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:55,700
I took a bite, you know.

149
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,700
Don't like the texture.

150
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,700
It's weird.

151
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,740
This is giving me a stomach ache.

152
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,540
Yeah, my stomach really hurts.

153
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,900
I'd rather just eat it like if you guys had a Tootsie Roll.

154
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,900
I would really like that.

155
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,300
I mean, you have the whole grocery store, it's like guys' grocery games.

156
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,260
You have the whole grocery store in front of you and none of you brought back a thing

157
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,500
of saltines for me.

158
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,140
That's all I wanted was saltines.

159
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,100
I don't want to try your Korean fusion hot dog.

160
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:28,700
I just want one saltine with a saltine in the middle.

161
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Yeah, one saltine, no salt, please.

162
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,860
The salt is way too spicy for me.

163
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,700
Do you guys have anything that a horse could eat?

164
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,980
I've never met one.

165
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,140
Like eating the napkin and be like, "Oh, this is really good.

166
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,660
You guys did a great job."

167
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,940
My compliments to the chef.

168
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,540
The balance of flavor and paper in this dish.

169
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:57,060
The balance of flavor and taste is just immense.

170
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
Oh my god, and the smell.

171
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,220
It's like I'm being on a food show.

172
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,420
Yeah, well it tastes really good, but it smells amazing.

173
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:11,780
Oh my god, I love the smell even more than the taste.

174
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,220

229
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,760
All the girls are like, "Please don't advance me to the next round."

230
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,480
Every single one of the dates is just them watching me play Fortnite for 30 minutes until

231
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,400
I get bored and say, "I'm going to watch a movie and go into the other room and close

232
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,360
the door."

233
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,120
I'm mostly sedentary. My bones are made out of pretzel material. I can't smell anything.

234
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,960
I don't want to.

235
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,600
I have 15 jobs and I'm busy and I don't have time for these women.

236
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
Have you ever heard of anime?

I'm going to have to send you to the bathroom.

241
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,200
That's where I think you go.

242
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,560
It's a bachelor where the guy thinks if he doesn't pick the woman they get killed.

243
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,240
He's like crying as he picks.

244
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
He's like, "I'm so sorry."

245
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,240
"I can't believe I have to do this to you!"

246
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,800
"I just don't see us having a future.

247
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,800
It's not..."

248
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Oh god.

249
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Oh god no!

250
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:21,160
It's like the bad, the like, the narrator's like, "And Cameron had a, was in for a difficult

251
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,160
day."

252
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,600
And it's just like a video of like the outside of the door and it's just going, "Oh my stomach!

253
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
I ate the rose!

254
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,600
*laughter*

255
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,600
I ate the whole rose with the thorns!

256
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Oh my god!

257
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,600
My stomach is bleeding from the thorns and the rose!

258
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
It's sucking!

259
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
Oh my god!

260
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,600
I need all of the women to rub my belly!

261
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
*laughter*

262
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
It's the only way to make it feel better!

263
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
I need an ultrasound!

264
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,600
They do an x-ray and it's like a whole rose with the stem, like completely unshoot.

265
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
Perfectly preserved. It's like the fucking Beauty and the Beast thing.

266
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
They have to do surgery because it's like...

267
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
The medics like run in, like they have like the...

268
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
They like completely cut you down the middle and like sew you back up.

269
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Yeah, like just chin the dandruff all the way, way too much.

270
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Damn. Do you remember, I think I've talked about it before, but on Rock of Love,

271
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:45,160

272
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,440
on our levels are off the charts.

273
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
- Yeah.

274
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,280
- That's that guy's dream job.

275
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,640
He was growing up and he's like,

276
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,720
"I wanna be a doctor.

277
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,200
"I wanna be a boner doctor."

278
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,720
And everyone's like, "You'll never make it."

279
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,560
- It's just like Dead Ringers.

280
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,360
- "I wanna be a boner doctor on TV."

281
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,400
And they're like, "That's not a job.

282
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,960
"You're not gonna get that job."

283
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,840
- It's like Dead Ringers, he's got a twin brother.

284
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:07,000
He's like, "Oh, I do all the work for you."

285
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,520
- Instruments to inspect mutant boners.

286
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,440
- Imagine being a mad boner scientist.

287
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,520
You're in the lab and the evil guy's like,

288
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,640
I need it done tomorrow and he's like I don't have time.

289
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,680
I don't have time. He like turns the electricity thing like all the way up

290
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,120
and the guy's boner just like it's like 20 feet long all of a sudden.

291
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:28,280
It's too much. It's too much for him. We gotta take him down.

292
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,040
Oh god he's gone. Bigger.

293
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:37,080
We're losing him. I need it bigger.

294
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:41,160
Yeah it's still just Igor in there too.

295
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,500

296
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,880

301
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,600
(laughing)

302
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,120
Oh yeah, I shouldn't have tried this.

303
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,360
(laughing)

304
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,200
- Oh boy.

305
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,680
- Oh, Patrick's tired.

306
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,960
- How's your New York adventure so far, Tom?

307
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,760
- This has been the worst week of my life.

308
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,680
(laughing)

309
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,640
- This is your first time here, right?

310
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,000
- Second, but the first time I was just a kid.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,560
So I just saw like, I was mostly in DC,

312
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,080
like I saw like monuments and shit, but it wasn't like--

313
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,840
Yeah, well DC is not in New York.

314
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,760
Yeah man, I'm gonna fucking kill you with like a gun.

315
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:47,040
I looked and I didn't know how I was gonna get around before and I was looking at like

316
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,960
if there were like ATV rentals around here.

317
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:56,160
Cause I was like it'd be badass if I just got like a dirt bike for like a week and I

318
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,640
just fucking rode it out.

319
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,960
But yeah, they don't have that here.

320
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,960
They have the city bike, they have electric city bikes.

321
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
Yeah, it's not the same.

322
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I want like a four-wheeler.

323
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
That'd be sick.

324
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:07,960
I could just take down Grand Central and just *roar*

325
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,960
People do that though, they do have like the, have you seen the dudes on the ATVs?

326
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:15,960
Like riding through, they ride on like Myrtle Ave and shit

327
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,960
Just like around there, dudes on like dirt bikes and shit, they're all doing wheelies

328
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Yeah, it's so cool. Speaking of ATV, I was at the zoo

329
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,960
last week, and there was a little kid

330
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,960
who was on like a kid ATV who was riding

331
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,660
riding through the zoo on it.

332
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,820
It was so funny because he was just like,

333
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:37,260
he was there. - You were just jealous of him.

334
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,500
- It was so cool.

335
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,620
He was there with his mom and the thing was so slow.

336
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,900
His mom was just walking next to him

337
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,940
and like holding his hand and like helping him steer.

338
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,900
And we were just like walking

339
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,540
to all the different like animals.

340
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,760
And it was like insanely slow,

341
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,080
but also just like the loudest thing ever.

342
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:51,920
So we'd just be looking at the animals

343
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,460
and we'd just hear coming up like,

344
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,940
(imitates car engine roaring)

345
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,940
just like this tiny ATV with this little kid.

346
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,860
So sick.

347
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
You should get one of those Thomas.

348
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,860
Yeah.

349
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,740
I'm going to get a, I'm going to like sell my truck and just get like a fucking.

350
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,060
You can get two ATVs for the price of a truck I think.

351
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,300
No, they're pretty expensive.

352
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,020
Well, I don't know much about ATVs.

353
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,100
Like well, I mean dirt bikes too can get real expensive, but like you can, you can get a

354
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,780
cheap one, but it's still like probably like 2,500 or something.

355
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,780
Yeah.

356
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,620
Which is like not an insane amount of money, but like.

357
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,620
Right.

358
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:30,780
I mean, but it is an all terrain vehicle, so you are getting a lot of money.

359
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,140
You can ride that on the subway.

360
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,900
You can take it on the interstate if you want.

361
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,700
That's one thing that's interesting about New York is there's no highways, there's no roads

362
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,020
apparently.

363
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,460
It's all just brick pathways.

364
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:50,860
And people, they've got donkeys, they've got poodles, they've got their carts.

365
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:51,860
Brick shows.

366
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:54,580
Yeah, and it's interesting.

367
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,820
People ride camels here.

368
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:58,780
Yeah, it's like a melting pot.

369
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:04,820
I've seen people like I thought died from my life just walking around.

370
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,460
I saw a guy riding on an ogre's back.

371
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:11,260
I saw myself in like 10 years.

372
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:12,260
And that was just at my house.

373
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:20,060
I saw myself from age 1 to 30 walking in a line together.

374
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:23,100
I saw how you guys are going to die.

375
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
New York's crazy.

376
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,100
How?

377
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
How does Cameron die?

378
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,660
I didn't. I forgot. I wasn't paying attention. I just saw it. I was trying to look at my phone

379
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,900
and I kept having these like

380
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,420
you know like

381
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:38,340
like prophecies would come to me and I'd be like dude fuck off I'm like

382
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:43,180
I'm looking at boobs dude. I just want to see boobs I don't want to see. Oh my god

383
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm so close to beating my high score in bubble bobble. Yeah

384
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,380
I'm playing the boob game dude. I just remember this the other day

385
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,900
when I had class with Caleb and

386
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,220
there's one class we'd always just be our laptop if you play bubble bubble the

387
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:57,960
entire

388
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,740
class like the game like

389
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,820
the game where you like shoot bubbles on the like a spit like

390
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,480
the worst game of all time. I played that at the arcade the other night.

391
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,020
it's a horrible game

392
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,200
it's the worst arcade game. I went to a barcade.

393
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,220
yo! Actually we could probably go back I have so many tokens. You guys want to go to the

394
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,460
barcade today?

395
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,280
I'm down

396
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,800
so like do they have gun games there? They do. So I

397
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,780
I went back on whenever I built my PC I got back on Steam

398
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,960
uh... and I hadn't really used it for like a year or whatever but I'd forgotten

399
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
that whenever I was like at like a university or whatever and like

400
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,760
completely burn out I would go to class open up my laptop and play this like

401
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,920
mafia wars game

402
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,400
that it was so stupid dude like

403
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,040
two thousand ten level like

404
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,040
it hadn't been up to date. Those are the best games to play. It was like

405
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,480
gang wars or whatever where you'd like buy like

406
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,680
properties to money launder from and like

407
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,360
you'd buy like guns and cars and shit but none of the economics on it really

408
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,660
made sense

409
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,640
and i thought like oh how many hours do i have in that probably like twenty

410
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,640
but i used to play it like everyday in class and i would just be like barred out

411
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,820
or drunk or whatever and i'd be like this game fucking rocks i had like two

412
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:17,240
hundred hours on that game

413
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,560
I was like, "What the fuck, man?"

414
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,520
It was my most played game by, like, a lot.

415
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,320
Like, it was the main game I had played.

416
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,320
That's sick.

417
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,200
Yeah, dude, I'm glad that Bloons doesn't tell you how much time you played, because I played

418
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
that a ton.

419
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,760
Dude, I probably, in middle school, had like a thousand hours on Temple Run 2.

420
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,240
I was like, I had a Kindle Fire, and I was like, "I'm going to be the best in my whole

421
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
school with this game."

422
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,120
Yeah, playing on a Kindle 2 is really funny.

423
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
It's really hard on the Kindle.

424
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
Yeah, I've got to play it on a bigger screen.

425
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,120
I think I got like, I hit like 18 million on that game.

426
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Ooh.

427
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,120
Am I lying to us?

428
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
No.

429
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
You're not?

430
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:58,120
I saved up my gems for a long time.

431
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Okay.

432
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,800
Anyway, this now, keep in mind, this was not a time in which I had really any friends,

433
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,400
but you know, like, sometimes you gotta know when to grind and when to shine.

434
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,000
When to run through the mines.

435
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,260
i was in our city other day i think it's fucked up that they have like

436
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:22,120
like fruit ninja arcade machines like a like doodle jump arcade machine or

437
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:22,920
whatever like

438
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,740
they should have been all be like

439
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,460
it should all be aliens fireteam or whatever it shall be house of the dead

440
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,500
that's not a lot of your case it all begins for you kill

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,900
kind of

466
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,180
that's right

467
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,180
You should have some kind of like, just like...

468
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,180
Some guy who doesn't know who was involved in D-Day.

469
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Yeah, we were trying to invade Normandy.

470
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
Who... what did they ever do to us?

471
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,180
Yeah.

472
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,180
What did they...

473
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,180
I mean, that's France, too.

474
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
The Normandans.

475
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,180
What did France ever do to us?

476
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,180
The Norman... the Normandides.

477
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,180
I mean, they were all speaking Normandese at us.

478
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:00,180
They were innocent Native Americans over there.

479
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,180
And we came in trying to wreck their shit.

480
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,180
I'm glad we got our shit wrecked, dude.

481
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:08,980
We deserved it trying to invade Normandy.

482
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,980
[Laughter]

483
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,480
Yeah, they were communist.

484
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Yeah.

485
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,480
[Laughter]

486
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
So stupid.

487
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
[Laughter]

488
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,980
But yeah, every arcade game should have some kind of either weapon or vehicle that is like

489
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
attached to the machine.

490
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,480
Like you should either be holding a big gun or sitting on a fake bicycle, like motorcycle.

491
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,980
No, you should have two flippers.

492
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,480
No, dude, that's lame.

493
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
That's lame as hell.

494
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,680
You could play that on a keyboard.

495
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,680
Every arcade game.

496
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
I do.

497
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,680
Exactly.

498
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,680
That's why it shouldn't be an arcade game.

499
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,680
You should play that at home.

500
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,680
You know what?

501
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,600
The Pirates of the Caribbean machine sucks.

502
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,600
Okay.

503
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,520
I'm going to say it right now.

504
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,680
The Pirates of the Caribbean machine I played the other night, do not play.

505
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,680
Okay.

506
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,680
That's my official.

507
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:00,440
But the Star Wars one, it's from the 80s.

508
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
It's very cool.

509
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,800
I bet you you saw you saw Keira Knightley on there and you started blushing and he

510
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,440
Started squinting your eyes and you couldn't see the game you lost

511
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,560
You suck here nightly and you put all your tokens in it didn't play here a nightly back in the day

512
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,200
She was

513
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,440
She was mine dude when I was like three years old. I thought she was so fucking hot

515
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,620
I wanted to give her a flower.

516
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,480
I just wanted to follow her around, I think.

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,120
Maybe like hold the back of her dress when she got married so it wouldn't get caught in

518
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,600
somebody's feet.

519
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,000

527
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,480
We had some family friends, we had some family friends who their family wasn't allowed to

528
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,360

00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,800
It's normal, I don't have good aim.

696
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm not going in there.

697
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
*laughter*

698
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,560
I'm scared, I don't like it in there.

699
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
I can't see the bottom.

700
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
It's weird to me.

701
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,560
I don't like your trap door.

702
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,560
I don't like it.

703
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:47,000
I didn't know you had that.

704
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Keep it closed.

705
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Look, every time I see it, it pisses me off.

706
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It makes me- I turn red.

707
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Why don't you look like a poly pocket?

708
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,660

00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:04,660

717
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,320
yet you

718
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:37,760
and i thought it was a good idea i was there the night you were born

719
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,000
yeah so i don't know that apparently if you put your mouth on someone's thing it

720
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,280

721
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,800
yeah i mean do you

722
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,820
did you ever seen our dogs will there's something like that on boys

723
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,120
and it goes it goes into a but i don't know

724
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,660
so some men have buns on them some got them taken off

725
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:59,020
uh... great

726
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,380
that's what pirates do

727
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,500
i was seeing a lot there's some there's cia

728
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,820
you you can walk the plank if you want and don't do that because there's a

729
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,780
shortage

730
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,900
yeah pirate

731
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:17,620
they'll say they want to split your gold with you and that they take all the gold

732
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:21,140
because they're stealers. You hop in an Uber and don't even have the door closed. It's not

733
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,820
your Uber by the way. You'd never walk the plank ride. Don't ever do that. There's a crocodile

734
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,740
that makes clock noises down the water. You've been in New York a lot, right? There's a lot

735
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:35,860
of water. There's so many pirates in New York. Have you ever done an Uber ride for a pirate

736
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:44,860
on a ship? They have cannons on there too, which is you can use a match that you go boom.

737
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:49,460
I wouldn't mind walking the plank if it was longer.

738
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,420
Maybe it connects to another boat.

739
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:55,820
Maybe if it went to land and then I could just go there.

740
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:59,220
And I hate being in the brig.

741
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,180
I don't like it when they put me down there.

742
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:05,020
It smells bad and there's a guy with one arm and he tried to eat me.

743
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,740
I want to be an anchor.

744
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:10,740
I want to be the mermaid on the front of the boat.

745
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,740
I want all the boys that...

746
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:19,180
I want to be in the nest up there.

747
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,500
Yeah, me and my friends, we're thinking of moving to Brooklyn. I think we're all going to buy a pirate ship together.

748
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,380
We're all going to live in the...

749
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,940
I've been getting really into pillaging lately.

750
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,940
Yeah.

751
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,120
What's that fucking...

752
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,120
Is it the Gowanus River?

753
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,180
Gowanus Canal?

754
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,620
Where's the...

755
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,620
Why are you asking me?

756
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,620
Yeah, I think that might be what I'm thinking of the Panama Canal.

757
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,620
I was just saying that because it's something connected.

758
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,620
I'm just thinking about like a pirate ship in Brooklyn.

759
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:48,620
That's...

760
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:50,620
The Panama Canal is not in Brooklyn.

761
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,620
I was fucking with you.

762
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,620
No, it's here.

763
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,620
I mean, he believed you.

764
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,620
What is the closest bywire? Amazon River?

765
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,620
The Panama Canal is right here, right next to the Statue of Liberty.

766
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,620
Don't you see that?

767
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,620
It's not the same.

768
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,620
Yeah, I heard that sharks are big and scary,

769
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,620
But there's a little fish called piranha.

770
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,620
There's a thing here.

771
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,620
If there's blood in the water, don't even get in there.

772
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,620
There's a thing called the buttermilk channel.

773
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:20,620
Yeah, it's called where you tune in to my freaking wife's pussy.

774
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,620
That shit creaming like a motherfucker.

775
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:26,620
Yeah, I got off the pirate ship.

776
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:29,620
I found a treasure chest in my dad's closet, but he just had his gun in there.

777
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,620
So I played with that for a while.

778
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
I looked for a parrot and they all got mad at me.

779
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:43,620
me. I wanted him to get on my shoulder. Come on! I just called them all Smee, they didn't

780
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:50,420
like that. I saw a guy with one leg and he was he was taking he was holding a bridge

781
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:58,420
hostage. Would you please get out of the car, man? We can't we can't drive away until you

782
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,580
get out. You're not part of this ride. We're not UberPool. I'm just gonna drive with you

783
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:17,580
you

784
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:20,940
hitting a telephone pole because you're hanging out the door.

785
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:23,420
It's like you keep hitting fucking shit.

786
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,420
Yeah.

787
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,700
Yeah, there's Davy Jones and there's a bootstrap bill and he's got barnacles on his face.

788
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,100
Yeah, they're not pirates but I heard there's some turtles down in the sewers too.

789
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
They like pizza too.

790
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
So.

791
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Oh, where am I headed to?

792
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,500
You probably hear this a lot.

793
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,100
Anywhere but Davy Jones' locker.

794
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Yeah.

795
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:46,100
Oh man, time to go.

796
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
(coughing)

797
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:49,780
Oh man, Thomas got me back on cigarettes and I've just been like...

798
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
Yeah, I've been trying to...

799
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,740
The thing is, I don't really smoke cigarettes usually, but since I got here I've been smoking

800
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:55,740
like half a pack a day.

801
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,860
Yeah, man, it's New York.

802
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,180
You gotta smoke in New York.

803
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
Absolutely.

804
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,180
In New York!

805
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,340
Concrete jungle where cigarettes were from!

806
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,340
They were made here!

807
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,620
That's where they came from!

808
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,620
New York!

809
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,620
Now I smoke Newport!

810
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,620
Yeah, there we go.

811
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:16,860
Yeah, I got a pack of camels last night.

812
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
Yeah, really?

813
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,860
What do you feed them?

814
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Oh my god!

815
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
Oh shit!

816
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,860
Probably water and maybe oats.

817
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:26,740
I haven't smoked like a normal cigarette.

818
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,080
Or like, you know.

819
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,660
Like not a light or something?

820
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Yeah.

821
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,940
Like a real man's cigarette?

822
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,540
Yeah, because I would only smoke camel blue.

823
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,620
Yeah.

824
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,820
And uh...

825
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:41,840
Are those like the, what's it called, like the Turkish...

826
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:45,040
the Turkish ones just like the plain like the six dollar ones in New Hampshire.

827
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,120
Yeah but is it similar blend wise or is it like a parliament or?

828
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:56,280
There's like the Turkish ones like there's like the red pack.

829
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,280
In terms of the blue camels like what are they similar to?

830
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
Probably red camels.

831
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,960
Yeah red camels.

832
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Interesting.

833
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,960
They kind of taste stale which is why I like them.

834
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,440
i like uh...

835
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,240
but they are true but i think it's a

836
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,800
turkish any of all this

837
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,960
stuff is like a turkish thing

838
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,360
so i don't want to know anything about cigarettes on those people funnel

839
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,360
you know they come in different colors on a mini blow it out to suck in your

840
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,680
puffing it

841
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,720
blow the house down

842
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,840
we should get leather jackets before we should we should get the uh... eight ball

843
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:30,600
jacket

844
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
you know the one

845
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,440
we should it's like the red jacket we should get a ball in the back and see

846
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:40,520
We should get monster costumes and prank our friends into thinking we're monsters.

847
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:46,280
There was a Halloween store in the Lower East Side that got shut down and it's right next to-

848
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,560
They saw a real monster in there.

849
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,040
Yeah.

850
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,680
They had to shut it down.

851
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:53,400
Probably got shut down because it's July.

852
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,720
No, like COVID shut it down. It was like a costume store.

853
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,760
Oh, like year-round?

854
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,640
Yeah. And it's right next to a place that's like, it's called like a goth- it says gothic

855
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,480
on the front and it's like a place that sells like like trip pants and like

856
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:11,760
chain mail and shit yeah yeah I wanted to go there really bad I want chain mail

857
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,940
oh dude we should get chain mail I need I need to be dressed like a Lord of the

858
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,880
Rigs I'm more of a like a bronze yeah I think I might wear like an elven cloak

859
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,280
maybe yeah that might be more my I use really thin leather I'm killed pretty

860
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,920
easily yeah it's a little bit of leather maybe no not even studded oh well yeah

861
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,360
What weapons are you rolling with?

862
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:43,640
I usually use elephant tranquilizer and then I'll do charisma rolls.

863
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,920
And so I'll inject the elephant tranquilizer and I can't feel anything.

864
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,280
I can't do any attacks.

865
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,600
I wake up and I have to do the elephant tranquilizer again and I'm pretty useless as a character.

866
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:05,600
like a problem now is that all the drugs in the city all have elephant tranquilizer in

867
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
them.

868
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,840
It's mostly because of Thomas.

869
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:14,380
That's why all the white rhinos died is because they were smoking on that shit.

870
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,640
My loadout, I got an elephant cloak, I got a chainmail speedo, and I'm walking around

871
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,640
with the flail.

872
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,040
Here's a special trick no one will tell you.

873
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:25,000
If you hold the flail by the spiky ball part and hit him with the handle, it hurts more.

874
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,000
It's because there's a piece of metal at the end of the handle.

875
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It hurts.

876
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
It hurts really bad.

877
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
It's longer than the ball.

878
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,000
What about like a...

879
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I mean if you got hit in the head with a basketball, that doesn't hurt that much.

880
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
You get hit in the head with a baseball bat, that's going to hurt really bad.

881
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
So it just makes sense.

882
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Just a tip for any flail heads out there.

883
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Is there like a double-ended flail?

884
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
Like a Darth Maul flail?

885
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I've definitely seen pictures of it, but that's just...

886
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I mean that's essentially a shotgun that's pointing the wrong way.

887
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:10,920
on

888
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,880
by accident right away. That's why they had the helmets. Just caving your skull in, yeah.

889
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,520
So they could get hit in the head by the flail. Yeah.

890
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,760
Yeah. That's why I bought mine. My doctor said you gotta get one because you're gonna...

891
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:28,600
Yeah. You gotta get one. Yeah. I was prescribed a flail. Yeah.

892
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:34,600
I hated that doctor. Yeah. He always had this huge iron gate.

893
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,120
Yeah, oh and his keep was just impregnable. It's so yeah, dude. Oh, it's like great now. I have to talk to har goth

it

917
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,000

I just, I don't like them. I don't like them but they've grown on me.

925
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,080
I don't like getting burned by fire.

926
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:14,900
Don't walk around with some gold in your pockets around a dragon is what I'll say.

927
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,460
Whoa!

928
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:19,320
They eat that shit right out of your pocket.

929
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,800
Yeah, you can't walk around with gold in your pockets, period.

930
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,240
Around here.

931
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,080

What's that?

933
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:32,320
It's heavy.

934
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,820
you can wear a belt

935
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,860

936
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,500

yeah when you're not sure i keep the bit i just don't know i have a lot of the

969
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,160
i guess the juices are like sunflower seeds and i crack it with my teeth and i

970
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,480
spit out the bones yeah

971
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,080
they've got so many bones inside them struet most of the thing i realize about

972
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:36,520
lobsters like most of it is inevitable

973
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,320
yeah it's it's kinda like a rotisserie chicken you have to throw most of the

974
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,040
way yeah

975
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,800
like

976
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:45,600
yeah exactly i think you just take the heart out yet

977
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,640
like that green shit on their but you know you only get all that you can only

978
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,040
you like the toes and you know yeah

979
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,280
and you gotta like

980
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,560
it's like a bag of ice

981
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,620
you gotta

982
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:55,960
bounce on the ground

983
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:56,880
yeah

984
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:59,740
yeah in the parking lot you just slap it

985
00:47:59,740 --> 00:48:01,520
and you see if it's

986
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:02,900
yeah i mean the way i

987
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,580
yeah i i i love i love killing the lobster but i hate eating it

988
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:11,080
i love i love it it's so crazy like the first time i teach him how to swim

989
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,080
the first time you ever eat lobster i remember being a kid

990
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:16,600
and like my mom bringing home lobsters and being like

991
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:17,480
like it's like

992
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,480
okay we can like put it on the floor and like play with it for ten minutes before we kill it

993
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,780
it's like the most horrible thing ever. That's like how Vietnamese people like

994
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,780
bring a fish home and like keep it in the bathtub for a little bit

995
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,660
yeah I didn't know that. Yeah they'll swim with it

996
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,080
in the tub? Yeah. Is it true?

997
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,160
no that part's not but

998
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,400
you know it's like your baby son and it's like

999
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,640
it's like a three-foot long fish and you're like alright you have a good bath

1000
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,640
Yeah, no.

1001
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,640
Just leave the room.

1002
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:48,640
Yeah.

1003
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:49,640
Yeah.

1004
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:54,640
I mean, fuckin' ... Hearing a lobster scream the first time.

1005
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,640
Yeah, scream is insane.

1006
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,640
Yeah.

1007
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
It's so crazy that they scream.

1008
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:01,040
'Cause like some people just like don't do the cut.

1009
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,040
Yeah.

1010
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,400
But I don't know if the ... Someone told, like I just found out the other day 'cause Caleb

1011
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,360
told me and I just didn't say it.

1012
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,320
Like I wasn't like, "Oh, like that's why they scream?"

1013
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,040
It's like the pressure leaving the shell.

1014
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:15,040
Yeah.

1015
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:36,040
But

1016
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,040
It's probably more humane.

1017
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,040
Maybe.

1018
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:44,040
I mean, I'd rather have my brain chopped in half than be boiled in a pot.

1019
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,040
I think.

1020
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,040
I feel like we should just not eat lobsters.

1021
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,040
It's just too much hassle.

1022
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,040
And also, don't they live super long?

1023
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,040
Yeah, they're biologically immortal.

1024
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:59,040
They only die when they don't have the energy to molt anymore.

1025
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,040
Like, they don't die from old age or whatever.

1026
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:06,440
The most expensive lobster probably lived for 300 years or something.

1027
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,440
That's probably true.

1028
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,440
Yeah.

1029
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,440
Yeah.

1030
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,800
I feel like every science museum I've gone to is like...

1031
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,800
That's how crazy you are.

1032
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:16,000
You just, "Oh great, you're gonna eat that like a damn hamburger."

1033
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,880
Every science museum I've been to has had a lobster in a case that says, "This is the

1034
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,000
biggest lobster in the world!"

1035
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
I feel like...

1036
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:25,000
They're big.

1037

1043
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,880

Walmart for fingering the lobsters oh my god dude sixth grade was a movie yeah

1046
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:01,240
Remember we used to eat out those lobsters at the grocery store?

1047
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:03,240
Yeah, I used to put my penis in there and make it swim.

1048
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,240
And they'd all come up and suck it like a dick.

1049
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:09,240
Yeah, I'd say, "Look guys, it's a fishy, look, it's a fishy!"

1050
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:13,240
And all the workers at the seafood counter would clap.

1051
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,240

1052
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,240
Hey, you buy the lobster, you can do whatever you want.

Yo that cow's ran through.

1095
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:15,840
Have you ever seen like the videos where it's like they basically like have a cylinder thing

1096
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840

00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:19,840

Yeah.

1104
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:37,520
Do you think the cows when they're in line to get bullgunned, they're like, "Oh my god,

1105
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,880
we're finally in line at Disneyland."

1106
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,720
I hope not.

1107
00:54:43,720 --> 00:54:47,880
Imagine it's the most terrifying moment of your life and the only noise you can make

1108
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,880
is like, "Moooooo!"

1109
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,880
Yeah.

1110
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:57,880
I'm so much smarter than a cow.

1111
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:02,220
Imagine like two reactions a cow can have to anything is is say moo and squirt milk

1112
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:05,360
Those are the two imagine like you're watching the assembly line

1113
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,920
You like work in the factory and there's one like the cow is just about to get like it's next in line

1114
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,880
And the rest of cows like whoa ruin you just hear one. It's like fuck

1115
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,320
And then the gun hits it and you never knew like

1116
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,440
That was like the one cow that could talk

1117
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,480
Yeah, shit. Well, we can't bring it back

1118
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:30,680
You're like yeah

00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:35,820
Fuck gotta wait another hundred years to fucking see this thing

1120
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:39,880
First it's first words to

1121
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:46,880
*laughter*

1122
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,880
Who do you learn that from?

1123
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,880
He just goes like, "Noooooo!"

1124
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,880
"Don't! No, no, no, no, no!"

1125
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,880
"Ah, shit!"

1126
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,880
"Oh, damn!"

1127
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,880
"Hell no!"

1128
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,880
It's like, "Well, that cow was racist."

1129
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,880
"Good riddance."

1130
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:24,760
the

1131
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,160
inside a cow and then talk.

1132
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,360
- And then get killed.

1133
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,960
He's like, no, it's like fully automated.

1134
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,880
There's no one there.

1135
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,720
You just get killed.

1136
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,720
- You guys in a cow costume.

1137
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:36,440
- Yeah, you're like in a two part cow costume.

1138
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,020
- He's gonna be such a good friend, this fucking guy.

1139
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,720
- You get processed and somehow like the ground beef

1140
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:45,160
or whatever, like you can see your entire face in it.

1141
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,160
Didn't get shredded.

1142
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,800
- Yeah.

1143
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,200
- My throat's killing me.

1144
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,020
- Yeah.

1145
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,860
- Yeah, dude.

1146
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:53,680
- You yelled too much last night.

1147
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,520
- I yelled and.

1148
00:56:54,520 --> 00:57:15,520
like

1149
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,520
and I looked at it and I was like, "This isn't going to be good."

1150
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:25,520
They had a bin to put it in and all the rest were clear, light yellow,

1151
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,520
and mine was like, "It looked like scotch."

1152
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,520
And I was like, "Yeah, this is probably fine."

1153
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:34,520
And the doctor didn't even say anything about it, it was just on the report.

1154
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:37,520
It was like, "Yeah, this shit's fucked up. Whatever, it's not what we're worried about right now."

1155
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,520
"Tastes horrible."

1156
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,520
"Smell like piss, dude."

1157
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,520
I thought it was gonna be whiskey.

1158
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:45,020
Yeah.

1159
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,520

That's the doctor that you have, it's just like

1162
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,520
"Uhhh, eee, eee"

1163
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:55,520
I go to that

1164
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,520
"I don't wanna, I'm nervous about hitting your funny bones"

1165
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:03,520
I go to that like fake doctor who just like pretended to be one for like

1166
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:04,520
Oh yeah, yeah.

1167

Yeah.

1171
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,520
Was he pretending to be a gynecologist?

1172
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,520
Yeah.

1173
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:15,700

1175
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:20,320
you know i i don't think i like

1176
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,800
this is how well but i have to do it

1177
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,720
because i think the hippocratic oath yeah

1178
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,240

patients are comfortable, you have to, whenever you're looking at a woman's pussy, you have

1206
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:16,340
they don't have those. this thing is normal. yeah. you can be like a...

1207
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:20,900
a prostate guy or whatever right? yeah you can be a prostate guy but no one

1208
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,820
inspects the penis. that's not a doctor that's just a prostate guy

1209
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:29,020
you got balls. yeah but your doctor just kinda gives him a squeeze. i think your prostate... it doesn't need to look at

1210
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:33,900
your balls yeah but no there's no like

1211
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:40,500
did your prostate guy fondle your balls not my prostate guy isn't there a penis

1212
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,180
doctor though I don't know there's a guy who knocked on the door of your

1213
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:46,620
apartment

1214
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:01,300
So this is let me preface I was not molested but I there's so I had to get a

1215
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,020
physical for this job and I hadn't had a physical since like sixth grade

1216
01:01:05,020 --> 01:01:09,940
basketball or something and so I'd done most of it and then it was like this

1217
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:14,340
Indian doctor and he was like instead of being like okay if you could like you

1218
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:21,900
know scoot he was like show me your penis and I was like what and he was

1219
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:27,820
like for the uh you know whatever i was like oh okay yeah you can see it or whatever

1220
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:36,860
and the weirdest one i've had for a physical is this guy just like uh he like drop him

1221
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:43,260
oh i was like my i went to the same doctor and he like fucking so usually they like

1222
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:47,900
they do they go like up here yeah yeah and they have you cough he like fucking like

1223
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:51,100
He briefly like grabbed my balls.

1224
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:53,100
That's what my doctor would do.

1225
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:55,100
And then it's where they'll like hold him and they like

1226
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,100
Yeah, they check for a lump.

1227
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:59,100
They put like a blindfold over you.

1228
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,100
[laughter]

1229
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,100
They're supposed to do that.

1230
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,100
They put something wet all over it.

1231
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:07,100
And you have to sign like so many documents.

1232
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,100
[laughter]

1233
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,100
And then you find out you're starring in a movie.

1234
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:13,100
I hate doc--

1235
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,100
[laughter]

1236
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,100
Our healthcare system is messed up

1237
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,300
but it just turns out he like got molested by his doctor.

1238
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:25,900
I have great health insurance, but this system, man, there's just something about it.

1239
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,340
Don't you guys all agree?

1240
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:32,500
I had a doctor, the doctor I went to from, I've only seen one doctor my whole life, from

1241
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,780
the age of like 6 to like 20.

1242
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:36,780
They're all over.

1243
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:37,780
You've probably seen another.

1244
01:02:37,780 --> 01:02:40,020
Probably on the train.

1245
01:02:40,020 --> 01:02:46,420
But he like, every time he had to do it at the physical, like touch my balls or whatever,

1246
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,420
You just go like, "Okay?"

1247
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,680
(laughter)

1248
01:02:50,680 --> 01:02:57,680
He's like, preparing like, "Okay, you know I don't want to do this."

1249
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:58,520
- Yeah.

1250
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:03,020
- Then you'd just be like, "Turn your head and cough.

1251
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,440
Turn your head and cough again.

1252
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:05,600
Okay, now get hard."

1253
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:07,560
(laughter)

1254
01:03:07,560 --> 01:03:09,520
- In sixth grade, whenever I had to get one,

1255
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,920
it was this girl who was in our grade,

1256
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:17,080
Her mom was a nurse and she did all the physicals.

1257
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:21,160
So all us guys, as like 12 year olds, we're like, "Yeah, she's probably gonna see who

1258
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:24,520
had the biggest soft dick and tell her daughter."

1259
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:30,480
That's probably how it's gonna work.

1260
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,960
So maybe fluff it up a little bit before.

1261
01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,320
All right.

01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,320
