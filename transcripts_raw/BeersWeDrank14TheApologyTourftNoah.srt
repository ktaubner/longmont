19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:58,520
- Wait, we gotta pop the seal.

20
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:03,120
- Oh my God.

21
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,180
- Yummy.

22
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,520
- Okay, so.

23
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,360
- Cheers.

24
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,180

25
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,020

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,860

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:09,680
- Just start off.

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,520
- Oh that's great.

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,120
- Today's Beers We Drink is a special one.

30
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,520
We're in person, we got Noah here.

31
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,880
Noah. What's up?

32
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,680
OK, so we got these three

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
beers at the supermarket.

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,100
They're the most weird looking beers

35
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,100
of all time.

36
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,240
But that was over there

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,400
and the show.

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,300
The show is not going to end until

39
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,800
we everyone drinks their

40
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,000
perspective beer.

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This one don't count.

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,720
This is maybe we'll get to those.

43
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,420
Yeah. If you finish all three before

44
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,840
somebody's finished their third, you

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,920
get to move on to the Miller High

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
List.

47
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,460
Guys, this is so much better

48
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,960
than the normal podcast.

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh my God.

50
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It feels really good.

51
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You all are just sitting at your computers.

52
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,620
He loves the beer.

53
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,980
He loves the sour ale.

54
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:50,980
What the fuck?

55
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,980
It tastes good.

56
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,980
It's sour candy.

57
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,760
This is, we're drinking right now Bronx Brewery City Island Sour India Pale Ale.

58
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,800
This is not the kind of sour, I honestly thought you were about to pull up with the slushies.

59
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,280
Yeah, I didn't see the slushies.

60
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Oh, what the smooch is?

61
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,280
Yeah, the smoothies.

62
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,040
Do people still make those or is that a fad?

63
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,040
Smoothie beer?

64
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I never even had them.

65
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Yeah, you did.

66
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
No, I didn't.

67
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
The moon, whatever.

68
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Oh a fruited sour.

69
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Those are like the smoothie beers.

70
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,040
These were like $40 and so those would have been like $60.

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,040
Yeah they are like the most expensive beers in the world.

72
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,040
Fruited sours are so expensive and they make you really fat.

73
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Yeah. It's dope.

74
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,040
Went to like a liquor store this morning, we were like oh after having like a lunch breakfast type thing.

75
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
And we were like oh let's just see if they got beers.

76
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
And we just like looked like two little children being like oh I want to buy some alcohol.

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
saw a bunch of liquor and wines and we're like, okay, no, we're not,

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,560
I don't want to fuck with any of this.

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,360
And we went to the supermarket and we saw the funniest looking beers of all time.

80
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,720
We're like, Oh yeah, this is my shit.

81
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,200
These are funny beers.

82
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,400
Even if they did think y'all were underage, they would still sell them to you.

83
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,200
This beer is hurting me so badly. I don't know. I think it's, it's just like,

84
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:03,880
it's very sour. It's like drinking Fanta.

85
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,560
Like I feel fucked up from it.

86
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,560
Yeah. We have to talk more about the beers, the components and the tastes.

87
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,100
I mean, it's very, very sour.

88
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,540
It's really sour.

89
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,980
It's really sour.

90
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:15,620
It really gets into your throat and attacks you.

91
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,280
It gets into your... I feel like I'm rotting my teeth with this one.

92
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,420
It's a lot of green apple.

93
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,020
I'm getting a lot of crisp green apple from this.

94
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,220
Yeah, it tastes like a sour candy.

95
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,120
It's a little too much, I'm going to be honest.

96
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
I agree.

97
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,120
But...

98
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,460
Also, it's an IPA.

99
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,720
Let's power through this one.

100
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Yeah.

101
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,260
Just destroy it?

102
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,560
Let's get the fuck through this one.

103
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,760
I'm not going to destroy it. I can't destroy it.

104
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,860
You can't? You can't.

105
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,260
That's a loser mindset.

106
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
That's a loser mindset.

107
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,980
I know we did. This is our first ever guest. There's a couple of things about this. This

108
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,140
is big for us. Number one, I never want to have a comedian on this show. That's not what

109
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,060
this is about. This is for the working man. This is for the every man. The working man,

110
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,300
the working man, the working man, the working man.

111
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,260
Y'all work the hardest out of everybody here.

112
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,660
No doubt, dude. Also, I do kind of like the idea of we just only have bartenders.

113
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:07,920
(laughing)

114
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,760
- No, we don't want--

115
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,500
- This is his job.

116
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,020
- Do y'all know anyone else who bartends?

117
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,940
- No, yeah, I know a couple people.

118
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:16,340
- I mean, I know bartenders.

119
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,820
- Oh, you know Daddy?

120
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:18,660
- Yeah, yeah.

121
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,500
- Oh, we should get Daddy.

122
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,780
- The Brooklyn bartender.

123
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,620
- Yeah, Daddy.

124
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,220
- Come on, everybody bartender.

125
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,980
- The other Brooklyn bartender, Mommy.

126
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,060
- Yeah, yeah.

127
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,900
- Daddy and Mommy.

128
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,180
- Yeah, Daddy and Mommy at Brooklyn.

129
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,580
They should come through.

130
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,620
Yeah, I don't work at Brooklyn.

131
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,660
- But this is what I want, man.

132
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:36,800
I wanted to get him a job there when we first moved.

133
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,400
I tried to, I applied, I gave them my resume and everything.

134
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,840
And you weren't good enough for the video game bar.

135
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,740
Yeah, for the video game bar.

136
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,280
I think I did okay.

137
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,040
Yeah, you're doing alright.

138
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,920
I think you'll make it there at some point.

139
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,520
I hope not.

140
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,880
I hope not, dude.

141
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,780
It's going to be a big step.

142
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:56,160
Okay, so let's talk about this.

143
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:02,660
Because I think eventually us four, we will be four person owning a bar at some point.

144
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,320
Yeah.

145
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,960
I was talking to Julio about opening a Brooklyn.

146
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,840
Really?

147
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,080
Oh yeah.

148
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,280
Copy?

149
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:07,880
Wow.

150
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,400
This morning he was like, we were just eating breakfast and he was like,

151
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,280
how do you think like Brooklyn operates?

152
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,400
I'm like, I don't fucking know.

153
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:14,800
Okay.

154
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,080
So for people who don't know, Brooklyn is a bar.

155
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,920
It's in Brooklyn that is a bar and then it is also like a

156
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,680
lander cafe.

157
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,280
A lander cafe.

158
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:25,400
Yeah.

159
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,880
Basically where there's computers, you can play video games on them.

160
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,080
And we're there, man, probably three nights a week.

161
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,720
Yeah.

162
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,720
It's so expensive.

163
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,720
A hundred dollars each time.

164
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,720
Yeah, it's so expensive.

165
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,720
It's so expensive.

166
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,460
So what would you do differently there?

167
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,400
So my thing was year pass for the computer.

168
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Whoa.

169
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Whoa.

170
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,040
See, and I think this is a good idea, but I think he's thinking too much like pro-consumer.

171
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,480
Like the thing at Brooklyn is they charge you way too much for a day pass, and if you

172
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:56,440
just want like five hours, it's like just five dollars less.

173
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,040
And that's all you can get.

174
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
So he has to go more anti-consumer.

175
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,560
consumer. He has to be like, you can only get the day pass into a hundred bucks.

176
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
And also every beer is a hundred dollars as well.

177
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,240
That's a good theme for a bar.

178
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,480
Yeah. Like a dollar tree.

179
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,520
You just make it like a suicide beer.

180
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,360
You just pour every empty you find that people don't finish into a pot.

181
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,160
And then you have a crazy nasty beer.

182
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,800
I'm sorry to change the topic instantly.

183
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,280
I saw a haunting video today.

184
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,120
What?

185
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,160
of somebody dumpster diving outside of a PetSmart and they found a bunch of

186
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,960
hamsters and fish

187
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,400
that were alive.

188
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,600
The fish were alive? What about that?

189
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,800
They just like put the aquarium in the trash.

190
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,000
Just like a Krispy Kreme, oh these are from yesterday.

191
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,080
Dude, just fucking, just put them in the toilet.

192
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,520
What are you doing at the trash can? Feed them to the snakes.

193
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:56,680
Yeah, you have a whole food chain. And the snakes will eat them and become...

194
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Make use of the food chain, bro.

195
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,380
Exactly. That's savings.

196
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
Yeah, food for the shark.

197
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,380
Yeah.

198
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:09,480
This is the good business savvy type of mindset that we need for the...

199
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,880
Yeah, money makers podcast.

200
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,980
Actual money makers podcast is this one.

201
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,980
Yeah, no doubt.

202
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,680
The one in the middle of the week was a facade.

203
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,480
I see four grinders right here.

204
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,480
He completely didn't want to speak because he didn't want to share any actual trade tickets,

205
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,880
but he's going to share them right now today.

206
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,480
Yeah.

207
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,880
And he's not going to get disappointed.

208
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,980
He's not...

209
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,240
(laughter)

210
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,480
- I didn't listen, I don't care.

211
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,680
- Here's four ways to make money.

212
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,820
Feed the hamsters to the snake.

213
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,420
- That is a saving on food.

214
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,960
- You can steal other people's pets

215
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,660
to feed to your pet snake as well.

216
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,500
- Yeah.

217
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,320
- Oh yeah, that's true.

218
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,900
- Just a dog.

219
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,740
- Cut 'em up.

220
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,660
- Yeah, you're gonna need to cut it up.

221
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:48,940
- No, they like 'em alive.

222
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:51,820
The snake's like, why do they do that?

223
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,300
Why is it, you go to the zoo,

224
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,520
they're all about feeding rabbits and stuff.

225
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,200
Why don't they feed them just food?

226
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,940
- My girlfriend, her snake, he was a live snake

227
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,620
when she got him and she cried every time

228
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,840
she had to feed him a mouse.

229
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:09,260
Just 'cause it screams, it screams.

230
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,940
- Wait, she was feeding him live mice?

231
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,020
- Yeah, you feed him live mice.

232
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,220
- She tried, she was like, I can't.

233
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,340
- They like the struggle.

234
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,980
- Yeah, yeah, they like the fights.

235
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,140
- Wait, what is she gonna snake for?

236
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,220
- Why do you get the cruelest possible animal

237
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,020
as a pet for a girl?

238
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,080
The girls love snakes, dude. You're gonna need to talk to her more about it.

239
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,160
Oh, I'm feeling like getting a pet. I think I'm gonna get an orca.

240
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,420
She likes snakes. She also likes... You feed it like once a week. It's a very low

241
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,020
mean. It's like a cactus. Well, but think about this.

242
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,940
So you want a succulent as an animal? Exactly. Exactly. But when you feed a...

243
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,220
You have to feed a dog twice a day, but when you feed a dog, you feed it pebbles.

244
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:48,160
Yeah, yeah. You don't... Nothing screams. It's honestly the one time you don't

245
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,280
have to think about the animal. Yeah, screams and tears are tucked, dude.

246
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:57,960
They get fake food. Yeah. A dog would fucking murder a cat for food if you let it.

247
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,520
Yeah. Well, they famously have an argument. You know this.

248
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,360
Because they're the famous enemy.

249
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,760
Yeah. They really do not like each other very much.

250
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,800
What do you think that is?

251
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,000
You know, I've thought about this a lot.

252
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,400
Every time you walk your dog, you're like, "What's with the poems, man?"

253
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,640
I do think sometimes about if I brought Phil over to Pat's place,

254
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,680
and just to your place and just let him go wild and...

255
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,080
You think he would kill Moe?

256
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,680
Well, let's see if it happens.

257
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Listen, I've met both Phil and Moe.

258
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,680
Us as like a third party here,

259
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,180
I think we can both agree that Moe is so stupid

260
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,180
that he could get eaten immediately.

261
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,180
Yeah, he would just let Phil put him in his mouth.

262
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,680
Yeah, he would walk in there.

263
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,180
Probably hates his life so much.

264
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,180
Yeah.

265
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,180
Yeah, I mean, Moe wants to just go outside and kill things

266
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,680
and I guess getting killed by something else is a good alternative.

267
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,680
Dude, it is so hard to be an animal. Oh my God, it's hard.

268
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,680
I wish I knew what that felt like.

269
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,680
I never want to become an animal.

270
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,680
I'm a divine creature.

271
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,680
You don't want to be stuck in a small apartment in New York,

272
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,680
just yelling all the time, crying and being gay.

273
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,680
And shitting and pissing on the ground.

274
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,680
It's a little bit pretty close to my life, I guess.

275
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,680
But the idea of being a wild animal and having a natural predator,

276
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
That's a bad lot in life.

277
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
What if you're the top though?

278
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,680
You're like the lion.

279
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,680
We are the top.

280
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,680
Even a lion is like, every once in a while

281
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
True, a hippo will fuck it up.

282
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,680
Every once in a while some fucking, yeah,

283
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,680
one of the Trump boys comes down and puts a giant cannon

284
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,680
into your face.

285
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,680
I want to be a jellyfish.

286
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,680
A great white?

287
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,680
No, you don't want to be a jellyfish.

288
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,680
We don't hunt great whites, man.

289
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,680
We don't do shit like that. They just get to eat hot babes.

290
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,360
But they pull up and they put an earring on you and they track you for the rest

291
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:46,800
of your life.

292
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,280
That's it.

293
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,120
That's what happens when you get an earring in real life.

294
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,880
Dude, you know that when you go back to the great wife...

295
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,120
The great wife dude?

296
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,840
The great wife shark.

297
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,440
Yeah.

298
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,800
Sorry, long day.

299
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,440
Hit the gun.

300
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,640
Great wife shark.

301
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,760
That's for you.

302
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:21,480
If you, if you, if you get tagged and you go back to the great white hive or cave, wherever

303
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,440
they live, yeah, they shun you. I mean, they just got a clown. You know, on this age, only

304
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,360
if you get it on the left ear. Yeah. And this tick tock age, they're fucking with you. Yeah.

305
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,160
You're the coolest around. You're the coolest. No, no, no. You're saying they got a dangly

306
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:43,640
tag hanging off the fin.

307
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,040
They actually let you pick, they let the shark pick which earring you want.

308
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,360
Listen man, I have no interest in being a shark, but I do have an interest in having

309
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,360
fins.

310
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,200
That would make me go a lot faster underwater.

311
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Dolphin?

312
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Dolphin shit?

313
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Or like Aquaman?

314
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,160
Like popping out, like retractable, kind of suicide door movement coming off of my ankles.

315
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,320
You know who's got it worse in the sea?

316
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
It's crabs.

317
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,400
Yeah, crabs eat the poop. They eat fucking poop.

318
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
They poop and...

319
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
They like poop though.

320
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,640
Every once in a while, you get picked up by some fishing boat and they're like, "Oh yeah,

321
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,280
your arms are just gone." So they just throw you back in.

322
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,360
Well, that's actually cool that they take your arms away and they put you... Because

323
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:29,160
you're the only of those... You're the only shellfish that is spared. A lot, they'll spare

324
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:32,840
a lobster. If a lobster is really big, they just throw it back because it's so old and

325
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:36,000
they're like, "We'll let it run its course." And if you're a crab, they just take your arms

326
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,500
arms off and then you grow them back. It's not a big deal. What do you mean

327
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,960
they just take their arms off?

328
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,840
Blue or what's the, what's, it's a specific kind of crab. Snow crabs. Some

329
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,480
kind of crab, they just take the arms off. There are crabs who, they're just

330
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,880
gone. And then they, and they get boiled alive. That's awful, dude. When they

331
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,960
die, they get all the bacteria and shit, so it's like you have to kill them

332
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,480
while they're alive. Yeah. You gotta, like, that is awful. You have to kill

333
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,760
them while they're alive. Okay. You have to dismember them while they're alive.

334
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,880
Yeah, you did get owned a little bit.

335
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
You're fucking stupid.

336
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,320
No, no, don't kill me!

337
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,320
We're giving you, you get the high-pitched voice for five minutes.

338
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
My name's Caleb!

339
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

340
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,320
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

341
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

342
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,440
away right now. No, he doesn't have it anymore. That's great. Alright, how is everyone coming

343
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,400
into their talent of the disgusting beer? I'm about done. I'm about 66% into this. I

344
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,040
think I have a third left and I don't like it at all. I'm certainly going to speed run

345
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,000
these beers. Alright, really, Bronx Brewery, you've made a disgusting product and you are

346
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,560
no longer welcome to the show. It's definitely a bottom half sour for me. Yeah, they make

347
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,280
this in the zoo over there in the Bronx. You can taste it. Yeah, it's like this beer tastes

348
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,880
like it should be 8 to 9%. This is the most unpleasant beer of the batch I would say.

349
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,640
Well have you had these other ones? No. So you're just talking out of your ass. It's

350
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,000
a prediction. I'll let y'all know how this one is real soon. Oh my god he's moving on

351
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,480
already. No make it a surprise. Don't ruin the surprise. People can see him. Yeah well

352
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,620
Crack open the second one. What is this one? This is the Grim.

353
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,320
This one is a Grim single negative. Yeah, I think Grim makes the best beers in the entire

354
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,680
world. I kind of agree. They're really fucking great. I've had their double negative. I'm

355
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,680
not a big stout guy. It's pretty heavy. So we'll see how this one goes. I'll keep my

356
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,520
opinions to myself. And keep your mind open also. Yeah. I'm starting to feel psychedelic

357
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:49,500
because I've needed a beer today, man. I've needed a beer so badly.

358
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
What happened?

359
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
I had to go do one thing.

360
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,420
It's probably the hardest thing anyone's done.

361
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,660
I had to go hang up lights at a backyard.

362
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:03,580
That's a dad activity that needs a beer after.

363
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,220
That's akin to working on the railroad.

364
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:10,100
It was worse than that, dude, because I didn't even get paid, first of all, and I didn't

365
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,100
get to die.

366
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,660
And you didn't get to look at trains.

367
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,820
Yeah, exactly. I didn't get to feel like I was part of a bigger thing, which by the way,

368
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,780
you worked on the railroads of your grandpas did shut out.

369
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,260
I'll shut up to you. Yeah, like you also stop complaining. You should instead of complaining,

370
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,740
how about you take all the accolades that I'm willing to give you of thank you so much

371
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,460
because we have one of the greatest rail systems in the entire world now. So thank you so much.

372
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
Kudos to you.

373
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:40,780
Have you seen that video of like 1000 Chinese people making a railroad in nine hours?

374
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:50,120
In China? Yeah, in China. I would have thought in China they would have a robot do that. No,

375
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,060
they got people. They haven't figured out the robot shit yet. They just got hella people.

376
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,520
Wow, in nine hours they made a whole railroad? So they took like a hundred crews of a hundred

377
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,820
people and just had them each do a section of railroad. So imagine in China, like this

378
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:07,760
room would fill with a hundred people. Yeah. Because they got hella people. They got hella

379
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,400
people. Oh, there'd be a hundred person podcast in China.

380
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,960
Yeah, they would all be drinking a hundred beers.

381
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,460
Wow.

382
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,040
They'd be like, "Oh, this sucks."

383
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
They do everything by the hundred.

384
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,400
Three hundred beers. Let's get it straight.

385
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:18,880
Yeah.

386
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,800
Does China do the thing I don't like where all the money is too much?

387
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,560
A little bit.

388
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,240
It's a hundred of something for a dollar.

389
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,680
A little bit. I think a little bit.

390
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,240
It's in between.

391
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,080
What's their Chinese, what's the money in China?

392
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,040
The exchange? You want the exchange rate?

393
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,240
No, no. What's it called?

394
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,740
The yuan.

395
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,600
Yuan is what people say though, right?

396
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,800
- Won is Korean.

397
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
- Oh, okay.

398
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,640
- Yu-won.

399
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,840
- That's a really bad one.

400
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,040
- What's the Japanese one?

401
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,880
It's similar.

402
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,700
- Yeah.

403
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,640
- Yeah, it's too much.

404
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,760
- Well, the good thing about China is that

405
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,920
their money is just completely,

406
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,680
it's just imaginary at this point

407
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,280
because it's all on the phone.

408
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,720
They never have a single bill.

409
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,080
It's always on WeChat.

410
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,920
- Really?

411
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,440
- It's on the phone for us too.

412
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,280
What are you talking about?

413
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,440
- Mostly, but you still have some bills and some coins.

414
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
- They don't really make paper money very often there?

415
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,920
- Yeah, they completely have done away with it.

416
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,880
- Really?

417
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,520
What about, is there still peasants in China?

418
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,020
Yeah.

419
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,960
That's cool that they're like the last place that has peasants.

420
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,460
Yeah.

421
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:13,960
That's awesome.

422
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,360
They're the last place?

423
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:17,360
As far as I know, I only hear about Chinese peasants.

424
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,060
I'm not hearing about fucking Canadian peasants.

425
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:20,700
That is true.

426
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,600
Alex?

427
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,900
Well, yeah, he might be a peasant.

428
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:29,740
But I mean like Monty Python style, like wearing rags covered in dirt.

429
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,240
You know.

430
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,940
That's the thing is you see them on TikTok and they're all wearing like anime girl outfits

431
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,480
and shit like that now.

432
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:35,980
Yeah.

433
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
And they're cooking a monitor lizard.

434
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,980
Yeah.

435
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:39,980
A 400 pound one.

436
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,980
The cooking videos are so awesome.

437
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,980
They just chop a cow's head off.

438
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,980
Dude, the lizard ones, honestly, and the thing is, man, if you watch just the second half

439
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,980
of those videos, that looks like the best food you would ever eat in your entire life.

440
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,980
Oh, dude.

441
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
With all the chili oil and sea?

442
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:03,980
If you didn't take some kind of deep sea creature and torture it and poke it a thousand times,

443
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:07,340
a thousand times, they're like, oh yeah, I got to put poke it with a thousand

444
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:07,740
holes.

445
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,540
I was going to say with a hundred guns.

446
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,500
Yeah, exactly. Like you would eat that. I would eat that.

447
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,980
Yeah.

448
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,180
It's not that big of a deal.

449
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,340
The more tortured the animal, the better the food.

450
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,100
I think veal tastes so good.

451
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,700
That's why veal is so good.

452
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,420
Yeah.

453
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,780
Lamb, it's a tiny baby.

454
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,140
That's how you get every animal born with game in it, they say.

455
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:24,380
Yeah.

456
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,580
They're gamey.

457
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,140
I know, I got game.

458
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,500
Well, speaking of meat, I think we have to move on to your official apology,

459
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,180
Caleb, your officially recorded apology.

460
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:31,820
About what?

461
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,100
For your betrayal.

462
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,100
What betrayal?

463
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,600
The betrayal he did to them yesterday.

464
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Oh, yeah.

465
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,600
To both of us.

466
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Is this what this is?

467
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,600
Is this what this is?

468
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,060
Is you guys, is that what you were like?

469
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,060
We need to get Noah here.

470
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
So you had numbers, you could corner me?

471
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,900
Yeah, I like how he's instigating this.

472
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
When he had his meal paid for.

473
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,900
I was also a victim.

474
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:48,900
I was also a victim.

475
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
How are you a victim?

476
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,900
You got to enjoy it.

477
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
I was a victim.

478
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
I was a perpetrator.

479
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,900
I was used.

480
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,900
I was just simply used.

481
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,900
All right, let's go.

482
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,900
Let's set the scene.

483
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
What was the crime?

484
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:58,900
Let's set the scene.

485
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Crocodile tears from Julio here.

486
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Instead of the school boys in the morning.

487
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,180
Here's the thing. No, no, no. We're going to go before that. We're going to go to what

488
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:14,180
you were going to say. We're going to go to about one month ago. Me, Rex, Julio, maybe

489
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:22,300
you I don't remember. We were talking on Discord and we're making plans for this New York trip.

490
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,620
We're going to do so much fun stuff. This is going to be the best day ever. This will

491
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,540
be the best week of our lives. What are we going to do? Here's what we should do. We

492
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,900
go eat at Fogo de Chao. Who said that? One of us. I don't remember. I think it was you because

493
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:40,420
I didn't know they were in New York. Okay, so I could have just never even told you.

494
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:45,220
So we were like, let's go eat at Fogo de Chao. And then they get they've been here a couple

495
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,780
days. Yesterday, me and Julio and Cameron went out to go get some mic stands. And we

496
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,500
went to an elf or something else. But that was the thing. Yeah, we found a ghost, a ghost

497
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,100
But we woke up, it was like 9am, I texted Julio, I was like we're gonna go run some errands,

498
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,100
you wanna come with?

499
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,500
He said yeah, let me wake up Rex.

500
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Tries to wake up Rex.

501
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,820
And here, this part of the story you can tell, what happened?

502
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:11,980
I knock on his door, he doesn't wake up, I'm assuming he went to sleep, he stayed up late

503
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:14,540
because we were gambling last night.

504
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,980
I was like, you know what, I'm just gonna text him, I'm gonna tell him we're outside, I left

505
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,660
the keys inside, if you wanna go out, we'll be back later for lunch.

506
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,660
That's all I said.

507
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,660
Okay.

508
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,420
Alright, so we, well, let's take a little pause.

509
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,740
We've moved on to the grim orange beer.

510
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,300
No, no, finish the story.

511
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,300
We can talk about the beer after.

512
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,300
Wait, wait, I gotta take a sip of this.

513
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,300
Yeah, take a sip.

514
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,660
Yeah, take a sip, but let's talk about the beer after the story.

515
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:38,660
Okay.

516
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,660
Let's not split it up.

517
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,660
So, he doesn't wake up.

518
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,380
I just text him like, "Hey, we're outside."

519
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,020
He lets me know like, "Yeah, I'm not feeling great.

520
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,820
I'm just gonna rest up and go to the pharmacy."

521
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,620
Like, "Okay, that's completely fine."

522
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,820
We go to our errands.

523
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,900
We fail to do one of them in the funniest way possible.

524
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,180
We get our mic stands and then we're heading back.

525
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,680
I can't just say funny as possible.

526
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,340
What happened is we were looking for costumes for a D&D thing and I found a store called

527
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,500
Halloween World and we put it in Google Maps.

528
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,740
We get there.

529
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,300
It's a piano showroom.

530
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:14,980
Well, first of all, we get there and it's called like Holiday something.

531
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Holiday Himosis.

532
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Holiday...

533
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:17,980
It was called Holiday...

534
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,980
Yeah, Holiday...

535
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:19,980
Central...

536
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:20,980
Yeah, something like that.

537
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,780
we're like, "Oh, okay, maybe it's some like, it's just all holiday stuff." And

538
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:29,580
then we walk in and it's a fully like grand piano stuff that would make no

539
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,660
sense. The most expensive pianos on the planet. Yes, exactly the kind of store

540
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,460
that it makes no sense to be a transient kind of like Halloween store for three

541
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,020
months of the year because you'd have to move fucking 50 pianos. It's giant. The

542
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,580
guy who like greets you at the front is wearing like a tux. Yeah. He's like, "Do

543
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:50,060
you have an appointment?" That's the other thing. It was giant. We walk in, we

544
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,580
walk around where we spend probably no one there. There's not a single soul.

545
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,140
It's a completely ghost store called Holiday Central. There's a bunch of pianos.

546
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:01,460
There's no one there. It was in Flushing. It was in Jamaica. It was so fucking weird.

547
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,260
It was weird, but also it makes complete sense.

548
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,060
So we needed to say that because we already, we're in a weird mood.

549
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,380
We're not acting like ourselves. We're not acting like ourselves.

550
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,220
We got mentally attacked by the world.

551
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,980
And you guys are in a place called Jamaica, but it's in New York?

552
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,020
Exactly. We're being psychically attacked. We have psychic pain.

553
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:22,140
And then we drive over to another Halloween story. This one also doesn't

554
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,000
exist. And then we start driving back to come maybe get you and meet up for lunch.

555
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,040
But then

556
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:31,140
I say, where do you guys want to go to lunch? And Cameron says

557
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:34,240
Fogo de Chau.

558
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,540
It's Cameron's fault. Cameron said it first. That's what I'll say. And I say,

559
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,940
oh yeah, we could put it. I'll see where the Fogo de Chau is. Fogo de Chau,

560
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,400
381 feet away.

561
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,800
Yeah, I want to say, I mean, come on. I want to do a quick aside. I'm completely

562
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,840
hands off on this one because I don't recall who said it first. I'm not all

563
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,760
that upset because I know there's going to be many more Fogo de Chao trips

564
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,240
coming up. I'm planning on making it a weekly thing. Yeah, I'm not. I loved it.

565
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I'm sure it was fantastic. You should go this weekend. What happened was...

566
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,420
A steak house and it's Brazilian? It was 381 feet away. I said,

567
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:09,880
"We're already here." Yeah. It would be 30 minutes round trip, 45 to

568
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,880
come get you. And at that point, I won't even be hungry. I'll be so

569
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,480
I'm full of my own spit that I'm not hungry anymore. So I just make an

570
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,480
executive decision. I pull I take the exit. We wrap around. We park. We go in

571
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:29,080
the guy comes up. He says, Have you ever been to Fogo before? I say no. I have it.

572
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,480
What happens here? I full well I've seen hundreds of videos about this place. He

573
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,780
says, Do you want to order food or do you want the full experience? I order the

574
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,620
experience. Triple full experience. We go, we get, we get, we go to the buffet. Now here's

575
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,160
one thing you need to know about Fogo de Chaux if you're ever going to go and if anyone is

576
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,500
who's listening is ever going to go, which you will go, you will go. Yeah, I'm not so

577
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:59,380
sure. But if you are ever going to go to Fogo de Chaux, they have this buffet, right? And

578
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:05,340
the buffet is a honey pot because it's full of some good stuff. They have all kinds of

579
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,140
cheeses. They have meats, they have salads. You would be one to know what it looks like.

580
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,140
vegetables, fruits, I would because I went.

581
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,140
They have all, anything that you would want on a normal meal.

582
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,140
There's an entire meal sitting for you in the buffet.

583
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,140
Don't do it.

584
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
Don't waste your time.

585
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
Do not go to the buffet.

586
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,140
It's all meat. It's all I'm there for.

587
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,140
I'm there for the meat. I'm there for the steak.

588
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,140
I got one piece of pineapple and two slices of papaya.

589
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,140
No. I wouldn't even touch that.

590
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,140
And three beans. I got three beans because the beans look good,

591
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
but I didn't want to fill up.

592
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,140
Three beans, he sits down and immediately gets, it's one bean.

593
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:39,740
Me and Cam are still sitting down and he's like, "Yo, tell me a bean."

594
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:41,540
So Cam gets one and I get one.

595
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:46,220
I didn't even want to have two more beans worth of food in my stomach because the specter

596
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,820
of not being able to eat as much meat as possible upset me.

597
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,380
So then, dude, they were coming in, they had the garlic steak, they had the picanha, they

598
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,900
had the filets, they had the rib-eyes, they had the...

599
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,900
Bigger wrap steak.

600
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
Bigger wrap steak.

601
00:24:58,900 --> 00:24:59,900
Y'all got to chill.

602
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
They brought over the chicken.

603
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,900
I said, "Get that chicken out of my fucking face."

604
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,900
Fuck that chicken.

605
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,900
I do not want that chicken.

606
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
We said no to the chicken.

607
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,900
We said no to the chicken.

608
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,540
a week but I rarely eat steak.

609
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:14,900
Here's the other thing about Fogo, when they come with that chicken, that lamb, that pork,

610
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,180
you say no, no, no, no, no, you turn that card red.

611
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,620
Which is how it works by the way.

612
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:25,100
You have a card, one side is red, that means no meat, one side is green, that means yes,

613
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,100
as much meat as possible.

614
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:31,060
It's really funny, that's like the bubblegum system essentially.

615
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
The what?

616
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,060
The bubblegum system.

617
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,060
Have you ever been to bubblegum?

618
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,060
I've never been to bubblegum.

619
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,900
system. So they have the thing where you can like if you flip it's I think it says

620
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,620
like run run for his run that will complete they you will be completely

621
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,140
ignored by all service you say stop for stop you flip it over someone will come

622
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,180
in like what do you want so it's not a line from the movie stop for a stop no

623
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,860
they just put it there run for us run as a line yeah that is it probably could

624
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,460
have used another line from the movie forest I have AIDS yeah she never says

625
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:07,460
AIDS. What does she say? She just says I'm very sick. Yeah, it's assumed she is. It's

626
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:12,300
like a Darth Vader type of thing. You think he says I'm the father of AIDS, but he doesn't

627
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:17,980
say that. He does not say that. It's completely useless because the chicken walks up and we

628
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:21,860
can still say like, oh, it's green, but I don't want it by the way. You can just leave.

629
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:25,860
And at one point we're headed on red and the guy still walks up like, hey, you want some

630
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:30,420
of this? Well, this is also a lunch service. I'll say that it was lunch. So it's a little

631
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,420
more casual. As far as I know, the dinner full experience, first of all, it's a little more

632
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:40,180
expensive. And it was expensive. It was $46.50 a person. So if I bring you two, now all of

633
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:47,460
a sudden the bill's $200, right? So it just doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make any

634
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,640
sense. A quarter of a thousand dollars that we're going to go spend at a steak place? No,

635
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:54,640
not going to happen.

636
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Yeah.

637
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
For an unforgettable memory?

638
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,980
You think I wouldn't want to pay for myself? You think I'm not a hardworking man?

639
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:10,500
What? Say it. My name is Caleb. No. No, no, no. Listen, you can't fuck with him. He has

640
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:14,820
to redeem himself. He's been shy all week. He's been crying. I see, I hear him crying

641
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,860
from his room. He does. He barely sleeps. Julio did tell me this, that he went to Fogo

642
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:24,540
to Chow. Talk into the mic! Julio did tell me this, that I went, that he went to Fogo

643
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,940
go to chow and I didn't believe him. Oh, wait, yeah, yeah, back to the airbnb.

644
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,000
Dude, as we were leaving, I was like, okay, who's going to break the news? I

645
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,920
was like, you have to do it because you're the leader of this of this

646
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,640
cartel. It's your fault, but I'll just say

647
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,100
and we're like, no, we'll just never say, but if he asks, we'll just tell

648
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,700
him it's whatever. So I come back to the airbnb. I hope not to have this

649
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,820
conversation with him. I wasn't ready to break down the news, but I'm such a

650
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,480
friend I want to know about your day. I first thing you were hanging out. He's

651
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,640
like, what do you guys go do for lunch? Just a casual conversation.

652
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:07,280
Talk about breaking us apart. I'm looking down. I'm like, I'm gonna have

653
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,680
to tell him. I'm like, you're gonna be upset. You did not say you're gonna be

654
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,640
upset. You just knew he was gonna be a child. You said, for the show. And I

655
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,800
said, that's very funny. That's a really funny. You said, that's funny. Yeah,

656
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,400
He thought it was so absurd.

657
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:26,160
Well, I was like, of course, why would they go to Fogo de Chão without me?

658
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,080
That would be an awful, horrible thing to do to someone.

659
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,440
And he goes, he tells me, "No, really, where did you go for lunch?"

660
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,080
And I go, "Fogo de Chão."

661
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,880
And you could have heard a needle drop on the ground.

662
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,720
Yeah, it was, the whole day was completely ruined.

663
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,080
We've been chastised for the entire day.

664
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,080
I'm surprised you didn't get kicked out.

665
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
I was simply a victim.

666
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,080
But we're getting kicked out anyway.

667
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,080
It's not a problem.

668
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
We are getting kicked out for a different reason.

669
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,080
Oh yeah, talk about that so we don't have to talk about Fogo de Ché.

670
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
Let's talk about the beer now.

671
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,080
That's like coffee.

672
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,080
Yeah, it's a lot of...

673
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,080
I mean that's how stouts taste a lot of the time.

674
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,080
It's like a coffee gingerbread.

675
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,080
That's what I'm getting from it.

676
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
It's okay.

677
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,080
It's a lot lighter than their double negative.

678
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,120
lighter than their double negative which is nice. I don't like a heavy stout. I mean

679
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:24,920
I don't really like stouts either. This tastes like a non-nitro Guinness to me. Yeah, I knew

680
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,680
you would like it because it's similar to Guinness. Part of why I like Guinness is just

681
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,180
the nitro though. If they have a normal Guinness or whatever, I don't want that. Yeah. Yeah,

682
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:39,520
this tastes not as bad as this but I somehow enjoy it less. It's a little tough to get

683
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,720
through. But it's also, I can crush that and that's higher percent but you just can't

684
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,300
crush a stout very easily. They feel heavy.

685
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,300
This is quite hard.

686
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,080
They're very full bodied.

687
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,280
So we have four of the top beer aficionados and speakers on the subject in this room right

688
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:04,400
now. So I feel like we would be remiss to not go around and go favorite beer. Number

689
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,920
one, like undisputed favorite beer.

690
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:07,920
I can't.

691
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,520
Just name one, dude.

692
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
I brought Miller's.

693
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,800
I brought High Life.

694
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
That can't be your favorite.

695
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
It's not my favorite.

696
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,480
Actually, I have, you guys say yours.

697
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,540
You're backing me into a really difficult corner because there's a different beer for

698
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,540
every occasion.

699
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
This is a really loaded question.

700
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Yeah, very loaded.

701
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,160
There's a different beer for every occasion.

702
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:34,120
And this is like I stopped into the deli to make sure I didn't come empty handed to the

703
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,360
beer, the foremost beer podcast on the planet.

704
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:46,760
So okay, well here's the scenario because I am a working man, you're all working men,

705
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,360
you get off a long day of work, you get home, it's like the scene in Cat in the Hat where

706
00:30:52,360 --> 00:31:00,260
Alec Baldwin, he undoes his male spanx he has on and he sits there on the couch, big

707
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:03,220
belly hanging out of the wife beater.

708
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:07,420
You pop open a can, you bring it to your lips, what's entering?

709
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:09,060
What is passing through your gums?

710
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,740
End of the day, hard day of work.

711
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
Hard day.

712
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,740
Are we going in order?

713
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
You're not going to let me answer.

714
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
I'll go first, but you're not going to like it.

715
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
I'm going to say Michelob Ultra.

716
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
Because that's all I drink back home.

717
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,780
I don't drink at all.

718
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,300
That's all you drink is Michelob Ultra?

719
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,660
Yeah, when I have friends over, we just drink like, my beer.

720
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,980
I like Michelob Ultra.

721
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,340
But I'm never reaching for it.

722
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,540
I'm not going to the store and buy Michelob.

723
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:35,540
but I'll say mine. If you're skipping the rest of the day, okay, I thought you

724
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,040
were saving

725
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,540
mine. Mine's probably Jeevik because Patrick probably has a hundred in the

726
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,920
refrigerator at all times, which he only likes because he thinks it's a funny

727
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,580
name. Yeah, yeah, he's like I

728
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:51,300
he's like this is foreign and I shouldn't be able to know how to pronounce

729
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:55,500
it, but I can't. It's fine. It's okay, yeah, but I just drink his beers for

730
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,980
free. That's nice. Yeah, I've been drinking a lot of the Taheen Smirnoff. I

731
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,980
not been drinking beer at home.

732
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:02,980
Taheen Smirnoff.

733
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,980
Yeah, dude. It's like a Dia de los Muertes, like vodka bottle.

734
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980
Okay.

735
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,980
And it's got like a sweet, you know, taheen.

736
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,980
Yeah, I love taheen.

737
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,980
So it's that. It's like a spicy vodka and you can just sip it. It's so good. It's like

738
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,980
sweet.

739
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,980
That's the thing. I don't usually spring for beer and I only drink beer on this podcast.

740
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
Yeah.

741
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:25,980
But I used to be a big beer drinker and I always went for Coors Light.

742
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Right.

743
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,980
Cores Light is the best light beer.

744
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,980
Over, over, I gotta be honest.

745
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,980
What?

746
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Bush is spanking Cores Light every day of the week.

747
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Dude, you are a fucking fool.

748
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,980
Bush, spanking.

749
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,980
You are so stupid bro.

750
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,980
Spanking hard.

751
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
What do I have for you?

752
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,980
Dictatorship, Dictatorship type 5's right now.

753
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,980
Yeah, yeah for sure.

754
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,980
(laughter)

755
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,980
I like Gansets.

756
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Like when I was back home, I would crush like a six pack of Gansets like every night.

757
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:59,020
every night. But I mean if I can only have one beer for the rest of my life, it's gonna

758
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:05,300
be Coors Light. It's gonna be the Grim Hefeweizen. Really? Yeah. What's a Hefeweizen? It's one

759
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:09,780
of the oldest beers in the world. It's got a lot of banana flavor on it, malted barley,

760
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:18,580
it's very nice. It's great beer. Best Hefeweizen. Or the Weifensteiner. You need to speak English

761
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:25,580
The Weifensteiner is a very good beer.

762
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:26,580
What is that one?

763
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,580
It's another Hefeweizen.

764
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,580
Oh, okay.

765
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,580
It's probably one of the oldest beers in the entire world.

766
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,580
So a Stout is a brown one that tastes like poop.

767
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,580
What does a Hefeweizen mean?

768
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,580
So a Weiss beer is a white beer, so it's going to be very similar to a light beer.

769
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,580
How about an Allagash White? You like that?

770
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,720
you like that alligash white is brewed very similar to a traditional German

771
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,880
white beer or vice beer. So what's that? What's the hefa come from

772
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,580
God?

773
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:59,080
I could not tell you yeah yeah, hefe that's what I mean. It's big. I couldn't

774
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,600
tell you man. I just I just drank him. I just put it down.

775
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
Mexico City El Jefe? No, that is ridiculous.

776
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,160
Los Big Apple. Why does my brother say that?

777
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,640
I don't know, my brother was talking about Mexico City, he called it El Jefe.

778
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,400
I was like, "What are you talking about?"

779
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,000
He was like, "Mexico City, El Jefe."

780
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,800
I was like, "What?"

781
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:22,280
He for sure is just talking to like a Mexican guy in LA that's like fucking with him, for sure.

782
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,480
That's awesome.

783
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,320
He's easy to fuck with, for sure.

784
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,680
Yeah, he listens.

785
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,560
So, go ahead.

786
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,160
Yeah, you're easy to fuck with, bro.

787
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:29,800
Oh, he listens?

788
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,360
Can't lie.

789
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,720
He texted me a couple of weeks ago and he said, "Beers we drink, nation."

790
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:35,240
Damn!

791
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,120
I love you.

792
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,120
I'm going to go to his bar now.

793
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:43,900
Yeah, yeah, you need to I'm working on it. Yeah, no, it's doing the drinks. Yeah, I'm doing the drinks

794
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:48,040
When I come absolutely

795
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:54,160
You will be here when it opens you'll be here. It's like six months away

796
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:58,660
It's there's so much shit like LA is such a backwards or like

797
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:05,120
LA County in California in general is just horrible. Yeah, this is officially the last the last time

798
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,840
we ever book an Airbnb because Rex is moving to New York City.

799
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,000
How are you feeling about that move?

800
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm excited.

801
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Yeah.

802
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It's so nice here.

803
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,720
Everyone is always doing shit outside.

804
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:15,720
Yeah.

805
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,720
Yeah.

806
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,720
You know, I was thinking about that today.

807
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,480
No one does anything outside anywhere else.

808
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,240
This is the only city in America where the rich people have to, like the richest people

809
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,840
in the world, have to see a homeless guy every single day.

810
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,840
Yeah.

811
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,840
Yeah.

812
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
It's dope.

813
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:37,040
around like in the richest neighborhoods in New York City, you walk on the street

814
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,440
and there will be a homeless guy. I don't see a homeless guy every day.

815
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,240
Well, you're not rich. You're not rich. You see him in the mirror.

816
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,640
If you live in Manhattan. Yeah, true. That's true. That's true.

817
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,040
If you live in Manhattan, you will. Yeah.

818
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,640
Like Upper West Side, Upper East Side, doesn't matter how rich you are.

819
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,040
You can be at the top of one of those, the Iron Man places, but still.

820
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:55,040
That's my favorite part about living here is like in LA,

821
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,240
it was a weekly thing getting attacked by a homeless guy.

822
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,040
But here, you don't even see him. Wait, you were getting attacked?

823
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Yeah, several times.

824
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Several times?

825
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
What happened?

826
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,600
I mean, on the subway just...

827
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,800
The metro in LA is so much worse.

828
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Yeah.

829
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,800
What did it do to you?

830
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,280
So, a few times on the subway, guys would try and pick fights with me.

831
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
People have a weapon.

832
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,280
They walk around in nunchucks and shit.

833
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
They're scary.

834
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
It's crazy.

835
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,240
I mean, they take over whole subway cars and turn them into like, "This is my house now."

836
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,360
One guy will just pop a squat in a subway car.

837
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:32,840
I remember one day on the subway, I was getting on the subway and I saw a guy smoking crack

838
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:40,480
and then on the bus into work I saw a guy jerking off and then when I got off the subway to

839
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,560
get home I was like, "Whew, that was a rough day on the metro."

840
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,840
And I come out of the station and there's a guy, spread eagle, his whole butthole in

841
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,120
view for me, just dropping a deuce right there.

842
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,960
And also homeless guy poop.

843
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Homeless guy poop.

844
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,220
That's very different than the poop that me and you poop.

845
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,720
No fiber in that dye.

846
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,200
No fiber, it's a different color than I've ever seen before.

847
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,200
It's a new color.

848
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:11,280
Yeah, yeah, Pantone probably went and sampled it and put it on the color wheel.

849
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,360
Yeah, LA is fucking crazy.

850
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,560
I remember me and you over by where I lived.

851
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,040
I lived by the Wiltern off Wilshire and we were like walking somewhere over there.

852
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
Guy with one arm.

853
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,720
Yeah, I was in our there's a guy one arm. So his pants were sagging. Yes.

854
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,200
He had no underwear on his pants were sagging right underneath his cock.

855
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,040
So his cock was falling out and he was trying to hold his pants up with his one

856
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,200
arm. By the way, valiant effort. Yeah. If I was him,

857
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,400
I would have just let that thing fly. There's no way I'm like, I'm homeless.

858
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,400
I'm like that. I have one fucking arm. So look at my dick. I don't care.

859
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,640
Horrendously dirty and flailing about.

860
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,960
He had like a little nub and it was like moving.

861
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Like it was doing something, but it wasn't doing anything. Yeah.

862
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,040
LA certainly has some really new types of homeless people coming out every day.

863
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,040
Every day now.

864
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:05,280
It's like, and every time I go back it's like, any time you pick up a new Pokemon game, where

865
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,800
you're like, I know the original 151, but all this is getting crazy.

866
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,280
It's all original 151 here in New York.

867
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:15,280
It's very traditional homeless people.

868
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Good people.

869
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,280
Good people.

870
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,400
Good people that are just like, give me money or I'm going to scream.

871
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,520
And I go, you know what dude, yeah.

872
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,320
In LA they get straight to screaming.

873
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:28,480
Today a guy came, I was pumping gas, a guy came up and he was like, "Hey man, can I like

874
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,640
wash your window or something?

875
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,280
And I, or can I like help like pump your gas for you?"

876
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
And I was like, "Here man, I got some cash."

877
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,760
Gave him like 10 bucks.

878
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,760
And then he walked away.

879
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
He immediately just walked away.

880
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,360
And I realized I just paid him to just go away.

881
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,800
I paid money for, to just not talk to him anymore.

882
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Yeah.

883
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Hit me with the rosé.

884
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Yeah.

885
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,160
beer that we have. Noah's moving in first.

886
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,760
Well, it's not as strong. We got plenty of room.

887
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,760
This one is definitely...

888
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,760
No, take your time.

889
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
I got 20%.

890
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,560
I want to get into these millers. I want to drink at least two of them.

891
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:08,360
These are like the last obligatory beers. These are like bonus dessert if you wish it

892
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
so.

893
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,560
Oh, Noah did not have a good reaction to that.

894
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,040
I will say I don't like rose.

895
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Okay.

896
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:19,920
And I think it's a rose cider and I really only like very decadent and delicate rose

897
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,160
- It's been like such a like a backwards experience for you and me.

898
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,560
- That you having, you know like in this one, I'm gonna think that I'm actually gonna like it.

899
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,400
- Noah's getting the high-pitched voice after that.

900
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,760
He said he only likes very decadent and delicate rosé ciders.

901
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,560
- That's fine dude.

902
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,360
- He's had one before.

903
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,160
- I'm comfortable with who I am. I don't mind the voice at all.

904
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,840
- Somebody kill him.

905
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,120
- No, no, I'll own it.

906
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,400
- Nah, I'll do it.

907
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:46,960
- No, no.

908
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the

909
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
news.

910
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

911
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

912
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

913
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

914
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

915
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

916
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

917
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

918
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

919
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

920
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

921
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
I'm going to be doing a video on the news.

922
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
This is a craziness episode.

923
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
It's extra bow down.

924
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
An extra bow down?

925
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,960
If you bow to someone that's respectful.

926
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
I wish I could.

927
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Do both of them right now.

928
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
My name is Caleb.

929
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,960
Start up and do both of them.

930
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,960
The bow down and the cow down.

931
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,960
Oh yeah the demonstration.

932
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,960
He needs to get on the table.

933
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,960
No you can see it there.

934
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Show me a bow.

935
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
I've seen him do this in many times.

936
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,320
Cowtow is like you're on your knees.

937
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Oh!

938
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,320
There he goes.

939
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,320
Whoa!

940
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
I would say that's praising.

941
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Yeah.

942
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
That's like downward dog.

943
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
He just did it to me.

944
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
That's awesome.

945
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,320
You got that one for free.

946
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Yeah, I know.

947
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
You didn't even do anything.

948
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,560
Yeah, I didn't do shit.

949
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,560
I just used the word cowtow and he did it.

950
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,040
Because your vocabulary is so densely huge.

951
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
Use a little life hack.

952
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
And it's always so wrong.

953
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,680
It was telling me something about the party yesterday and it was all completely wrong,

954
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
but I just believed him.

955
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
About the what?

956
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,880
- Something about like acid in my cells

957
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,920
and like exploding and having like an epitome.

958
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,440
I don't know, it was Cam, nevermind.

959
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,680
- Yeah, I was gonna say, bro, chill, I'm always right.

960
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,600
- No, that was actually completely Cam.

961
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,400
- I've never, ever been wrong, ever.

962
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,280
- I feel like I'm getting more of that.

963
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,040
I'm getting like, I'm remembering stories

964
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,960
or like things that happened to me.

965
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,000
And I'm like, oh yeah, you were there.

966
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,520
But it was a completely different person.

967
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,360
- I-- - You are--

968
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,960
- And who was there with us when we went

969
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,800
to the knife store in LA?

970
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,720
- My brother.

971
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,960
- Okay, it was Josh.

972
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:45,400
Yeah, we went to the knife store and they claimed that they had OJ Simpson's knife.

973
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,120
They sold OJ Simpson the knife.

974
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,120
Oh, that's what they said.

975
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:54,640
They said that OJ Simpson, for whatever reason, to buy the knife, went to downtown Los Angeles

976
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,760
and bought the knife as if it was like so premeditated that he...

977
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,160
Which I don't think it was, right?

978
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,560
Wasn't that the whole thing with him?

979
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,560
He was going...

980
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
No, he's in a rage.

981
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,560
Yeah, he was in a complete rage.

982
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,240
He was like, "Oh, you're fucking someone else."

983
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,760
I think he just bought the knife there and then later did the murder with that knife.

984
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Yeah.

985
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:17,200
And then they had like a nice case that said OG Simpson knife.

986
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
With a glove.

987
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
That's the story right?

988
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,960
She was fucking somebody else right?

989
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,200
And then he was like I'm gonna kill you bitch.

990
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,960
It's actually interesting because I don't know shit really.

991
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,720
So the uh, they were amicable.

992
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,480
It was an amicable split.

993
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,200
They still were friends.

994
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,600
and then one day that's why some people think he didn't do it. Some people still do.

995
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,640
I don't think he did it. I don't think he did it. But I think he did use that knife.

996
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:47,080
It was an amicable murder? No, I think he didn't kill her and he used that knife at

997
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,240
that store. They were divorced. They were divorced. It was his ex-wife. She sold the

998
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,160
knife and he committed suicide. The guy that he killed, the other guy, was just her gay

999
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:03,840
best friend. Oh. Yeah. If a girl dates me and we break up, she's always mine and she

1000
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:10,840
can't fuck ever again or else I'll kill her. That's the damn truth. That's the damn truth.

1001
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:17,200
You know? And I'll only say that if it's behind several paywalls or else I'll incriminate

1002
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:27,000
myself. Oh fuck. God damn it. You guys are going to post it all over the place and I'm

1003
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,040
going to prison. So this rose cider, I like this. Yeah. I like this. You're just not into

1004
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,240
the decadent and delicate rose cider like I am. I don't like decadent and delicate which

1005
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:43,720
to me are two kind of opposing words when it comes to describing a drink. How so? Decadent

1006
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:48,800
and what? Decadent and delicate. Decadent means like it's definitely, it's of a higher class.

1007
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,360
It's a lot more workmanship put into the drink than a mass produced sort of canned beverage.

1008
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:57,480
and beverage. This is fucking mass produced bullshit. And delicate means that it's probably

1009
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,640
going to have some florals in it. It's probably going to have some herbs. So you want dirt

1010
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,000
and flowers in your fucking drink. Guys, this is our highest ABV one that we've had. What

1011
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:14,160
the fuck? 6.9%. Oh my god, that's a sexy number. Yeah. It makes me think about something naughty.

1012
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:22,920
This is from Graft. This got birth defects. Ew. That's a horrible name for a brewery. Graft.

1013
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,120
I do like that they have to put that warning on beer.

1014
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
Makes me think of ass.

1015
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,720
By the way, if you're pregnant, some pregnant lady is going to be halfway through one of

1016
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:33,720
these going, "Wait a minute!

1017
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,720
What the fuck!

1018
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,720
Hold up!

1019
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,720
Wait!

1020
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,720
The Surgeon General thinks I shouldn't drink this?"

1021
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,720
And then go, "Who's that?

1022
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,720
Some Civil War guy?

1023
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,720
Finish that."

1024
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,720
I'm not fucking with them.

1025
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,760
Oh, one more sip can't hurt.

1026
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,760
How bad is that?

1027
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:50,920
You can drink it first.

1028
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,520
first like the first trimester you can drink. You can't drink drink but you can like you

1029
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:01,180
can have a glass here and there. It's like a drinkable driving type of situation. Yeah

1030
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:04,840
exactly. If you can handle it, it's completely fine. Yeah, yeah but then after that first

1031
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:09,000
trimester you need to slow down. This is medical advice by the way. Yeah, yeah I'm a doctor.

1032
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,960
I'm a doctor and I gave it up to be a bartender. I think that my mom definitely had some wine

1033
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,560
while I was, while I was at home. I can say without a doubt my mommy didn't touch it at

1034
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,560
I think my mom smoked while she was pregnant with me.

1035
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,560
That's rude, what he said, by the way.

1036
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,560
That was rude.

1037
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:28,560
What he said?

1038
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
I'm still a little sore from you going to...

1039
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,560
Yeah, I know, you're lashing out.

1040
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,560
I understand.

1041
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:34,560
I understand.

1042
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,560
My mommy was a good girl.

1043
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:37,560
Yeah, she is.

1044
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,560
Yo, why'd you say that?

1045
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,560
My mom's a good girl.

1046
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:43,560
Let me redo that.

1047
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:45,560
My mommy is a good girl!

1048
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,560
Is that better?

1049
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,560
No, that's worse.

1050
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,560
That's worse?

1051
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,560
I think you'd fit right in.

1052
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,560
You guys have been watching MILF Manor?

1053
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,560
Dude, I've been done.

1054
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,560
I've been done with MILF Manor

1055
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,560
for weeks.

1056
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
I ran it through in two days.

1057
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
We only watched it because this morning

1058
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560
he told me that he put it on

1059
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,560
just in silence and he turned it off.

1060
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,560
You want me to spoil? No, no, no.

1061
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
We went out for breakfast and

1062
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,560
Rex was like, "Yeah, I couldn't sleep. It was horrible.

1063
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
There's demons in my room. We'll get to that."

1064
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,560
And he said, "I just put it on MILF Manor

1065
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,520
for like half an hour and on the first episode he gets to the part where they're like touching

1066
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,520
the boys. Oh the blindfold challenge. Yeah, find your boy and they get all the women and

1067
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,000
the women are like oh I want to touch all the boys and they get up there to touch the

1068
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,880
boys and he's like you know what this is enough, this is too much for me Rex. Can I really

1069
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:40,560
quickly say what my strategy would be in that? If you touch all their cocks of course your

1070
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:46,120
son is going to be like oh no! I think that's the smart because they all take their shirts

1071
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,120
So you're supposed to touch the upper body.

1072
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,120
Yeah, you break the rule.

1073
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:52,120
You gotta give a shit.

1074
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:57,120
Also the thing about Milf Manor is there's no prize at the end.

1075
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:08,120
It's not like, yeah, yeah, it's like, no one wins anything except like maybe we like go out for drinks back home.

1076
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:15,120
When I was in Raleigh, me, Adam, and Chad sat and watched like three episodes of Milf Manor

1077
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,720
to the one that was devastating, honestly, where they ask, they're like,

1078
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:23,480
what is the nastiest thing you've ever done? The nastiest sex thing.

1079
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,520
And you have to try to match it to your, to who, which one is your mom?

1080
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:31,600
Oh my God, dude. Yeah. And, uh, the one,

1081
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,960
this one lady, hers, hers was, I don't remember her name,

1082
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,280
but hers was, uh, so the blonde Asian lady who has,

1083
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,680
So young is shut up.

1084
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,680
She's awesome.

1085
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:46,680
So young was my favorite.

1086
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,440
So she's she apparently has sex.

1087
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,640
She was like, I had sex with my my son's best friend.

1088
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,600
Yeah. Yeah.

1089
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,800
Well, and he gets drunk.

1090
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,280
Gets fucked up.

1091
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,560
Yeah. Like basically tries to kill himself in the pool.

1092
00:47:58,560 --> 00:47:59,960
Yeah. He gets naked.

1093
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,240
He talks out and everything.

1094
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,680
And he's like, I don't give a fuck about anything anymore.

1095
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,440
Like, yeah, you can tell that he suspected this for so long.

1096
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,200
Yeah. Yeah. And as soon as he saw that on the board, he was like, I'm fucked, man.

1097
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,440
Yeah, but it's hoping it wasn't her the whole time. Yeah, I think honestly I would

1098
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,440
I would kill her first. I think I would definitely kill my mom if I went on that

1099
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,140
trip. Wait, do they like get like eliminated? What happened? So they did

1100
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:31,040
switch people out. But I think the only purpose of switching people out was like

1101
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:37,040
y'all are not like making this. Yeah, this is the show mom that got switched

1102
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,040
The Jersey mom with the stripper son, they get swapped out.

1103
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:47,040
And I think that's the only one that gets swapped out.

1104
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
There's that one mom that looks like a teddy bear. I like her.

1105
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,040
A teddy bear?

1106
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:51,040
Yeah.

1107
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,040
She has that kind of like teddy bear like lines on her face.

1108
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,040
Oh, no, I hated that mom. The one that looks like a skeleton?

1109
00:48:58,040 --> 00:48:59,040
Maybe.

1110
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,040
Oh, the older mom with the gay son. There's a couple gay sons on the show.

1111
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:06,040
There's like two or three gay sons.

1112
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,040
Yeah, one of them was just completely there to just touch the other boys.

1113
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:12,540
Which is like, how, of course that would be so hard to break the news to your mom when she's like,

1114
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:15,840
"I just got accepted on MILF Manor. I sent them a photo of you."

1115
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:16,340
Yeah.

1116
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:17,840
And just be like, "Oh!"

1117
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:18,340
Yeah.

1118
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:25,140
They have their nails are painted, they're wearing pearl chokers, they're like wearing their mommy's hoodie at night, you know.

1119
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:32,440
We got a complete sidetrack. We were just watching MILF Manor because I told, he brought this up during breakfast,

1120
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,440
And I was like, oh, that's funny.

1121
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,800
That reminds me of the story that

1122
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,720
Patrick told about you

1123
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:38,600
watching Milf Manor in

1124
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,540
your place with your girlfriend and

1125
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,360
Patrick's girlfriend.

1126
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,400
Yeah, it was mostly driven by them,

1127
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,120
by the way. I will say

1128
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,120
I was very entertained.

1129
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,600
This is a judge free zone.

1130
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,440
We're talking about decadent and delicate.

1131
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:51,560
I will own it.

1132
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:53,360
Decadent and delicate.

1133
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,480
So and you do say

1134
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,080
that one of them is Rex

1135
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:59,040
and then Patrick walks in and says,

1136
00:49:59,040 --> 00:49:59,960
oh, that guy's Rex.

1137
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,380
And you guys all laugh.

1138
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:01,960
It's so funny.

1139
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:02,960
Which guy?

1140
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:05,960
No, y'all are not deep enough into the show to meet him.

1141
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,960
He's the one who replaces the Jersey mom and son.

1142
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,960
Oh, yeah.

1143
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:17,960
We put it on because me and Cameron, if you both said the same thing, we thought as soon

1144
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,960
as we see him, we're going to know it's him.

1145
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,960
And we're looking for him, like, this one's gay, this one's black, this one's Asian.

1146
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,960
Alright, pull it up on the phone.

1147
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,960
Pull it up, yeah, pull it up, pull it up.

1148
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,960
And you'll be like, "This is Rex. It is Rex."

1149
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:35,460
And he does a demonstration of how to eat pussy in front of everyone.

1150
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:36,960
It's so awesome.

1151
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,960
Do you know what his name is?

1152
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:38,960
I don't know.

1153
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,960
Like he's the one who did it to you.

1154
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,960
I don't know anyone's name from that show.

1155
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,960
That's okay.

1156
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,960
Here's how you eat pussy.

1157
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,960
I couldn't even show you if I wanted to. I don't know how.

1158
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,960
Holding court during dinner.

1159
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,960
Be like, "By the way guys, this is how you eat pussy. Hand me that apple."

1160
00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,460
it

1161
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:04,120
spitting all over the place. Tell me you see him. Oh, I keep going. That

1162
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:09,000
one's that one's a new one. Yeah, it's a gay one. Yeah, also so young son might

1163
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:14,000
be gay. I don't think it's out on him. I don't think I think he's hot Jimmy.

1164
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:21,320
Yeah, Jimmy, he's a he's Jim Jim Jim Jim Jim. I would if I was around

1165
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,860
honestly, if I was in the manor and it was a I was like dude imagine,

1166
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:28,260
because they have that they had better of a cleaning crew, because you know

1167
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:32,100
nasty something's going on. If I was in that milf manor, I was a cleaning crow

1168
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:39,320
as a janitor straight up. I would fold on the on the janitor crew. I would fold

1169
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:44,820
if any if any of those mills or or two of those sons approach me, I'm folding

1170
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:50,920
well. That's the problem. They two two sons or one mill to do any of the mills

1171
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,460
Or two specific ones of the sons.

1172
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:54,460
Well, that's the thing.

1173
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:55,460
I followed it.

1174
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:57,700
They get the ugliest crew of all time, so the MILFs are not in.

1175
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:03,660
I will say, on the show, there is only one implied instance of sexual contact.

1176
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:04,660
In the entire thing?

1177
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:05,660
In the entire show.

1178
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:06,660
Well, there's one.

1179
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,660
Which is like, "What the fuck?"

1180
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:08,660
Like, "Yup."

1181
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:09,660
The blonde girl and the...

1182
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,900
Yeah, yeah, and the handsome Spanish guy.

1183
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,900
Oh, yeah.

1184
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:12,900
Oh, the Spanish guy.

1185
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,900
They fucked.

1186
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,900
They fucked.

1187
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,900
They fucked in a hotel.

1188
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,900
They like go off the property.

1189
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:17,900
They say, "Wait, you can just leave?"

1190
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:18,900
Yeah, they just leave.

1191
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,900
What?

1192
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,900
No, no, they win it.

1193
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,520
And he like gets a pick and they go fuck and I figured the boy. How do you win?

1194
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,080
How do you fucking remember dude? I really do not be the most

1195
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:33,500
Seven or six maybe it's like it's kind of deep into the show

1196
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:37,740
Yeah, I'm - what's like a like a like a YouTube like video essay about it - like no

1197
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:44,420
I was expecting just complete fuck like fuck fest the whole time and it was not at all and I was

1198
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:50,580
Disappointed with how gross it is. Oh women. Yeah, I wanted to see 19 year old boys fuck 50 year old woman

1199
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,580
That's what I wanted to say.

1200
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,580
Honestly, a lot of the MILFs are a little disappointing.

1201
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:56,080
There's maybe one or two MILFs that are pretty hot.

1202
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:57,080
Yeah, yeah.

1203
00:52:57,080 --> 00:53:04,180
But I think what is the explanation for that is like how, why on earth would a hot woman

1204
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,780
say yes to doing this show?

1205
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:06,780
Exactly, yeah.

1206
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:11,100
And also, it probably strokes your ego to be cast as a MILF on something.

1207
00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:12,100
Yeah.

1208
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,100
You know.

1209
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,100
That is a situation.

1210
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:18,340
I don't know if they necessarily knew the name of the show before they got put on.

1211
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:19,340
But they understood.

1212
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:21,620
On the first episode they were like, "This is just like a dating camp."

1213
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,180
No, no, no.

1214
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:26,300
They all knew what was happening going in.

1215
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,500
They knew the whole thing.

1216
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,940
You can tell they're all bad actors.

1217
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,620
And they're like, "Oh, I didn't even know that you guys were going to be here."

1218
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,220
It was like, they were weirded out.

1219
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,620
But if I saw my mom, I would be like, "Whoa, what the fuck?"

1220
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:40,740
Or I would just be like, "Oh, what?

1221
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,740
My mom's here."

1222
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,740
"My mom's here?"

1223
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,180
"Where the fuck, where's my mom here?"

1224
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,660
"Where's my mom here?"

1225
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,280
Personally me I'd be playing valor in my room the whole time. That's right

1226
00:53:49,280 --> 00:54:12,200
Do you think they give them that option like do you want to take your ps5 if you want like no

1227
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:16,820
No, they want you to mingle. They want you to rub and mingle.

1228
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,820
Honestly, the real version of an interview, if you did it with no cameras, would be...

1229
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,820
It would actually be...

1230
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:24,820
It would be a ton of guys playing Madden in 2K.

1231
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:27,820
It would be seven guys playing 2K in the living room every single day.

1232
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,820
Yeah.

1233
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:30,820
And the mom's cleaning up and cooking.

1234
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:36,820
(laughter)

1235
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:39,820
Yeah, and they're just like talking about their sons.

1236
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:43,500
that are like getting a little bit competitive about who's the best at 2k by the end of the

1237
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:48,460
show. And the moms are who's the best at cooking and who's the best at cleaning. They just

1238
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:51,860
take turns, they have a chore chart going, they're doing their whole thing. Yeah, the

1239
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:56,180
sons don't do any of it, they don't take the trash out. Of course not. No. Fuck no. I'm

1240
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:01,740
not taking the trash out, I'm playing 2k. If I show up in MILF Manor, God forbid, if

1241
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:06,540
I show up in MILF Manor, that is what I'm doing. I'm unionizing the sons instantly. All we're

1242
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,660
doing is playing video games. I don't give a fuck about this show at all. The only way

1243
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:12,620
we can win is to not play.

1244
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:14,660
Yeah, I think that's true.

1245
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:20,940
I do think that is the only way you win that show. I mean, the only way you win is to not

1246
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:24,180
join in the first place because it's the most embarrassing thing you can do.

1247
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,060
It is crazy that there's winners and losers on it.

1248
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,740
No, there's not. There's not winners and losers.

1249
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,740
You said it was one-on-one.

1250
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:37,540
No, they won like, they got challenged. They all picked, like he had the most votes for

1251
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:43,100
people that liked him. So he gets to pick like which one of these women does he take

1252
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:48,740
to fuck in a hotel room. And he picked the woman that he was going to have the highest

1253
00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:54,440
chance of fucking. And then he went and fucked her. And that's it. And then at the end they

1254
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,320
just all hold hands and are like, "Are we going to keep seeing each other?"

1255
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:05,600
And then maybe the guy says like a haiku that he wrote.

1256
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:10,880
We also watched, on that same trip, we watched some Jersey Shore, first season Jersey Shore.

1257
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,880
That show is fucking crazy.

1258
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,920
That show they are having sex in the first episode.

1259
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,040
That's a real ass show.

1260
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,100
That's like completely unscripted.

1261
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,520
That is an insane show.

1262
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:23,520
It's so good, man.

1263
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:24,600
Yeah, it's really, really good.

1264
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,640
I mean, also, I mean, they're still popular.

1265
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,640
Like, uh,

1266
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,160
Pauly D is still, he's still doing his thing.

1267
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,720
He does DJ sets in Atlantic City like

1268
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,880
every year. And he had like a Vegas residency

1269
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:37,320
and shit like that.

1270
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,440
I love the reveal in that episode of

1271
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,800
The Manor Doing Well.

1272
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,240
How to where Pauly D is at

1273
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,160
spring break.

1274
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,000
Yeah.

1275
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,800
That's like one of the one of my favorite

1276
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,800
moments.

1277
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,680
Pauly D is a man.

1278
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,320
Yeah. I love Pauly D.

1279
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:52,880
We got to go to the Jersey Shore.

1280
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:57,240
We got to go and and and I've been to AC many times.

1281
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,600
There's a Wahlburger that I want to go to.

1282
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:00,280
AC sucks.

1283
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:02,000
No, you guys are stupid.

1284
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,560
Me and Caleb will be in a penthouse.

1285
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,040
You guys didn't.

1286
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,480
Yeah, but we didn't do it right.

1287
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,400
I mean, that's definitely true, but

1288
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:09,920
we didn't win.

1289
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:18,520
Y'all were describing your trip to AC and you're like, we all got way too drunk and we were all so hung over and we hated our lives.

1290
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:19,960
And then we went to AC.

1291
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,000
We brought your brother.

1292
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Yeah, he's a complete downer.

1293
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:29,000
Well, no, he was just talking too much about like blackjack math.

1294
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Yeah, he's a complete downer.

1295
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
And then y'all being like, "We're all way too drunk and hungover. We have to leave."

1296
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:40,000
And he's like, "I'm just getting high. I just got hung off my table."

1297
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,000
Yeah, it's like a three-hour drive. It was nine o'clock.

1298
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:48,000
And he's the only drunk one. He's drunk off rum and coke because he just started drinking two months ago.

1299
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
And he was like, "If I'd say to that table I would have made $800."

1300
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Shut the fuck up.

1301
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Do you remember when you and I sat at that one slot?

1302
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,000
It was like a Chinese dragon slot with a huge screen.

1303
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
I love those.

1304
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,000
And I hit like seven bonuses like back to back and then just upped the bet and lost everything before we went to lunch.

1305
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:14,000
I don't remember that. No, I have so many memories of just staring at a screen in Atlantic City.

1306
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
It's hard to parse which ones are which.

1307
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Right.

1308
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:21,080
That's the first place I've ever had a martini.

1309
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,080
How'd you have it?

1310
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:24,120
I just ordered it on the bottom of the slot.

1311
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
Oh, just a martini.

1312
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Yeah.

1313
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,120
And it came in a plastic cup.

1314
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,120
Oh!

1315
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,120
Vodka or gin.

1316
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:30,120
I felt like James Bond.

1317
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,120
I don't think they let you choose.

1318
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:37,640
No, you just order a martini on the button.

1319
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,840
I'm not feeling like I'm going to enjoy the drinks in ACA.

1320
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:42,160
The drinks are not good.

1321
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,080
It'll be like rum and coke for me.

1322
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,360
I bet, okay, so Vegas is of course way better than they say.

1323
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,080
- Yeah, Vegas is fantastic.

1324
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,160
- You need to go to Vegas.

1325
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,840
- Vegas is basically Disney World.

1326
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,680
- Yes.

1327
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:53,520
- Yeah, you have every--

1328
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,400
- Vegas is manicured, it is engineered

1329
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:59,600
to extract money from you,

1330
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,360
to get you drunk and high and ready to lose your money.

1331
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:04,200
- Yep.

1332
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,080
- And I'm ready, I'm ready to go back.

1333
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,200
- Vegas actually has good food and stuff.

1334
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,960
- I didn't drink when I went to Vegas.

1335
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,080
- That is horrific.

1336
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,800
- I was just like completely high out of my mind

1337
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:19,640
the whole time and I didn't gamble barely at all. I didn't care for gambling.

1338
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,600
Speaking of drinking, this is somehow the worst of the three.

1339
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,100
Yeah, I agree. I don't really like it.

1340
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,600
This is fine. This goes down easy.

1341
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,600
Yeah, it goes down easy, but I don't like the taste. It has something weird.

1342
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:31,600
It goes down harsh.

1343
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,100
It's got a bit of funk on it and it's not a good funk.

1344
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:37,400
I opened it and I wafted and I smelled it.

1345
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:40,600
Yeah, it's got a bit of a booger type of vibe to it.

1346
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:41,600
It completely exploded Rex's hair.

1347
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:46,660
on the mic and completely explore. Rex is her. You look drunker than you did when

1348
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:51,160
you walked into yeah, surely okay, yeah, you look messed up.

1349
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:57,260
You wouldn't know you crush this struggle. Yeah, do we have a true

1350
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:01,800
something to something to open this with most people. Do I need to go out and

1351
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,400
break it on the rock iron fence?

1352
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:10,820
Yeah, yeah, we didn't even talk about that. Should I go? I think we need to

1353
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,840
I don't want to show my cock on camera.

1354
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,840
My cock is kind of poking out.

1355
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,840
It's right in my cockle area.

1356
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:23,840
Those are my nuts right there.

1357
01:00:23,840 --> 01:00:25,840
That's not your nuts.

1358
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,840
Just know we got here and...

1359
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,840
We needed something. He had to jump a gate to get something for my wife.

1360
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:38,840
No, no, no. So Caleb's wife was like, "I want those chairs."

1361
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:43,640
those chairs and I was like, I'm not getting those fucking chairs. And then I see Rex look

1362
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:50,000
at the fence and suss it out like, can I jump over this fence? And he clearly decided no.

1363
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,440
And as soon as I saw that, I was like, I can jump this fence right now. And you got, you

1364
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,040
paid the price. Well, I had the super hops and I jumped over the fence. You paid the

1365
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:03,680
paper. Vertical, you know, I could have played it in the NBA. Of course. You know, they didn't

1366
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:09,680
get on skate the first time. The first time, yeah fine. Second time, just complete blowout

1367
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:16,680
and my shorts are in tatters. Like my dick is just hanging out of my shorts right now.

1368
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:21,040
It's just your balls, relax. My dick and my balls dude. Everyone knows you have balls

1369
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:28,040
bro. No, stand in the middle. Damn, those are some CCS shorts. Those are like the tightest

1370
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,260
shorts. I will say they lasted seven years. So pretty damn good.

1371
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:36,720
And they wouldn't last even longer.

1372
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:37,720
They're small.

1373
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,720
I bought them when I was 18.

1374
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,720
They're small shorts.

1375
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,720
They're small shorts.

1376
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,720
Oh, I just, I just, they're just tall like a piece of metal.

1377
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,720
I just tore them again.

1378
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,720
They just hit their best buy date, right?

1379
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,720
Yeah.

1380
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:48,720
You gonna go buy shorts tomorrow?

1381
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:51,280
Yeah, we're going to Manhattan to buy shorts with Annie.

1382
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,280
I have to work a double.

1383
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:53,280
All right, we'll get you some shorts.

1384
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,280
A double what?

1385
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,280
A double whammy.

1386
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,280
A double shift?

1387
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:57,280
Oh, okay.

1388
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,280
I'm bartending brunch and then I'm, you know, you all don't care.

1389
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,280
What time are you off?

1390
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,280
What time are you off?

1391
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:05,280
Say what time you're off.

1392
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,280
Like 9pm.

1393
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:07,280
Never mind.

1394
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:08,280
9 to 9?

1395
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,280
No, go.

1396
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,280
No, no, no.

1397
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,280
Leave.

1398
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,480
Back to the original cast.

1399
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,480
No more distractions.

1400
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:14,480
Finally.

1401
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:15,480
Hand him the keys.

1402
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,240
Hand him keys so he can pop the bottle.

1403
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,360
I one time, when we were on tour I opened, I was really drunk and Pierce handed me a

1404
01:02:24,360 --> 01:02:28,120
a bottle to open with keys. And he was like, "Can you open this with keys? I can't do it."

1405
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,880
And I opened it and I tore one of my knuckles clean off of my hands.

1406
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,600
Oh, I think I remember that.

1407
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,360
It was the most disgusting injury I've ever had.

1408
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,680
Here, yeah, I can open them with keys if you can.

1409
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:41,160
He says he can open them with keys.

1410
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,160
I can not.

1411
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:46,960
No, it's, like I said, I haven't done it since then. Ripped my knuckle off my body.

1412
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:47,960
I'm very methodical with it.

1413
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:51,920
Yeah, I think I remember seeing you with like a fucked up knuckle.

1414
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,920
Where are you going?

1415
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,920
Where are you going?

1416
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:55,920
Okay, nasty. Farting?

1417
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,920
Disgusting. Fart in the fucking, there's a bathroom right there.

1418
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,920
If you fart in the bathroom, you are a girl.

1419
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:02,920
Or it's Thanksgiving.

1420
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:06,920
Those are the two options.

1421
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:08,920
I think Rex is feeling that by the way.

1422
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,920
I just gotta keep going.

1423
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,920
It'll be open and the episode will end.

1424
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,920
Yeah, pretty much.

1425
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,920
I don't know, we still have to finish these and these are completely disgusting.

1426
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:18,920
I mean we gotta finish these, come on guys.

1427
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,920
No, we don't have to finish these.

1428
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,920
What's our run time?

1429
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,440
- I want an hour or two.

1430
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:25,920
- Yeah, let's go for an hour 30.

1431
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:26,760
Come on, let's crush this.

1432
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,000
- I think we can go for like an hour 20,

1433
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,040
but I don't, these are like terrible.

1434
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,920
- Yeah, I didn't like them.

1435
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:35,000
- Yeah, and it'll take an hour 20 more

1436
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,360
for him to open all the highlights.

1437
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:39,420
- No, we just need to unlock the door

1438
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:41,400
and bang him on the raw iron.

1439
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,920
- No, that's not worth it.

1440
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:44,480
For a high life, dude, I'm not doing that.

1441
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,320
- High life is pretty good.

1442
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,160
- There you go, it's open.

1443
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:46,980
Oh my God, it's open.

1444
01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:48,440
All right, open the rest of them just in case.

1445
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:49,840
- Yeah, open them all, just in case.

1446
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,540
- I'm gonna see, I'm gonna see.

1447
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:52,260
No, we don't need that.

1448
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:54,180
That's great. These keys are not going to work anymore.

1449
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:56,820
We got completely kicked out of our Airbnb, sort of.

1450
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:57,380
Oh, yeah.

1451
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:58,820
Oh, yeah. We need to talk about that.

1452
01:03:58,820 --> 01:03:59,380
Yeah, yeah.

1453
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,340
Go ahead and explain.

1454
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:04,820
You want to talk about, first of all, the demons, how they live in the place?

1455
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:06,420
You have a haunted Airbnb?

1456
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:10,420
Yeah. So we're getting attacked by both ghosts, demons and cops.

1457
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:12,420
Yeah, all three.

1458
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:16,100
You can talk about the ghosts and the demons part and I'll talk about the cops if you want.

1459
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:22,640
Okay, so there's like a sewer grate in the basement. Speak into the microphone.

1460
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,860
That just makes noise, like bubbling noises. Okay. Like demonic, just like

1461
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:27,860
bloop.

1462
01:04:27,860 --> 01:04:34,940
That's demonic? That doesn't strike me as demonic. No, I'm very well versed in

1463
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:37,620
the demonic and that's not demonic at all. That's hardly demonic. Just the

1464
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,580
most evil noise, like bloop. You think that's what keeps you up at night,

1465
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:46,280
That's a water level. No, no, no, it's not bad.

1466
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:50,480
That just means the poop sewer is really close to where y'all are staying.

1467
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,480
So, first of all, it's directly beneath a nail salon. I feel like people should know that.

1468
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:57,680
Yeah, it smells like acetone.

1469
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,480
Yeah, it does.

1470
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,480
They're just dumping chemicals into it.

1471
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,480
Yeah, we're smoking fumes 24/7.

1472
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:08,480
Yeah. Then there's like a sewer that runs directly under it.

1473
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,980
It's a two-story Airbnb where one story is completely blocked off on both sides.

1474
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:18,480
So it's completely illegal to stay down there, which is why the cops have been coming.

1475
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,980
Okay, because according to according to the cops, no, according to the guy that runs the Airbnb,

1476
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,480
who's been my best friend and calling me the real estate gang.

1477
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:28,480
Yeah, the real estate.

1478
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,480
Real estate.

1479
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:30,480
PSN name.

1480
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,480
They log in.

1481
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:32,480
Add him on PlayStation.

1482
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,480
His PSN name is the real estate gangsta.

1483
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,480
The real estate gangsta.

1484
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:41,480
He has Overwatch 2 and Mortal Kombat X and I think Destiny 2.

1485
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,480
If you want to play some of those games, you can add them.

1486
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,480
Is it an ER, hard R or a soft A?

1487
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,480
I think it's a gangsta.

1488
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,480
Gangsta.

1489
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,480
Yeah.

1490
01:05:51,480 --> 01:05:52,480
Alright.

1491
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:53,480
So you keep showing Rex.

1492
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:57,480
There was, there's a, the people who were in there before us had a party,

1493
01:05:57,480 --> 01:05:59,480
which is why there's a sign on the door that says,

1494
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,480
"No more than seven people. Parties not allowed. $1,000 fine."

1495
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:08,480
I have to be that close to the mic.

1496
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,480
You can angle it.

1497
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,480
I need to kiss it.

1498
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:20,480
Put your hand on it. Make love to the mic.

1499
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,480
Put two hands on it.

1500
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,480
Bro, he's going to phone you.

1501
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,480
I can't finish this by the way.

1502
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,480
good conscience. You don't need a good conscience. You need to finish it.

1503
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:41,320
Come on, big swig. You're a big man. Come on. I'm drinking you under the table and you

1504
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:45,320
weigh twice as much as me. Come on, man. You are an alcoholic and you work at a bar.

1505
01:06:45,320 --> 01:06:50,320
That is not even true at all. Also smells like shit. Not even true.

1506
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:56,620
There was a party there and someone who lived above the apartment called 311 and complained.

1507
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:02,200
And that's what's happening. They're persecuting the real estate gangsta for being so dope

1508
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:10,000
and so fly. This is, of course, according to him. Yeah. So the second day we're

1509
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
there, which is Tuesday, cops show up and they're like, "Julio..." First of all,

1510
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:17,840
Julio's not American, so he doesn't understand the law, which is that, like,

1511
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:22,320
cops are like vampires. You have to invite them inside. They can't just come

1512
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:28,680
in. And somehow, whenever the cops come, only Julio is ready to answer the door.

1513
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:31,340
right twice. Yeah, they love me. I got coppers

1514
01:07:31,340 --> 01:07:40,480
copper is yeah, so the cops come ten thirty in the morning on Tuesday.

1515
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,880
Julio, of course, invites them in yeah, big asking for sugar. Yeah,

1516
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:47,840
I'll come in their family,

1517
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:52,720
but I'm a stall. I'm a vision. They're like okay, let me take some pictures in

1518
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,480
here. This is a ten thirty in the morning,

1519
01:07:56,020 --> 01:07:58,620
So they take some pictures and I'm like, "What the fuck?

1520
01:07:58,620 --> 01:08:00,400
Why did you let the, you know?"

1521
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,900
In my head I'm thinking, "Why did he let these people inside?"

1522
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:05,100
But outside of your head you're like, "Oh, hello, sir."

1523
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,100
"Hello, sir."

1524
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,100
"Hello."

1525
01:08:07,100 --> 01:08:08,100
"Can I shake your hand?

1526
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:09,100
Good officer.

1527
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,820
It's so nice to have you in my home."

1528
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:15,500
Anyway, they come in and they take pictures of everything.

1529
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,740
They're like checking out the windows in Julio's bedroom.

1530
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,980
They're checking out the door to outside of mine.

1531
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:20,980
They go downstairs.

1532
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:21,980
They're like, "Can we go downstairs?"

1533
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:23,020
And I'm like, "You know, fuck it.

1534
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,600
They're already here.

1535
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,860
Fuck the guy over.

1536
01:08:25,860 --> 01:08:29,540
go downstairs. So they go downstairs, they take pictures and they come back over

1537
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:35,340
and they're like, "All right, we'll be in touch." We go and record on

1538
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:39,980
Tuesday, and we get back, there's a sign on the door, it's a summons for the

1539
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:45,140
building owner. And we're like, "Okay." So I send all the info to the

1540
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:48,620
guy on Airbnb and he calls me and he's like, "Yeah, don't let them in if they come

1541
01:08:48,620 --> 01:08:52,580
again." And I'm like, "First of all, I'm not your friend. You're fucking ripping me

1542
01:08:52,580 --> 01:09:01,860
off room. I'm not going to protect you, you retard. Anyway, so because this is funny,

1543
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:09,180
this is a funny train of events. Because I didn't get to go to Fogo de Chao, I leave

1544
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:14,300
the apartment to go to Kachapisi Mosque. So it's my fucking fault.

1545
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:15,700
Whoa, wait. Kachapisi Mosque.

1546
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:20,900
So I go to Kachapisi Mosque, I go and walk there, and Julio wants some ice cream so I

1547
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:25,300
if I stop and get some ice cream and he it was really yummy. He face times me

1548
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,740
immediately after buying the ice cream. I'm like, why are you outside?

1549
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:33,140
Why are you outside? Tell me right now why you're outside and there's no reason

1550
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:37,500
you should be outside. I was dreaming. Why are you outside? I have a surprise

1551
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:42,700
for you when you get home. I am such a surprise, so I get back and they're like

1552
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:43,340
take a look

1553
01:09:43,340 --> 01:09:47,220
notice. It just says vacate immediately.

1554
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,740
this premises is imminent danger to

1555
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:51,400
human life,

1556
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:52,300
perilous to human life,

1557
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:53,460
perilous to human life.

1558
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:54,700
I just wanted to scare him and he

1559
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,900
got scared and he was like what the

1560
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,900
fuck and I mean it's home go for his

1561
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:58,980
runs. I don't want I don't want him to

1562
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:00,220
come to real estate gangster right now.

1563
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:01,620
Don't tell him he's being flying.

1564
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:03,220
Yeah, he's probably fucking a bitch

1565
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:05,140
fine fucking a bit hose. Yeah,

1566
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:06,900
so I'm like no, it's just it's just a

1567
01:10:06,900 --> 01:10:09,700
joke. It's not that big of a deal. So

1568
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:12,540
on my P of V, I'm in the basement

1569
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,220
rex leaves with the keys. I hear him

1570
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,100
take the keys. He didn't tell me that

1571
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:16,220
you got the keys. I hear him take the

1572
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:22,680
he's at the jingling. He leaves. I'm playing Zelda. I'm streaming it with Cam. We're having

1573
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,800
a fun time. We can't hear the game, which is really annoying. And I hear the doorbell,

1574
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,360
the door ring. I was like, "Oh, that's probably, that's maybe Rex, but I don't know why he

1575
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:37,200
would ring it because I hear him take the keys." And me and Cam were joking, like, "What

1576
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:42,560
if it's the cops? Dude, what if it's the cops?" And I just walk up, so like, "Oh, maybe it's

1577
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:49,000
the cops and I opened the door and sure enough, small white guy with a badge. I'm like, ah,

1578
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,000
fuck.

1579
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,080
Yeah. I do think it's funny. Y'all keep saying it's the cops. These are firefighters. These

1580
01:10:55,080 --> 01:11:00,480
are firefighters and you guys are like, they're the cops. Oh no.

1581
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:05,240
Any theory conspiracies in here? The two times the cops showed up, the fire cops showed up

1582
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:11,400
to our house, the tag along the Robin was an Asian guy, which is really weird to me. I'm

1583
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,280
looking at it's really weird to do.

1584
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:19,040
Yeah, the fire marshals are almost homeless people when you see them. I've

1585
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,680
seen them. They have so much shit on their body. They have weird beads

1586
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,960
hanging from them.

1587
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,320
They look weird as fuck. They're just like Boy Scouts.

1588
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,800
Yeah, they look like Boy Scouts with like, I don't know, like fucking weird

1589
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,640
I don't know how to describe it.

1590
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,600
The second pair of cops that showed up, the lead, the white guy, the white guy, he

1591
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,440
he spoke like a mouse and was small as a mouse.

1592
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:41,280
- Yeah.

1593
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:42,900
- It was really funny.

1594
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,440
- They're so weird.

1595
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,280
- It was making me laugh.

1596
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,100
So I'm like, "Yo, what's up?"

1597
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:46,940
- They're so weird.

1598
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:47,760
- "Yo, what's up?"

1599
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:49,180
He's like, "Yeah, I just need to put the stickers up

1600
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,900
"in here and downstairs."

1601
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:55,120
I'm like, "Okay, come on in, my friend, my cop friend."

1602
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:58,580
And I let him in and I'm like, "Oh, fuck, I'm streaming."

1603
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,520
And the way I'm streaming is like so fucked up.

1604
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:03,320
This is the one thing where I had to start the stream off.

1605
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:09,860
I had to like show my OBS like on the on the on the big TV to like see the game

1606
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:13,060
because all the fucked up shit the MacBook is terrible.

1607
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:17,560
So you could see like the stream you can see on my funny little like overlays

1608
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:19,060
you can see if someone subscribe you'll be like,

1609
01:12:19,060 --> 01:12:21,660
what's this talking now?

1610
01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:27,260
Simpson gamer, Simpson gamer and like a funny video and you can see my webcam

1611
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,560
on it and I was like, I don't want to cops to walk through me like yo, what

1612
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:31,460
the fuck is going on here?

1613
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:34,260
Because it would be funny but I would have been on

1614
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:39,460
live stream fails. So I just I just thought it was way funnier if I just

1615
01:12:39,460 --> 01:12:43,060
went downstairs and I said to camp is the cops and then I go I get really close to

1616
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:46,960
the camera you got swatted I go if it's the cops and I close it I end the

1617
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,460
scenario it was really dramatic and really funny to me and they sure they

1618
01:12:50,460 --> 01:12:55,460
don't if they come downstairs like yeah this is fucked up basically you cannot

1619
01:12:55,460 --> 01:13:02,060
cook you cannot bathe or sleep downstairs and that's it Wow and if we

1620
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:05,060
"If you catch yourself sleeping downstairs, we're going to arrest you."

1621
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:07,740
I was like, "Oh, okay, that's beast."

1622
01:13:07,740 --> 01:13:08,900
I was like, "But can I stay here?"

1623
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:09,860
They were like, "Yeah, you can hang out here."

1624
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:11,900
[laughter]

1625
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:12,940
I was like, "Oh, okay."

1626
01:13:12,940 --> 01:13:14,340
-Just don't know. -Yeah, I was like,

1627
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:16,220
"Can I just finish my stay and sleep upstairs?"

1628
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:17,340
They were like, "Yeah, that's fine."

1629
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:19,500
"Just complain to Airbnb and they'll give you a refund."

1630
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:21,580
I was like, "Oh, okay, my friend."

1631
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,100
-You love them. -Yeah.

1632
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,980
And then the second, the Asian guy, the Robin,

1633
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:29,380
he looked at a clearly fake decoration, like, paved in front of the wall.

1634
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:31,020
He was like, "Oh, shit, this thing work?"

1635
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,500
They're like, "No." I'm like, "Oh, okay." They just leave.

1636
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:41,140
And they found the no parties fine thing really funny. And I was like,

1637
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:45,700
"Yeah, and the guy who wants this is a DJ. What's the deal?" And they're like,

1638
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:48,960
"That's funny, my friend." He's got cop riz. You do have cop riz. I've got

1639
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,300
riz. He's got cop riz. He would be perfect on a ride along. I do think

1640
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:58,600
cop riz is equivalent to L riz, though. It's basically L riz. No, it's L riz.

1641
01:13:58,620 --> 01:14:00,960
W is in exactly one situation.

1642
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,260
We have the hottest cops in the world.

1643
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:04,860
Y'all support cops?

1644
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:05,860
Couldn't be me.

1645
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:07,580
When you're a foreigner, you have to have cop wrist.

1646
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:08,380
That's true.

1647
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,220
That is true.

1648
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,300
As a white man, I can have like, I don't talk to police.

1649
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:14,060
Thank you.

1650
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,820
I'm like this.

1651
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,660
I can't do anything.

1652
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:17,980
You want to get handcuffed instantly.

1653
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:18,620
No, that's not true.

1654
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:19,820
I actually like handcuffs.

1655
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:21,260
I've always wanted to be handcuffed.

1656
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:23,100
You should say that to them.

1657
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,460
Actually, can I have you guys--

1658
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,660
Can you guys handcuff me as a joke?

1659
01:14:26,660 --> 01:14:28,140
It is funny y'all saying this.

1660
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:31,940
Like when I pull up at your Airbnb now with the summons,

1661
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:36,820
I'm like standing there waiting for y'all to open the door for me.

1662
01:14:36,820 --> 01:14:41,340
There's nothing for me to do but read the summons. And it's like,

1663
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:43,820
if you enter, you will be arrested.

1664
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:52,220
Yeah. Can I go in? Or is there like a stakeout? Are they going to arrest me?

1665
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:53,300
Like what the fuck?

1666
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,420
Our plan is to get Airbnb to give us our money back,

1667
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,980
but we're not just we're gonna complete stay there and yeah we're gonna stay

1676
01:15:45,260 --> 01:15:51,020
horror so in Julio's room is the light just flickers and it's funny because

1677
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:53,740
Because last time we were here, we sent Annie to that room.

1678
01:15:53,740 --> 01:15:56,620
And she was like, "Yeah, I'm getting psychic damage here

1679
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,500
because this light keeps flickering,

1680
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,820
and I'm getting really hot in this room,

1681
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:00,980
and it's horrible in here."

1682
01:16:00,980 --> 01:16:01,820
- Oh yeah.

1683
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:02,900
- And we're like, "Oh yeah, whatever."

1684
01:16:02,900 --> 01:16:04,260
And then we come two years later,

1685
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:05,740
and the light's still flickering,

1686
01:16:05,740 --> 01:16:08,460
and the Airbnb is currently in disrepair,

1687
01:16:08,460 --> 01:16:09,420
has not been looked at,

1688
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,500
and shit's coming off the walls.

1689
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:12,980
And the real estate guy says,

1690
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:13,820
"Yeah man, it's completely fine."

1691
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:16,980
- He's chilling in fucking, he's in Turks and Caicos.

1692
01:16:16,980 --> 01:16:18,300
- He's got a New Jersey number.

1693
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,140
- Oh my God.

1694
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:19,960
- Damn.

1695
01:16:19,960 --> 01:16:20,800
- That's evil.

1696
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:23,200
Oh, Julio's been talking about like demons.

1697
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,840
So last night, I couldn't sleep.

1698
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,240
It was so hot in the room,

1699
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,840
I had to like strip down to my underwear.

1700
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:31,840
And even then I was still like sweating.

1701
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:35,560
And I'm from Arizona,

1702
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,580
it takes a lot to like make me sweat like that.

1703
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:40,800
I like couldn't breathe.

1704
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,000
I was like having like trouble breathing.

1705
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,640
I was sweating.

1706
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:46,800
- Asthmatic.

1707
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:47,640
- Yeah.

1708
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:54,400
There was just like noise all the time, just like constantly scratching,

1709
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,160
scratching, scratching.

1710
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:59,440
That's a demonic noise. You open it with bloop.

1711
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,920
I hate the scratching. The scratching is fucking my head so much.

1712
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:05,800
He doesn't want to admit it, but there's rats in the walls.

1713
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:06,520
I think it's a dog.

1714
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:08,240
No, it's not a dog.

1715
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:10,400
That's the most Mexican shit I've ever heard in my life.

1716
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,480
It sounds like a small dog.

1717
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:12,880
No, it's fucking rats.

1718
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:15,240
You guys have dogs in your walls in Mexico.

1719
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,520
We have dogs on our ceilings most days.

1720
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,280
Most days.

1721
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:25,080
Okay, let's finish. Yeah, I can't finish it. We're going to end up the podcast.

1722
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:27,680
Thank you for joining us. You have to finish it. Oh, wait, I just finished it.

1723
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:30,580
I just... Wait, let me see how much is left. Hold on. Give me this. No, no, no.

1724
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:37,480
Give me this. Come on. Oh my God, that's a full beer. Holy shit. So bad, dude.

1725
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:41,380
