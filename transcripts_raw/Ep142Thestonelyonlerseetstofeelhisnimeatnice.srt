00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,280
Podcasts for the hopeless.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:11,760
You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,080
Now I remember.

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,080
Now I remember how to record an episode.

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,000
No you don't.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,920
The next hour will prove you don't remember a single fucking thing about it, pal.

00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,880
I ate a whole ass brownie and I left the gas on.

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,640
I'm high on ketosis right now.

22
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,880
I don't need any fucking weed.

23
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880

24
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Is that what you said?

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,160
No, I'm high on a lack of carbohydrates.

00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,120

27
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,120
I'm high on K2.

28
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,920
I smoked kush two times.

29
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,600
Ooh, I smoked two joints in the morning.

30
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,760
Alright, that was actually, that's pretty good actually.

31
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,760

00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Are you guys seriously showing up for work high right now?

33
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:32,880
I'm getting dug with high right now.

34
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,760
I smoked a bong that was a thousand feet tall.

35
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,600
My dad has never smoked weed in his life and he's a huge getting dug with high fan.

36
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
He just sits there and laughs his ass off it.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,960
How does he even understand what they're talking about?

38
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,240
I know dude, they're so fucked up.

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,960
I will tell you though, I will tell you though, stay up late past midnight, you're going to

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,960
understand a little bit about the stoner's mind.

41
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,960
True.

42
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,120
Just from sleep deprivation will drive you a little giggly.

43
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,120
Yeah.

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:59,120
That's true.

45
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,120
If you know, yeah.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,120
A little slap happy.

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
You would light up after that.

48
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Dude, that's it.

49
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Oh my God.

00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Dude, you're going to be sitting there.

And you're going to be going, "Ooooh."

83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,880
poisoning on the podcast before, but have you guys ever?

84
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,720
Nicotine poisoning?

85
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,600
I never got nicotine poisoning.

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,000
I definitely thought I almost threw up sometimes.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,160
How dare you talk bad about the holy nicotine flower?

88
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,140
I've thrown up from smoking too many cigarettes so many times.

89
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,920
From the Blessed Tobacco Plant?

90
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Yeah.

91
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,920
Really?

92
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,920
Uh huh.

93
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
I don't believe it, dude.

94
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,360
You're a propaganda artist.

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,360
It happened.

96
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,360
Nope.

97
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,920
- Definitely, I don't think it's like,

98
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,420
I bet you believe those paintings

99
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,800
on front of the cigarettes too.

100
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,640
- I'm gonna tell you--

101
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,600
- Ever heard of CGI?

102
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,960
It's how they remove all the guy's teeth.

103
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,760
- I don't know if it's like poisoning that I got,

104
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,980
but it's definitely like--

105
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,120
- Did you turn green?

106
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,200
- Yeah, I turned green.

107
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,320
- I wanna let you guys in on a little nicotine secret, okay?

108
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Everybody knows it doesn't get you high like weed, right?

109
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,720
But that's because you're lighting the cigarette on fire.

110
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,600
You get it cold, gets you high.

111
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,040
Nicotine overdose?

112
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,640
- Do you know nicotine is one molecule--

113
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,480
- I'm on WebMD, I'm looking at nicotine poisoning.

114
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,280
- One molecule off of gold?

115
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
- Did you know a cigarette-- - On a molecular level?

116
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,560
- You know they invented a cigarette

117
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,920
that was one molecule wide?

118
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,340
- Whoa. - So you can't see it

119
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,880
and you can hide it from your teachers?

120
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,760
- That's actually fucking genius, dude.

121
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,200
- Yeah.

122
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,060
- Son, what are all these damn molecules

123
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,760
in this shoe box under your bed?

124
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,400
(laughing)

125
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,520
Hey, you tell me, genius, huh?

126
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,400
Go ahead and try, fuckin' asshole.

127
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,000
That is, dude, it's actually low-key genius.

128
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,120
Instead of storing your weed under your bed,

129
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,080
you just store the crafting ingredients

130
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
you need to craft weed.

131
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,400
True, dirt, seeds, hydroponic structures.

132
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,760
It's so easy.

133
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,720
And magic.

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,640
And alchemical table.

135
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,320
What's the thing in Minecraft that you can put

136
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,160
on the seeds and make it grow?

137
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,840
Can we not talk about Minecraft on the weed holiday?

138
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,920
Can we keep these two things fuckin' separate?

139
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:15,080
I don't want to think about drugs and my favorite game on the same day.

140
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,120
There's a weed mod for Minecraft, did you know that?

141
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,560
I don't even want to know what it's called.

142
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,560
But it's probably called...

143
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,560
It's called weed mod?

144
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
My weed.

145
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Mine weed.

146
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
No.

147
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,680
It's called dick weed and it's named after you.

148
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,880
Adolf Spliffler's birthday today.

149
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880

Sheesh.

152
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:34,880
Adoink Spliffler.

That guy was in a different dimension though.

158
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,840
So I want you guys to watch it.

159
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,880
Yeah, you don't think weed's addictive?

160
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:08,880
That's what people say.

161
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,200
It's not addictive, right?

162
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Mm-hmm.

163
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,360
Yeah, I'm still on the nicotine poisoning web page.

164
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I bet you are.

165
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,480
Symptoms typically last an hour or two after a mild overdose.

166
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,560
So it's technically like an overdose on nicotine.

167
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,120
Dude, it's not 4th of July, which is the 4/20 for nicotine.

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
I'm fuckin 420.

169
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,120
Alright?

170
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
Yeah, I don't want to hear about nicotine anymore.

171
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,120
Chill.

172
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
That's really good.

173
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,120
Okay?

174
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,120
We're talking about-

175
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
That's really good.

176
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,120
You can fuckin do this on our Bastille Day episode.

177
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
Yeah, come on dude.

178
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,920
We're talking about weed.

179
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
That's true.

180
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,120
Yeah, I think that 420 for cigarettes is a lot better for Bastille Day because it's French.

181
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
Yeah.

182
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,120
Well anyway, you guys love smoking cigs.

183
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm not French.

184
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,600
Yeah, you are.

185
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,920
I'm white.

186
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,920
And I smoke cigs on Fourth of July.

187
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,280
Isn't it weird to you guys that French dressing is orange?

188
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,560
It's not about weed.

189
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I don't care.

190
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,560
Can you just talk about weed?

191
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,560
I'm sorry, I'm having ideas.

192
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,560
I'm having ideas right now.

193
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,560
No you're fucking not, dude.

194
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,560
This is what you should be talking about.

195
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,560
I'm so stoned.

196
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
Listen to me.

197
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
I'm so high.

198
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,560
This is what you should be saying, okay?

199
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Remember that?

200
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,920
Oh, you can't overdose on weed?

201
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,120
My cousin overdosed on weed.

202
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,600
He smoked a joint too long, he burned his damn fingers.

203
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Okay, that's the kind of thing you should be saying.

204
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
My cousin got addicted to weed.

205
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,080
Don't talk about some French dressing shit.

206
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,000
He got stuck in a traveling sex circus, sucking his own dick, trying to pay for a gram of

207
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,600
a strain called Snoop Dogg's ass.

208
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,960
Right?

209
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
That's what happened to him.

210
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,960
Yeah.

211
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Yeah.

212
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Yep.

213
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
And then he fucking came in his own mouth, got himself pregnant.

214
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
Do you think that's funny?

215
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,960
A little bit.

216
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,880
You think, oh, that's fucking funny.

217
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,520
My cousin got himself pregnant by coming in his mouth and had an ass child.

218
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,720
You think that's really funny?

219
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
And guess what?

220
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,720
Godfather I shouldn't be making fun. Yeah

221
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,240
Yeah, the bod between godfathers and

222
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,360
God between a god son. That's not what I said bond. I said bond

223
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:18,280
Why are you so interested in Caleb's godson's no no

224
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,200
- Okay.

225
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,860
- Nothing high about that.

226
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:24,700
- Yo, anyway.

227
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,520
- That's low.

228
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:26,360
- Even for you.

229
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,000
- Imagine a damn circus where everyone's smoking weed.

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,560
The animals wouldn't even jump through the hoops.

231
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,500
They'd just be laying there like,

232
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,260
damn man, I want some snacks.

233
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:38,200
- Man, do you imagine at the zoo or the circus?

234
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,840
- Yeah, here we have a gorilla playing Xbox.

235
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,880
- You're at the circus and the animals get high

236
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,820
and then they accidentally find a box of animal crackers.

237
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,660
- Oh no.

238
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,480
- Oh my God, dude.

239
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,720
- Imagine the crisis they would have.

240
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,720
- That's like when I watch Modern Family

241
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,560
I'm like damn dude I'm also part of a modern family.

242
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,560
Damn, damn this kid looks like my dad.

243
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,960
I'm like damn, I'm like damn these two dads they look like tigers.

244
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,280
You ever get high and go to the aquarium?

245
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
No.

246
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,000
Back when I was a fucking drug addict I did.

247
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Yeah?

248
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What'd you see?

249
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,800
See I saw everything dude.

250
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,720
I looked at the jellyfish and right as the edible kicked in and I turned to Janet and

251
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,360
said we have to leave right now. We cannot be here. And then I don't know if I

252
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,360
talked about this, I was like I left, it was the first time I had eaten an edible in

253
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,900
like years and I left the aquarium and there was like they had like

254
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:39,240
animatronic dinosaurs set up in the exit that like screamed at you. One of the worst days

255
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,020
of my entire life dude. I'm not kidding. I've been there. That was like my childhood

256
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,940
like aquarium like I went to it all the time I go there one time high and

257
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:54,020
there's a traveling exhibition where as you leave the place you finally get out

258
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:59,180
of the fucking dark evil jellyfish room yeah velociraptor jumps at you and

259
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:06,300
screams damn you know how to keep a stoner out of your house dude you

260
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:11,580
put a mirror on the door he'll get confused and scared and run away yeah he's

261
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,180
He's gonna do his fighter fuck response on the mirror.

262
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Exactly.

263
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,460
You put a two-way mirror, and you start screaming.

264
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,460
Two-way mirror?

265
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,460
Uh-huh.

266
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,460
Mirrors are always two-ways.

267
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,460
Yeah, front, yeah.

268
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,460
Yeah, up and down.

269
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,460
Front and back.

270
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:28,300
It's so fucked up that that can be called a two-way mirror or a one-way mirror, and

271
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
it means the same thing, right?

272
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Yeah, I never- That's a high thought that I had before.

273
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
There has to be a correct one, right?

274
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,540
God, can you imagine a three-way mirror?

275
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
Yo.

276
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,140
I can't stop imagining a three-way mirror.

277
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,140
Ooh!

278
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,140
Oh my God.

279
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,140
Yep, me, you, and your brother.

280
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,140
Yeah, me, me, and another me.

281
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,140
And we're all doing funny things in the mirror.

282
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
Yep.

283
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,140
Oh my god.

284
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,140
Yeah, I haven't smoked weed in a very long time.

285
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,140
Me neither.

286
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
Not since I threw up on my bed.

287
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Yeah, I have.

288
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,140
I smoke weed pretty much every night.

289
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
I don't.

290
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Oh, that's why you're like that, huh?

291
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,140
Dude, I'm high as hell all the time.

292
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,140
I hate you, you fucking druggie.

293
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,140
My brain basically looks like a bong at this point.

294
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,260
- Are you having a very smoky 4/20 today, Cameron?

295
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,380
- Oh, absolutely, dude.

296
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,220
I walked around.

297
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,500
- Dude, smoke weed on camera!

298
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,340
Bro!

299
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,700
- If you're such a fucking pothead,

300
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,180
how about smoke weed on camera?

301
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,140
- No, no.

302
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,780
- Yeah, come on!

303
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,700
It'll be the first.

304
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,860
It'll be the first time anyone's done that.

305
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,420
- Getting Cameron--

306
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,620
- Getting high, uh-huh.

307
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,140
- No.

308
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,700
- Getting Cameron-- - No, I'll start crying.

309
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,900
- Getting-- - Don't make me do it.

310
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,060
- It's funny that all three of us have just--

311
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:39,180
- Oh, we can't smoke weed.

312
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,340
- I just can't do it, dude.

313
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,580
- I just like, something that was

314
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,620
something I'd rather we think of.

315
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,660
- 13 year olds will smoke weed and then win a million dollars

316
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,820
in a Fortnite tournament.

317
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,660
- Oh yeah.

318
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,900
- And we are three grown men who can't smoke weed

319
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,380
unless it is twilight.

320
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,380
- It's fucking evil.

321
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,300
I can't smoke, I only smoke weed at night

322
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,960
because it gives me the worst psychosis of my life.

323
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,460
And I think that the matrix is real, but it's red.

324
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,740
(laughing)

325
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,300
- It's red, red numbers.

326
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,140
That's terrifying, dude.

327
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,660
- Yeah, oh my God. - It's so scary.

328
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,180
- Evil matrix.

329
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,340
- It's so fucked up. - Evil matrix?

330
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,340
I can't even imagine.

331
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,300
I would try to do it every night because otherwise I'll lie awake and think, "Damn, what if the

332
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,420
Matrix was red?"

333
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,460
And it won't scare me, but it will intrigue me.

334
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:20,420
It's crazy how many times I smoked.

335
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,700
I used to take Adderall for my ADHD and I would just smoke weed and just have the worst time

336
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,700
of my life.

337
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:30,780
I was like, "I just don't understand why I can't smoke weed."

338
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,780
Dude, when I was on Adderall, that was the only time I could smoke weed.

339
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:36,660
Once I stopped taking Adderall, we're opposite.

340
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:37,940
I can't smoke weed ever.

341
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
I don't think, I think there's something in my brain.

342
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,940
I've tried taking Adderall and then smoking weed and then I'm just normal again.

343
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:45,620
It's like one of the most disappointing things.

344
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,300
Yeah, I can't, I can't smoke weed for shit.

345
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,500
I suck at it.

346
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,060
Yeah, well that's because you're not using the right formulas.

347
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:58,660
I think I could smoke CBD and get like high from it.

348
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,500
Yeah, yeah, no that's a, I think plenty of people smoke CBD and think they're high.

349
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,500
Yeah.

350
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,760
I was really hoping that that would like work for me just because I'm like such a

351
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,480
Like a lightweight when it comes to any drugs like that

352
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,880
I could just take CBD and like it would put me to sleep or fuck me up or something

353
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,540
I wouldn't like spend money on weed and shit, but it just didn't do anything

354
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:23,300
And so it's like damn people are so the people who think this stuff works are such a loser

355
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
Yeah, I can't believe all these kids cancer lying, dude

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,000
You look sick. I miss cigarettes so much dude. I miss like dude

362
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,920

363
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,000
Yeah, and just like when I first moved in New York

364
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,620
I keep leaving the classroom and I come back just reeking of cigarettes just like yep. Yep

365
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,960
Yeah, that was that sorry. I just took a really insane smelling shit and it just yeah fucking cover

00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:25,240
Oh, yeah the body I fell in a toilet and I had to clean it off

367
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:31,640
I don't miss having like a yellow finger. You got a yellow finger? I smoked so much that my finger changed color.

368
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:38,300
That I can do it. You get the stains, right? Yeah, the stained finger. That's why I wear motorcycle gloves. It also adds to how cool I look.

369
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,300
That's what, uh... I wear oven mitts, dude, when I'm smoking weed so I don't get green all over my hands.

370
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:48,620
Step outside the bar, put on my fucking, my oven mitts and my apron, just to not arouse suspicion from the cops.

371
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,780
That's what the guy who played Grand Moff Tarkin would do. He would, on set, he would wear gloves.

372
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:55,780
That's also what the guy who played Grand Theft Auto would do, that's me.

373
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,780
Uh-huh.

374
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,780
Smoking cigarettes in a basement, playing GTA 3.

375
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,780
Oh my god, dude. How cool can you get?

376
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,780
Oh my god, the best thing ever.

377
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:07,780
The best fucking thing ever, smoking cigarettes and playing Grand Theft Auto,

378
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,780
pretending I'm smoking in a car.

379
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,780
Yep.

380
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,780
Getting used to smoking, like, shitty cheap cigarettes,

381
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,780
and then somebody hands you two Marlboro Reds,

382
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,780
and then you're on your roof trying to kill yourself.

383
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,780
Yeah, and you're throwing up, 'cause, like, it's too strong.

384
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:25,900
You're like what the f-- that is not a tobacco in that.

385
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:33,100
I don't know if it's local to New Hampshire or if it's like Circle K's like brand of like

386
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,220
cheap cigarettes but there's a cigarette company called Traffic Cigarettes which is one of

387
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,220
the most disgusting cigarette names I've ever heard.

388
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,340
Traffic?

389
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,300
I smoked one pack of Marlboro Reds and I was honestly convinced there was like mayonnaise

390
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,300
in them.

391
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300

It was honestly it was heartbreaking dude.

421
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,260
It was like seeing somebody burn a pile of money in front of me.

422
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,500
That's what it fucking felt like.

423
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,380
I was like, "Who am I?

424
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,340

480
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:54,420
Need to get you a job as an ice cream tester

481
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,620
That'll be my next move.

482
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,620
Yeah.

483
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Yeah.

484
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:05,300
I'm gonna start setting you up on dates with scientists who are trying to create the biggest

485
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,380
fattest man in the world.

486
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,680
Those aren't scientists, those are just like feeders and gainers.

487
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,680
They're called heroes.

488
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,060
It would be so sick if there was like a job like that, like an ice cream tester job where

489
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,500
like it pays really well and you get to eat ice cream all day and everyone's like, "Well,

490
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
what's the downside?"

491
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,100
It's like, "Oh, by the end of the year working there, you're gonna be insanely fat."

492
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,040
Can you imagine like if your job was was

493
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:33,380
Ice cream taste you spend all day tasting ice cream you get home and your wife or husband asked for oral sex

494
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:36,020
Can you imagine how disgusting that must be?

495
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,540
You've been tasting fucking pecan

496
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,300
cream

497
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,620
Yeah

498
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:48,060
Rainbow sherbert all day was amazing flavors, and they're just tasting a fucking salty like butthole. Yeah

499
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:55,260
That's gotta be an awful life just ruin everything for you fuck. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you'd never

500
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,020
Yeah, the ice cream tester

501
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,660
Unless they come with pussy flavored ice

502
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:07,760
The ice cream tester factory actually just shut down after a disgruntled employee got brain freeze and shut the place up

503
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:15,780
Yeah, they cut his brain open afterwards and to prove, you know, we always suspected that there was long-term effects of brain freeze

504
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,180
But then Will Smith cut him open and saw that he had

505
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:28,600
Sure signs of brain freeze. An ice cube stuck in the cerebellum. Yeah, there's an ice cube in his hippocampus

506
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,820
It actually led to him being extremely violent. Mm-hmm

507
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:40,020
That's why you freaking smoke weed instead of eating ice cream. Yep, no negative effects

508
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,860
But when you smoke weed you want to eat some ice cream

509
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:49,940
Not me dude. Hey, dude. Yeah. No, I go for pretzels and chips, baby. When I see your salt terrifies me is that I

510
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:56,660
Know I don't think I've eaten something after smoking weed in years. It's the only way I can get myself to eat anything

511
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,580
I smoked I when I smoked weed I

512
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,340
ate pretzel or peanut M&Ms and

513
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:06,720
Those are like those are the perfect high food

514
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,620
I I ate too many of them and I thought I could taste the chemicals in the like the dye

515
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,240
Like I was sitting there, and I was like yeah, these are starting to taste like paint

516
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,360
Closing your eyes and being able to tell what color they are

517
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,820
And then spitting into your hand and being like yep, it's brown

518
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:31,980
It's crazy how stale the peanuts are in peanut M&Ms

519
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:41,460
No, they're not stay delicious. They're delicious. Oh, no. They're so good because I mean they're covered in like they're perfectly preserved by chocolate

520
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,140
What are you fucking talking about?

521
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,340
They just grow like that.

522
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,100
They grow them and they put a seed into the middle of the M&M and a single peanut grows.

523
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,100
Yeah, it grows out.

524
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Yeah.

525
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:57,140
Dude, they only recently started removing the shells from the peanut M&Ms.

526
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,460
They used to have shells inside.

527
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
Yeah.

528
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,460
It used to be.

529
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
How about this?

530
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:02,460
Candy, chocolate, shell, nut.

531
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,700
How about a pistachio M&M?

532
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
That would never work.

533
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,660
You bite into it, fucking, you eat all the chocolate layer, you let the chocolate melt

534
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,020
in your mouth and then you crack open delicious pistachio.

535
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:17,100
So there should be more foods that you have to eat, take out of your mouth, like manipulate

536
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,740
in some way and then put back in.

537
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:21,740
Why stop there doing meatball M&M?

538
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,220
Yeah, exactly.

539
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,740
Little mini miniature kind of like Ikea style meatball with gravy and then the chocolate.

540
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,620
I want an egg yolk in there, dude.

541
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,860
I want a hard boiled egg yolk in the middle of my M&M.

542
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Oh, that'd be pretty good.

543
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Nice chalky texture.

544
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,860
That'll just make you appreciate the chocolate even more.

545
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,420
The smell that fills the room when you bite into one.

546
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,420
Oh, it's just gorgeous.

547
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Chocolate and eggs.

548
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:43,420
Just an absolutely gorgeous smell.

549
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,980
The ultimate stoner snack.

550
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:50,300
Yeah, dude, protein M&M's with egg yolk inside.

551
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,180
We can get a couple of people on that.

552
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,180
It's a pretty good idea.

553
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,180
Yeah, I believe it.

554
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,060
I'm gonna get my guys on that, my M&M guys.

555
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,580
I know a couple people who work at the M&M factory.

556
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,380
Yeah, which one, M or M?

557
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,860
I know Marshall.

558
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
I don't know Mathers.

559
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Yeah.

560
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:16,100
I know the orange M&M. Yeah. That guy, Jesus Christ. What about him? I mean, you can't

561
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,500
even hang out with him. What's his problem? He has an M&M. You can't even hang out with

562
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,220
him without him freaking the fuck out. What does that mean? Have you met him? No, no,

563
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,180
but I assume you're talking about a real guy right now, so what does it mean he

564
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:32,460
freaks out every time you know him? The orange M&M? What does that mean he freaks out? God,

565
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:38,220
that guy I mean he's he's so nervous he's nervous all the time what does he have

566
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,860
to be nervous about he's a millionaire people can do it oh I just I yeah I just

567
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:48,460
like we're gonna eat I'm on I'm on I'm on chocolate dot fandom calm on the

568
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,020
orange M&M page and I'm reading about him he's actually been through some shit

569
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:58,380
dude yeah yeah listen to this that was originally a crispy M&M and he was

570
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,540
always used to being and he always used to be scared of being eaten because he

571
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:06,120
thought he was the tastiest flavor. Orange doesn't really trust anyone, especially when

572
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,740
Red and Yellow licked him in one of his ads. He's always very scared and worried about what

573
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:11,740
will happen to him.

574
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,980
"He sounds like Drake."

575
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:17,220
"Yeah. He's a lot like Drake in that they hang out in the same circles."

576
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,540
"Yeah, and he's nervous because he knows he's the best, dude."

577
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:24,220
"Yeah. People are plotting on his downfall constantly."

578
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,220
"Eventually, Krispy M&M's were wiped out from the USA and he no longer advertised Krispy

579
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:36,160
I'll look later. However, he met pretzel guy who made things worse for him

580
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:43,060
This guy's I mean, this is horrific punished Eminem. This is a great wiki

and it's only orange M&M and M&M characters are the only two.

588
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
He's the annoying orange.

589
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Oh, because it... whoa!

you guys want to you guys worry about hot chocolate? Yes, hot chocolate is a warm

597
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,220
chocolate drink as implied by the name. It is a common beverage in the US. It is

598
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,820
useful to drink it during the winter season. The reason is because it gives

599
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,920
your body heat. You can also drink it during other seasons, but it is usually

600
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,120
it is mostly usually popular in the winter. Juvia went on a date the other

601
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:01,240

612
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,160

613
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:11,000
brought a lunch chocolate sandwich and he dropped it in the milk. No. And then it

It was a hot day. It was in Arizona. It was in Mumbai.

615
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:26,000

640
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,080
I think yeah, like there's like they have something else right now

641
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,520
Yeah

642
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:46,400
The old ones where it was literally just chocolate and then just like a toy that could easily break apart into tiny plastic pieces

643
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,760
Like if you bite it like just like the worst design of all time. Yeah, I remember wonderful stupid

644
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:59,480
I don't know. The Wonder Ball? No. Is that a kind of ball? It was a ball full of like

645
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,520
I'm wondering where your balls are. It's a chocolate ball full of Smarties. See

646
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,640
that's that's at least two edible things. The Kinder Eggs they put like a

647
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,880
transformer that turns into a razor blade inside of the egg. Exactly dude.

648
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,520
Yeah go ahead go fucking wild dude. Yeah. It's like making a fucking like

649
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:24,600
like Darth Vader helmet that just has a plastic bag inside yeah they should put

650
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,840
like cigarettes they should have to put photos of kids with toy Tonka trucks

651
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,520
stuck in their throat on the front of the kid like a whole surprise egg.

652
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:38,760
yeah exactly that that should if they do that then it should be legal everywhere

653
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,480
mm-hmm everybody should be able to get them this should be free too oh damn

654
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,880

Muppets take Manhattan on that. That's like I feel like the only reason anybody

661
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,440
would ever buy like like plain checks is because they have like a Girls Gone Wild DVD.

662
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,280
Right? Your dad's at the store is like "and we'll take ten boxes of checks."

663
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,640

669
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,680
Okay, so, the admin of the

00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680

only admin on this,

672
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
only editor.

673
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
He has a blog

674
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
that's attached to the chocolate wiki.

675
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
The most recent post

676
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,680
is from September 11th,

677
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,680
2015,

678
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,680
and the title of the blog post is

679
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,680
On this day

680
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,680
I'd like to read it to you

681
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:20,460
Hello there everyone. This is one of the first blog posts not about chocolate today marks the day known as 9/11

682
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:30,280
Today we acknowledge 9/11 a very unfortunate day in history for america

683
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,520
This was the day that the twin towers fell killing

684
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:37,260
277 innocent people who were taken too soon, then there's a lot of statistics and

685
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:44,940
Then the last the last paragraph my personal thoughts are with those who are gone and their families and us at the chocolate wiki

686
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,620
Thank you all for your service

687
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:52,980
Whether you are a paramedic firefighter police officer security guard or a pilot I and chocolate wiki

688
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,900
Thank you for being brave on that day. Oh my god

689
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,780
That's so nice. I

690
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,340
I love the chocolate wiki. There's a comment on that blog post from Fudgy Guy.

691
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:15,380
It just says "thanks first responders." Fudgy Guy. Oh my god. Here's what I'll say. Everything

692
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:23,060
happens for a reason. Yep. What do you mean? I don't know. But if I was a news anchor on September

693
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,420
11, 2001, I probably would have said that live on CNN. Why would you say that? And speaking of

694
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,460
Speaking of these horrible attacks, you know, I just like to quell everyone's fears by saying

695
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,860
everything happens for a reason.

696
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,700
And you need to trust God's plan.

697
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,340
That's literally, that's the only, there's two other blog posts and they're both just

698
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,340
like "Hi everybody, welcome to the wiki."

699
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,340
That's the only, that's the only not a horrible one.

700
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,460
Seems like zero of these are about chocolate.

701
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,460
Yeah.

702
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,460

00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,860
No, no, not the streaming service.

00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,620
Yeah, chocolate form.

And it's very nice.

723
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,980
People say, "Wow, I just found out this wiki exists."

724
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,800
And I have to say, "Wow, I'm literally obsessed with chocolate, so I'm so glad I found this."

725
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,180
Somebody else posted a post titled "Chocolate, not chocolate," where they're holding a piece

726
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,300
of chocolate and there's another picture of them holding a rock.

727
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,300

827
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:58,260
- The file name is giantist-remix.jpg.

828
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:59,300
- I don't like this at all.

829
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,320
I hate when a woman is taller than me.

830
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,300
I was in Walgreens the other day, I pissed off.

831
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,600
I was like, "Come on, how are you 5'6" right now?"

832
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:14,100
Their only contribution, I'm looking at their user page,

833
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,480
their only contribution is to Maltesers.

834
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:20,700
- No, they edited other stuff, I'm looking at it.

835
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,620
They edited hot fudge, oh no wait that's recent wiki activity.

836
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,420
I just took off my pants because I have to pee so bad.

837
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,420
Can I see?

838
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:30,420
What?

839
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,420
Yeah sure.

840
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,420
Lower the camera.

841
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:33,420
Woah!

842
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,420
Okay.

843
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,380
You thought I was faking it?

844
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,380
Yeah.

845
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,140
Come on dude, who do you think I am?

846
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,660
I have to pee so bad, it's like Thanksgiving dinner.

847
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,340
You can go pee dude.

848
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,500
There's still 15 minutes left.

849
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,580
And then can we talk about marijuana again?

850
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,580
Yeah sure.

851
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,080
Okay.

852
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,580
Well, we're talking about the food you eat.

853
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,580
We're talking about candy.

854
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:53,580
Yeah.

855
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:54,580
Three edits.

856
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:58,580
Oh, yeah, they did Maltesers and White Chocolate Maltesers.

857
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:00,580
Yeah, they...

858
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,580
Oh, yeah, the caption on the Maltesers page, it's the same picture, but the caption this time is,

859
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:12,580
"A giantess version of a woman eating Maltesers. A giant woman was eating her giant Maltesers along with giant white ones and giant dark ones."

860
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,580
What the fuck is that?

861
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
It's fucking

862
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:26,540
That's so weak cuz it's just like a picture of somebody's like friend that they photoshopped yeah

863
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:30,700
That's

864
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:38,500
Are these wait are these pictures all on the huh where how can I see what do you look at?

865
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,180
There's a picture of

866
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:46,100
Thanos on this wiki somewhere, but I can't figure out how to see what page it's on

867
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,700
there's a gif of a

868
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:54,580
Some I think it's a final fight character. I don't know yeah, see like what's

Well that makes sense that makes at least on the on here. Yeah, yeah

871
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,340
Dude, this wiki sick. This is the coolest wiki ever found. I'm gonna become a regular contributor. Oh

872
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:11,940
Oh, you should.

873
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,940
I found a thing called Jost-Lewis.

874
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,940
A page called Jost-Lewis.

875
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:21,940
Diet soda fan likes to post pictures of themselves holding the candies.

876
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:25,940
[Laughter]

877
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:28,940
Hershey's Air Delight. Oh, have you ever had that?

878
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,940
Hershey's Air Delight?

879
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,940
No, I don't know what that is.

880
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,940
Yeah, it was like in 2010 they had this candy.

881
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:37,140
- Yeah, it's a discontinued one,

882
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,340
but it's just they put a bunch of air

883
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:42,540
into the chocolate, into the candy bars.

884
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,780
- So is it like, kind of like a crunch bar-ish?

885
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,580
Or like, let's put a bunch of air in you.

886
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,780
- It's just like, it's not crispy at all.

887
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,700
It was just like airy chocolate.

888
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:56,020
Like, it was light like air when chewed on,

889
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:56,860
is what it says.

890
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:59,540
- Hey, you wanna go for a ride on my bicycle, pump?

891
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:00,380
- What?

892
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,060
- You wanna go for a ride on my bicycle, pump?

893
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:03,900
- What are you talking about?

894
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,580
- Do you wanna go on a bike ride?

895
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:10,160
bike pump ride. What are you saying? What the fuck are you saying? Do you want to sit on

896
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:14,260

899
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:27,780

903
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:48,740
you're crazy and fat I'm no I'm not fuck you right all right we have to talk

904
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,100
about weed a little bit here right yeah yeah I mean we did for 20 minutes yeah

905
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:56,660
but I hand-picked these these lists much like a nugget of weed these

906
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:59,940
little is picked by a slave the list that you picked are the ones that I'd

907
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,300
looked at and thought weren't good enough.

908
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,300
So what did you just say?

909
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,300
No, but I'm looking at them right now.

910
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,300
What do you mean?

911
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,300
Hand...

912
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:08,020
What the fuck was that?

913
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,020
There's...

914
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,500
Marijuana is made by slaves.

915
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,180
That's why it's an immoral industry.

916
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,180
You don't know about this?

917
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:15,180
What?

918
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,180
Handpicked by slaves?

919
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,140
Ed, you know, that's fascinating because smoking marijuana is one of the only ways you can

920
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,140
emancipate yourself from mental slavery.

921
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,440
That sounded way worse than how you think it sounded in your head.

922
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:22,700
It sounded bad?

923
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,700
Yeah.

924
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,700
There are...

925
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,700
Slaves make your shoes, man.

926
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,180
You gotta stop saying slaves.

927
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:40,620
What is-- okay. Brave. Happy fellows. Braves. How about now? That's better.

928
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:47,020
They're brave. All right. Obviously you have some slave in your family that you

929
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:52,940
haven't disclosed and you don't want to talk about it but okay we'll move on and

930
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:58,300
we'll talk about weed. Are you happy now? Yeah. Okay. Which one are we doing? We should do

931
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,420
top 10 things marijuana can help you with. Okay. Right. I'm gonna do it fast. All right.

932
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:08,540
What time is it? Oh shit. Oh my god. Fuck dude. Hey, you know how it is when you're

933
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:13,020
high dude. You just fucking time flies when you're time high is when you're flying high.

934
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:16,380
Dude, last night I was smoking weed and lying down in bed. Next thing you know, I was asleep

935
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:22,060
and it was a morning and I was awake. That's like, oh, you're a, you're a damn time traveler.

936
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:26,140
Yeah. It's, it's cool. Smoke. When you smoke weed right before you go to bed, it helps you

937
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,260
time travel to when you wake up in the night and hear an airplane and think that your house

938
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,260
is being bombed and you're about to die.

939
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,260
Yep.

940
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,780
And sometimes you just time travel through the first Avengers movie too.

941
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,780
Yeah.

942
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,020
You just fucking don't remember a single scene.

943
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,020
Yeah.

944
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,020
Yep.

945
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:42,020
Saw it in theaters.

946
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,020
Who knows, man.

947
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,020
Brought a jar of peanut butter with me.

948
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:45,020
I can't.

949
00:50:45,020 --> 00:50:51,260
Time traveling through this bag of pretzels to my destination is constipation.

950
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,260
That's right.

951
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:55,500
It's a little rhyme I just came up with.

952
00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:01,340
That's a good rhyme. Thanks. You guys can use it too if you want. I might use that.

953
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:08,340
Okay. Yeah. Constipation, slave emancipation. No, I can't bring slaves up again.

954
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:14,580
Pat will get sad. Come on man, you've been talking about them too much. Who's them, huh?

955
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:22,540
Slaves. He said it! He said slaves. Book 'em boys. Yep, now you have to get fat or

956
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,540
or else we'll send that clip to your employers.

957
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,980
- Yeah, Pat, if you hate slaves so much--

958
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,820
- My employers, myself?

959
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:28,020
(laughing)

960
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,820
- No hates, come on.

961
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,660
- I mean, sounds like you kinda do.

962
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,540
- It's not true.

963
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:37,140
(laughing)

964
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:38,500
- Number one, school.

965
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,260
You know, in my experience, this is a lie.

966
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,100
- Yeah.

967
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,940
- Yeah. - Does not help you

968
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,760
with school.

969
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:45,740
- I tried to smoke weed before school once.

970
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:51,320
I got like, the smallest amount of weed I could

971
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,080
for like five bucks from somebody.

972
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:53,920
- Yeah.

973
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,400
- And then I smoked it the night before

974
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,440
and then tried to like smoke like the resin

975
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,660
out of like the, like the bubbler I made

976
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:01,940
out of a two liter soda bottle.

977
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:05,340
And I just went to school like kind of high.

978
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:07,520
- I will say I'm remembering a time

979
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,920
that I actually, I smoked weed in high school

980
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,800
and actually it helped me a lot.

981
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,640
But I did--

982
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:15,200
- It didn't help me at all 'cause I was still on Adderall.

983
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,700
- But I did, this might be important,

984
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:20,120
I did go to Freddie Wong's video game high school.

985
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,360
(laughter)

986
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,600
- That might have been why it helped me so much.

987
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:29,160
But I felt like, I mean it was like, it was like nothing.

988
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,440
- I guess that makes sense.

989
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,280
- Yeah.

990
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,100
- It could have been that.

991
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:32,940
- Dude, when I smoked weed in high school

992
00:52:32,940 --> 00:52:34,640
it helped me so much with Pokemon Go.

993
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,120
- But do people still play Pokemon Go?

994
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:38,960
- People do.

995
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,800
- I'm sure they do.

996
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,640
That's, dude, that's one thing I miss about,

997
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,720
I haven't been taking like public transportation

998
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,880
'cause I don't gotta fucking work anymore, baby.

1002
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:03,220
on the bus who's like playing Pokemon go or writing just be like oh man you that's

1003
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:08,180
the lamest person in the world right now dude I'm thinking 2020 I said I'm gonna

1004
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:15,020
go until like 2018 playing Pokemon go in 2020 on the bus at like 7 a.m. yeah like

00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:19,720
I probably I mean I have I have a few I got a few good a few thousand dollars

00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:37,180
star gym leader some fucking I don't remember easily motivated by gold stars

1009
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:48,400
Yes. Why? Makes sense. No reason. None at all. I did go to Montessori school. Number two, cancer. I mean,

1010
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:55,200
is this really... I mean, it doesn't... This is so fucking good to say. I don't think it helps you. It causes cancer. Are we

1011
00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:03,000
joking? Are we fucking making this up? Cancer? You think weed helps cancer? No, it doesn't.

1012
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
No.

1013
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Are you living in an upside down world?

1014
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,640
Yeah, it's a joke.

1015
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,760
This is a joke entry.

1016
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,840
I'm not even, I don't even want to, you know, I don't want to give this the time of day.

1017
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:12,840
Yeah.

1018
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:13,840
Absolutely.

1019
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:14,840
Insomnia.

1020
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:15,840
True.

1021
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:16,840
Very true.

1022
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,320
Yeah, yeah, because it shuts down your thinking brain.

1023
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,320
Exactly.

1024
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,240
Make you, tell you what, lie down.

1025
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:29,520
You lie down and you start thinking, damn, post offices really be crazy and your brain

1026
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,280
is so embarrassed that it just instantly shuts down and you fall asleep.

1027
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,960
Yeah, sitting there trying to understand a stamp and then you just fucking fall asleep.

1028
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,800
Your brain just shuts down, just fucking breaks.

1029
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,200
Wait, stamps are a kind of money?

1030
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:40,440
What?

1031
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,960
Whoa.

1032
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:42,680
Just fall asleep.

1033
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,200
I had to mail something the other day and I was like, I honestly, I had that thought.

1034
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,160
I was like, what is it?

1035
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,600
This is like a currency that just-

1036
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:50,040
Dude, post offices are nuts.

1037
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,040
They're like wild west shit.

1038
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:52,360
Yeah.

1039
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,800
It's so weird.

1040
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,680
Dude, that post office in Brighton, you been to that one?

1041
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:57,480
No.

1042
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,880
If only there was a fucking one that didn't have to go stand in line at the post office.

1043
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,880
Oh.

1044
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,340
If only there was some kind of fucking...

1045
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,340
Yeah, like stamps.

1046
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:07,340
Like, every single time I need stamps.

1047
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,080
Which is pretty much every day.

1048
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:13,360
I have to walk my ass 50 miles down the street to go to the post office.

1049
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,360
I have to stand in line.

1050
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:15,360
Takes two or three hours.

1051
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,360
God.

1052
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,360
If only there was some kind of...

1053
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,360
Like a website?

1054
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,360
Dot com almost.

1055
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
Yeah.

1056
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,560
And only if there was a coffee that made me shit my pants.

1057
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,560
Uh huh.

1058
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,600
If only there was a guy who could play guitar.

1059
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,400
Yeah, and he has two cats.

1060
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Yeah.

1061
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:35,720
Yeah. He loves those cats. Oh well, guess that guy doesn't exist.

1062
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,600
Mm-hmm. The perfect man. If he does, he's probably gonna die soon.

1063
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:42,280
He's probably gonna kill himself pretty soon.

1064
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:50,280
Number four, anxiety and depression. In my experience, Mike's weed greatly magnifies

1065
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:55,400
these two things. Yeah, no. It gave me depression, dude. I was the most normal guy of all time until

1066
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,320
I started smoking weed. The media's representation of marijuana does not handle the paranoia.

1067
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,520
at all. They're in Snoop Dogg's pocket. Weed fucking turned me from like a like a New Balance

1068
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,920
Pokemon nerd to Travis Bickle straight up.

1069
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:17,320
They won't tell you about that and Bob Marley did. Dude I started smoking weed

1070
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,360
immediately started losing my hair. Decided a mullet was the way to go. I did

1071
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:26,920
I had the same path brother. Dude I was so high I was like you know what fixes balding?

1072
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:36,720
a mullet. I had the same. I had a mullet for like a year. It's so fucking funny. It's so funny that yeah you smoke weed and you're like damn I should start wearing a size bigger of shirts and grow my hair out.

1073
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:41,920
Yeah. That'll be sick dude. Oh my god dude my pants got huge.

1074
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:51,320
Like if you if you introduced weed to an alien civilization that was like completely different from humans they would still start like growing their hair out and wearing like big tie-dye shirts and shit.

1075
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,840
I think weed could be like a chemical weapon.

1076
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,840
Yeah.

1077
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,760
I think it's possible that weed was dropped on us by the USSR, China, some odd years ago,

1078
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,240
just to destroy us.

1079
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:07,240
The weed that they're selling at dispensaries now, you don't think like the CIA is like

1080
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:08,840
meddling with it at all?

1081
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,160
No, they're too busy fucking protecting us from Islamic terrorist attacks.

1082
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,160
You know what, you're right.

1083
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,720
I was thinking about that and then I said it and I was like, man, I sound like a fucking

1084
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,880
fool right now.

1085
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:18,880
That's right, yeah.

1086
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,680
Come on, are you an idiot, dude?

1087
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,560
I guess I am in that moment.

1088
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:27,520
There are CIA agents out there right now taking bullets for you and you're accusing them of

1089
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,240
having anything to do with the drug trade?

1090
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:33,640
Well they're taking bullets from me so I don't...

1091
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:37,040
You need to stop fucking reading that People's History of the United States book.

1092
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,560
Oh man, I fucking...

1093
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:42,600
Stop reading it and re-reading it and re-re-reading it.

1094
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,600
It's not good for you.

1095
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,720
You can get high on Howard Zinn.

1096
00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:49,360
I gotta stop, I mean, Mark Fisher, you gotta get out of my head.

1097
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:50,360
True.

1098
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,400
There you go, he's a ghost of my life. Exactly. That's the damn truth

1099
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,440
number five weight loss no

1100
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,880
Let you know, what are you talking about?

1101
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:07,180
You know, I'm looking this up and there's actually no way to lose weight, yeah, it's actually impossible

1102
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:12,340
There's only way to doctors recommend that you should gain weight. Yeah, it says it. Oh my god

1103
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:14,840
It says under 300 pounds is a horribly underweight

1104
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,560
What yeah, is that oh no? I mean it guys I guess we all got a you know

1105
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:24,720
I'm busy in the next couple weeks, but maybe Pat you get like a head start. We do like a gaming competition

1106
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,440
You know okay, that's how you hit 300 pounds first. It might be a good idea

1107
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:34,900
Here I'm gonna send you five cases of olive oil, and if okay just finish just replace water

1108
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:38,520
There's water in olive oil, so you should be good right yes

1109
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,360
So anytime you would reach for a water bottle or a lemonade maybe drink an olive oil instead

1110
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,280
Can I still, can I just like combine the olive oil and the lemonade?

1111
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,880
It kind of needs to be pure or else you're not going to get the kind of fat content that

1112
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,880
we're looking for.

1113
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,880
What about the sugar in the lemonade?

1114
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:53,880
Wouldn't that help you gain?

1115
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:00,080
So you can add a packet of lemon, like a crystal light to the olive oil.

1116
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,080
Yeah, yeah.

1117
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,280
And it won't float on top of the olive oil?

1118
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,440
No, it mixes right in.

1119
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
Yeah?

1120
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,000
Yeah, it completely dissolves.

1121
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Uh-huh.

1122
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Yeah.

1123
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Okay.

1124
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,160
So that might be a good move for you.

1125
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,160
Number six, headaches.

1126
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,160
Headaches, not true.

1127
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:18,160
Tell you what, you get a headache, find your fucking

1128
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,160
find your child or your wife, or your

1129
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,160
child wife smoking weed, that'll give you a headache.

1130
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,160
Yeah. Whoa.

1131
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,160
Hey now. Yeah, it will.

1132
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,160
Hey now. Number seven, epilepsy.

1133
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,160
Nope.

1134
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,160
No, it does the opposite.

1135
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,160
Diabetes. What are you fucking talking about?

1136
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,160
You fucking

1137
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,160
killing a bag of yogurt

1138
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,160
pretzels after smoking weed, that'll give you

1139
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:46,200
diabetes. Number 9, they got creativity and they got that Bill Hicks quote, the one from

1140
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:52,080
the Tool song. And the thing about that is like the creativity thing is like, weed doesn't

1141
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:56,800
make you creative. They used to think it did because the weed they were smoking back in

1142
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:02,600
the fucking 70s or whatever, it has the same effect as if you sit down and just imagine

1143
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:09,600
something. Like it's just made of dirt. It's just nothing dude. You get high and you're

1144
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:15,080
You get higher off the fluoride in your water than they got off of fucking weed in the 70s exactly

1145
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:19,880
It's crazy how many things were created on 70s weed - yeah, I know

1146
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,080
Do those people were just they were just weird like they were just guys who like to think that yeah

1147
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:32,880
This is like before they did a minimum wage job. Yeah guys were were hailed as geniuses

1148
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:38,560
That's the thing about it though. They would write all these songs that were just euphemisms for weed, and it's just like

1149
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,160
Like about like a wizard or something. Yeah, dude, Chocolate Rain.

1150
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,160
Yeah.

1151
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,160
[Laughter]

1152
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,160
One of the biggest drug addict anthems in the world.

1153
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,160
It's fucking horrific.

1154
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:54,160
No, like Sweet Leaf by Black Sabbath.

1155
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:57,160
Yeah. It even rhymes. Wheat Leaf.

1156
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,160
Oh my god. Yeah.

1157
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:01,160
Bet you never thought about that, dude.

1158
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,160
Wow. Ozzy Osbourne.

1159
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,160
That's a dark person.

1160
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:09,160
He ate a bat. That guy got the munchies so bad he ate a fucking bat.

1161
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,520
Yeah, is this where the damn coronavirus came from?

1162
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,520
Is this guy Ozzy Osbourne?

1163
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,520
Hey now, hey now, come on.

1164
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,000
Yeah, hey, hey, how about you lay off the bats for a couple years, give us some chance to

1165
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,000
recover, Ozzy?

1166
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,600
How about you fucking tell your daughter to shut up too while you're at it?

1167
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:23,600
Yeah, Kelly?

1168
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,680
Fucking stupid bitch.

1169
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,200
Remember that clip of her on The View?

1170
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:32,280
Yeah, and hey, can you tell your brother Norman to take off that green costume and stop throwing

1171
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,280
fireballs everywhere?

1172
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,320
Yeah, that's a very fair point, dude.

1173
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:38,680
Oh my god, I'm so sick of his bro- Ozzy's brother Norman.

1174
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:43,780
So true. I'd be mad too- by the way I'd be mad too if the media started calling me the

01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:44,880
Green Goblin.

1176
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,080

Just call me Iron Man, dude. Call me the Green Iron.

1178
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:57,240
Yeah, Iron Green Man. Green was just the cheapest color of metal.

1179
01:01:57,240 --> 01:02:01,400
Mr. Green! Yeah, why do I- I mean, Green doesn't even have to factor- you don't call Spider-Man

Exactly. Keep going. Yeah, keep going. Yeah, you don't call you don't call the whole
