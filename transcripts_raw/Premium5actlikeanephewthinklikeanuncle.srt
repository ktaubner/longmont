sorry i dropped my jewel

14
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,080
- Do you scream when you drop your jewels?

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,760
- I scream, I'm very easily startled,

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,600
you know that about me.

17
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,760

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,440
- I do scream easily.

19
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,560
There was a long period of time where I would,

20
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,440
I had to like fight to erase this instinct,

21
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,700
but anytime I opened a door at the same time

22
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,600
as somebody else and we would like

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,040
almost run into each other, I would just go, "Ahh!"

24
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,920
And just strangers and they--

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,760
- They hate you for it.

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,640
- I think they didn't, yeah.

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,120
Yeah, and then I got, and then I took an arrow to the knee.

that place and we just like straight up just like walked in and did... I should

69
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,600
probably let them out. We just straight up like walked in and just didn't like

70
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:01,320
check with the front desk or anything and then we were like going around doing

71
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:07,000

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,320
talking about can that one day when you and me walked around downtown Boston

75
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:33,880
looking for a place called the pedophile law child child pornography yeah there's

76
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,440
a there's a listing on Google for on Facebook for the child pornography law

77
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,760
firm somewhere in downtown Boston. Milk Street? Yeah, yeah. And we walked for like 30

78
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,560
minutes just trying so desperately to find it and we like walked in somewhere

79
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,600
and just like looked at the directory and it clearly didn't exist. Yeah, it was really

80
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,840
upsetting. It was such a bummer because that I just wanted to just pick their

81
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,480
brain a little bit. Wanted to take a cool picture with their sign. I just wanted to

82
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,160
find out honestly I just wanted to find out which whose side they were on. The

83
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:14,000
children there you are or the poor yeah they are at odds yeah that was when I

84
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,360
went through a phase of just going on unlike messenger Facebook messenger you

85
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,600
can just send like you can search for a location and like just send people

86
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,320
random locations and this like Google Maps just has a bunch of stuff that

87
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,160
people just put in there yeah like there's a fake Chick-fil-a and shit but

88
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,840

89
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,820

92
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,480
Thousands of years old. Yeah. Just two decrepit like two ancient Mesoamericans.

93
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:03,380
Americans kept alive. Yeah, right. Yeah, bronze man. Yeah, like those like those

94
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,680
monks that are stuck in Buddhas. They're like the statues. The terracotta army in

95
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,340
China. Yeah. What's that? That's an army of stone soldiers that they uncovered

96
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,520
underground. That's extremely scary to me. Yeah. Take it back. You're gonna scream?

97
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,140
No. No, I unlearned that habit. All right. Yeah. What if you opened the door and a

98
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:32,420
on the other side when you scream scary scary scary stuff scary times we're

99
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,800
living in man absolutely absolutely just next thing you know Dracula could be on

100
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,500
TV in the Senate or on TV. They could let Dracula on TV now. That would be scary as hell.

101
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,420
I know man I'd have to turn that off yeah I'd be like I'd shut the TV off immediately. I'd change the channel

102
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,260
immediately what if he's on every channel oh I can't even imagine. Welcome

103
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:58,880
back to the Dracula show. Yeah, oh my, well, yeah, there's a different bloodsucker

104
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:05,220
given the State of the Union. More like the fangs of the Union. The blood of the Union

105
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:09,420
address is what he would call it if he was the president. Yeah. Yeah, President

108
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:31,900
The first female Frankenstein. Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde have two separate seats.

109
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,180
True, and he switches between them based on what time of day it is. Based on how

110
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,980
hungry he is I think it is. Does he drink a potion that turns him into the scary guy or is it a day/night

111
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:47,420
thing. No, it's a metaphor for having a boner. Yeah, that's true. So it's when he sees a hot

112
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:52,100
lady he turns into Mr. Hide. He turns into Mr. Hide and he gets a boner? Yeah. Wow, Mr.

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,940
on the tip of your penis.

Clear sign of a weed smoker too.

- Instead of peeing, it cries.

120
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,320

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,440
like a lily pad. For all you know some other guy just fucked it and he had an STD.

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,720
- Well, I never.

168
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
- I never.

169
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,920
- Well, I never.

170
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,640
- I used to get pimples on the shaft of my penis

171
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:31,040
and I would pop them and it was pretty cool.

172
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,000
- That's disgusting.

173
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
- That's not disgusting.

174
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
- That's just gross.

175
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,960
- It's just a young man exploring his body.

176
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,320
I don't know what's so wrong about that.

177
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,160
You're wrong.

178
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,800
- I've never been a pimple popper.

179
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,640
I don't pop pimples.

180
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,760
- I love it, dude.

181
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,040
I was telling people last night, my friend had a cyst.

182
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,120
I'm sorry, my friend's dad had a cyst.

183
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,720
telling people last night that your friend's dad had a cyst. Yeah, I did, because we were talking

184
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,040
about pimple popping and my friend's dad had a cyst and we would try to, we were trying to convince

185
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,080
him to like put stuff on the cyst that would make it come to a head because he'd had it for like

186
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:10,040
10 years or whatever. Yeah. We were like, yeah man, you know what'll make that cyst go away?

187
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,000
Just tons of coconut oil every night before you go to sleep, which is like what'll bring it to a head.

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,480
yeah and uh... we've time i moved out of the state before it ever

189
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,460
and arrived dot daniel higher over there

190
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:25,080
there is a from the old yep there is

191
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,320
it's so funny how here in l_a_ just like

192
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,920
the cars just don't move out of the way

193
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,600
yeah for an ambulance is there on a

194
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
now it's worse in l_a_ it's much worse really people don't try they don't even

195
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,060
like move at all

196
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:42,000
the the and it just goes on like the opposite side of the street around

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,280
traffic yeah shit

198
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,760
- Like in Boston they like at least try to pull over.

199
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,920
- Fuck the firefighters. - And now they just

200
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,280
don't care, it's so funny.

201
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,320
- Fuck the firefighters.

202
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,320
- Yeah man, I have to go be an office PA for this new--

203
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,780
- I have to be the guy that holds the money

204
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,180
for Billy on the street.

205
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,680
- Yeah, exactly.

206
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,660
- This is much more important than some old man

207
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,280
who has had some kind of--

208
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,960
- He's had a long and fulfilling life,

209
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,880
just let him die, who cares?

210
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,200
Also, what, is he on fire?

211
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
Is that why you're sending a fire truck?

212
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,740
It can't be that bad.

213
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,620
- It's not that bad.

214
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,960
- I've been on fire before.

215
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,360
- Somebody recently told me that you can buy a fire truck

216
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
for like $3,000.

217
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,160
- Oh yeah, they sell them in like Northern New Hampshire.

218
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,700
There's like, they buy like old ones

219
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,960
and then re like fix them and shit.

220
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,520
And then they just kind of sell like that and ambulances.

221
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,380
I've seen like used auto, like used car lots have them.

222
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,600
- Do you have to have like a,

223
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,840
can I drive it with just like a class C license,

224
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,000
just like a regular license?

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,560
Can I drive a fire truck?

226
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,080
I think you might need like a CDL.

227
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,440
That would be so baller.

228
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,280
Yeah.

229
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,040
Let's all go three Z's on a fire truck

230
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,160
when we get back to Boston.

231
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,320
Yeah, all right, yeah.

232
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,520
Sound good?

233
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,760
Damn, something's really going on.

234
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,580
Yeah.

235
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,420
There's a party.

236
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,240
There's a fire truck party.

237
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Having a big party.

238
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,080
Yeah.

239
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,480
All the firemen are invited.

240
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,520
They're all going to a drive-in theater.

241
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,880
I don't think that's true.

242
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,720
They are, man.

243
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,560
I don't think that's true.

244
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,240
It's firefighters and night out.

245
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
I really sincerely doubt that.

246
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,240
You're filming Firefighters Night Out.

247
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
It's a movie.

248
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,440
It's a movie and then they're going to play the movie at the Drive-In Theater.

249
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:29,200
Today I found this Etsy account that makes like these realistic baby monsters and like

250
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,320
I was googling, I just googled like small creature or something and I found this like

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,720

259
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:17,680
made up to describe this alien baby. Skangu. I want to show you...

260
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,840
Why do you keep sending images? I'm pretty good. Patrick, I know for a fact that

261
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,360
this episode is gonna have Patrick clicking a hundred times a second on his

262
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,640
mouse and it's just gonna be deafening. Patrick got a gaming mouse specifically

263
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,640
so he could have very loud clicks and catch up on the microphone.

264
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,640
Yeah, this isn't even a...

265
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,640
That's a gaming mouse. Anything is a gaming mouse

266
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,640
if you're a big enough gamer, buddy.

267
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,640

1776 Japanese robots what hey hey Michael Bay can we have a talk please I like to

293
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,240
strap in here's my thread about transformers they're Japanese it's I

294
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,280
don't even think they are Japanese I know they're from space yeah the

295
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,640
franchise they're from mega is the franchise is it an American franchise

296
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,040
spaceship I don't know from Cybertron first of all you guys are gonna fucking

297
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,400
pussyfoot around it we were trying to afraid to say the word cybercrime

298
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,840
you say the c-word on pod cybercrime you broke the barrier there for Cybertron

299
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,800
isn't it a cube planet they're from no you're thinking of the all spark no but I

300
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,160
think it's a cube I know that it's moon is not a cube those motherfuckers are no

301
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,160
no you know what it's not a cube because or at least in the Michael Bay movies

302
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,880
cuz in Dark of the Moon they build a portal and remember they try and bring

303
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,960
the plant Cybertron to earth and when it comes through the portal it's a sphere

304
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,680
because they cut it out because they close the portal and it cuts it off and

305
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,760
it's like part of a planet that this you would know if you're a real transformer

306
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,480
cyber head I've been thinking well he never seen you I think I want to rewatch

307
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,200
all of them dude I've only seen the first three but um so cool man they are

308
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,680
cool they're fucking sick I would say the easily in my eyes the best like

309
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,520
visual effects of any movie yeah I mean it's insane because like all the

310
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:43,400
explosions and shit are real. I feel like when it came out it got so looked down upon and

311
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,800
then you look back and you're like, damn. Like you look back at that and then you look

312
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,600
at like... Damn, Megan Fox was hot as fuck. Dude, Optimus Prime was fucking thick. Oh

313
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,720
my god dude, Megan Fox in those tiny little baby jeans. And Starscream too was so hot.

314
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,720
Starscream and Megan Fox? Wouldn't Starscream turn into a gun? No, that's what was hot. Starscream

315
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,960
is a plane yeah wait oh wait never mind that was Megatron I like those two

316
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:15,520
gangsta transformers from the second one yeah where it's Tom Kenny doing black

317
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,520
scent yeah man yeah those things were for like little RV one yeah yeah this

318
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,960
bitch trippin yeah yeah and they're little tiny that's awesome it's just

319
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,000
funny the idea that like they would come to earth with those actions well no those

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,760
Those were created by the shard of the Allspark.

321
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,320
So those weren't from outer space.

322
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,160
So they were around people they picked up accents from.

323
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,600
That's my personal theory.

324
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,040
It's not appropriating in any way.

325
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,880
Yeah, no, Tom Kenny is black.

326
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,940
True.

327
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,940
That's true.

328
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,080
Tom Kenny's invited to the cookout for sure.

329
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,600
Yeah, Tom Kenny, you can come to the cookout.

330
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Says me.

331
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
Says Pat.

332
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,980
Pat is the head of the CEO.

333
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,980
He's the CEO head.

334
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:03,980
I'm the CEO of the cookout.

335
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,980
I'm the CEO of the cookout.

336
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
That's me.

337
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,980
That's me.

338
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
That's me.

339
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980
I'm the CEO.

340
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
I was wanting them to make a Beast Wars movie.

341
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,980
Yeah.

342
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
Beast Wars was way cooler.

343
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
Yeah, it is a cooler concept.

344
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
Yeah.

345
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
Beasts are way cooler than cars.

346
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,980
That's why I like, did you ever watch Zoids?

347
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
I played the Zoids Game Boy game.

348
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,980
They had an RPG called Zoids Legacy.

349
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,980
I played the Zoids Game Boy game.

350
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
I played the Zoids Game Boy game.

351
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
I played the Zoids Game Boy game.

352
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,980
I played the Zoids Game Boy game.

353
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,980
I played the Zoids Game Boy game.

354
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
I played the Zoids Game Boy game.

355
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
I played the Zoids Game Boy game.

356
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:47,100
are

357
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,840
is fucking sick. That's true. It's just it's always cool. I just like big stuff. I

358
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,700
like any movie that has a giant wave. That's like a genre of movie that I

359
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,240
really like. I like a movie where you can see the moon in the sky cuz I'm like

360
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,940
damn if you think about how big the moon is that's gotta be one of the biggest

361
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,600
things you can show on TV. Anytime there's a there's an establishing shot

362
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,260
of Earth I'm like damn that thing's big. Not as big as the moon though.

363
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:17,340
That's true. Yeah. Yeah, because the moon's closer to the camera. What? So that's why.

364
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:23,780
No, it looks further away. Not the movies I watch. It'd be cool if the moon was the

365
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:29,660
same size. As Earth? Can you imagine? Somebody should make a video that shows

366
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,060
what it would be like if the moon was the same size as Earth. Yeah. Here's what it would

367
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,100
be like if the moon was the same size. Yeah. In parentheses, as Earth. And they

368
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,980
spun around each other like two beautiful dancers. Right? And they were sort of each

369
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:50,060
other's moons. Yeah. Yeah. Man, what if? This is gonna be the best summer of our

370
00:20:50,060 --> 00:21:00,780
lives. I'm trying to decide what to do with my girlfriends in town for the next week.

371
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:08,020
Trying to figure out fun stuff to do. Yeah, there's not that much. Probably go eat out a lot.

372
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,020
Yeah, go hiking. There's some good hiking around here.

373
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,020
We're gonna go to Montana del Oro.

374
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,520
Nice.

375
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
Which is on the coast.

376
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:17,020
I would not want to go hiking anywhere.

377
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,020
That's because you're a big fan.

378
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,020
Yeah, you're gay.

379
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,520
Come on.

380
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,020
No.

381
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,020
Why would you not want to go hiking?

382
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,020
Because it's boring.

383
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,020
No, dude. You look around and you go, "Wow."

384
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,020
Why not just go to like...

385
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
Why not just go to Taco Bell?

386
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:37,020
Why not go to Taco Bell and order one of everything on the menu?

387
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,020
That would be really funny.

388
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,020
And I can play CSGO in there.

389
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,020
On the Taco Bell WiFi.

390
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,020
That is one plus. I have to admit.

391
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,020
That is way cooler than a hike.

392
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,020
Asking the Taco Bell manager for the WiFi.

393
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,020
So is it Taco Bell 3G

394
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,020
or Taco Bell 5G?

395
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
Yeah. No, I'm not going to use the

396
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,020
guest network because I am more than a guest.

397
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,020
I am a customer.

398
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,020
Yeah, and you're going to treat me with respect.

399
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,020
I get so low latency

400
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
in the Taco Bell.

401
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,460
and I play their own server in the back they do yeah and you see a csgo server

402
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,180

just when you see like his hand or whatever come off and slickly and fuck

421
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,060

423
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,160
well

424
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,720
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

425
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,760
Oh yeah, he fucking did.

426
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,880
He had a big jack in the box penis.

427
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,200
He had a big jack in the box penis.

428
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,200
With a tiny inspector gadget head on the tip.

429
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
Yeah. And just a big spring.

430
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,360
Yeah, he had a, like when it shoots a bang flag.

431
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,800
It says "Come."

432
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,200
That'd be cool.

433
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,400
Pop-Tart, you have brown sugar cinnamon Pop-Tarts?

434
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,680
Yeah. You're crazy.

435
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
I know but other people...

436
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Get some s'mores ones.

437
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,320
The thing is, yeah I guess, that's probably true.

438
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,400
S'mores is the good one.

439
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,080
I don't know, there's something, I feel, when I eat a s'mores pop tart I feel like I'm eating

440
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,720
a dessert and I know it's no different than a brown sugar but it feels much more like

441
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
breakfast food.

442
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,040
Okay, yeah, I get that.

443
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,160
For brown sugar, even though it like, there's still this kind of gross whatever.

444
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:43,800
But there's a, there's a almost a pancake-y sort of flavor profile going on there.

445
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,800
Or french toast.

446
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,160
Yeah, I don't want to be eating like a marshmallow chocolate thing.

447
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,840
- Because it is just marshmallows and the s'more,

448
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,560
or yeah, and the s'mores, Pop-Tart, so.

449
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,240
- Yeah, so that's my argument.

450
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,200
- I don't think I like Pop-Tarts, now that I'm--

451
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,240
- They're not great.

452
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,980
- It's definitely not, it's not something I would eat

453
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:01,560
for breakfast, I don't think.

454
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,400
- Yeah, I--

455
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,760
- It's not something I'd eat all the time.

456
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,720
- I just eat them, I would take them with me

457
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,320
if I don't have time to make oatmeal.

458
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,240
- Ah, man, that's a rough morning.

459
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,080
- I don't like oatmeal, dude.

460
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,040
- You don't have time to make oatmeal?

461
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,120
- Well, yeah, I just don't, I don't wanna wake up

462
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,080
ever heard that play yeah you know snooze my alarm until I have to leave in five

463
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,960
minutes and then and then it's pop pop and get crumbs all over my floor never

464
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,600
vacuum I can tell that yeah lick everything up yeah I'm sitting on a pile

465
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,960
of crumbs yeah my bed is actually it's a giant pile of crumb sleep on a giant

466
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,520
crumb pile yeah cuz I'm a giant mouse that's what mice do I hear they hide

467
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,880
their crumbs and sleep on them they hide them they make a pillow out of a crumb

468
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,040
I did that's what a mouse freaking does a worst pillow ever makes a pillow out of

469
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,680
a crumb I want to wear that you know why would you wear a pillow

470
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,520
because you're sleeping what do you mean you put your head in the hole you got a

471
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,680
bad you put the feathers in your mouth yeah you close your eyes you see a you

472
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,920
and you're and you put your tongue in the hole in the pillow that usually fuck

473
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,160
yeah during the day yeah and then you just fall asleep yep well yeah and I

474
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
I would not want to do that with a crumb.

475
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,160
That makes sense.

476
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,160
It'd be nasty.

477
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,160
What did I do today?

478
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,160
I don't even know.

479
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
I don't even know.

480
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,160
I didn't fucking know, it was so crazy.

481
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Um, I, yeah, I guess I did nothing.

482
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,160
I ate Arby's for dinner.

483
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Nice.

484
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,160
That was exciting.

485
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,160
I got a big half pound sandwich from Arby's.

486
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:36,160
Did you get the, um, you get the new steak one?

487
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,160
No, I just get the classic roast beef every time.

488
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,160
I don't even do the beef and cheddar.

489
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,920
at her. Beef and cheater? Beef and cheater. It's too expensive. I got two McChickens for

490
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:54,480
lunch today. Nice. Three dollars baby. It's a good deal. See I was imagining somebody mixing

491
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:02,480
up Lizzo and Brandy the R&B singer but he calls her Candy. I don't know who Brandy is. She's

492
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:10,520
a just a regular sized R&B singer and Lizzo is a ginormous woman. Yeah. Yeah. Very tall

493
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:15,080
right is what you mean? Yeah, she's over 6'2". It'd be funny, I don't know how tall she is,

494
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,880
but it'd be funny if she was like 7 feet tall and also that fat. She's Andre the Giant? Yeah.

495
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:25,640
Proportions. That'd be sick. That'd be scary. That'd make me like her more. Yeah,

496
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,200
if she should have to stay inside. I think she's practically, she'd have to stay inside. I don't

497
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,440
know that she could fit out of any doorway. Yeah, wouldn't be able to. Did you see that girl is

498
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,040
suing her back. No, what girl? Or is suing her. I guess Lizzo didn't sue her. But the

499
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:47,440
girl who she put on blast for taking her Uber Eats over. Oh really? That's great.

500
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:55,080
Yeah, that's the funniest shit dude. So funny. Nice. Just getting what they deserve.

501
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,200
Finally some comeuppance. I see I saw that the Epstein guards got got and she was

502
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,520
suing Lizzo the same day and I was like you know what I guess it

503
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:11,160
balances out huh? You know the universe it all comes to an equal zero at the end of the

504
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:19,800
day. They give my man Sandusky another 60 years. Nice. Nice. Nice. I just said he was my man

505
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:23,400
dude. Yeah I know that's why I don't know anything else about him but if he's your man

506
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,040
he should be in jail. I know who he is it was a joke. I was saying I don't know anything

507
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:31,360
about him but if he's your man he should be in jail. That was what I was gonna say. Sometimes

508
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,760
You interrupted me to tell me what I already know.

509
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,760
Which is?

510
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
What happened with Jerry Sandusky?

511
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,760
What do you know about him?

512
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Yeah, I know that's 60 years.

513
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
He's a pedophile.

514
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Pedophile from where?

515
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,160
Is he the guy from that college?

516
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Yeah.

517
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,160
Yeah.

518
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
Duke.

519
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,160
Told you.

520
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,160
Yeah, he's the Duke lacrosse team.

521
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Is he?

522
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,160
Yeah, he was the entire team.

523
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,160
See, I don't like this.

524
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,160
Can you stop looking at me?

525
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,160
I don't like it when you look at me.

526
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,160
I know you hate that.

527
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,720
- I just see that fucking everyone's mad

528
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,040
about this like TikTok thing.

529
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,360
- What thing?

530
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,560
- The nurse.

531
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,740
- Oh, that was, why do people care?

532
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,580
- What is it?

533
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:08,400
I don't-- - Who gives a shit?

534
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,560
Like, well, all right, I understand that like

535
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,160
a medical professional shouldn't be making fucking TikToks.

536
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,320
- What is the, I haven't seen this.

537
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,400
- But not, just 'cause they're embarrassing.

538
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,240
- Right.

539
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,000
- I do think it's funny that like all the people

540
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,960
who are mad at this person about like the TikToks

541
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,740
are the same people who are like,

542
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,280
like, yeah, like, it's a lot of like anti-SJW people

543
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:37,320
are like getting really upset over a TikTok

544
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,460
that a nurse made where she just like

545
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,800
laughs about people pretending to be sick.

546
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,920
- So what's the TikTok?

547
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,040
- So it's like, somebody is coughing

548
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,680
and the caption is like, we know when you're faking it

549
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,800
and somebody is coughing and then she's like,

550
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,700
She and then her nurse starts like dancing and there's like a beat that plays to the to the coughing sound and the nurse just like

551
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Dances until the person stops coughing and it has a it has it has generated a humongous out read outrage mill. That's cool

552
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,940
Yeah, yeah somebody like sent like

553
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,060
Somebody like docks the lady and like sent like her DWI

554
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:23,180
That's great. It's iconic. Yeah, who cares? It's like I'm not like on the I don't

555
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:27,320
I don't think she's in the right for that TikTok,

556
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,800
but then I like,

557
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:32,840
'cause why would you go out of your way to doc some lady?

558
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,180
Yeah, and I just don't see,

559
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:39,280
I don't feel like a TikTok even deserves a moral judgment

560
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,660
of like whether or not it is good or bad.

561
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,800
Like it may be as far, maybe it's not funny,

562
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,760
but it's not doing harm.

563
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,600
You know what I mean?

564
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,840
It is making me afraid to go to a doctor.

565
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,760
Yeah, 'cause they'll just dance and do a beat

566
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,600
- Well, I'm-- - Yeah, they're gonna dance it.

567
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,640
- 'Cause I think I'll laugh too hard

568
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,480
because they'll do that in real life.

569
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,300
- They're gonna start, yeah.

570
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,140
- And I'll laugh until I die. - They're gonna show me

571
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,280
all their cool TikToks and I'm gonna laugh.

572
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,120
- And that terrifies me. - I'm gonna laugh

573
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,760
my ass off.

574
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,220
- My ass is literally gonna fall off from laughing.

575
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,800
- I guess if I found out that my general practitioner

576
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,800
was a, like I later, he was like,

577
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,580
"Yeah, here's my card," and he had his TikTok on the card,

578
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,800
I probably would never go back.

579
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,800
- No, that'd be cool. - Yeah.

580
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,520
- I would go, yeah, I probably wouldn't go back,

581
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,880
but I would go to his TikTok and laugh

582
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,620
make fun of him for to everyone I know forever. Yeah that would be fun. I would

583
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:30,580
just like post them all online. Yeah. Like look at this fucking idiot. Just absolutely

584
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:34,860
fucking rake in the cloud. Yeah and I would post this guy is has been arrested

585
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,480
multiple times for beating his kids. Yeah. I would post records of that. Even if it's not true. And then I would reply and be

586
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,660
like there's no need to dox the guy. Yeah. And I would say what it's funny. I'm gonna

587
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,780
dox OJ Simpson. Let's see what's in his past. Yeah. He's been on Twitter for like

588
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,280
I just don't understand how he got so many followers so fast. He really blew up.

589
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,280
He must have bought them.

590
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:56,280
He must have bought all those followers.

591
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,280
He bought all those followers.

592
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:01,280

598
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,780
They're not, yeah, it's just him just showing off how charismatic he is, basically.

Yeah, and yes, he is charismatic and yes, I yeah, I would I personally would let him get away with anything

Right on water world by Michelle Foucault. I have this one fucking class. I have to like

617
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,900
It's like a it's called like a sex and comedy

618
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,920
Seminar sounds sexy like I have this

619
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,660
Presentation I'm supposed to do to your classmates. Yeah

620
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:02,340

Look at look at this is funny. Yeah, my sex is funny because my penis is so small a

622
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,580
Plus that's where the comedy of it comes from yeah

623
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,760
But it's just like I got to do this presentation about a movie that like

624
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,460
Nobody has seen and then I have to do all these readings and shit, and I don't know how to fucking wing it

625
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,900
I don't know. I will say a movie that nobody's seen sounds so interesting

626
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:33,260
No, it wasn't that great. No what movie was it it was a it was called grief

until I knew everything from Freakonomics Radio. Yeah until I knew all the names of

633
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:19,020
the McElroy brothers. Until I knew how to say boy correctly. Boy! Boy! Hey boys!

What are you dressed like? Oh I'm dressed like Joe Mama.

733
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,240
Yeah. Then she killed herself. A clown doing a mass joy buzzer ring.

734
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,240
Going into a club and shaking everyone's hand one by one and just zapping them all.

735
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:53,240
I had a mind bug for a little while. It was a pedophile hunter who he would just find the pedophiles

736
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:56,600
And then just get real close to him and then buzz them with a joy buzzer.

737
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,100
[laughter]

738
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,940
I was thinking like...

739
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,140
"I wanna shake your hand, you piece of shit!"

740
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:01,640
[laughter]

741
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,600
- Oh. - Pssssss!

742
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,100
Gotcha!

743
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,600
Have you seen that video of the guy on the plane?

744
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:09,100
He's like a drunk guy and he's like walking towards the back of the plane, screaming.

745
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
He's like, "I wanna shake your hand!"

746
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,600
- Yeah, it's so funny. - "I wanna shake your hand!"

747
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I had a joy buzzer then and my mom...

748
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,600
Me and my mom went to the grocery store when I was a kid and I had to...

749
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,100
It was like the day that I was just using the joy buzzer a ton.

750
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,460
and my mom knew like the manager of the grocery store.

751
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:26,960
Oh man.

752
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,220
And she was like, she was like, "Hey, like maybe like next year when you turn 14 or

753
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:36,860
whatever you can like work here and so I'm gonna introduce you to this guy."

754
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:41,340
And he like came out from the office and he was like, "Well, hey there young man,

755
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,340
my name's Jerry." And I joy buzzed him.

756
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,700
And my mom was so mad.

757
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,140
That's so funny.

758
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,980
I should just have a joy buzzer at all times.

759
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:59,260
It's so funny. Things like that are still funny to me. A joy buzzer, a Groucho Marx mask.

760
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:01,020
A whole mask.

761
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,020
Yeah, an entire-

762
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,300
A carnation that squirts water.

763
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,020
Carnation that squirts water?

764
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:11,500
Yeah, one that you put on your lapel that you squirt at the president when you're

765
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,940
meeting him for the spelling bee.

766
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,940
It's like a clown terrorist and he does carnation acid attacks.

767
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,420
That's just the Joker, dude.

768
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:20,540
Oh, that's true.

769
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,420
Get a new thing.

770
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:28,700
Yeah, I was imagining a guy who like fell into a thing of acid and it bleached his skin white

771
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:29,700
and he went crazy.

772
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,700
And then he fought back.

773
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:35,020
I was imagining the clown prince of crime.

774
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:36,020
Yeah.

775
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:37,900
Oh, now I'm thinking of the Joker.

776
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:38,900
I'm realizing.

777
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,180
I'm realizing that's actually the Joker.

778
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,900
Dude, you just blew a sick O, Pat.

779
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,420
Yeah, that was a pretty cool O.

780
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,420
Yeah.

781
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,260
I know its tricks.

782
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,140
I can do it, O.

783
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,140
I know the tricks.

784
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,180
Yeah, what a, can you do a kickflip?

785
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,540
Do a kickflip with smoke.

786
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,300
Create a dragon out of smoke.

787
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
Wow.

788
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,300
He just did.

789
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:01,140
There was a dragon at the place I went to.

790
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,140
A real dragon?

791
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
Did you do MagiQuest?

792
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,140
No, I didn't.

793
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:05,140
Dude, I did MagiQuest when I was a kid.

794
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,700
Dude, I didn't have the wristband.

795
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:11,180
If I went to go do it, they'd be like, "What are you doing in here?"

796
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,180
MagiQuest was fucking awesome.

797
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:15,100
It was the only thing to do in Myrtle Beach.

798
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,100
Is it not MagicQuest?

799
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,980
I thought it was MagiQuest.

800
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,980
It could be.

801
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:19,980
I don't know.

802
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,980
I don't know why it would be "magic"

803
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:23,980
Because you act as a magi

804
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,980
I love magi

805
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,980
Yeah you do become a magi

806
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:29,980
Well magi is plural

807
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,980
Just saying

808
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,980
So you and your friends become magi

809
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:35,980
Okay, alright now it makes sense

810
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:37,980
Magi

811
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:39,980
Keep going

812
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,980
Have you ever done it? No

813
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:43,980
It's so sick, I don't know, it probably updated

814
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,980
It would be even cooler now

815
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,980
You basically walk around like a

816
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:55,780
whole new world and you walk around like a like a fake like little universe and so

817
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:59,060
there's like there's different sections that are themed like oh this is like the

818
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:02,540
swamp and then this is like the cave where the dragon is. Oh that's sick. Like all

819
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:05,260
this stuff and you do all these quests where you have to like find things and you

820
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,200
have they give you like a wand that has like an IR sensor in it and you point it

821
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,060
at different like things it's so cool. I wish I'd done that when I was a kid that

822
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,200
would have been my shit. It was sick and they also had a dueling part. Damn. And I

823
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,520
I would fucking just beast on kids.

824
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,240
'Cause I went multiple times with the same wand,

825
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,580
so it saved my progress.

826
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,420
So I was like-- - Oh nice.

827
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,440
- I was way OP by the time that I did my last visit

828
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,280
to Magic Website. - Did you guys go

829
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,300
to Lazer Tag a lot?

830
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,520
- Yeah, 'cause my dad did some work.

831
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,360
- Damn.

832
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,340
- 'Cause my dad did construction growing up.

833
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,760
He did some work for a place that did Lazer Tag.

834
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,520
And so for two seasons, they gave us unlimited passes

835
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:43,360
or whatever.

836
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:45,280
- I've only been to Lazer Tag once.

837
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,960
I only ever got to go once as a kid.

838
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,400
and I think that's one of my biggest childhood regrets

839
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,440
is I would go back, I can't do it as an adult now.

840
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,440
- Yeah, I would not do adult laser tag.

841
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,360
- I mean, it'll be fun.

842
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,120
- Let's do some when Pat comes out to LA.

843
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:59,720
- Maybe if it's, do they have like,

844
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,200
I don't wanna do it with kids.

845
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,200
- Yeah, you could have adult laser tag

846
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,360
where there's like porn all over the walls.

847
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,200
- But no, I don't wanna--

848
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,040
- Oh my God, adult, I don't wanna think about adult laser tag.

849
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:11,200
- Come on, dude, let's do it.

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,080
- Yeah, but I, yeah, no,

851
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:13,880
I don't think I could do laser tag now.

893
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,240

Hatred sounds really cool. Yeah, I bet this was fucking sick

00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,640
It's a genocide crusade game to kill as many human beings

896
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,840
That's like there was a movie on Netflix for a while called Rampage which is just

897
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,280
about a guy doing a mass shooting and getting away with it. I remember that.

898
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,420
It was directed by Uwe Boll. Oh really? That's the dude who did the Postal

00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:15,280
Yeah probably in Germany or something. Well they made that movie that movie with the

909
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:50,200

I love movies yeah where it's just like a thinly veiled like mass shooting thing

914
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,580
like yeah there's that movie Mayhem that came out with Stephen Yuen and uh

building gets a zombie disease but it's not like they're not dead they just get

917
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,880
really angry and they didn't have to go around and kill everyone in their office

918
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,960
building. All zombie movies are kind of... Yeah well it's not even zombie they're like they

00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,880
literally they're just like are angry. They have their eyes turn red and they get

920
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,040
really mad and they're like I guess we have to kill everyone. I guess we have to kill our

00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,360
friends yeah yeah yeah and also we're doing this there's that one fucking sick

922
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:49,320
scene in that in the first Kingsman movie when the guy the older agent he gets

923
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:55,040
like this rage virus or something not the one from whatever in the first game

924
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,080

930
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,860
give me his phone number so I can conduct a business transaction. What if I feel

931
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:34,680
like maybe Weird Al has like a like a Justin Bieber mass shooting parody that

932
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,160
he's just had in the vault for like 10 years and he almost releases it and

933
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:42,160
every day that he does news breaks that like another one just happened. Yeah. He's like

934
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,400
fuck! He has to wait until mass shootings end to release his Justin Bieber. What if

935
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:54,240
what if Weird Al was fucked up? Yeah. Yeah. What if he was Weird Al? Well he has that one, he

936
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,880
has that he has that song where Santa does a mass shooting.

937
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,880
Yeah true.

938
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,880
True Santa's going crazy.

939
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,600
When I was a kid I printed out the lyrics to that song and hid them in my room.

940
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,080
Just so you could look at them?

941
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:05,080
Because I read them with my friends.

942
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,080
That was in like elementary school.

943
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:12,760
One night Santa went crazy, one night Saint Nick went insane.

944
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,760
That's a good one.

945
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,760
Classic man.

946
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:17,200
What's the best Weird Al song?

947
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:20,400
Probably probably Weird Al the song.

948
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,400

949
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,600
Weird Alvin.

950
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,140

Just blowing up.

961
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:08,340
I would just start a multiplayer server with nobody on it just so I could blow up the buildings.

962
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
Yeah.

963
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,340

I got, that's why I got Red Faction Guerrilla.

968
00:54:16,060 --> 00:54:18,340
Red Faction Guerrilla was so good.

969
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:24,420
I yeah I never really like don't even do this like Saints Row in space that would

970
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:27,980
be so much cooler of a game cuz like really the only fun part of that is

971
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:32,680
breaking shit that's what it was advertised to me as was read Saints Row

972
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:37,320
in space and then I was like oh damn that's not this at all we should make a

973
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:42,580
video game absolutely that's the next patreon what is what is our video game

974
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:54,700
doodle jump to doodle jump yeah yeah poppy jump extreme crappy bird whoa yeah

975
00:54:54,700 --> 00:55:01,460
crappy Mario I remember I like was laughing so fucking hard cuz you know

976
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:04,820
they have like those Facebook games that just like a bunch of them are like auto

977
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:09,580
generated and yeah I found this game that was like in some crazy language

978
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:12,720
there's some crazy language. I don't know it was some foreign game and it was

979
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,980
called wash run and it's a guy. I remember yeah like a flappy bird clone,

980
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:20,320
but he's sitting on a toilet and you shoot water out of the toilet and when

981
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:28,380
when you die it goes like it says like ah you scored the number. It just says

982
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:34,220
like ah above your score, so funny wash run.

983
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,240
I'm going to go on a wash run.

984
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,240
And you blasted off on the toilet.

985
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,240
I made a game when I was like 14 that was a poppy jump clone called,

986
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:49,240
because I thought it was so, I thought Gary Busey was so hilarious.

987
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:53,240
It was called Gary Busey Jumping Adventure and it was fully functional,

988
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:59,240
but I couldn't pay the $99 licensing fee to put it on the Apple store.

989
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,240
