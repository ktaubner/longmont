- It shows that you're separate from me and Cameron,

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,720
maybe a little worse, like Robin from Howard Stern.

13
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,680

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,520

00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,960
it's a story dude some some fucking Antifa soldier through a through a

66
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,080
Heineken bottle through my so my window yeah you're getting too close to the

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,520
truth car window right yeah here's what I'm thinking of you've parked the car

68
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:53,200
near the office before right yep do you think maybe this could be the work of

69
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,360
the beautiful invader who's seen you walking from the car to the office and

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,920
follow the car at the office no it happened outside my house maybe he

71
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,920
walked he fought maybe also apparently happened broad day did really yeah broad

72
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,600
day didn't you not know hey that's good that's good that's good at night the

73
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:15,000
invaders getting beauty sleep true I thought that it was during that it

74
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,600
happened like a couple days ago during the night and I just didn't see it till I

75
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,620
I went to move my car, but apparently,

76
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,420
the old baby girl was walking the dog yesterday morning,

77
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,420
and she made specific note of the fact

78
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,840
that there was not a hole in the car window

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,120
when she walked by. - Wow, interesting.

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,200
- And then when I went out at about 4.30--

81
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,460
- She specifically noted that,

82
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,480
'cause I think that that would maybe make her the culprit.

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,620
- Yeah. - No, I don't know.

84
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:39,140
She, I was like-- - I think we might have

85
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:41,120
to put her on investigation. - She texted you.

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,960
- She said, yeah, she texted me--

87
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,120
- She texted you three hours before--

88
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,180
- At 8.30. - There is no hole

89
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,480
in the car window. - There's not a single hole

90
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,580
in the car window, especially not from a beer.

91
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,580
And then she came back, she's burping up bubbles,

92
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,480
you know, she's got snot bubbles,

93
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,320
she's swaying left to right.

94
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,860
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

95
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,180
Seeing pink elephants who were spurting water

96
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,020
out of their mouths.

97
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,860
- Yeah.

98
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,680
- Yeah.

99
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,520
- Yeah.

100
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,620
- But I don't think it was her.

101
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,700
- I think the trunk of an elephant

102
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,260
should be the mouth, not the nose.

103
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,420
- I think the trunk of the car is where you get beer,

104
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,260
not the window.

105
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,860
- Here's my question, why do you call it a trunk

106
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,060
on an elephant when it's in the front,

107
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,100
when you call the trunk of a car is in the back of the car?

108
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:15,940
- Yeah.

109
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
- Unless it's a Lamborghini. - That's the back of the elephant.

110
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,960
- Yeah. - Unless it's a Lambo.

111
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,980
Maybe all along that was the back of the elephant and the front is the butt.

112
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,000
That's my question and my problem as well.

113
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,020
Maybe the tail is the real trunk.

114
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,040
I don't really care. I'm just really-- I'm just hurt, man.

115
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,060
I'm hurt and I need to see a pair of humongous boobs.

116
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,080
- Well, what? - Yeah, I need to see a pair of boobs.

117
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,100
That's not gonna fix your problem, man.

118
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,120
- I need to see a pair of boobs. - You need to go to therapy.

119
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,140
No, I don't think so. I need to see a pair of boobs that are so big that they smell bad.

155
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,820
- I would say that's a strong yes,

156
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,860
because that supports us.

157
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,420
- That comes from our website, so it's safe.

158
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:41,020

159

- And even then, a website like that--

164
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,340
- And if you already accepted the cookies

165
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,860
without reading what it was for, you should not be worried.

166
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,700
- Yeah.

167
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:58,480
And even then a website like that, that would host games like this for free, would never

168
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,700
take your data and do anything bad with it.

169
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,380
No, and it wouldn't hack our website either.

170
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,380
No, it would not.

171
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,640
And it won't, it definitely, yeah, it won't be an issue if we ever added any e-commerce

172
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,500
to our website and it won't take any credit card data from our database or anything like

173
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,500
that.

174
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,500
Definitely not.

175
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah, I can't see that happening.

176
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,500
No, that makes no sense.

177
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500

204
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,060

205
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:43,900

(laughing)

219
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,180

221
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,060
- That kid ain't bringing you no apples.

222
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,900

but check it out, there's a worm in 'em.

225
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,740
- Can you imagine how good that's gotta feel

226
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,300
when you just get yourself real hungry as a teacher,

227
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,580
so you can eat some apples when you get there?

228
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,220
- Yeah, but what if the kid's bringing a Red Delicious?

229
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,700
- Who cares, you're a teacher.

230
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,180
- Dude, a Red Delicious apple on a teacher's salary,

231
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,740
I think that's a delicacy actually.

232
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:49,200
- Yeah, maybe.

233
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,980
No, honey crisp, that's gotta be.

234
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,640
If a kid brings in a honey crisp.

235
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,480

244
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,220
Nowadays kids bring in their Apple iPhones

245
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,180
and film you when you're bending over in class.

246
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,380
- Yep, yeah.

247
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,220
They used to bring in apples.

248
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,940
- Now they bring in their Apple iPhones

249
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,920
and film you calling one of the students a freak.

250
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,400

We're doing an advice column.

376
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,080
We're jumping out of the--

377
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,620
The lists to give you the advice that all of you

378
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,240

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,320
that has multiple ats.

383
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,160
Yeah.

384
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:20,240
we want to we want to jump right into this maybe yeah. I think we should just start

385
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,040
with the first question from a listener. I love to jump right into this. Yeah let

386
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:30,620
me let me see here now some of these also have just just answers attached to them

387
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,440
already. Yeah we don't know why. Yeah don't know what's somebody replied to

388
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:40,000
the email thread. Yeah here's our first question can humans become demons?

389
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,560
Here's the answer that's already attached here. To be a demon you will have to spend

390
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,040
several hundred and thousands of years in hell as Lucifer's foot soldier gaining

391
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,600
his trust doing his dirty work and building a demonic reputation this often

392
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,600
means quote accidental mass murdering such as 9/11 Hurricane Katrina and more

393
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:03,520
Wow it's pretty good that one it's making Caleb cry

394
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:13,380
Okay, so this question is should teenage boys eat their come

395
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:21,600
So there's two there's two answers here, and I'll give my answer first mm-hmm no mm-hmm, okay

396
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:30,120
Neil sterling who lives in the United Kingdom says yes, not only is it good for you, but it's fun to produce it and then

397
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:38,400
Somebody else says most definitely you should eat you come every time it's possible in fact a teenage boy should go

398
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,880
out of his way to find all the people they can and drink their cum as well. It

399
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,440
is growing years and eating a lot of cum will help your dick grow long and hard

400
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,120
so find all the people you can to suck them off and drink their cum and that

401
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,520
person's name is Master.

402
00:19:52,520 --> 00:20:04,360
But you guys ever get some cum in your mouth? Yeah. It's not, it tastes like

403
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:10,320
orange juice? Depends on the day. It tastes like fire. Did you eat a bunch of ribs or

404
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,800
something? I did, yeah I did. It tastes like salt. Yeah. If you eat a bunch of pineapples it

405
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,240
tastes like a tropical delight. Yeah I think I did, I tried the pineapple thing

406
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,680
for a little bit in high school. Nobody was like eating my cum, but I was like

407
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,120
I was like maybe I just want to make sure if it ever comes. In the situation that someone

408
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:34,200
wants to eat my cum suddenly. I want to be prepared. Yeah, so I was eating a lot of

409
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,480
fruits and stuff. That's what the Pina Colada song's about. And I wish that I'd

410
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,880
gotten, I wish that that's when I'd gotten cum in my mouth. Yeah. But I got, I

411
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,440
think I got cum in my mouth at a time when I was mostly eating like ciabatta

412
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,680
bread and Cheerios. Oh man. And so it was really, it was real dusty. Yeah. Yeah, kind of

413
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,720
tasted like an attic. Yeah, do you, do your cum taste like kashi and it's like

414
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:58,040
damn. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's got some crunch to it. Yeah. Yeah. That's why I

415
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:02,760
Mills loves this shit. It's like the gojo soap. Yeah, exactly. It's exactly like gojo soap.

416
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:09,760
had the pumice stones. It definitely had stones in it. That is the worst soap of all time.

417
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,000
It's horrible. You just fucked it up. The one office thing you did, you just fucked it up

418
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,520
so bad. I bought a one gallon thing of soap that has pumice stones in it. The nastiest

419
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:25,160
soap ever. And he bought quarter ply toilet paper. Yeah, one roll. Yeah, one roll of quarter

420
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,800
ply toilet paper. I didn't buy that. I didn't buy the toilet paper. You did. No I didn't.

421
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,880
read your Joe and Alex. Just answer your question. All right here's a question

422
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:41,820

423
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:48,280
aunt has a crush on me what do I do? And Janet Maker PhD of educational

424
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,240
psychology says just make sure you do nothing to encourage her you might start

425
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,880
talking about your girlfriend or boyfriend make sure you're never alone

426
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,720
with her if she invites you anywhere say no in fact if you think she might invite

427
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,420
you prepare a list of excuses in advance what are the signs of an aunt crush she

428
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,740
says I have a crush on you mmm she says I have a crush on somebody in the family

429
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:16,180
but I can't tell you who my husband so there's this guy so I'm talking I've

430
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,180
been thinking I've been talking to this guy but talk to this guy he's a little

431
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:23,740
Thanksgiving update I've been talking this guy's a little bit younger than me

432
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:30,460
And he loves Spitfire wheels. He loves getting his cheeks pinched. He loves

433
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:36,820
cheeks pinching and he loves getting a Spitfire shirt for Christmas which may or

434
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:43,980
may not be happening. He's great with my son. He's really good. Being at Thanksgiving and

435
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:48,740
getting a note handed to you from your grandfather who's sitting next to

436
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:56,320
you yes like do you like me ever be a great yeah yeah you just look at you

437
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,160
pass it on yeah pass it on it's supposed to go to your grandmother do you like me

438
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:12,540
why in yes how did you see me yeah my my advice for this one is you have to leave

439
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:17,620
your family permanently yeah your family permanently that means that you were no

440
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:24,500
longer a part of the family and then your aunt. And then you can fuck your aunt. So I think what you should do is

441
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:33,500
probably... kill your aunt. You become your own uncle at that point. What? If you get involved with your aunt.

442
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,100
I guess so. But I would say that this situation probably is an

443
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,220
aunt by marriage. Okay. Because I don't, you know, aunt by marriage, pretty hot.

444
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,620
hot, you know, like that's fine, you know, like you can you can pursue that. Do you

445
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,520
think that's like a like because they have all the stepbrother stuff on the

446
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,920
internet now, all the pornography. I don't even know what you're looking at. You're

447
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:04,220
looking at the stepbrother stuff, not the stepsister stuff. It keeps popping up.

448
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,580
The pause it keeps popping

449
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:17,460
Do you think there's like so it's like the stepbrother stepsister stuff there's all this stepdog stuff

450
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:23,160
You think that there's like some videos that are like aunt by marriage

451
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,400
My marriage stuck in dishwasher. Definitely. Yeah

452
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,620
I'm by marriage, hand stuck in garbage disposal.

453
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,740
Please don't turn on the garbage disposal.

454
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:40,340
I want to see it stuck in the dishwasher one where she's like a perfect cube.

455
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,860
You know what I mean?

456
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,500
Like she's all mangled and like her...

457
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,140
Like a plate.

458
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,900
She looks like the beginning of it follows where the knees like bent back.

459
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:55,220
When you put like a water bottle on the bottom rack and like the lid like melts and like yeah.

460
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,700
Yeah, she's all melt, half her face is melted off.

461
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:03,100
Yeah, that'd be so hot. Here's a here's a question from one of our listeners sent

462
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:09,900
this in. How can I punish my slave online and here's an answer attached here from

463
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:15,460
Utah father's rights helping dads win custody a slave with a clueless master

464
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:25,740
is punishment enough. How do you think he lost his kid? Just telling his kid he's

465
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,620
Is this slave his whole life?

466
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,620
I would like to--

467
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:30,180
You are my child's slave.

468
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,500
Here's one.

469
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:37,740
This is from somebody-- this is from our listener, LicketySquirtingSplits.

470
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:43,220
This is, "How was the taste when you first sucked and licked a pussy?"

471
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,660
And Michelle Morgan said, "She tasted so good I couldn't stop.

472
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:49,660
It was my mom."

473
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:53,940
Oh dear.

474
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,820
And as for my answer, I'd like to say that I've never and will never do that. That's

475
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,820
disgusting.

476
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
Yeah.

477
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
Yeah.

478
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,020
Put somebody's thing in my mouth.

479
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
No way.

480
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,020
Eww.

481
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,660
Yeah. A penis or a vagina?

482
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,660
Just anything.

483
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,900
Yeah, I'd have to say, I mean, either way.

484
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,380
I'd be sitting in the bathroom immediately after going, "Eww."

485
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,380
I'd wash my mouth.

486
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,380
I'd wash my mouth.

487
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,380
That was soap, if I heard.

488
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,380
I'd have to. I'd put Listerine in my mouth.

489
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,380
A penis or a vagina.

490
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,380
And Listerine really hurts.

491
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,380
Yeah.

492
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,820
But I'd put it in my mouth for maybe four or five seconds.

493
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,820
- I do Listerine mixed with hydrogen peroxide.

494
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,060
- I do Listerine mixed with the hot sauce.

495
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,020
- I do nail polish remover mixed with Styrofoam.

496
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,020
Put that in my mouth.

497
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:36,860
- Um, and here's another one from the same guy.

498
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,220
This is, he just replied to the same email

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,420
so that he could, he wanted to get two for one.

500
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,260
- Yeah.

501
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,420
- He said, "Have you ever fucked teen pussy?"

502
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:48,340
And this person says, "My cousin brother

503
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,260
"has fucked his teen sister's pussy."

504
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,500
(laughing)

505
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,300
and Don Spencer who lives in West Virginia says,

506
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,380
when I was young, I did my neighbor's daughter.

507
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,020
It was mutual and good.

508
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,660
And-- - I love our fans.

509
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,060

512
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,580
- Here's a, here's one here.

513
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,160
This is kind of a prequel one.

514
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,840
Prequel question from a fan.

515
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,260
How can I tell my aunt that I have sexual feelings for her?

516
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:30,100
here's a celebrity guest answer from John Wilson who says this is how it went

517
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:34,620
this is how I went about it my aunt and I have had a close relationship for a

518
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,340
long time I stayed with her like I was her son through the years as I grew

519
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,540
older we could talk about anything and we did some of our best conversations

520
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:48,660
would be when the Sun when she's untanned by the pool I would stare at my

521
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:55,780
aunt's hot body and imagine her naked. One day I couldn't help myself so I asked

522
00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,180
if I could rub lotion on her. With no hesitation she said hell yeah. I missed

523
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,740
some spots plus I'd love to be rubbed on. I thought I was dreaming when she said

524
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:10,180
that. Sweet this works for both of us because I wanted to rub all over your

525
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:17,100
sexy body. She didn't say anything so I apologize for saying that. So she rolled

526
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:24,880
over so I could start with her backside. My dick was semi-hard as I made my way

527
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,320
up her thick with two C's. We need to imagine what he's what he'd be filming

528
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,880
with all this. So thick with two C's. He's just filming random women on the street.

529
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,880
Thick with two C's maybe like a tree trunk. You know. Continue. It was time to

530
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,960
make my move so I pulled my dick out of the side of my short. Okay so that's a guy

531
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:53,960
getting off the subway yeah yeah as I moved it got so hard her tan line on her

532
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,800
ass was covered by the bottom she was wearing with both hands just grabbing

533
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,400
her so much I asked if I could pull them off her hips come up and I quickly had

534
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,960
them off I asked if it bothered her by what I said but not shocked her there I

535
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,680

557
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,080
was answered by by one of our fans, John Willie. This is about he answered the

558
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,040
last question.

559
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:09,380
This is about me and my wife, who is a tall and very strong and dominating

560
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:12,540

twenty twenty one after dating for over twenty four months and I can't read

563
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,740
this whole thing because he literally he wrote a twenty six item list of what

564
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,820
happens when they have sex and each item is like multiple paragraphs long, but he

565
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,040
does include the statistics, the vital statistics of both his wife and him.

566
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:36,680
So his wife is five foot five feet, nine inches, one hundred and five

567
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:40,840
kilograms, breast, forty nine inches, triple D's, biceps, nineteen inches,

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,320
four inches, shirt slash bra size, triple XL, body type, strong, athletic

570
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,920
and muscular. And then his stats are five feet, four inches, weight, fifty

571
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,520
six kilograms chest, thirty four inches biceps, thirteen inches waist, twenty

00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,980
eight inches thighs, eighteen inches calves, fourteen inches shirt slash

573
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,220
vest size, extra small body type, weak lean and thin. Does he does he list her

574
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:12,460
does he list her at or anything does he yeah? I would like to see my eyes are

575
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,780
smaller than her biceps. My face is twenty percent smaller than her boob.

576
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,300
This is her ass is bigger than my back. Her thighs are bigger than my waist and

577
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:22,940
as big as my chest. Her side body thickness from back armpits to boobs is

578
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,780
as big as my front body with shoulder to shoulder with so she can hide me behind

579
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,320
her even horizontally apart from being obviously able to hide me behind her

580
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,880
vertically and then yeah it's a 26 and then it at the end it's a attached like

581
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,440
super dark blurry picture of it just look it's just two naked bodies, but only

582
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,680
like the shoulders. Oh we looking at this it's like it's a it's a oh my god.

586
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,780

587
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,740

bathroom so bad and and as we were saying listen this one this is a pretty good

590
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:26,820
question this this is a woman who's having some marital issues she said how

591
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,140
would I make my husband happy in bed he complains I have a big pussy and he

592
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,500
doesn't enjoy sex with me so it's a lot of people in this thread who are just

593
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:43,900
kind of it's not your fault it's not your fault right but your gum out huh

594
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:50,660
Spit your gum out. Yeah now he's the villain. It's not your fault. Oh, it's not your fault. Your husband's a jerk and then this guy

595
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,820
Usman Fia

596
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,900
He's yeah friend of the show. He says I sex with you

597
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:07,780
Accolade is that he knows English

598
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:15,860
So that's pretty impressive. I have another I haven't I have a an advice question here from a fan of the show

599
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:21,700
I think this one is specifically for Caleb. This is an advice question that I'm here to answer. Yeah that asks

600
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,960
What is size of your boob? Can I see it?

601
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:30,240
My boob. Yeah, I don't know. I'm trying what what's my measured one?

602
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,780
So like I could be an a cup. I tried to get my

603
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,820
My sternum bone fitted for a bra

604
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:42,340
Yeah, I have pectus carinatum. I don't know how to say it the one where it pokes out instead it goes in

605
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,620
Oh, yeah

606
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:49,020
Yeah bird chest and when I was 13 it poked out a lot more and as a gag

607
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,660
Me and my friends made they were like, oh, what are they like, you know with the odds remember that game?

608
00:34:53,660 --> 00:35:00,380
Yeah, I lost I had to go into Victoria's Secret and get it fitted damn asked to get it fitted and they said no

609
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:02,740
They said no, they won't they said they wouldn't say no

610
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:06,900
They said they would not fit my they would not check my my size

611
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:11,580
That's terrible. Yeah different time. Yep

612
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:17,860
So it would probably one of the most embarrassing moments of my life talking to a Victoria's Secret employee like

613
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,840
Victoria's Secret model because it's all models who was yeah a Victoria's Secret angel

614
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,000
I had to walk up to yep and ask well you was wearing the angel wings

615
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,260
She's only in she's six. Will you put some tape measure around my 13 year old chest? Yeah

616
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:38,740
and she said no no I will not beat you yep and my friends were like well at

617
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:47,220
least you did it that's right anybody have one or just I yeah sure my son's

618
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:54,180
dick gets boner on seeing me is it good Brandon DeVos I have a question for

619
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,460
Cameron tell him it's normal and teach him how to take care of it specifically

620
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,620
for Cameron from a fan. Uh-huh. What happens if I put liquid meth in my

621
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:13,460
vagina? And somebody named Carissa Gardner, former addict of several drugs for over a decade,

622
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,020
says first off what's the point of meth mixed with water? Secondly I will only

623
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,900
allow pure organic grapeseed or coconut oil in my vagina because I fear infection.

624
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:28,860
It would destroy your pH balance. Yeah I only I only allow I only allow

625
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,860
purists is weird. I only allow pure coconut oil in girls vaginas as well.

626
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:36,380
Absolutely. Yeah. That's a big rule for me. Yeah. That's the only thing that's

627
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:40,300
going in there. Definitely. Nothing else. Yeah. Why is it's kind of weird that

628
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,700
women's thingies have a scientific element. Yeah. Well it's because it's an

629
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,660
open hole. Guys thingies don't have that. Yeah. There's nothing alchemical about my

630
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,340
penis. Yeah. But the girls are trying to put the right mixture of salt. It's

631
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:59,540
It's basically a hot dog. It's basically a Petri dish. Yeah. Their thing. You guys

632
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,740
haven't have never... because I'm... this has got me thinking about the pH balance of

633
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:08,740
my butthole right now. The pH balance of my butthole is all the way negative. Yeah.

634
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:17,340
It's fully... The pH balance of my butthole... the pH stands for penis hole. Okay, what's the

635
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:23,340
balance yeah what do you balance in there how are you balance are you

636
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:33,860
balancing it in your butt what's the number is that a sick I don't know which

637
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:38,140
one is with me neither I think acidic is the the most medium my damn buttholes

638
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,100
acidic the way that I twirl my fucking butt pubes that's right

639
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:49,940
you know you know I got them curly bouncy little things what are they called

640
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,940
tendrils

641
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:00,780
things that come off of the city guys heads yeah I suppose the city close well

642
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:09,460
I'll be rubbing sheets all over it. Whoa! Stop look! That's crazy! That is a fan named

643
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,700
Adam Schlong sent in a uh... Adam Schlong certified HEO and avid

644
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
extreme outdoorsman

645
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:21,420
uh... sent a photo of somebody injecting meth into a vagina

646
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,420
I bet that feels really good though. Yeah probably

647
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,980
He also posted a picture of

648
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,860

Here's an answer from Oliver pick up composer, twenty fourteen to present as a

694
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,400
sick ass fucking name. You should go to the police immediately. Why you ask

695
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,480
because if you refer to your penis as your thing, then you are clearly not an

696
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,240
adult, far too young to have a wife. Ergo, she is sexually assaulting a minor.

697
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:09,780
Not good. Hey, here's my impression of that fucking guy. Ergo, bitch. Ergo,

698

retired entrepreneur which means he's an entrepreneur he's former

730
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
- He's literally retired.

731
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,380
- Yeah, so now he's back in the game.

732
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:45,220
They pulled him right when he thought he was out.

733
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,380
- Yeah, this must have pulled him out of the game

734
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,780
'cause this was in, he was 1983 to 2009.

735
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:50,620
- Oh wow.

736
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,820
- He's a former retired entrepreneur, he said,

737
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,620
because he has a deep-seated anal retentive needs

738
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,020
that were never met as a one-month-old baby.

739
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,260
(laughing)

740
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,740
'Cause caregivers most likely,

741
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:06,100
products of their own parents'

742
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,200
depressive drug-ridden environment,

743
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,400
had a comorbid poly drug and substance abuse

744
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,280
and undiagnosed mental health disorders.

745
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,600
They were never brought out

746
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,640
in his part of the family's lineage

747
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,900
and it began a self-perpetuating generation

748
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,200
and cycle of maladaptive behaviors,

749
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,800
thus leading each new offspring to be neglected

750
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
and not properly potty trained

751
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,720
and rarely had his diapers changed.

752
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,980
So when he grew up and landed in a foster care family,

753
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,320
they actually cared for him

754
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,380
and helped the boy overcome his anxiety

755
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:40,680
he became unable he became able to handle the stress of life I could find a

756
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,880
part-time job utilize newfound ways of self-care and could afford underwear and

757
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:50,040
habits begin to change his ass digging habit and smelling it was likely a

758
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:56,020
remnant of his early memories of anything anymore than the first sentence

759
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,720
of this yeah here's the thing big guy it smells good your butt smells good

760
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,760
everybody knows your butt smells hopefully you're not calling him

761
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,020
scratch and sift no seriously maybe his anus is itching and he needs to check

762
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:10,920
and see if his butt stinks who doesn't like to smell their own but it's cool to

763
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,360
do everyone loves their own yes smell here's an important question from a

764
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:20,600
listener that we need an answer to no answers yet can bread oil regrow my

765
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:26,920
thing I think it can I'm guessing that they meant to say beard oil so by

766
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:31,880
oil. I mean a hair that they have they may be I'm reading. I think they need to

767
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,360
retire. I think they're talking about bread oil and I think they're talking

768
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,880
about their downstairs thing yeah,

769
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:39,880
a lot of it rolled in the store and I think they're trying to might be a

770
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,200
little yeah, my right. I was the oil that they give you when the ed like a

771
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:49,320
restaurant to dip bread. It's got balsamic vinegar and oregano yeah, that

772
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:55,000
might work. I want to this is from truth finder. I want to sit on my

773
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,940
boyfriend's face and fart on it. How do I approach this?" And then here's just one

774
00:46:00,940 --> 00:46:08,280
answer. Somebody did this, or somebody has a good strategy. "Sit on his

775
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:12,860
face while he's eating your pussy. When you get ready to come, let it rip. That

776
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:16,440
way you can say, 'He did such a good job eating your small pussy that you blew

777
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,480
him a kiss.' It always works for my wife when she farts while I'm eating her

778
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:29,060
your pussy. I blew you a can you imagine that just like getting farted on your

779
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:29,380
chin.

780
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,380
Well,

781
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:34,980
I have an important question from

782
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:42,080
a fan, a mother actually a fan of the show and a mother. Wow, then maybe you

783
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,580
can shed some light on Patrick. This motherly fan asks us, why does my son

784
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,080
keep my undies in a box?

785
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:55,840
You have any insight on this one?

786
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:59,480
No, I don't.

787
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:01,340
It's because your son's a freak.

788
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,640
Your son's a weird freak.

789
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:06,320
Maybe, I mean maybe the son's putting the undies in the box to protect them from

790
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:07,320
the underwear perverts.

791
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
From the underwear fairy.

792
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
From underwear perverts.

793
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:10,520
Oh, I was thinking of a magical creature.

794
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:15,840
Like Spongebob and Mr. Krabs.

795
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,760
This may be a question that the son asked.

796
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,180
That woman's son, our fan, I think they asked, "Can you tell me why haters take so much pleasure

797
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,180
in hurting people?"

798
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,320
I fucking hate haters, dude.

799
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,520
I actually love haters.

800
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,380
I hate haters, but I love my haters.

801
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,400
I love my haters.

802
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:37,880
I have a shirt from DGK that says this.

803
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:43,800
It says, "I love haters because they motivate me to be a better person and basically do

804
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,880
do all awesome, do incredibly dope shit,

805
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,400
kick incredibly dope shit.

806
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,000
- Do you kick dope shit to your haters

807
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,180
and they get mad icy at it?

808
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,020
- Yes.

809
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:54,840
- Yeah.

810
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,760
Do you know what I hate more than haters?

811
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,780
- Suck MCs?

812
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:58,240
- Suck MCs and herbs.

813
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,220
- Oh, dude.

814
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:00,060
- I hate herbs.

815
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:03,800
- Oh, dude, the only time I want a herb is 11 of them.

816
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,640
- That's right.

817
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,460
- 11 of them on a--

818
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,300
- And maybe some spices, brother.

819
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,840
- Uh-huh, 11 herbs and spices in my damn--

820
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,500
- But I hate them herby-ass haters.

821
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,340
- Uh-huh.

822
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,160
(laughing)

823
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,160
I saw a picture of this one.

824
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,160
Oh my god, I did not open the answers to this question.

825
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,160
He's crying.

826
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,160
He's crying!

827
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,160
This fan made Cameron cry.

828
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,160
This is a question from a fan that I picked because the question is "How can I make someone to be my slave?"

829
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,160
Holy fuck.

830
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,160
There's an answer!

831
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,160
Dude, what the fuck.

832
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:40,160
There's an answer!

833
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
Kimberly

834
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:56,860
You need to find a person like me and if I am as you desire then I submit to your training and allowing myself to be

835
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:00,680
Brainwashed until all I am and will ever be as a slave. Good luck in your search

836
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,160
Then it's a picture of the penguin from

837
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,480
Exactly like the penguin she has black lips uncle fester in a way

838
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:21,900
Wish both of them all the best of luck. Can you get can you give me?

839
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,880
I think I think the office needs a slave. I think we should hire her as a slave. Okay, Kimberly

840
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,200
Well, I do I do actually have some if you if we're looking for a slave. I have some good news from uh, oh really

841
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:39,000
I have a question here that that um that might be relevant. Is it true? This is from a fan even

842
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,480
it's very it's very nice of the fans to kind of predict that we might be looking

843
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,760
for a slave is it true that if you tell someone be my slave they become your

844
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:54,240
slave right away as if it were a magic incantation be my slave Oh be my slave

845
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:02,760
be my slave be my slave we had a great slave off

846
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:10,960
so we all are each other so how does this work then we can't boss each other

847
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,040
around it is guys George Sawyer says this is sorrows George Sawyer says this is

848
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,120
complete nonsense it is not true at all if it were that easy there would be

849
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:25,120
armies of slaves out there that's what well Jory he's using one George source

850
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:28,640
is using a fake name so that people don't know that it's him and - he's only

851
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,600
saying that so people don't know catch onto his mind control well that's what

852
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,200
he that's what he does with everyone yeah he makes everyone his slave and he

853
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,840
He doesn't want a secret to get out. Is it rude that my boyfriend put his naked

854
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,760
ball sack on my head while I was sitting down and not looking?

855
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:47,200
No. It's certainly rude.

856
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,640
It's not rude. It's certainly rude, but it's not unwelcome.

857
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,000
And Steve says, "People are getting so offended now."

858
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,880
I have a ball sack related question for the fan.

859
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:01,280
I got quite a couple ball sack ones. Let me throw this one in there real quick

860
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,320
quick and then we can maybe do a

861
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,820
ball sack lightning around.

862
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,880
There's this thing on my nuts that

863
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:08,560
is blue and is like going into the

864
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,180
nut sack, but I can't get it out.

865
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,600
It's kind of sticking out. What is

866
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,720
this and is it bad?

867
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:20,100
This is blue. It's blue. Blue is

868
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:21,540
that's the scariest color for

869
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:23,500
something to be absolutely growing

870
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,420
out of your necrosis of your balls.

871
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:27,260
That's yeah. This person says what

872
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,660
should I do with my ball sack smells

873
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,260
like salt and vinegar and and Marco

874
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,300
says make a salad lol oh make a salad with here's one I'm not gonna get into the

875
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:40,940
answers but this is good for I think for us mm-hmm what changed in your life

876
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:48,000
after becoming a martial artist just the way people looked at me I would say it

877
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,820
saved my life yeah yeah yeah because I would say health what was I would say

878
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:57,300
personally I have heart failure idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy plus

879
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,260
an extreme number of irregular heartbeats as you guys know yeah this

880
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:04,540
diagnosis means I have a life expectancy of six to eight years and the diagnosis

881
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:09,780
was made 18 years ago when I was six years old yeah I take the pills that are

882
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:13,440
prescribed and I have a pacemaker and I and I practice Tai Chi basically every

883
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,180
day I'm convinced that a large number amount of credit goes to Tai Chi for

884
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,700
keeping me alive I doubt that I will ever get into a fight because who would

885
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,160
want to pick a fight with a gray-haired overweight person who is obviously over

886
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:29,340
75 that's me but I'm winning the fight for my life good for you man thank you I

887
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:33,100
I actually think becoming a martial artist actually changed my mental health.

888
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:35,820
You might think it was for the better, but it actually changed it for the

889
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:38,860
worst because now I walk around and I see everybody on the street and I think

890
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:41,740
I can kill this person with a single punch and it makes me depressed and

891
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:46,300
anxious. Think about my power. That's a good point. Yeah. I just use it

892
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:49,100
for chopping wood.

893
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:55,900
Just you know if I don't have an axe handy. Going up to the cabin and just

894
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:02,380
smashing your head against logs and then like getting a concussion

895
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,860
hallucinating that you've chopped all the wood.

896
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:13,820
I uh this next question from a fan um it was answer um let me let me just get

897
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:19,100
into it let me just say it um i want to have sex with my maid but i'm

898
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,260
scared i'm young and muscular will my maid agree should i start masturbating

899
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:26,940
or flashing my dick in front of her and there was an answer here from Daniel but

900
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:34,380
he deleted it. Daniel got in trouble. So that led me to find a man

901
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:40,060
named Steel Rod, it says related answers Steel Rod and he's created a

902
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:47,620
judgment-free space for anybody of age called pick/tips for jerk-off

903
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:51,860
fantasies Desi plus Bollywood and there's three questions in here there's

904
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:57,140
none of them are answered. This is a fan of the show, Steel Rod. I didn't

905
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:01,380
come for the last nine days can anyone help me come with their pics or DMs?

906
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:12,100
And which of these non-Indian celebs turns you on the most? This real quick I

907
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,220
just I want to read this one this is from an anonymous fan they say can I

908
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:18,580
I open my ball sack like a bag of chips

909
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:25,880
and then someone responds. It depends and that answer is from

910
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:26,820
spider man.

911
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:35,880
I have a question here. Is it possible to get a girlfriend using magic? Yes,

912
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,220
yes, I would say yes, there I have a few answers here. This one is from

913
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:43,380
Joshua George, which I think great man. This sounds like this might be his

914
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:49,720
personal story of his life, but he says learn magic get guda at it go to an

915
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,520
orphanage put on show ask the sweet old lady running the orphanage to be your

916
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,120
girlfriend. Yep, wow yeah, and I have another answer here. That's more of like

917
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:04,040
life wisdom from dress swami vaidya nathan chandra sikar born in Tamil Nadu

918
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:07,920
and worked in many places all over India. So experienced knows a lot about

919
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,120
about life experience. Don't use magic use logic magic will mislead you to

920
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:14,740
that the GF is out of this world and disappoint you.

921
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:16,780
Logic will make you accept her as she is,

922
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,120
as no one is perfect.

923
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,320
Magic will jack your expectations sky high,

924
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,660
only to bring you down to earth later in a crash.

925
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,920
Logic will keep you grounded and stable.

926
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:25,760
- Damn.

927
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,100
- Logic is basically a kind of magic.

928
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,460
- Logic is like better than magic, I think.

929
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,300
- All right.

930
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:32,460
You're thinking logically.

931
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:37,160
- How can I get a blowjob from my mum?

932
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,400
(laughing)

933
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,660
(laughing)

934
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,660
And Nicola Green, who's--

935
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:46,500
- A fan of the show.

936
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,540
- Accolade is a mom of two, says,

937
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:51,520
"Now it's wrong with a blowjob."

938
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:53,060
(laughing)

939
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,260
And then related question,

940
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,420
this one doesn't have any answers, but it's for you guys.

941
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,540
If your son said he was feeling stressed out

942
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:00,820
and then took out his penis and asked you to suck it,

943
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,660
would you?

944
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,480
- No.

945
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,320
- But he's stressed.

946
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,160
(laughing)

947
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,060
But he's really stressed.

948
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:05,900
He's like--

949
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:07,900
- Not until he gets his chores done.

950
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:10,620
Okay, all right, all right, listen.

951
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:15,100
Your son, picture this, your son straight A's

952
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,940
his entire life, right?

953
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,300
You've been putting him in special schools,

954
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,340
like he's straight A's at like--

955
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,460
- So my special son is stressed.

956
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,260
- He's special, but he gets straight A's, right?

957
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,100
And he comes to you and he gets an A minus, right?

958
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,540
And he's about to break down

959
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:33,180
when he hands you the report card,

960
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,040
and he's like, "Dad."

961
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:37,180
- Dad. - Dad.

962
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,020
Dad! Dad! Dad!

963
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,540
The reason why...

964
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:42,260
Dad's failing in school, Dad.

965
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:44,580
The reason why he's so stressed...

966
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:45,780
Son, I'll suck your dick.

967
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:49,100
Welp, Bobby.

968
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,380
Goddammit, Bobby, get that dick over here.

969
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,180
Dang it, Bobby, pull out your penis and let me suck it.

970
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,020
So yeah, that's an answer then.

971
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:56,940
It's a yes.

972
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,460
So yeah, if your son's stressed out enough...

973
00:56:58,460 --> 00:57:00,980
If your son is Bobby Hill and you're Hank Hill...

974
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:01,580
Yeah.

975
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:02,300
...it's a good group.

976
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,460
You might be a redneck.

977
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,820
yeah i think it's a good reason the yeah

978
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:12,260
uh... here's a question from uh... so this is from a fan who i think started

979
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:12,940
to write

980
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,980

1002
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,160

pretty good. Yeah, I just got one more sure I have one more after this,

1012
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,880
- Nicola Bjork, I'm 15 years old and I just cummed.

1013
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,120
(laughing)

1014
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:39,520
- Is there a question mark after that?

1015
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,360
It's just a statement?

1016
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,600
- No, it's just a statement.

1017
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,520
- It's a statement.

1018
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:43,720
- Okay. - That's great.

1019
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:48,680
- So this question was sent in,

1020
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,360
but I think there's a question,

1021
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:54,160
another question under it to kind of like,

1022
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,400
I think they kind of regretted saying this.

1023
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:02,520
This question is from an anonymous fan. They said, "What is the most

1024
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,520
inappropriate thing a cousin has done to you?" So they start to try to start the

1025
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,040
question here, get the conversation going, start the discourse. And then an ad by

1026
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:15,560
the penny hoarder immediately under that says, "What are the biggest money secrets

1027
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,040
that rich people keep from us?"

1028
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,040
[Laughter]

1029
01:00:20,040 --> 01:00:26,080
The trick is to start a podcast. You make a lot of money. You make a million dollars.

1030
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:32,260
dollars. Most inappropriate thing a cousin did, won't say. No thank you.

1031
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:38,740
Yep. Alright. Thank you guys for sending in all the questions. We love you guys.
