*explosion*

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,000
Alright, we're recording.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm stuck in the peanut butter, Lois.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's me, it's me, Peanut Griffin.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Peanut Griffin.

10
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Peanut Grif- Lois, please.

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
*laughs*

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
*gibberish*

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Friggin' crap.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm stuck in the peanut butter again.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm drowning in the peanut butter.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Peta, it's just your arm.

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
No, it's my whole body.

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm drowning in the peanut butter.

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm drowning right now. I'll stick my thumb in this side.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm stuck.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
That's how you get a work around not being able to do an impression of somebody.

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You feel like, "Oh, it's them."

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It's an impression of them stuck in peanut butter.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yeah, it's them, but they're like stuck underwater.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
This is Barack Obama.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm Barack Obama, I'm drunk too, I have food stuck in my throat!

27
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm choking!

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm choking, somebody help me!

29
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm Barack Obama!

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's me, Obama, and I'm choking on food!

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Help me! I have food in my mouth too!

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I know it's me, but it's Obama, and I'm asking for food!

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm choking at Harvard!

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Now let me be clear!

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The CPI on me right now!

36
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,840
(laughing)

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,340
- Now let me be clear, the American people.

38
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,320
- I'm getting just lightheaded.

39
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,440
- You've been lightheaded.

40
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,720
You're lightheaded 'cause I knocked you out

41
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,560
in Fight Club, bitch.

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,040
Don't even lie to me.

43
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,120
- It's true, you were.

44
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,120
- I literally just took Patrick out bad,

45
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,960
and I beat him.

46
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,040
- Yeah, you guys made me winded before recording.

47
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,920
- I beat him down.

48
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,760
So I wouldn't be--

49
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,580
- We cornered him a couple times.

50
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,800
- Yeah, so I wouldn't be on top of him.

51
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,640
- I'm not making that up.

52
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,800
- He tried to do a kung fu double kick on us to get out.

53
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,840
- And I beat him.

54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,600
I think that's gonna be my new--

55
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,440
- Your new move.

56
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,640
interacting with you guys I'm gonna fight you I don't like that well you're immune

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,940
that's what I do. I'm gonna fight Patrick. That's what I used to do to Neil and Neil did not like it.

58
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:02,440
Oh that's because you were doing it to Neil. That makes sense.

59
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:09,120
The thing is Neil, the problem is Neil is specially trained in Kung Fu and so he

60
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,000
knows that he's a ticking time bomb yeah one day somebody's gonna throw a fake

61
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,400
punch at Neil and he's gonna fucking terminate him. I remember the one time that Neil tried to

62
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,500
punch Patrick he tried to punch me that one time there's two there's two

63
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,420
incidents where he tried to there was the one time I did something I think I like I

64
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:35,760
don't remember what I did but he turned around and started choking me and then

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,460
you turned around did you saw him doing it you're just sitting there watching it

66
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,700
laughing and I was like the first time I ever hung out with like all of you guys

67
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,540
Neil choked me I miss him did I talk to him today I think we're gonna hang out

68
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:56,060
pretty soon. I should have. I wanted to, yeah, I meant to invite him to come hang in New York.

69
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:00,940
Oh yeah, we're all, we all got, we're in, it's amazing, we're in New Hampshire again. We're in

70
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:08,140
Manche, Vegas. Yeah, Fallout Manche, Vegas. We got, we all got positive COVID tests. Yeah, so we

71
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,140
decided, we decided, why not, might as well. Might as well, we already got it. That's true, I mean,

72
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,980
we're building herd immunity. We all tested negative, but if we'd all tested positive,

73
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,300
we'd be in the same place. That's true. It wouldn't matter. It's like, it wouldn't matter.

74
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,980
Might as well, yeah. True. Either way, right?

75
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,060
Yeah. We could have fought it together.

76
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,740
Yeah. I would have fought it for you because you're so weak and I'm the king of Fight Club.

77
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,180
I never get sick, but when I do get sick, I get like... Man, if you get me sick, that's fine. I

78
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,300
don't care. But if you get my family sick, you get my friends sick, I'm going to fuck you up.

79
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,780
I'm going to get you sick. I'm going to get you sick right back.

80
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:41,340
I'm going to inject you with cancer blood. Whoa.

81
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:46,380
Yeah. I'm doing experiments to undo the cure for cancer and I'm going to use it on your mom.

82
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,100
Did you guys ever have the chicken pox growing up?

83
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:54,780
No. I, dude, I straight up, anytime I do get sick, I'm like out for like a whole day.

84
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,780
And I'm like, if I like, like have like a flu, if I have like flu-like symptoms,

85
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,340
I'm like throwing up for 24 hours, but I puke so hard that I think I push all of it out.

86
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,500
I think that's food poisoning.

87
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,780
You, I could see you having like a very like 1800s idea of what like medicine is.

88
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,300
Yeah, it makes sense. You're like yeah, my pepper. Sometimes your blood turns evil and you have to let some of it out. Mm-hmm. Yeah

Over the top. I'm doing a cranberry lemon lime thing with my blood right now. That's cool. Mm-hmm

98
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:22,240
really

99
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,300
blood bites back. That's the tagline of Resident Evil.

100
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,500
I recently re-watched the first Resident Evil movie.

101
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,700
I've been watching through them. I have two left.

102
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:32,140
The first one is sick when the guy gets turned into cubes.

103
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,740
Yeah, and every kill in that movie is just stolen from another movie.

104
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,740
It's just ripped off. It's so funny.

105
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,240
Yeah, because it's like the coolest kill in Cube.

106
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,140
You know what that movie's called?

107
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:41,840
Yeah, Cube.

108
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,640
And they just were like, "Oh, we can just do that."

109
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,140
Yeah.

110
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,740
Cube.

111
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,240
Yeah.

112
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,740
Right, you know. It's Canadian.

113
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,540
Resident Evil, fuck, what's it called?

114
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,640
Apocalypse.

115
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
That one's good. It has like weird dogs.

116
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:57,240
the fourth one is like so good because they just like... Resident Evil 4? No, the movie,

117
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,840
what's it called? Resident Evil... It's where they just give up and they just like none of it

118
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,920
makes any sense and it's just like CGI fight scenes for no reason like and they

119
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:09,160
like fight it's when Paul W.S. Anderson came back to the movies he like he made

120
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,080
the first one then he and then he left and then he came back and it's just like

121
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,560
Paul Thomas Anderson. You mean Paul Thomas Anderson. You're talking about Paul Thomas Anderson.

122
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,960
Yeah, yeah. There's a scene where there's like just a giant zombie with an axe

123
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,400
That just like like it's like he just looks like like pyramid head

124
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,120
He just like comes into a bathroom and starts fighting a girl and they just never explain what it is or why it happens

125
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,320
They just killed the zombie and move on. Well, it's

126
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:36,200
In the games. It's like there's an evil spirit or some shit, right? No, no, I don't think I've ever

127
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:43,400
We're gonna read a resume. I haven't played one either. But um, it's it's a virus. It's the virus. Oh, right

128
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,000
T-virus testosterone. So you're saying that this is a coded feminist game. Yep. Yep. Wow. They're trying to take us down

129
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,740
Yeah, I mean think about it. We gotta get him first.

130
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:57,800
I'm inviting every girl listening to this to fight club outside Patrick's house. You know, you can't double team

131
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,320
Take me on and if you're above 5'5"

132
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,300
You lose by the decision. Mm-hmm. I'm also the judge

133
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,280
I'm also one of the judges. It's 12 rounds

134
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,880
And the last round is an eating competition and that's where I really clean up. Yeah

135
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,920
Yeah, yeah, you I may not be able to beat up every woman, but I can out eat any woman on earth

136
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,720
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and that's absolutely true except have you guys seen this show on?

137
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:31,600
Hulu that I've been watching which yeah, but have you guys been watching? Yeah. Yeah, it's about two women who combined their sisters

138
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:40,040
I've watched like two episodes of it the first episode I cried. Yeah sure I cried a little bit. Yeah

139
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,480
the like emotional part of the episode is she goes to a dump because she can't fit

140
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:50,280
on a different scale, she can't fit on a normal scale and so she goes to the dump

141
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,760
and they like weigh her like next to a bunch of scrap metal and it's like

142
00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,240
"you weigh 600 pounds" and she's like "I thought I weighed 300 pounds" and she starts crying.

143
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,200
That's sad. It's horrible. Yeah I mean yeah it's awesome though. Yeah. Yeah. I would go to the

144
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:12,260
dumped probably weigh myself yeah you go to the dump to weigh myself just to feel

145
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,860
better about it cuz then it's probably like it's too low to read yeah you like

146
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:21,080
this sounds all about this I'd like to weigh my dump hey what's that go to the

147
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:27,080
dump and crap on the scale and wait that yeah how much money for this that's what

148
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,900
I would have done if I was working on that show as a cameraman yeah I mean like

149
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,860
while we're here I might as well take a shit on this scale right can you zero it

150
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,740
We're gonna add some drama to the show. If you eat a bunch of pennies, you can sell it.

151
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,740
I tried to get on the scale, but there's too much poop on the scale!

152
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:47,620
Another hurdle she must overcome. There's poop on the scale and she has to bend over to pick it up.

153
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,980
No! But yeah, one of them was like, the best part of it was they were like, "We's gonna get healthy.

154
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,340
We's gonna get healthy enough to have our weight loss surgery." Because they're too fat to drive to another town.

155
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:05,500
yeah yeah they can't even they just bike well that's a great that's two birds one

156
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,180
stone see now you're thinking like a genius if they use the bikes from

157
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,180
Spongebob those ones just float right it doesn't they are to worry about wait

158
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:18,300
they could have gone across the ocean as in they went underwater Tron underwater

159
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:23,020
they weigh negative they could go to outer space no that's true they could go

160
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:27,140
to outer space no they wouldn't be they would just be cool I mean just there no

161
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:34,140
If you sent to 1000lb Sisters to space

162
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,140
You might be a redneck

163
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Here's your sign

164
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,140
What was the concept behind the "Here's your sign"?

165
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,140
I don't know

166
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,140
It made no sense right?

167
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
It made no sense

168
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,140
You'd just be like, sometimes you'd be cooking stuff and it's tasting weird, here's your sign

169
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,140
Yeah

170
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,140
Yeah, sometimes you leave the TV on at night

171
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
Like get her done

172
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:58,500
And you get to the Girls Gone Wild commercial and you pop a little hot one in your pants.

173
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
Here's your sign.

174
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Here's your sign made the least amount of sense.

175
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,500
It's probably why he wasn't like the most popular one.

176
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, because it's so funny that he just had like two other catchphrase comedians and he was like,

177
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
"Oh, I gotta, yeah."

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Luckily Ron White escaped that.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
They tried to put Ron White in with the catchphrase

180
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
and his catchphrase was just "They call me tater salad."

181
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,500
I forgot that he did "They call me tater salad."

182
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,140
That was his catchphrase was just they call me tater salad. It's awesome all of

183
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,580
them had to have one. He's like still I mean he's easily only one of those guys

184
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,220
who's like a very funny comedian. Yeah he's the only one who's still like

185
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,460
whole like Jeff Foxworthy was good but then he just found out that like you can

186
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,780
just do that and then lay in golden corral commercials. And smarter than a

187
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,100
fifth grader. Yeah. He makes a shit ton of money. Some of that shit on smarter than a

188
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,380
fifth grader. Hey I wasn't learning that in fifth grade. Yeah. I was learning how to

189
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,780
finger that's what they should be asking those guys they should be asking those

190
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,420
guys about over the clothes stuff yeah that's what I was doing in fifth grade

191
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,260
you I'm just bouncing my leg oh I thought we had a scratch I thought the cat was

192
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,260
scratching himself under the table yeah yes no I was just Cameron's oh but what I

193
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,780
was trying to say earlier is like okay so like the combined weight of like

194
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,140
everybody on the Challenger was probably one of those sisters or at least like

195
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,780
two of them. Two or three of them. And then if it explodes it's only one person dying.

196
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:23,220
We were watching that show and then we were just gonna say it because you were talking about

197
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,700
sending fan people to space. You replace a crew of ten people with one one thousand pound

198
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,420
sister. Because people weigh a hundred pounds. And then if the astronauts do, they feed them

199
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:40,900
freeze-dried powder. That's why when a freeze-dried powder dies you can eat a SpaceX steak. Exactly.

200
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:50,180
freeze-dried lettuces pieces she goes to space cabbage I was I was watching that

201
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:54,660
show gets out she gets a powderized salad that she's every day she comes back

202
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,020
she's one pound she's gonna make some alien pound she comes home in a box

203
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:05,620
that's right yeah she's got a she's gonna run into some some Martians that

204
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:12,880
are gonna hit her with some cosmic beams you're so fat I was watching that show

205
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,940
and that with the big bitch she's 600 pounds okay 600 pounds like five foot six

206
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,260
that's probably like all of us put together so she has so much fat that it

207
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,860
started that's all I got together oh my god Patrick she has a she has a horn

208
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,100
you know one for her forehead because she's so fat what do you mean a horn

209
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:34,380
It's like a mound on her fucking forehead.

210
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,220
It's insane.

211
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,000
So my question is--

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,620
Like a fat lump.

213
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,580
It doesn't have a point, but it has a giant--

214
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,300
You know people can grow horns, that happens.

215
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,580
Yeah, that might be her problem.

216
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,900
She might be all horn.

217
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:46,740
She might be the devil.

218
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,580
She might be horn all over her body.

219
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,420
She might have a demon living in her.

220
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,260
She might have a devil in there.

221
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,300
My question was, I was watching that and I was like,

222
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,220
if I had--

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,740
Yeah dude, if there's a 300 pound demon living in her,

224
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,180
you just have to do a ritual

225
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,980
and she's gonna be 300 pounds, dude.

226
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,480
And that's manageable 300 pounds. Yeah, I was I was looking at her. That's like

227
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,780
Kevin James. There's an incubus. There's a 300 pound incubus and a 300 pound

228
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:14,080
succubus having sex inside of her. You just have to ruin the mood and they'll leave.

229
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,580
Yeah, she's like a motel room for demons dude. That's why she weighs so much.

230
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:21,580
That might be true. A motel room for demons? She's been living in sin dude.

231
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,580
She's gluttonous, you know. She ate three pieces of cake. Demons are checking in there

232
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,580
and they're fucking with their big barbed horn penises. Whoa. And if you just put

233
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,380
What is it? You put Christian music on headphones on her baby, like she's

234
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:40,820
pregnant. Okay. Baby lump. Uh-huh. The demons fly out. True. You play some-- She looks

235
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,940
like Megan Fox. That's how they made Megan Fox. Fingers crossed. You play some

236
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,660
Lifehouse in there. Yeah. Is Lifehouse a Christian? I'm gonna show you guys a

237
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,740
picture of this woman and I have a question for you guys. Uh-huh. Hold on.

238
00:13:54,740 --> 00:14:01,860
one thousand pound sister okay a thousand pounds i thought you were just gonna like

239
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,460
i gotta show you this picture of this woman i saw on google street view yes

240
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,580
okay where's yeah this isn't a real show this is okay this is just looking out his window in queens

241
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:19,620

242
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh yeah, she's got a horn. A little bit. No, I wouldn't call it a horn.

243
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,800
She's got a lump on her. It's a lump. I wouldn't say horn.

244
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,300
That's like a... That's like a Klingon.

245
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,420
She looks like a Pokemon. Yeah.

246
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:33,340
That's like a Klingon forehead. She has a Pokemon shadow.

247
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,140
She does have a Pokemon. Outline that, who's that Pokemon.

248
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,580
[laughter]

249
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,980
Black outline, who is it?

250
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,820
Alright, my question is, this woman, you are put in, let's just say fight club with her.

251
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,860
Your mission is to kill this woman with your bare hands, punches only.

252
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,300
How many punches does it take to kill this woman?

253
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,860
I wouldn't do it because I would never hit a woman. No, you have to. You have to kill her.

254
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,860
I would never do it. She's begging you. She's saying, "Put me out of my misery."

255
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,580
For me, that's different. That's not a fight club. That's a euthanasia club.

256
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,180
Okay, you're a euthanasia club. Okay, now the rules are different. You're a euthanasia camp.

257
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:12,860
Rule number one of euthanasia club, you can talk about it all you want.

258
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,860
Rule number two, do not go in the bathroom.

259
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,100
(laughter)

260
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,840
But yeah, I mean, what, a thousand punches?

261
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,680
- I'd say one.

262
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,800
- I'd say one.

263
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,640
- You hit it in the right spot.

264
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,600
- I could do, I could get one.

265
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,540
- Okay, also, no head shots.

266
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,660
- All right, I punch.

267
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,020
- You have to do internal organ damage.

268
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,140
- Okay, listen to this, right?

269
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,580
I punch, I start from one inch away from her.

270
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:38,260
- Why would Euthanasia Club would have more than just punches?

271
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,120
- Okay, remove it from Euthanasia Club.

272
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,600
- I do the punch from Kill Bill, two.

273
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,460
The one inch punch.

274
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,580
I punch into her stomach, I pull out a hot dog, I eat it.

275
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,580
Nice.

276
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,700
She dies because she, that's the exact amount of nutrients she needed.

277
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,080
She dies of heartbreak that she didn't get to eat the hot dog.

278
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,040
My favorite part about it is like, because if you have somebody this fat on TV, they

279
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,220
can just be naked because they can never actually be naked.

280
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,460
Because all of the good stuff is hidden.

281
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,460
Yeah.

282
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:11,100
They're already wearing a walrus coat.

283
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,740
Like they just, this person can never be naked.

284
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,980
you she walks around her house in the in the fucking show completely naked really

285
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,580
and just you'll never see there's not ever gonna be a nipple don't look this

286
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:33,100
up do not look this up I will hear you staying in your house yeah we're asleep

287
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,900
on the bed you just start using the computer to find that footage yeah and

288
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,460
then you give yourself a little one-inch punch yeah come on dude yeah no but I

289
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,820
would like to be that fat I think I could be that fat I definitely couldn't you

290
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,140
could you would I do not have the will I think I know I would kill myself but I

291
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:56,660
could do it for a day I think people who get that fat people get that fat for a

292
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,780
day no one day okay one day magical I wake up you know called big and you

293
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,420
wake up it's called big it's exactly like the movie be it's called really big

294
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:11,560
but I I accidentally go to the to the Zoltar or whatever and I wish to be big

295
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,560
and I wake up and I'm like, "BURNT LIKE THIS!"

296
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:19,560
(laughter)

297
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,560
And then the whole--

298
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,560
(unintelligable)

299
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,560
"What the fuck?!"

300
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,560
"Why would you do that to me, Mr. Virginia?"

301
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,560
"I was supposed to fuck that girl! That adult girl!"

302
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,560
"I never wanted to be a girl!"

303
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,560
But you're still like 10 years old.

304
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
(laughter)

305
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,560
You're a 10 year old 700 pound kid.

306
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,560
You're 10 years old and a thousand pounds.

307
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,800
Your mom walks in instead of you being gone. She's just like who is

308
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,200
this?

309
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,800
Where's my son? Did you eat my son?

310
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:56,100
Just roll it just the whole movie is rolling down a hill like a

311
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:56,900
Katamari.

312
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,300
I'm just collecting things

313
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,560
like a Katamari. That'd be a great movie. If somebody wakes up one

314
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,700
day, super fat and then they're like just a Katamari, just grabbing

315
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:16,700
that

316
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,780
yet

317
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,880

00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,860
You got to check it when you're the prince. You got to check it at the gate.

357
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,180
Dude.

358
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,420

And when we land, you wanna go to the Cinnabon?

00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,140
You had to buy him two seats for sure on the plane.

00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,260
Yeah, it'd be funny if he was flying economy.

I'm basically a prosthetic my whole body. You can come on the plane, but

387
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,380
you're going to have to sit at the back of the plan. Do you have a charger?

388
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,740
My whole body is a wheelchair. You have to let me on first.

389
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,900
I'm a veteran.

390
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:53,260

Is he a libertarian?

434
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
Yeah I guess he is.

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,000
In his fur there's like a whole Doug Stanhope on nationalism.

like the clown wife his clown wife who like fell while they were doing coke and

443
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:35,080
when it was in a coma for like a year. She fell into, she missed the pool. And her diving board.

444
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,840
Her name is like, she fell, she fell. She was doing a clown thing. Her name is like Bobo,

445
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:43,720
right? Yeah, Bobo. She fell out of a car and she was okay until the 199 other women fell

446
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:53,480
onto her. That's all I've been tripping over and over again. 250 people are dead today

447
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,760
in a single vehicle accident on highway 95.

448
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,020
(laughing)

449
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:03,080
- Oh yeah, that'd be a better version of Final Destination.

450
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,920
- Yeah.

451
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,760
- Clown Final Destination?

452
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,400
- Yeah, just a clown goes, just fucking,

453
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,280
nobody ducks when they go over the underpass.

454
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,200
- There's so many clown things.

455
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,000
- Yeah, there is a lot of cool clown stuff.

456
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,680
- There's a lot of clown deaths you could do.

457
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,600
- Yeah, like a pie?

458
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,680
- Oh my god, a pie full of poison?

459
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,640
- A pie of poison?

460
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,480
- A pie full of peanut?

461
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,320
- A pie full of peanut?

462
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,160
- This is a poison berry pie.

463
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,240
I think that's it. I think that's all the clown deaths I can think of.

464
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,160
The clown sprays the flower, drowns.

465
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,200
The seltzer.

466
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,040
Too much water comes out of the clown's flower, it fills up the room, the clown drowns.

467
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:41,520
He starts spraying it and it's water, and then it slowly turns pink,

468
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,880
and then it turns red, and you realize he's been spraying all his blood.

469
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,360
It's just directly connected to his heart.

470
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:55,360
hit the pin too hard. Yeah, the pin, it went too deep. Yeah. Or the Selchewado that the clown sprays at you.

471
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,880
Yeah, and there's blood in that too. It gets too hot and it boils his face off.

472
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,200
Because that's how you get Selchew to have the bubbles, is you boil it.

473
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:09,280
Stilts made out of cattle prods. Human bones. Oh my god. Wait, what, this is just a

474
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,200
scary clown now. Yeah, now we're just making the perfect scary clown. He honks his horn and it's a roar.

475
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,920
a roar. The MGM line. Sorry, I didn't mean to get scary again. We've already done a scary

476
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,000
episode. We don't need to do two of them. The clown is standing, the clown is standing

477
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:30,640
like five feet away from the train on the subway platform where the door's closed and

478
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,280
his shoe gets caught in the door. Terrifying. And it drags him along. Yeah. Oh my god. Now

479
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,240
that would be scary. But it takes a really long time because he has long shoes. Yeah.

480
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,080
he goes "WHOA!" His suspenders get too long. His suspenders get too tight and chop his

481
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,640
arms off. And then he becomes Axel from Twisted Metal. They have to put him in a big clown wheel.

482
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,320
Who would you guys, if you guys could be a Twisted Metal character, what would your thing be?

483
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,240
My thing would probably be... I'd be in a really hot car. I'd have a... I'd have like a... You're

484
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,080
locked in a hot car. It's a character who's a dog who's locked in a hot car. Because they're just

485
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,960
trying to be a carrier yeah i'm not gonna hot car russell terrier yeah it's stuck

486
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,920
behind the wheel just looks so sad

487
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,880
yeah yeah special abilities that you just got a c for like two years he wins the

488
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:24,200
tournament and it is unlocked it is open the door

489
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,640
that is crack the window that's the reward and turn it into the radio on

490
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,400
Yeah, I'd be in a hot car for sure.

491
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,920
What would my power be?

492
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,920
Yeah.

493
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,960
I'd probably go in a spaceship and I would be in the Millennium Falcon.

494
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,600
I would have lasers and instantly win would be my power.

495
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,840
I think there was like a...

496
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
Is there a space one?

497
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,520
So there was like Star Wars, every Star Wars game ripped off another game at some point.

498
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,560
Like there was like Masters of Terrakasai, which was like Mortal Kombat.

499
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,920
I think there was a Star Wars Twisted Metal rip off for the PS1.

500
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
Yeah.

501
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
That's cool.

502
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:01,640
it and like you had to like it was like a harder game it was like you know twisted

503
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:05,480
metal it was like a rated T version of it. Has he ever played the Burger King

504
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:10,240
ripoff games? Oh like sneak king? Sneak King yeah and King Racing or whatever.

505
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,360
Five cents now. Yeah I got him I got all three of them when I was a kid yeah it's

506
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,720
probably the only time I ever went to Burger King and they terrified me. Yeah

507
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,640
sneak King is about your you walk around a construction site handing hamburgers

508
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,120
to people so in a way that they don't notice. Yeah. Only level is the

509
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:32,160
construction site. Yeah, it was like a $5 game. It came with your burgers. If you got

510
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:37,840
enough burgies they gave you a free game. My cousins had like every console

511
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,640
growing up. A hamburger is already game enough for me though. That's true. The only game I ever saw my cousins.

512
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I play that shit like an instrument when I'm eating it. That's right. You should see this guy on the hamburgers.

513
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,800
Oh my god he plays it like, it's beautiful. It's about the

514
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,640
bites he doesn't take yeah yeah my cousins had every console growing up

515
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,100
near the Xbox but I never saw them play the original Xbox except for the time

516
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:04,540
that I saw them play sneak King they were too afraid of the X on it they thought

517
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:09,760
it meant death logo opens up and it's all green and shit yeah damn they had

518
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,040
dreamcast dude and they fucking never they never played that fuck there's a

519
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,060
drink cast right now hey this cast is my dream I love you guys we're walking

520
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:26,700
around Manchester and we went to a hero place and the logo is just a Pizzagate

521
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,940
spiral and they just have it everywhere. They just have a bunch of

522
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,980
pictures of hats. Did you get a picture? I didn't take a picture. Oh god, we got to go back then.

523
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,660
Just like a hat. Euro world. Eurospot. It's literally, it's like

524
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,100
it's like the square spiral that's like the Nambla spiral and it's

525
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,540
literally just have it like. Is it exactly the Nambla spiral? The Nambla one is a triangle

526
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,580
but I think that the Pizzagate people say,

527
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,180
"Oh, there's another one that's a square."

528
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:52,380
- That's so funny.

529
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,700
- It's, yeah, no, it's like, it's very,

530
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,900
'cause like a normal restaurant doesn't even,

531
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,540
they don't put their logo everywhere.

532
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,380
Like that's not, you just put it on the outside

533
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,420
and maybe like on the menu, but this place had it,

534
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,020
it's like all, they had it like carved

535
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,620
into the wall and shit, dude.

536
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,900
- Well, I mean, we have no choice.

537
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,260
We're gonna walk in tomorrow,

538
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,380
we're gonna blast the place, okay?

539
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,340
- Well, okay.

540
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,180
- We're gonna put them on blast.

541
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:18,020
Let me get one more euro, they're pretty good there.

542
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,620
Okay, and then we're gonna go...

543
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,620
And I guess we gotta find out what's going on in the basement.

544
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Yeah, have you guys seen Rampage, that movie?

545
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:24,120
Yeah.

546
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,340
I'm gonna go Rampage.

547
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,720
Have you seen... oh, what was it?

548
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,220
We were talking about it on stream the other day, but the...

549
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,180
the Uwe Boll movie called Attack on Wall Street,

550
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:32,680
where it's just a movie...

551
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,260
Uwe Boll, he did Rampage too.

552
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,780
He did Rampage? Okay.

553
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:37,260
He did, I think he did two of them.

554
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
And it's just, the entire movie is like,

555
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:42,500
gamer so mad that he just starts killing people on the streets.

556
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,300
No, I just remembered, I just remembered I saw Rampage,

557
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,700
because he gets away with it at the end.

558
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,220
He kills his friend during the paintball game.

559
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,060
- I remember that.

560
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:50,880
- Is it like falling down?

561
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:51,720
- I saw that at a sleepover.

562
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,600
- I don't know what that is.

563
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,780
- You don't know falling down?

564
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,620
- No.

565
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,460
- It's not like falling down.

566
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,280
- It's not like falling down.

567
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,120
- No, because he gets away.

568
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,960
- Oh, okay.

569
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,140
- Falling Down is also a movie about a mass shooter.

570
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:00,980
- Yeah.

571
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,120
- About a guy who gets stuck in traffic

572
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,220
and he gets pissed off and kills everybody.

573
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,020
- It's more than that, but Joel shoots him off.

574
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,300
- That's a funny snap moment.

575
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,380
- He blows up a construction site with a bazooka.

576
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,540
It's a really good movie.

577
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,380
- How do you get a bazooka?

578
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:20,620
He goes to a like a army memorabilia shop and the guy is like, "Oh, I can tell you're a

579
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,620
Nazi like me.

580
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,180
I'm going to show you some cool stuff in the back."

581
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,180
God.

582
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,180
And shows him a bazooka.

583
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,420
Did you guys know, didn't Uwe Boll like-

584
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
He fought Lotex.

585
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,820
Yeah, he boxed Lotex, right?

586
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,140
And he beat his ass.

587
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,740
Oh yeah, he kicked the shit out of him.

588
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
It's so funny.

589
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,860
And everything has gone downhill for Lotex since.

590
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,980
Lotex is not doing well, dude.

591
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,340
There was like a thing Lotak spent like $80 on two pies.

592
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
What?

593
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,220
Yeah, I just remember seeing that.

594
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,340
It makes no sense what you just said.

595
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,140
He spent $80 on two pies.

596
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
I'll have to ask.

597
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,140
They were confused.

598
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,140
They were golden pie.

599
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,140
No, it was like a mail order service.

600
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,140
It was a really good deal.

601
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:56,180
Mail order food service and he spent like $80 on two pies.

602
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:59,460
Oh, did he get like, did people try to like audit his Patreon or whatever?

603
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,460
I don't know.

604
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,180
That would be so embarrassing if people did that to us.

605
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,660
They're like, "We demand accountability."

606
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,740
And they just see me buying like skins for my guns on Valorant.

607
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,740
Yeah.

608
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
Yeah.

609
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,260
- I had to make my gun look Chinese.

610
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,420
I put the cool Chinese skin on it.

611
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,260
Is that so wrong?

612
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,940
- Cameron buying Blu-rays and then me buying groceries.

613
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,700
- Yeah, like a pussy.

614
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,540
- Yeah, like a pussy.

615
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,100
I've not spent any of my Patreon money on anything cool.

616
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:21,940
- No.

617
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:22,780
- Yeah.

618
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,600
- But you had the computer.

619
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,440
- Yeah, that's true.

620
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,620
- Yeah, that's all I've spent my Patreon money on

621
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,940
is computer and Blu-rays.

622
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,780
- Yeah.

623
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,600
- We should just brag for a little bit

624
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,440
of how much money we have.

625
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,620
- We have a million dollars.

626
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,460
- I love having money.

627
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,300
- I love having one million dollars.

628
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,940
- Oh my God.

629
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,300
Oh my God, it feels good.

630
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,260
- It's awesome.

631
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,780
- Now we're gonna open up a restaurant though.

632
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,120
- We're gonna take down Eurospot.

633
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,240
- It's called Patrick's Breast.

634
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,740
- We're gonna take down Eurospot,

635
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,320
'cause they have the pedophile logo,

636
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,740
then we're gonna open up a shop in there.

637
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,820
- Then we're gonna open a farm,

638
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,220
and I'm gonna mill Patrick.

639
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:51,060
- It's gonna be called That Eurospot,

640
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,600
and we're gonna just change the logo.

641
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,440
- Yeah. - Yeah.

642
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,280
- Uh-huh.

643
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,280
- We're gonna change the logo to--

644
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,620
- It'll be like, kinda like an X, I guess,

645
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,200
but then with edges, like little extra lines at the end.

646
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
You know, maybe sideways.

647
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,120
- Yeah.

648
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,960
- No.

649
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,800
- What?

650
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,620
(laughing)

651
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,460
- Hold up.

652
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:09,460
You're gonna say it was like Malcolm X.

653
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,460
We'll do Malcolm in the Middle.

654
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,460
We'll do Malcolm in the Middle.

655
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,460
We'll do a Malcolm in the Middle themed restaurant

656
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,460
like that Breaking Bad themed restaurant in LA.

657
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,460
There's another one there that's like

658
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,460
the kids in all the...

659
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,460
We're gonna close the

660
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,460
pedophile hero place, okay?

661
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,460
And we're gonna open up

662
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,460
our new hero place that's called

663
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,460
Nice Awesome

664
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,460
Munchies Best

665
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,460
Lovely Awesome.

666
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,380
Okay, we're gonna put, it's gonna be an acronym, we're gonna put it on the front and we're gonna

667
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,860
get rid of the pedophile logo and we're just gonna, we're gonna...

668
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,860
Straight and narrow.

669
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,860
Yeah.

670
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,860
Yeah.

671
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,180
We might just make the pedophile, the Euro spot look...

672
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,180
Pedophile hero, what's that, an oxymoron?

673
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:54,460
Maybe just make it sharper, a little more triangular.

674
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:59,580
I think we're gonna have True Detective playing on the TVs in there.

675
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,100
And we're gonna boo when they win at the end.

676
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Yeah.

677
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
I think that's what we're gonna do.

678
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Yeah.

679
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
I love the first season of True Detective.

680
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,100
I think we're gonna put the

681
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,100
I think we're gonna put the behind the scenes

682
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,100
of Eyes Wide Shut where they say it's all true

683
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,100
and it was a documentary.

684
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,100
I think we're gonna have that playing in our restaurant.

685
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:21,100
What I love about True Detective is how

686
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,100
dark Matthew McConaughey is.

687
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
He's so good in it too.

688
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,100
I gotta re-watch it.

689
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,100
I watched the last episode of it

690
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,100
and that's it.

691
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Yeah, I was like, "That's all I need to know."

692
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,100
[laughter]

693
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,100
I watched it with my brother when it aired.

694
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
When did that come out?

695
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,100
That was a while ago, right?

696
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,100
That was in '14, maybe?

697
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100

Life is a fight.

704
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,100
Life is like a box of chocolates.

705
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
How about this? What about this?

706
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,100

was that straight was his name straight edge Phil it was SXE Phil yeah it wasn't

716
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,400
straight edge Phil but people used to call him sexy Phil but I didn't know

717
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,720
cuz I've seen a sexy for straight edge I mean yeah I don't think he was straight

718
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,420
edge he looks like he would have been you look into those dead eyes straight

719
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:54,760
Straight edge did. Those are eyes that you can only get by like destroying your

720
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:59,140
nerves. When I was 11 my brother, I think I've said this before, my brother who was I

721
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:03,660
guess 17 at the time, I was really close to getting a straight edge

722
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:08,940
vegan tattoo. Yeah. I was 11 years old. That would have been sick. It would honestly be so cool. If I had known what

723
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,820
straight edge, well I was straight edge but I didn't know what straight edge was so I

724
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,620
didn't call myself straight edge but I was for most of high school. For me it was just the sex thing

725
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:20,180
was a big problem. I had a friend who was straight edge and then he turned 21 when

726
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,340
I turned like 17 and then he was like well now that I'm 21 I should probably

727
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,620
just drink beer right? Respect. Yeah you should drink beer. Yeah why not man. And then he used to

728
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:35,860
buy me beer when I was 17. Dude. Uh-huh. Nice. Josh tells me stories about he every time he

729
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,180
comes home and visits Wilmington my older brother just like we drive by this

730
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,020
one convenience store and he just always tells me the same anecdote of it he's

731
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:49,780
like yeah they sold me beer when I was 13. He just used to go in there, he's 13 wearing a

732
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:55,020
Volcom shirt, just like I'll have the Bud Light please. Give me all the 40s. Yeah

733
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,540
give me every 40 you got. I got four nickels. Yep. Yeah that's sick dude. Yeah I

734
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,620
know. I don't think that, I don't think you find those as much anymore. You need to,

735
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:10,380
you need to, we need to normalize selling beer to children. I agree. Yeah.

736
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:16,060
normalize selling beer to children they're thirsty - you know kids get

737
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:19,460
thirsty what are they supposed to do when they're hanging out with their friends

738
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,180
and talking it's so important rather than get it from someone that they know yeah

739
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:31,780
like did you guys have parents have bought you beer in high school my dad oh

740
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:39,420
I said I was rich oh yeah I my brother during finals week in my junior year my

747
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:21,260
couple beers. I remember being 16, I remember being 16 and like having beer like in my house for the

like the sickest shit ever. Beer and freaking ball dude oh my god. But I just

750
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:36,020
remember he drank a couple of the Yinglings while watching Willow and then

751
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,460
my dad found out and then he opened all of them in front of us and poured them all

752
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,700
down the sink like in front of us he's like that's what happens when you drink

753
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:48,140
my beer I pour all of them out you don't get the rest and he we know he poured

754
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,220

00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:04,020
out I went to the fridge and grabbed one whoa I was just trying to fuck with him

757
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:06,260
and then he just grabbed it out of my hand and poured it out.

758
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,560
But yeah, I think when I was 16,

759
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,860
that's when my parents started buying me beer.

760
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,700
Yeah.

761
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,520
Yeah, they were like--

762
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,360
My mom bought me cigarettes.

763
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,200
I want my kid to be awesome.

764
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,440
I don't know if I should say that,

765
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,320
but my mom bought me cigarettes when I was 17.

766
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,320
I was never, my parents,

767
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,820
it was like this huge conspiracy I unearthed

768
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,580
once I was like 20,

769
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,620
when I found out that every older person in my family

770
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,300
smoked cigarettes until I was like 10.

771
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,620
Like my both my grandparents both my parents everybody smoked cigarettes

772
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:41,580
Yeah, until I was like 10 years old and they were like cigarettes are evil never smoke cigarettes

773
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:48,920
And I listen man. I smoke my mom's cigarette. I was so afraid of cigarettes until like two years ago. Yeah

774
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:53,700
Yeah, I smoke cigarettes. They're better. They don't kill you. They make you are so cool

775
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,880
They make you strong get addicted to nicotine and you need to have it or you shake. It's awesome

776
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,240
You're shaking because the power is like going through your veins.

777
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,440
You're losing power.

778
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:03,940
Yeah.

779
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,660
And that's why you're shaking.

780
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:05,160
Yeah.

781
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:08,240
Nicotine just makes me way better at video games.

782
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:08,740
Mm-hmm.

783
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,240
Yeah.

784
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:09,740
Yeah.

785
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,480
That's what it's for.

786
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:17,600
My mom found out that I smoke cigarettes because she went to Jamaica and...

787
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,560
She went to Jamaica and my sister...

788
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
Yeah, they smoke a different kind of cigarette.

789
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,060
They smoke a lighter cigarette.

790
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:28,060
[Garbled]

791
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,320
(laughing)

792
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,000
(garbled speech)

793
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,740
- My mom found out that I smoke cigarettes

794
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,780
because she went to Jamaica

795
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,680
and then my sister took a video of me.

796
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,120
I lit a cigarette, I took an aerosol spray

797
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:47,020
and lit a cigarette with a lighter and started smoking it.

798
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,140
And I guess she posted it on her Snapchat

799
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,940
and someone sent it to my mom.

800
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,260
- Whoa, snitch.

801
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,100
- Yeah.

802
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,020
- Snitch on the snap.

803
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,140
- Yep, snitch.

804
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,100
- Can you imagine, she was fucking,

805
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:02,100
She was on a Jamaican cruise, getting cornrows, doing fucking dabs.

806
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Getting spit roasted by two hot big Jamaican guys.

807
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,100
You know?

808
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,100
And she gets a Snapchat notification.

809
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,100
Yeah, he was filming it.

810
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,100
He's Jamaican.

811
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,100
He's watching.

812
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,100
My dad is Jamaican.

813
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,100
Yeah, he's in the corner, jacking off.

814
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,100
She just gets a Snapchat notification.

815
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
Her life is ruined forever.

816
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,100
Yeah.

817
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Well, she went there with a...

818
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,100
She tears out the cornrows.

819
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,100
She said, "This is seriously harshing my vibe."

820
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,100
She screams.

821
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,100

I was only concerned with skateboarding.

856
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,020

00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:39,420
There's a video, it's called Trailer Park Low.

883
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,140
And it's a fight at a skate park.

884
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:46,740
It's like some girls come up and then someone's filming and then there's a girl and she's like,

885
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,740
"What's up?

886
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,740
Trailer Park low!"

887
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:52,100
And then it's a whole skate park fight.

888
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:53,660
It's like the whole park fight.

889
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:54,660
It's amazing.

890
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:55,660
That one.

00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,660
That's a battle.

892
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,660
That's not a fight.

893
00:45:57,660 --> 00:45:58,660
And then...

894
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,660
That's the battle of...

895
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,660
Have you seen that?

918
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:42,280

919
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:48,200
just goes up and goes like no way he or no he goes like and he like kisses the

920
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,260
back of his hand and just like knocks a dude out with a backhand - it's like in

921
00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,200
like a pizza can is powerful yeah people underestimate the backhand is so

922
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:59,360
Because you get some fucking, there's some knuckling.

923
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:02,360
If you hit just like the jaw or the back end, you can knock someone out.

924
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,640
Yeah, because think about, I mean it's like, you know, if you swing a giant piece of wood,

925
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,040
the end of that piece of wood's going pretty damn fast.

926
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,320
There's another really good one where there's like one guy who's against like three or four

927
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:15,040
guys and they're all coming at him and he just fucking tanks their punches and a guy

928
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:19,320
hits him with a baseball bat and he like doesn't flinch, he just grabs the baseball bat out

929
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,680
of the guy's hand and then chases the other guy with it.

930
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,680
One's so sick, dude.

931
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,120
Oh, have you seen the Mike Villelli?

932
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,080
The Mike V, the pro skater?

933
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,080
No.

934
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:28,080
Oh wait, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

935
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,080
The one from CKY4?

936
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,080
Yeah, of course.

937
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,080
Where he fights four people or whatever?

938
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,080
Yeah, I think that's CKY3.

939
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,080
It's either CKY3 or 4.

940
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:34,840
That dude rocks.

941
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,840
He rocked.

942
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,840
Is he dead?

943
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,920
No, he, uh, I don't know what's up with him now.

944
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,440
But he doesn't rock anymore?

945
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,440
No.

946
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,440
There's a lot of videos of him.

947
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,440
He did amateur hockey.

948
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:45,440
Now he rolls, dude.

949
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,440
Makes sense.

950
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,080
He did amateur hockey and he got, there's so many videos.

951
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:50,840
There's a video of him, like, breaking an ankle in a fight.

952
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
That's cool.

953
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:52,840
That's awesome.

954
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,840
That's still cool.

955
00:48:53,840 --> 00:48:54,840
Yeah, but he got his ass kicked.

956
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,840
I don't care.

957
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,040
perfect track record and then I saw that one video of him and I was just like,

958
00:48:59,040 --> 00:48:59,840
"Ah, come on, man."

959
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:01,340
Dude, you're a fake fan.

960
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:01,840
I'm not a fake fan.

961
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,840
You're a fair weather fan.

962
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,340
Uh-uh.

963
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:03,840
Yeah.

964
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,340
No, I respect...

965
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,840
I thought you were going to say he was dead or he...

966
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,840
I respect his skateboarding.

967
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,640
I respect what he did for skateboarding.

968
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:09,640
It just...

969
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:10,840
But the fighting game.

970
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,340
The fighting? His fighting stance... His fighting stuff?

971
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:14,340
His fighting stance.

972
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,840
His fighting stance is kind of not good.

973
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:17,340
Yeah, he needs to move his shoulders in.

974
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,640
If it wasn't for Mike V, we wouldn't have...

975
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,540
There wouldn't be two sides to a skateboard.

976
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,440
It would still be flat.

977
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:22,940
Yeah.

978
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:24,140
It would be like a piece of paper.

979
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:25,140
Yeah.

980
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:25,980
- It would just be one.

981
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,820
- It would be one circle.

982
00:49:26,820 --> 00:49:27,640
- One dimension.

983
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,480
- It would be a circle.

984
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,300
- If it wasn't for Mike V,

985
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,900
a skateboard would just be a box still.

986
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:32,220
It'd just be a cardboard box.

987
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:33,060
- It would.

988
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,580
He was the first guy to open up the box.

989
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,140
- Yeah, he's a genius.

990
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:37,980
- He was the guy.

991
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:39,740
- Hey guys, there's a skateboard inside here.

992
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,660
- You guys, there's a whole skateboard in here.

993
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,380
- For some reason, I don't know why,

994
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,100
but I thought that skateboarding was like 150 years old.

995
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,140
And so when I found out.

996
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,300
(laughing)

997
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:52,460
So when I found out that it was invented in like the 80s,

998
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,300
it blew my mind.

999
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,260
- It was invented in the 50s.

1000
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,760
No, but like, you know, skateboarding in pools or whatever.

1001
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,760
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1002
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,760
Like the Lords of Dogtown.

1003
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,760
That's '70s.

1004
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,760
Yeah, that blew my mind.

1005
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,020
That's like late '70s, early '80s, late '70s.

1006
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,900
I was like, the man who invented the skateboard, probably Thomas Edison, is dead now.

1007
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:07,900
Yeah.

1008
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:08,900
Yeah, there's no way.

1009
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,460
I mean, they had skateboards back then, but it was just like...

1010
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,460
But they called them horses.

1011
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,460
Yeah.

1012
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:14,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1013
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,260
They used to try and do tricks with horses.

1014
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,260
Yeah.

1015
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,300
Oh, you try to do a backside flip on a horse?

1016
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,900
Nah, they used to do a horse air.

1017
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,340
they had skateboards back then but it was just they would just use it as like a

1184
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,680
And he's just like, "He's a bunch of crap."

1185
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,360
"Yeah, I don't believe any of this stuff."

1186
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,880
"Yeah, I'm shitting my pants."

1187
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,880
"Yeah, actually, I don't believe this stuff."

1188
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:02,560
Yeah.

1189
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,280
"I don't actually believe this. Can you- who- who are the guys?"

1190
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:05,780
"Yeah."

1191
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,280
"Who are the guys that did Creation?"

1192
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,680
"Yeah, who are the guys?"

1193
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,080
"Noah, Abraham."

1194
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:14,080
"Look, I'll tell them maybe if they understood Zappa."

1195
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,480
"Yeah, but they don't."

1196
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,480
"But I fucked his daughter."

1197
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:17,480
"I don't understand Zappa."

1198
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,720
I understand him because I've had sex with his daughter.

1199
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:23,800
I had sex with his daughter, but I still don't get Zappa.

1200
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,800
It is funny.

1201
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,960
He'd be such a fan of a musician.

1202
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,240
No, he had a whole thing in--

1203
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,200

Oh, no, no, it was Captain Beefheart.

1205
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:34,520
No, he loves Zappa.

1206
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,800
He's like, I can't get into Beefheart, man.

01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,260
just imagine me and Cam.

1321
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,980
Me plugged into him like a nightmare.

1322
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,300
- I mean, yeah, no, I can snuggle with Caleb, that's fine.

1323
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:20,140
I've done it before.

1324
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,020
- I'm telling you about the air mattress

1325
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:24,420
because I feel like Caleb will have a power trip

1326
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,820
about sleeping on the air mattress.

1327
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:27,660
- I would sleep on the air mattress.

1328
01:03:27,660 --> 01:03:28,500
- We could pair a power trip.

1329
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,060
- Caleb would, when I'm blowing,

1330
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,580
the whole time I'm blowing up the air mattress,

1331
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,420
Caleb would be like,

1332
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,780
oh yeah, I'm gonna love sleeping on this.

1333
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,620
- I'm not sarcastic.

1334
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,080
- Oh, I'm gonna love this.

1335
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,080
I'm gonna love sleeping on the air mattress.

1336
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:42,080
If you insinuate I'm sarcastic one more time,

1337
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:44,080
I'm gonna fight club you again.

1338
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,080
In your own home.

1339
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,080
You can't fight club me in here.

1340
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:50,080
I'm extending the boundaries of fight club.

1341
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:52,080
We have too many plants and glasses around.

1342
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:54,080
You have no security cameras and you can never prove it.

1343
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,080
I think we're gonna take a walk after this.

1344
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,080
Yeah, we're gonna take a walk in the courtyard.

1345
01:03:58,080 --> 01:04:00,080
I think we're gonna go hang out outside.

1346
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:02,080
Yeah, there's like this area of town that's all graffiti and barbed wire.

1347
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:04,080
And we were thinking of going and hanging out there.

1348
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,080
There's kind of like a, there's like this kind of like, this circle.

1349
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:10,480
the circle and white chalk on the ground and there's kind of like these red

1350
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,240
kind of polka dots around it yeah and really accent the mood. I have a really

1351
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:18,320
funny belt for you to wear. We have outfits. We have very funny diapers that we're gonna play in.

1352
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:24,320
It's not gonna happen. Why? It's called a costume walk.

1353
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:29,080
Have you not heard of this? Exactly. It's because it's a southern thing. Yeah yeah

1354
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:32,760
as in south of New Hampshire like Boston and North Carolina like that's what we

1355
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:36,460
understand that you don't yeah why don't you want to fight me also you have to

1356
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,020
wear you have to wear a blind why won't you fight me you would win no I wouldn't

1357
01:04:40,020 --> 01:04:44,400
you would know there's no winners you have momentum on your side Pat he's

1358
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:48,360

1359
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:53,880

1367
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,120
- Bready Pepsi-tone.

1368
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:47,960
- Bready Pepsi-tone.

1369
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:48,780
(laughing)

1370
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,040
- Yeah, he's way fatter than you.

1371
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:51,880
- Yeah, he's so much fatter than me.

1372
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:53,560
- Dude, you're bready Pepsi-tone.

1373
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,800
(laughing)

1374
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,040
- Oh, fuck.

1375
01:05:59,040 --> 01:05:59,880
- That's right.

1376
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,400
- No, but I will fight you and I'll defeat you.

1377
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:02,240
- You will not defeat me.

1378
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,840
- No, I'm gonna do a spitting kick.

1379
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,680
- You won't.

1380
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,280
- I'm gonna challenge you.

1381
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,360
Who do you think could last longer in a mechanical bull?

1382
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:09,200
- Bready peppercorn.

1383
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:10,240
- Oh, you.

1384
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,080
- Bready peppercorn.

1385
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:11,900
- Peppercorn.

1386
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:14,720
- Not even like, not even like fattening.

1387
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:15,560
- Yeah, yeah.

1388
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:24,800
Eddie Pepperoni. No, Mechanical Bull. How long? I could probably, I would probably last

1389
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:29,720
longer than you but by like a second. I would rip out its brain. Yeah. I would

1390
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:35,680
last like a year on there. I would last like a year on there if it was turned off.

1391
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:41,800
Yeah. True. Yeah. You would die because of food starvation. They bring me food.

1392
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,960
- Who? - My elves.

1393
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:45,080
- The other bulls? - Your elves?

1394
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:46,640
- My elves. (laughs)

1395
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:47,880
- Okay, Santa. - You think a bull would--

1396
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:49,520
- Okay, Santa. (laughs)

1397
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,040
- You think a bull would be freaking offended

1398
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,400
by a mechanical bull?

1399
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,720
- Yeah. - Yeah, they're taking

1400
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,880
our freaking jobs.

1401
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,400
- Yep, mechanical bulls.

1402
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,200
- Mechanical bulls are taking the bulls' jobs.

1403
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,560
- There was a mechanical-- - Why don't you do some jokes

1404
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,640
about that now, Caleb?

1405
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:02,480
Do it like a funny voice and stuff.

1406
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,400
- Oh, yeah, hey, I'm a mechanical bull.

1407
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,320
- I'm stuck on the water.

1408
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,000
- I'm a mechanical bull on the water.

1409
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:11,720
Somebody call the mechanical police.

1410
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:13,720
There was a mechanical bull at the farm.

1411
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:15,720
There actually was a mechanical bull who drowned.

1412
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,720
So we had to do a really quick land acknowledgement.

1413
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:21,720
Because he drowned in Manchester, New Hampshire.

1414
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:25,720
Before you ride the mechanical bull you have to do an acknowledgement.

1415
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,720
This mechanical bull was stolen from the Native Americans.

1416
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:31,720
They invented it before us.

1417
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:33,720
And we took it.

1418
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:35,720
That was a trial.

1419
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:39,720
Every time I would jerk off in my parents' bed I would do a land acknowledgement.

1420
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,080
I acknowledge that my parents have had sex in this bed,

1421
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,480
and it's giving me a boner right now.

1422
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:46,520
- That was the weirdest thing.

1423
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,420
Like, there was, like,

1424
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:51,600
oh, my cousin told me this.

1425
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:53,360
My cousin knew, like, a kid--

1426
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,980
- You know that Pat's story's gonna be good

1427
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:56,760
when he says, "My cousin told me this."

1428
01:07:56,760 --> 01:08:00,520
- My cousin told me that a friend of his in middle school

1429
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:05,840
broke his pube bone having sex in his mom's bed.

1430
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:08,360
- Wow, dude, the smash god.

1431
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:10,440
- The chosen one.

1432
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:11,440
We found the chosen one.

1433
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,520
- He broke his pube bone in his mom's bed

1434
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:14,660
but didn't want to say anything

1435
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:16,480
and then he had to eventually admit it.

1436
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,040
- With his mom.

1437
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:19,400
- Yeah.

1438
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,720
- Mom, you broke my pube bone.

1439
01:08:21,720 --> 01:08:23,840
- Sorry son, I'm sorry.

1440
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:25,560
- You knew what you were getting into.

1441
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,480
Your mom.

1442
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,320
- Oh, come on Caleb, what's that about?

1443
01:08:30,320 --> 01:08:31,560
- We gotta do another thing.

1444
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,400
- Are you doing it?

1445
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,240
- We can't end it episode.

1446
01:08:33,240 --> 01:08:34,520
- Nah, come on, nah, fuck.

1447
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,440
- You're doing a Jim Gaffigan thing now?

1448
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:38,440
Caleb

1449
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:57,800
Yeah, so I ate a whole hamburger tonight did he just say that I have a gun in my

1450
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:03,540
*laughter*

1451
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:05,940
I 3D printed it in my house.

1452
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,340
It's only got one bullet so I better not miss.

1453
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:11,340
It's plastic so the metal detector didn't find it.

1454
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:13,340
*laughter*

1455
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:15,340
I just hid the bullet in my belt.

1456
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,340
*laughter*

1457
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:20,840
I hope he doesn't notice me standing up right now.

1458
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,840
Oh, it's just one shot.

1459
01:09:23,840 --> 01:09:25,840
I have one shot at this.

1460
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:27,760
- And that's why I love cake.

1461
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,200
- Hot pocket.

1462
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,600
(laughing)

1463
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,800
Hot bullet.

1464
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:36,240
- Okay, we can end on that one.

1465
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:37,080
That's a good one.

1466
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:37,900
- That's a good one.

1467
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,200
- All right, thank you.

1468
01:09:39,200 --> 01:09:40,440
- Bye. - Thanks, guys.
