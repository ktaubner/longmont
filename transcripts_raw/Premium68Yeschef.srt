00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:07,420
- [Woman] Podcasts for the heartless.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,140
- You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:12,800
(laughing)

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,120
- Holy cord.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,440
All right, I'm gonna pick up my camera now.

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,280
- Okay, pick up your camera.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,120
- I'm just wearing a normal shirt.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,520
- You're definitely not wearing anything weird, right?

10
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,160
- I've decided to become a chef.

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,420
(laughing)

12
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,660
(laughter)

13
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:35,060
- It's for, nobody can fucking see this show.

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:38,500
- This one, I'll post the video of the first 10 seconds

15
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,500
of this episode.

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,500
- I have recently discovered my love for cooking

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,900
and the culinary arts.

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,740
- Do you have the hat?

19
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,560
Do you have the hat?

20
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,400
- Can you just say yes, chef?

21
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,660
No, they didn't have the hat at the store.

22
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,500
- What store?

23
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,140
- You went and bought a chef outfit,

24
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,140
but not a webcam?

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,720
- Yeah, what the fuck?

26
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,560
(laughing)

27
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,580
- It was on sale. - You were just saying

28
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,420
you were too broke to buy a webcam.

29
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,100
- It was on sale.

30
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,660
Fucking a webcam's on sale at Walmart right now.

31
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,740
I was there earlier.

32
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,580
- I don't live near a Walmart.

33
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,340
I do live near a Chef Supply Store.

34
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,920
(laughing)

35
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,360
Can you guys just say yes, Chef, please?

36
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,200
- No.

37
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,120
- And confirm that you're hearing me?

38
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,660
I won't know if you guys-- - No, Chef.

39
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,500
- Can hear me.

40
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,320
What the hell?

41
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,420
I'm not used to that.

42
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,340
(laughing)

43
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,180
But yeah, I'm basically gonna get into making recipes and--

44
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,180
- Hey Charlie, you're probably embarrassed

45
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,540
I got the perfect read on you,

46
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,780
that you didn't pick your camera up

47
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,140
'cause you were wearing a crazy outfit.

48
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,980
I knew that, dude.

49
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,900
- No, I'm not embarrassed.

50
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,060
- Hey Caleb, hey Caleb. - The chef has to be

51
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,140
strong and confident.

52
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,500
What? - Caleb, you're 86ed.

53
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,340
- What is, you actually, I'm actually the chef

54
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:45,140
and you're not wearing any sort of chef outfit.

55
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,140
- You're 86ed. - No, no, I'm not.

56
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,460
- Hey Caleb. - Uh-huh?

57
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,300
- You're food taste-- - Sorry, are you guys

58
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,460
on the line right now? - Hey Caleb, you're food--

59
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,300
- I can't tell.

60
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,140
- Your food tastes terrible. - I am on the line

61
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,860
and I'm telling you. - Your food tastes terrible.

62
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,220
- I'm telling you that you're 86ed.

63
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,060
- My food tastes terrible?

64
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,400
- I'm the head chef now.

65
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,980
- Well, I'm gonna flip your plate over

66
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,300
and say, "Get out of my restaurant!"

67
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,180
- Dude, it's not your restaurant.

68
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,660
- I'm the head chef. - I'm the head chef.

69
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,500
- I'm head chef.

70
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,300
- You don't even have a chef shirt.

71
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,140
- I'm dressed up like the chefs

72
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,300
at the restaurant I worked at.

73
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,620
- That's not a real restaurant.

74
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,940
- It was a real restaurant.

75
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,100
- I am designing a new-- - You never worked

76
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,300
in a restaurant. - I'm designing a new,

77
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:19,780
I worked at Jersey Mike's for three days

78
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,400
and I got fired because my hands were too sweaty.

79
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,240
You know that.

80
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,800
- That's true, I do know that.

81
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,780
- You do know that.

82
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,160
- That doesn't count though.

83
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,000
- That's a restaurant.

84
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,840
I have experience.

85
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
- I never worked the line either.

86
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,880
I only worked front of house.

87
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,440
- That's not a restaurant.

88
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:36,960
- If it's the person in line makes the sandwich,

89
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,520
since you're instructing them what's going on the sandwich,

90
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,640
there's no, it's not chef.

91
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,680
You're not a chef.

92
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,500
- Right, right.

93
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,000
- You might as well be a factory machine.

94
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,560
- At Subway and Jersey Mike's,

95
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,000
you're the chef when you walk in.

96
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,840
- Exactly.

97
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
- I design the menu.

98
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,880
It's not a restaurant, it's a factory.

99
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,840
- I have designed a new duck dish.

100
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,320
(laughing)

101
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,360
- What's it called?

102
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,960
- It's called Duck Caleb.

103
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,620
Or Caleb's Duck in French.

104
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,880
(laughing)

105
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,020
- You're not the chef.

106
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,760
- Look at me in my eyes.

107
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,320
- Stand up, stand up.

108
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,880
- Yeah, what pants are you wearing?

109
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,720
You wearing jeans or something?

110
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,880
- I'm wearing sweatpants.

111
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,720
- Okay, yeah, you're not a chef.

112
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,280
- These are actually black chef pants.

113
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,480
Are they chef pants?

114
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,320
- Yep.

115
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,160
- Chef pants.

116
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,840
I'm gonna Google chef pants right now.

117
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,680
- You're about to see a picture of me.

118
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,280
- Chef pants are a thing.

119
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
- Chef pants. - They are a thing.

120
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,200
- Let's see here.

121
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,800
- But basically I'm a chef and I was kinda hoping

122
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,640
that you guys-- - Okay, these are a thing

123
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,640
but they don't look like what Caleb's wearing.

124
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,040
- Well, I'm not gonna show you again.

125
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,560
You got a quick glance but that's all you're gonna get.

126
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
- I know that these are not what you're wearing.

127
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,280
- In the culinary arts, we call that a taste.

128
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,000
- Why are you saying culinary?

129
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,160
- 'Cause it's culinary.

130
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,320
- I'm Googling right now. - It's not.

131
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,560
- What does a chef wear on the bottom?

132
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,200
It's not culinary! Stop saying it like that!

133
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,480
First off, all chefs go commando, and then on top of that you have a very heavy, dicky

134
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
style pant.

135
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,580
Okay, so I googled what does a chef wear on the bottom, and what Google thought I was

136
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,440
asking is what do the folds in a chef's hat represent?

137
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Oh, okay.

138
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,680
I can tell you that.

139
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,760
Yeah, tell me what they represent.

140
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,560
The 50 states.

141
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,440
What about chefs in like France and stuff?

142
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,720
50 states of France. Isn't that a rule for countries that have 50 states? Is that how

143
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,360
you get to countries? It's provinces because they're Canadian in France.

144
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,920
You are making no sense and this is why I'm kicking you out of culinary school.

145
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,720
No, no, I'm staying in culinary school. You actually, your application has been denied

146
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,800
and you will never be a chef in this town. I'll be a chef before you are. This is what

147
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,000
the folds in a chef's hat represent, okay? Listen to this, listen to this. Like hat height

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,340
Tradition dictated the more pleats featured in a chef's hat the higher their experience level

149
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,760
It was said that if a chef had 100 pleats in their hat that represented the number of ways they knew how to prepare eggs

150
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,240
That's basically me. You don't have a hat on. You don't have a hat so you don't know how to prepare eggs.

151
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,720
My hats in the other room. Okay, go get it. I can't I just got I

152
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:10,080
My I stepped on glue. You didn't step on glue. It's one of the ingredients I work with and I got stuck in it

153
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,460
You work with glue.

154
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,660
Uh, yeah.

155
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,660
What kind of glue?

156
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,660
Edible glue.

157
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,660
Edible glue? That's not a--

158
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,660
What are you making with it?

159
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,660
To make a gingerbread house.

160
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,660
It's my signature dish.

161
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,660
[laughter]

162
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,660
[laughter]

163
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,660
[laughter]

164
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,660
[laughter]

165
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,660
[laughter]

166
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:36,660
Uh, yes, uh, waiter,

167
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,660
I'll have the, uh,

168
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:44,980
Today we have a beautiful gingerbread house.

169
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,760
We say gumdrop, lightbulb and frosting.

170
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:58,060
You have the choice of either men or women standing outside of the house.

171
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:01,620
And you can choose the holiday for your gingerbread house.

172
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,060
Would you like a freshly ground frosting on top?

173
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,340
Say when.

174
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,340
Would you like a Halloween gingerbread house?

175
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:10,340
A Thanksgiving gingerbread house?

176
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,340
A...

177
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,340
A Valentine's Day gingerbread house?

178
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,340
But basically that's, yeah, that's how my restaurant is gonna work.

179
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,340
I need to figure out a location.

180
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,340

Yeah, but I'm-

184
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,840
The roof on this gingerbread house is too steeply pitched.

185
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,340
Is this a fucking two-door?

186
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,140

My uncle or some some one of my family members used to have a hot dog cart in the common

258
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:09,880
Really? Yeah. There's a hot dog cart in a gas station in goths town inside the station. No out in front

259
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,800
He upgraded it to a food truck though. Oh good for him, dude. Yeah, it's a food truck

260
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,160
Remember the unless the hot dog stand unless the hot dog stand is gone

00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,800
Dude, the food truck the food

262
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:26,720

And my hometown dude a bunch of a bunch of food trucks are doing this shit where they'll like

265
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:39,320
They like you order ahead of time and then they like drive to a place

266
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,280
So it's just like it's like uber eats, but you have to like go to get the food from the car

267
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,700
Like they don't like yeah, you just like order it and they're like, all right

268
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,140
We're gonna be at this park then later today and you have to just go get

269
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:59,140
Stupid I knew my neighbor started. He wanted to do a food truck and he was he got like

270
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,100
he bought the truck and he like fitted it up with like a kitchen and shit and his

271
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,180
friend was gonna be like the chef and he was gonna be like the money and shit and

272
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,740
then his friend just like stole all the money and bought a bunch of like heroin

273
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:16,740
and went to Vegas Jesus Christ just so awesome dude yeah that's like that's

274
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,580
that there's nothing more chefly than that chef would be a completely different

275
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:24,620
movie if that happened well yeah I'd be skinny it wouldn't be such a fat piece of

276
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:31,000
of shit if John Leguizamo skipped town just bought a bunch of heroin it'd be a

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,580
funnier movie cuz there'd be more John Leguizamo in it that's my problem with

278
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,140
that movie put there needs to be the pest put Leguizamo in this bitch yeah yeah

279
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:44,700
let him do the shower dance again right yeah but let him say one stinky dinky to

280
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:50,660

282
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:04,100

283
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,460
I didn't even think of that. That's a Mario Luigi spiritual successor. And I

284
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,380
don't, he's Italian and Bob Hoskins isn't. No neither of them were Italian in the

285
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:24,060
original yeah it's fucked up fucked up that they're doing that you know did we

286
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,180
could do a new maybe that'll be we need to get into investing I think once my

287
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:34,560
restaurant takes off I think we'll have a lot of money coming in from all the

288
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,740
food that I am selling and we could maybe make a new movie yeah yeah maybe a

289
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,460
Mario style movie. I think maybe dip your toes into filmmaking make

290
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,460
a documentary about food. You could make a documentary about your restaurant.

291
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,760
That's true. Yeah we could do like a chef's table kind of thing yeah yeah

292
00:13:53,760 --> 00:14:01,140
about my restaurant you know just like a nanananana. His mind is so he has a

293
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:08,020

wow, wow, wow.

300
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,680
- Onion was boiled to perfection.

301
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,360
- Yeah, dude, we could definitely do a chef's table thing.

302
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,660
- Yeah, it's like you're serving,

303
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,080
you know when you make a broth

304
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,700
and you put a whole onion or a chopped onion,

305
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,500
like a carrot and everything in it?

306
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,540
You're just serving people just broth,

307
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,700
like you don't drain it or anything?

308
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:00,660
Just like broth with like chunks of food in it. Yeah. I serve everything in a cauldron. We're gonna do it's true

309
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,700
I'm gonna hire a bunch of witches to be the line cooks and they're just gonna like throw shit behind them into the cauldron as

310
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:12,700
Like yeah, yeah, I'll chop it and you are not gonna believe the poems that they're gonna say. Oh, well, that's it

311
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:16,660
It's kind of like a dick's last resort sort of thing where they actually they serve

312
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:21,180
They it's the cauldron is is on the table. So the witch comes to the

313
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,620
She puts and so it's like the curse the cursed helm onto your head. Yeah, your friends laugh at you. Exactly

314
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,500
It's like hot it's like somewhere between hot pot and like a like like Benny Hanna, you know what I mean?

315
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,100
Okay. Yeah, and there's so you want to make what a medieval times and

316
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,220
Last resort and the rainforest cafe. You want to be like Steve a Yogi's dad for

317
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:49,300
Okay, just cauldrons. Yes, exactly. I have an idea what it could we could hire a bunch of witches

318
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,740
we could also have animatronic witches and then you have to figure out which is

319
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:56,980
which which which is which and that's the name of the restaurant which which is

320
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,060
which which is which and we serve sandwiches yep we serve which which is

321
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:04,260
which is it's two bottom halves of a sandwich yeah that's what a

322
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:09,140
which-which is yeah and they'll be like this is this is great this is a

323
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,420
great place mostly because of the name yep the food is not gonna be very good

324
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,340
terrible the food sucks but you're gonna be a real team like that and then I go

325
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:24,220
to Universal say that they get turned to a newt that's true yeah they get made

326
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:37,980
into a witch witch and the witch could be like roasting them yeah like yeah we'll

327
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:42,740
get Lisa Lampanelli to be head head of front of house because she's the best

328
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,180
- What are you saying about her?

329
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,500
- She's the best at roasts.

330
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,140
- You're saying she has a witch style look to her?

331
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,700

332
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,620

338
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,340
That's what you guys are supposed to say.

339
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,460
- Yes, chef.

340
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,540
- Anybody listening along, any time I say something,

341
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,900
yes, chef, thank you, chef.

342
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,420
- We don't know if the witch trials are,

343
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,740
like, if they were getting actual witches or not,

344
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,580
'cause they didn't have color pictures back then,

345
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,900
so we can't see if any of the women were green.

346
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,340
- That's a really good point, yeah.

347
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:15,240
That's a really good point.

348
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,020
- I think what you have to do is check

349
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,220
for a wart on the nose.

350
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,060
- But then the wart also--

351
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,900
- But do you think people could,

352
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,540
back then people could have just been green

353
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,900
and they just didn't put it together

354
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,540
that all the witches are green.

355
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:25,380
- It could have been aliens.

356
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,060
- A boy green guy is a hulk,

357
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,940
but a green girl is bad news.

358
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,500
- I don't care if you're green, black, white, purple.

359
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,260
- That could be why they said that.

360
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:38,020
- If you're a witch, you better join my restaurant.

361
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,780
- They would be doing the--

362
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,140
- We can do witch trials and then instead of killing them,

363
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,780
we hire them.

364
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,260
Witch hire, witch hire.

365
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,100
- No.

366
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,100
- No, it's still a trial.

367
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,660
It's still a trial 'cause you're hiring them

368
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,500
on a trial basis.

369
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,300
- And if they're not a witch, we kill them.

370
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,260
- True.

371
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,260
That's a good point.

372
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,260
- It's like Hooters.

373
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,460
- There's a lot of witches who didn't get caught

374
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,580
back in the day though.

375
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,420
- Yeah.

376
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,240
- 'Cause you're right, they didn't know

377
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,080
the witches were green yet.

378
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,140
They hadn't read, there was no picture books yet.

379
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,980
- Yeah.

380
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,820
- 'Cause they had no idea.

381
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,660
- Right, the first time, I mean--

382
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,980
Maybe like some hot blonde woman about to get dumped in a lake and there'd be some

383
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:20,460
green old hag who's like "Yeah! Get her! She's a witch! Hee hee! There's the witch!"

384
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,300
Yeah, flying around in a circle on a broom and they're like "Wow, she is so good at cleaning."

385
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,660
"Damn, she funny as hell. Damn."

386
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,660
"Yo, funny woman."

387
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,660
"Yo, you like the class clown."

388
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,660
"Yo, she's so good at pissing these people off, too."

389
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:39,260
"I saw her transform into a black cat and run around the town."

390
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:42,620
you know i think so funny i think christine is a witch but esmerelda's

391
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,660
gotta be the funniest bitch in town

392
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,620
she funny as hell

393
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,860
did they have people back then named christina? they had no people

394
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,580
yeah i don't know, what were people named back then? dolph?

395
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,620
no they were named like uh... like griselda

396
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,260
griselda? griselda

397
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:12,720
Zelda the kids the kids from Narnia. Yeah, everyone back there. Yeah, the last name was named aslan and the one which

398
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,020
What up Thomas, thanks for the paper other a mr. Thomas, what were the other guys in Narnia?

399
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,460
It's Cass. Oh, oh

400
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,340
Rubble still know what's the mouse's name? Read it. Read it. Read the cheap

401
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,660
Rule did

402
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:39,340
you found out it was God. Oh I was 17. I had the box set dude and they did the like Star

403
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,860
Wars thing where they have like the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe is like technically

404
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:46,340
like the third book or something. Yeah. Like there's like prequels and I was like oh I'm

405
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,240
gonna start at book one and it's about like a guy getting like abused by his uncle with

406
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,540
magic rings or something and I was like I just stopped reading the book. Which one is

407
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:56,140
that called? That's called like the Summer Earth. Like the Magician's Nephew I think

408
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:00,940
it's called. Is that really what it's called? I'm pretty sure it's called that. The Magician's

409
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:05,200
nephew I'm Google yep it's called the magicians nephew it's the first Narnia

410
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,980
book it's the sixth published there's the horse and his boy yeah the horse is why

411
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,020
there's the silver chair Prince Caspian the last one that has that has a monkey

412
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:17,740
in it named puzzle and that was one of the main character they go I would not

413
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,360
start with that monkey there's like an evil God who has six arms or something

414
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:28,500
there's so much wild shit someone named Eustace scrub oh yeah used to Jill Jill

415
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Will Pole.

416
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Diggory Kirk.

417
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,500
Eustace Scrubb.

418
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,580
I think Eustace Scrubb was just like the lame guy that they brought to Narnia by accident.

419
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,580
Lady of Green Curdle.

420
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,580
Wait, wasn't that Edmund?

421
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:41,580
No, I think Eustace Scrubb is like another guy.

422
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,680
Eustace Scrubb is, I think he turns into a dragon.

423
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,100
Is that in The Silver Chair?

424
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,540
Oh, I think that's in Voyage of the Dawn Treader maybe.

425
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Eustace Scrubb is played by Will Poulter in the movies.

426
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,300
Oh yeah, look at that.

427
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:55,300
That's crazy.

428
00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:00,820
It's funny that they made more than one movie of that and it's just erased forever.

429
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,180
Yeah, they didn't finish them.

430
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,620
Yeah, but like the fact that they made more than one and I can't remember any like,

431
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,780
I don't think I ever saw anything besides the first one.

432
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,140
Everyone remembers Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe, but nobody remembers like,

433
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,540
Dawn Treader or any of them.

434
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,500
We should get really into Narnia.

435
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,340
It would be really funny.

436
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,900
I mean, it's like, it's the Stitchy Christ story.

437
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,380
Can we do a Narnia book club with all of the listeners?

438
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,140
I'll fucking pick up a book right now. Yeah, I have the box set somewhere

439
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,980
Restaurant confidential I'm freed up

440
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:36,340
They finished at a Don Treader and it was magician's nephew was supposed to be next

441
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,980
Yeah

442
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:45,260
Literally is like he has like an evil uncle who uses like magic rings to like lock him in his house or something and then

443
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,060
He has like a girlfriend. It's called the naughty uncle

444
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,460
Yeah

445
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,880
Uncle gone bad. Yeah. Yeah, it's truly

446
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:01,500
I remembered those but I read them when I was like a young like like probably in elementary school

447
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,300
So I was like these are so long but they're like 200 less than 200 pages. Mm-hmm. We could definitely read all these

448
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:13,380
The two children in in the magician's nephew are named Diggory and Polly. Yeah

449
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,180
See those are all those are old witch names to me. Mm-hmm

450
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,180
What listen listen to the first listen to the first paragraph of this this plot summary?

451
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,180
This is maybe the most evil uncle of all time

452
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Okay, the story begins in London during the summer of 1900 two children diggory and already evil meet while playing in the adjacent

453
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,660
Gardens of a row of a to of terraced houses they decide to explore the attic connecting the houses

454
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,800
But take the wrong door and surprise diggory's uncle Andrew in his study

455
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,900
Uncle Andrew tricks Polly into touching a yellow magic ring causing her to vanish

456
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,220
Then he explains to Diggory that he has been dabbling in magic and that the rings allow travel between one world and another

457
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:56,800
He blackmails Diggory into taking another yellow ring to follow wherever Polly is gone and two green rings so that they can both return

458
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:00,820
Yeah, I mean with it as somebody with an uncle who dabbles in magic. I

459
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,740
Don't know how I feel about this

460
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:09,980
If you spread it touching a magic ring then blackmailing your nephew

461
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:16,580
I mean if somebody asked me to touch a ring I would I'm out I would not see

462
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:21,180
too many there's there's too many bad stories that ends up badly so often yep

463
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,700
yeah doing that no no way hey buddy touch this ring I promise nothing's gonna

464
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,260

00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:34,860

467
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,900
I say you know cuz it which is like it's the funniest like most ham-fisted

468
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:52,140
allegory of all time I I pick that up I didn't know that I was 17 as a lion yeah

469
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:57,580
yeah yeah so so in terms of the book Aslan is the line and then the white

470
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:01,220

479
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:49,060
these books are terrible I'm scoot okay I'll Google Narnia who is Pontius Pilate

480
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:53,460
there has to be an answer I'll be so surprised if there's no answer I

481
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,460
I remember I saw a blog spot here.

482
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,860
Last week I dragged my husband and nephew to see Prince Caspian again.

483
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,140
I really loved that movie.

484
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,740
This time I saw a lot more of the symbolism.

485
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,860
It was really quite interesting and it rather enriched my viewing of the movie the second

486
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,860
time around.

487
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,620
This is a woman who is forcing her family to be in love with Narnia.

488
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:19,140
I saw Narnia with my friend and his dad in the theater and I, like after the movie, he

489
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,140
was like saying something.

490
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,420
just remembered the like him saying like oh there's a lot of good battle scenes

491
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,420
in that movie but we were kind of far away so I couldn't hear him so I asked

492
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:33,100
him to repeat himself like six times I walked out of that movie with my my

493
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:39,300
friends or my dad's friend who later died and he was like that was gay let's go

494
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:44,460
watch Pirates of the Caribbean and then we just went right back into the theater

495
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,860
the Caribbean dude I had a Chronicles of Narnia Stratego set how does that work

496
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,100
it's like Stratego but instead of like spot like all the different explain the

497
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:01,260
rules of Stratego to me what is Stratego you know is this a jitsu that you've

498
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,020
learned it's a board game I don't know about that me neither I'm in a monopoly

499
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,580
in life mm-hmm now those are the I love you go dude it's like it's like war

500
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:19,260
what's the whole thing you can't cheat in Stratego you can definitely cheat I think

501
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:23,860
a rule is you can't cheat in most games yeah well no it's like Stratego is like

502
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,220
you know what I heard it in Zathura in the movies of thorough one of the

503
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,300
brothers says you can't cheat in Stratego and then the other brother says

504
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,860
you've cheated in Stratego would be the worst definitely get sucked into like in

505
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,980
a Jumanji Zathura style the worst board game would be don't wake daddy

506
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:44,540
operation operation would suck yeah operation yeah that'd be a much worse

507
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,980
sequel to Jumanji than Zathura was. You suck. Would you be...

508
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,980
Are you the doctor? Are you one of the things?

509
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,860
It sucks either way. You and a friend are playing it and you get sucked in and

510
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,860
And what have you as the doctor, what have you as the guy?

511
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,860
And your just going AHHHHH!

512
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,860
NOOOO!

513
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,860
That would be horrible.

514
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,860
Monopoly is, get this dude, get sucked into Monopoly, just real life again.

515
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,860
Yep, true.

516
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,860
It's a whole other world.

517
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,860
Did I blow your mind?

518
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,860
Oh I'm sorry, did the chef blow your mind?

519
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Did I bring too much flavor to the podcast right then?

520
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,900
bad you did not I'm thinking of mixing up some flavors yeah I've been thinking

521
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:39,380
about good doing salty sweet here's it here's a flavor for you hmm

522
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:48,660
strong and dry yeah that's a bad combo strong and dry I've got I've got a

523
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:56,940
flavor for you okay delicious fruit loops fruit loops and milk well I think is it

524
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,860
I mean I feel like the whole thing with with fancy chefs who are on TV is that

525
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:05,300
they come they take something simple and then they make it yeah make it gourmet

526
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,900
they say here's mac and cheese but I put the pasta in one bowl and the cheese in

527
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:13,500
another yeah yeah and they're on either end of the room yeah you have to walk

528
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,100
where we and take one bite of each and keep it in your mouth all the way over

529
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,620
and also there's an optical course in the middle and there's a log over a river

530
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:26,380
yeah this is a cube of mac and cheese yeah I made bread but it's invisible I

531
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,220
made peanut butter and jelly but the peanut butter and jelly are on the

532
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,980
outside yeah yeah yeah but the peanut butter is made out of cheese and the

533
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:38,500
jelly is made out of meat so the peanut butter the peanut butter is on one slice

534
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:42,940
of bread and the jellies on another slice of bread but then those slices have a

535
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,420
slice on top of them and it's two different sandwiches and you have to eat them separately.

536
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:52,140
You have to eat them separately. If I was ever on Chopped I would blow the judge's mind I would make

537
00:28:52,140 --> 00:29:01,900
my famous ham and cheese PB&J. What's that guy's name? I'd make my tortilla chip salad. Chopped.

538
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:07,740
That guy. Chopped. His name's Chopped. No it's not that guy. Alton Brown. Awesome Brown. It's the

539
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:12,620
guy on YouTube who he does like his like sex doll reviews or whatever

540
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:20,020
Kinji Lopez alt no it's not I think it's like over some but no he does the GoPro

541
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:26,820
video on top of his head where he's Shane Dawson all mystery guitar man I

542
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,340
tried to look up I tried to look up the guy on YouTube who does the sex doll

543
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:42,340
reviews and I found the top result is sex dolls for sex offenders price. Wait, do they get a discount? I don't know!

544
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:48,340
Wait, can you submit for a coupon code if you're a sex offender or is it more expensive?

545
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:54,340
I hope it's more expensive. Why? I don't know. I feel like it's better if it's cheaper.

546
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,100
should be yeah it should be cheaper yeah we should be subsidizing sex dolls for

547
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:03,140
sex offenders what is this guy's name? I'm gonna take that back. What is this guy's name?

548
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:08,140
it's something Cobra he's like a goth guy Patrick Doren Cobra and he's got a

549
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,940
ponytail. Goth King Cobra? I think it's Goth King Cobra. The guy they made the

550
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,140
documentary about? Gothic King Cobra I think. Well he made a video where he was

551
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,840
making something he's making like a burger or like a grilled cheese with

552
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:26,760
peanut butter or something and he's like well my thought process here was I've

553
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:32,120
seen those Austin peanut butter crackers with cheese so I figure this should be

554
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:37,640
really good that's like stuffing in it or something I gotta look this up I do

555
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,040
love that though when you it's like when I was a kid I would I would come up with

556
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,680
dishes that I was like this is gonna be so good and it just sucked every time

557
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:52,440

578
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,380
takes an hour long it takes an hour to prepare

579
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:06,420
takes a long time at 16 minutes and 20 seconds in there's a fart

580
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,780
you have to make the mother for it first yeah

581
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,700
And then you can construct the sandwich from there.

582
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,620
Oh my god.

583
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,820
But yeah, I'm basically gonna get in.

584
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,980
Making a PB&J mayonnaise burger.

585
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,020
Wait, actually people love that.

586
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,060
Yeah, that's what I mean.

587
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,700
That's what I'm saying.

588
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,580
I forgot about that.

589
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,380
People will make that sort of sandwich.

590
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,220
Oh, that's the Elvis burger, isn't it?

591
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,860
My grandpa ate a hot dog in front of my dad one time that had mayonnaise and peanut butter

592
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,580
and bananas on it.

593
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,740
My dad vomited at the table.

594
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:38,180
People will eat shit like they'll eat like bananas and mayonnaise and stuff and it's like,

595
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,860
There's shit like that that definitely tastes good.

596
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:53,060
The Elvis burger is bananas, fried bananas, peanut butter, and diced bacon.

597
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:58,500
Wait, so you're saying it's bananas, peanut butter, and bacon?

598
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,500
Yeah.

599
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,500
On a burger.

600
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
That's it?

601
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
That's probably fine.

602
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,740
That probably tastes fine.

603
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,740
I'm sure it's okay.

604
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,740
I'm sure it tastes good.

605
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,040
The thing is Patrick, if people eat it, it probably is good.

606
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,040
If it tastes like shit, nobody's gonna eat it.

607
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,240
What do you mean?

608
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,740
What do you mean, "What do I mean?"

609
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,740
People eat bugs.

610
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,740
Yeah, people eat poop.

611
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,740
- People love eating-- - Bugs probably taste fine too.

612
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
People like eating poop.

613
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,740
There's people who get off on eating poop.

614
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,740
- Like that's their favorite thing. - Okay, but nobody's getting off on eating an Elvis burger.

615
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,240
- It's a type of burger. - Some people are. What about gainers, dude?

616
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
That's a good point.

617
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,740
Gainers get off on eating food.

618
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,740
Maybe I'll become a chef who particularly

619
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:43,920
Are not are not a good idea. Yes. Are not far enough apart to sound disgusting. That's okay. It's alright

620
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,620
I'm gonna come up with combos you tell me if it's if it's good or bad. Okay, I got a copy. Are you ready?

621
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,840
We're in pretzels dressing he's and an apple

622
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,900
Pretzel

623
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,860
Circle pretzel cheese on the inside. That's my combo. I'm gonna vomit

624
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,780
That's fucking disgusting dude here about this chip and a hint of lime

625
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,800
What do you think it's disgusting

626
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,020
The only reason you eat that is to get off on it. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah, what are you fucking free?

627
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,340
Yeah, tortilla chips with a hint of lime. What about Jesus Christ?

628
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,940
It's a tortilla tortilla chip and pico de gallo

629
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:31,040
I'm I'm I'm so close to vomiting. I don't know why this is but I actually do feel sick to my stomach right now

630
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,040
Thinking about these normal foods

631
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,780
Just the fact that we frame this as a disgusting combination made like chips. Okay. Okay, peanut butter and flour about chips and ahoy

632
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:43,940
well

633
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:50,720
Okay, there's my problem chips ahoy is there's no pirate twist yeah, no there's no anchor on the

634
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:59,080
They're not anchor shaped chocolate chips. It's called a hoy though, so it shouldn't that be enough pirate no no no their mascots

635
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,940
Not even a pirate. It's a baby cookie. They need like grog in the and they need a grog dough

636
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,340
Mm-hmm you know what I mean

637
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,100
Something their mascot the mascot. It's just a chip. So boy. I'm looking at a claymation cookie

638
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,540
That's I don't think ever. I don't think it ever was a pirate

639
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:20,580
Okay, well listen to this this makes even less sense in the 1960s and early

640
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,100
1970s a chips Ahoy bags featured comic strips of cookie man a superhero character

641
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:34,200
Who's who does subdued other various cookie devouring creatures such as fruit fly or bigwig his alter ego was Mort Meek?

642
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:41,420
Who was always seen counting the 16 chips in his chips Ahoy cookie? He was a crime-stopping cookie. He was a Batman guy

643
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,760
Oh my god, dude. What?

644
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:52,740
What the fuck is that for the in the early 1980s children played 1940 style newspaper reporters interested in the 16 chips story

645
00:35:52,740 --> 00:36:00,500
The chips Ahoy's branding is so fucked up for a time as it should be on 90s advertising labeled chips Ahoy as being

646
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,660
1000 chips delicious

647
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,940
in the 90s they just uh

648
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,740
they really

649
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:11,500
Could not figure out food mascots like Jesus or is never figured it out

650
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:18,400
Listen up from 2001 to 2010 Chips Ahoy's mascots were the animated cookie guys with one of their commercials having them drive a red convertible

651
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,840
So you want me by the Human League?

652
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,460
That's how I got about that song. What are we gonna do for her?

653
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:28,960
That's so fucking funny to imagine them like what are we gonna do for our chocolate chip mascot?

654
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
We need a new one. I don't know like a car

655
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:38,260
What about like what about like a sick-ass red convertible and a girl wants the real bad about like a funny bug

656
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:42,260
would that be cool as a chocolate chip cookie mascot?

657
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:44,260
that's honey nut cheerio, that makes sense

658
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,260
you're right, he is a very funny bug

659
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:48,260
but at least that makes sense

660
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
Nabisco says the name as a reference to the nautical term "ships ahoy"

661
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,260
the word "chips ahoy" also feature prominently in a story

662
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:56,260
appearing in chapter 15 of the Uncommercial Traveler by Charles Dickens

663
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:59,260
Dickens relays a childhood tale of a shipwright

664
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
hmm?

665
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
you said Nabisco

666
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,260
Nabisco?

667
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,260
Nabisco?

668
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,980
Because it's national biscuit company. Okay, I didn't know that. You know it's short for national biscuit company. Yeah

669
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:24,300
That's nice dude also what I said way it makes way more sense for national biscuit company than what you said now

670
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,700
This is Co national you say national

671
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,340
National now, what is like? Come on?

672
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,400
Dickens relays a childhood tale of a shipwright named Chips who is taunted by a

673
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,060
Diabolical talking rat who predicts the sinking of chips ship chips ahoy old boy

674
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:44,580
We've pretty well eat them too, and we'll drown the crew and we'll eat them, too

675
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:48,040
That was that's where chips that was a curse mascot. They were gonna do a diabolical

676
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:51,040
Diabolical talking right yeah

677
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,660
He'd be a great pick cheesestores Rex still makes no sense to me. Yeah, just yeah like just do the food

678
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,340
Just pick a picture of the food with eyes

679
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:08,540
the easiest thing. Like a Spaghetti-O? Yeah! So easy dude. Yeah. Just put eyes on it. It is really easy.

680
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:15,540
Like, I'm getting it dude. Or the animal that likes to eat that food. Exactly. Cheese, a human.

681
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,180
Mm-hmm. A human with two sets of eyes because you do have to add eyes. Honey, nut Cheerios, a bee.

682
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:26,900
Yeah, a bee. Cookie, cereal, a wolf. Cookie, cri- that's another. Lucky charm cereal, a leprechaun.

683
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:31,700
That's another motherfucker that doesn't make any sense. Didn't it used to be different?

684
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
Chip the wolf.

685
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,700
I think he makes sense.

686
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,200
What do you mean it makes sense?

687
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,200
Have you ever seen a wolf eat chocolate chip?

688
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,200
No, I've never seen a wolf eat cookies.

689
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
They do. It's a natural diet.

690
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,200
Wait, I just looked up Cookie Crisp old mascot. Their original mascot was Cookie Jarvis.

691
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,200
[laughter]

692
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,240
- Cookie Jarvis was a wizard in the Merlin mold

693
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,780
who with one wave of his wand magically turned

694
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,680
Cookie Jarvis into cereal balls.

695
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,280
- Yeah, I remember, dude, I remember Cookie Jarvis.

696
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,800
- Cookie Jarvis is from 1977, Patrick.

697
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,640
- No, he, no, in the 90s, Cookie Jarvis was still around.

698
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,160
- Yes, he's from 1977 and they stopped using him in 1980.

699
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,920
- It's pretty funny that like all of these--

700
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,000
- It says right here.

701
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,080
- All of these mascots got like--

702
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:17,520
- Why do I remember Cookie Jarvis?

703
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,120
- It's funny that all of these mascots

704
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,160
got replaced before Aunt Jemima.

705
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,160
(laughter)

706
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,160
They were like...

707
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,160
Aunt Jemima was like "this year" but they were like

708
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,160
"Warlock, that doesn't make any fucking sense."

709
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,160
"We have to get rid of Warlock, it's so bad for the brand."

710
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
Here's... okay, then after

711
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,160
Cookie Jarvis, they changed it to

712
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Cookie Crook and Cookie Cop.

713
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,160
Okay, maybe I remember that.

714
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,160
'Cause that looks...

715
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:46,160
I thought Cookie Jarvis was blue.

716
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
And then Cookie Crook was given a sidekick

717
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,480
sidekick named chip the dog in nineteen ninety

718
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,720
no it's shipped the dog that i remember okay

719
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,480
it's

720
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,680
that's that's the one i thought it was a good thing to do is not know i would be

721
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:04,520
remembered looking i'm looking at ship the dog right now i ship the dog was a

722
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,000
wizard

723
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,120
yes you heard

724
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,360
yes i did

725
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,800
that's a wizard named it

726
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,800
Because I remember when they switched over to the wolf.

727
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
Because it makes sense, I mean the dog goes to wolf.

728
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,800
They don't even talk about the wolf on the Wikipedia page, this is fucked up.

729
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,800
You have to go to Cereal Wiki for that, I just did.

730
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Just click through your bookmarks, back to Cereal Wiki.

731
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Yeah, because Chip the dog was where the "Cookie Crisp" comes from.

732
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,800
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:41,800
Okay, so that makes sense.

734
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Obviously.

735
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Because a dog does say cookie when it...

736
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,800
That is the noise that it makes.

737
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,800
It's like, you know how different cultures, they phoneticize a dog word differently?

738
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Yeah.

739
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Yeah, so America's is cookie.

740
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,800
We have now decided.

741
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
Do you guys like Cars 3 cereal?

742
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,800
Wait, do I remember this thing at all?

743
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Or am I creating a false memory for myself?

744
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800
You know what? I'm not sure it matters that much.

745
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,160
I'm losing my fucking mind looking at this bullshit.

746
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
Get off of the cereal wiki, you're gonna go crazy.

747
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,560
I'm gonna lose my fucking mind thinking about these goddamn mascots.

748
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,600
Yeah, I got so irony poisoned by the cereal wiki.

749
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Oh, fuck.

750
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:27,480
I think that they should put toys back in the middle of cereal boxes.

751
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,120
Yep.

752
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,320
Do they do that anymore?

753
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,520
They don't do that shit anymore.

754
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,000
They'll do like, sometimes they'll do a piece of paper.

755
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,560
Yeah, it's a QR code.

756
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,320
Or a VR headset.

757
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
they had Dunkin Donuts cereal?

758
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
nowadays they have a gender swapping button

759
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
in the middle of all the cereal

760
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
do you remember

761
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
do you remember in 2004

762
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:49,320
something like that

763
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,320
all general mills cereals came with

764
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,320
a movie

765
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
what?

766
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:57,320
yeah they came with a disc

767
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,320
they came with a DVD in the middle of the package

768
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
was it just a random movie?

769
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
yeah it was like the great muppet caper

770
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,320
was one of them

771
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,040
- Puppets Take Manhattan was one of them.

772
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,360
- That's a good get.

773
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,200
- That was a good get.

774
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,760
- That's good for the price. - And then it was another one,

775
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,680
I think it was like Zeus and Roxanne was one of them.

776
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,440
- They didn't, was the cereal like $15?

777
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,000
- I don't know, I don't know.

778
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,260
- That's an amazing promotion.

779
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,400
- And then you could put the DVD in your computer.

780
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,320
- We should hide a DVD in this episode.

781
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,160
- You could put the DVD on your computer

782
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,080
and it had a thing, it had America Online on it.

783
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,120
It had a free trial for AOL.

784
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,240
- Dude, cereal is like the best investment ever.

785
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,800
- Do you guys know that Funko makes cereal?

786
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,200
- Oh yeah, I just found that out right now.

787
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,780
- What kind of flavor is it?

788
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,900
- We're looking at Freddy Fazbear,

789
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,220
Five Nights at Freddy's tasty treat.

790
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:47,060
Fun to eat.

791
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:49,200
- No, it wasn't, it was not the Muppets.

792
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,940
It was not the Muppets, it was--

793
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,640
- We got Cuphead cereal.

794
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,560
- It was Liberty Kids, Heathcliff,

795
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,980
and Super Mario Brothers Super Show,

796
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,460
Madeline, Strawberry Shortcake, Inspector Gadget,

797
00:42:58,460 --> 00:42:59,660
and Inspector Gadget Jr.

798
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,500
- Okay, that's enough.

799
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,320
- And then Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

800
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,080
(laughing)

801
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:08,680
It sucks getting on any of these like like nostalgia train conversations

802
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,440
because Pat will just he will talk about this for three hours. That's true.

803
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,480
All we've talked about for the no wait no premium episodes is just various characters.

804
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,960
It does come with Muppet Takes Manhattan. It does come with that. Oh my god. Oh my god.

Jesus Christ. Okay all right I'm ready to talk about the news. I'm ready to talk about this.

Oh fuck, there's a fingernail here. What the fuck is this? And a woman's high heel shoe.

- Okay.

859
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,300

00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,100
and they pooped everywhere.

861
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:57,940

862
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,780
- And that's not a remark.

863
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,420
- Rich people, rich people.

864
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,360
Maybe the remark was like,

865
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,060
"Ugh, there's so much poop."

866
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,340
- Okay, that could be the remark.

867
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,900
- Wah, wah, wee, wah.

868
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,980
- Rich people love to have a small dog

869
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:13,700

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,160
I already ate.

988
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:17,160
I don't want to eat a poop.

989
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,160
You sure you don't want a poop Italian soda?

990
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:23,160
We can set you up a little dookie bag to take home.

991
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,000
Your chef gave me a sample outside.

992
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,580
It's just a bulldog on a chain.

993
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,120
(laughing)

994
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,420
- Dude, I just want to have a normal recipe.

995
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:37,580
I came in here with so many amazing ideas for recipes.

996
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,760
You know, I was gonna do a paella.

997
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,000
I was gonna do a--

998
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,220
- And what was gonna be in your paella?

999
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:45,320
- What's a paella?

1000
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,960
- Paella is like a rice dish.

1001
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,220
- Yeah, I was basically gonna put rice in it

1002
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:53,140
and probably some meat and some vegetables.

1003
00:55:53,140 --> 00:56:05,060
What about like a ceviche but instead of shrimp or any food that cooks from the acidic lemon

1004
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,860
juice you just put a whole flank steak.

1005
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,580
So it just doesn't cook at all.

1006
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,580
Or just like 80/20 chuck.

1007
00:56:12,580 --> 00:56:18,940
I'm trying this new sous vide method where I use...

1008
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:24,040
I let I let the steak I don't put the steak in a bag or anything and I let it soak in ice-cold water in

1009
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,860
My bathtub for a week. Yeah, I've been really enjoying this chicken tartar that I made. Oh

1010
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:34,660
It's delicious dude, Eric Wareheim posted a oh the chicken. Sashimi chicken

1011
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:38,740
So she may be the most evil food I've ever seen. Yeah, dude, like that's the most evil food

1012
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,740
I've seen that's not like like a poop burger. I

1013
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:46,740
Mean French bread crostini with a piece of chicken and barbecue sauce on it. I

1014
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,220
- I understand, yeah, try different foods and shit,

1015
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,840
but a chicken sashimi just sounds made up.

1016
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:54,680
- Yeah, no, yeah.

1017
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,060
- That sounds like-- - Don't do that.

1018
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,020
- That's like emperor's new clothes shit.

1019
00:56:58,020 --> 00:56:59,940
- That's what they would eat in Tim and Eric.

1020
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,740
Like, that's not, yeah.

1021
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:06,100
- It doesn't, it's like you trick a rich person

1022
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:06,940
into eating that.

1023
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:08,180
- Exactly. - It's not like a real thing.

1024
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,020
- Yeah, well he is a rich person.

1025
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,380
He maybe just got tricked.

1026
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,060
- He definitely, I can't imagine looking at that

1027
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:15,500
and being like, yeah, I'm gonna eat this,

1028
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,860
and I'm gonna post a picture of it on Instagram too.

1029
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:20,260
I want everyone to know that I ate this.

1030
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,540
- Your gut bubbling after that, just, oh.

1031
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:23,620
- Yeah.

1032
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,180
- Also your brain just like slowing down.

1033
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:27,020
- Right?

1034
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:29,300
- Yeah, there has to be some fucking microbe in that

1035
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:30,860
that's not good for your head.

1036
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,700
- Yeah.

1037
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:33,700
- It has to, I mean, the chickens that you kill for that

1038
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,520
have to be like--

1039
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,580
- That's what I say when I'm watching Tim and Eric.

1040
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:38,640
I'm like, were these guys fucking smoking raw chicken

1041
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:39,480
when they made this shit?

1042
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,900
This crap is insane.

1043
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:42,100
- These guys were eating raw chicken for sure.

1044
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,200
- These guys must have been out of their mind

1045
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:44,820
on raw chicken.

1046
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:47,260
Jesus Christ, this is so weird.

1047
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:52,140
is chicken sashimi like a thing like i don't know i want to see how long it's been a thing

1048
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:56,780
yeah because i feel that that sounds like a new like chicken sashimi that sounds like one of those

1049
00:57:56,780 --> 00:58:02,380
weird fusion things it's made from the part of the chicken that carries the lowest risk of

1050
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:09,180
salmonella contamination okay i guess that makes sense the vagina is it it's japanese lubricated

1051
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:13,980
i think most sashimi is japanese yeah it makes sense but i mean but okay but chicken sashimi

1052
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,980
seems like a kind of thing that a white guy would make.

1053
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:20,220
Yeah, it's like a French guy who studied sushi in Japan.

1054
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:20,980
People in Japan--

1055
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,980
Ma?

1056
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,100
I'm on the website India Today.

1057
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,740
People in Japan eat raw chicken.

1058
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:29,060
Here's why no one should do that to their body.

1059
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,780
The Japanese have done it again.

1060
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,940
That's the first line of the article.

1061
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:36,820
Yet again, the Japanese fucking it up right now.

1062
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,740
Just when you thought pufferfish dishes, a naked restaurant,

1063
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,280
and a superb non-melting ice cream

1064
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,140
was all that you could take of this country's

1065
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:47,380
culinary creativity, their proud tradition of eating raw chicken comes to light.

1066
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:49,380
Oh, it's a tradition?

1067
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,380
Yeah, that's what this-

1068
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:54,260
If it's like traditional Japanese, I guess I don't have-

1069
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,260
I guess I can take back my comments, probably.

1070
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:58,260
I guess I would like to expect me now-

1071
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,020
Yes, raw chicken. You know, chicken that is pink and limp, like only raw meat can be.

1072
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:06,660
Raw chicken that even a dedicated Indian non-vegetarian might not want to explore.

1073
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:09,780
Ugh.

1074
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:15,060
Yeah, 'cause I mean, like, eating, like, raw fish, you probably have the same risk.

1075
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:16,360
Uh...

1076
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,160
I don't think so. I don't know.

1077
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:19,560
I think salmonella-- I don't think that's true.

1078
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,300
I think technically salmonella is, like, present in all raw chicken or something.

1079
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:26,900
Yeah, I mean, it's raw chi-- yeah, you shouldn't be eating-- I mean...

1080
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,460
There's obviously ways you can-- Well, who are we to say that you can't eat it?

1081
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:33,680
I think I'm gonna eat it. Fuck me, because it's disgusting!

1082
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,760
Oh, fuck me! You cooked the fucking sashimi! You cooked the raw chicken sashimi! Fuck me!

1083
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Fuck me!

1084
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh, God.

1085
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Put it in the time machine.

1086
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Make it raw again.

1087
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
[Laughter]

1088
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Put it back in the time machine.

1089
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Oh, you fucked this up completely!

1090
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
Trash.

1091
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Garbage.

1092
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
This whole Wellington is ruined.

1093
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Throw it in the time machine.

1094
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:58,000
We don't have a time machine, chef.

1095
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Then invent one!

1096
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Fuck me!

1097
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,000
This is such a- this is the last line of the article.

1098
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
This is so funny.

1099
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
While Japan has its own culinary and food culture, we Indians are more prone to enjoying well-cooked

1100
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,040
enjoying well-cooked meat, poultry, and fish, according to our own culinary culture.

1101
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:16,580
So while raw chicken sashimi or even the French tartare looks great on a gourmet

1102
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,320
plate, they don't really belong on a platter made for Indians. That's right,

1103
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:26,000
yeah. These Japanese people must love making food that gives you diarrhea.

1104
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,200
Us Indians, on the other hand, that just, I mean, hell no. We hate that crap. Man, I

1105
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,920
don't, I'm thinking about it now, like if I was offered it, I think I would eat it.

1106
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,320
I mean I would eat anything I think I've realized yes, I will eat

1107
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:46,740
Somebody says if somebody vouches for it if you're not doing it as a prank if it's not if I'm not getting be my

1108
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:51,120
So I will do it if I saw Anthony Bourdain eat it. I'd eat it

1109
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:55,160
Well, I mean, maybe he maybe that was his last meal dude. Oh

1110
01:00:55,160 --> 01:01:02,900
I wonder what his last meal was did his last his last meal was like heroin or something shower water

1111
01:01:06,840 --> 01:01:08,840
hotel shampoo

1112
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:15,240
The forbidden vlog that they refuse to release

1113
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:21,780
It's Anthony Bourdain just like with a cup next to the shower. He's like it's perfectly fine to drink

1114
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:34,360
But he's got one of those shower heads have you seen like those those tick-tock shower heads that look like they have the beans in

1115
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,440
them

1116
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:38,960
No, no, oh well, then fuck they put beans in a shower

1117
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,680
Beans in the shower

1118
01:01:42,680 --> 01:01:46,500
It's like one of these shower heads where it's like they put like tiny rocks in it

1119
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
And that's supposed to help with the pressure or something

1120
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:51,280
No

1121
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,480
Making things up now look I don't go on tick-tock

1122
01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,160
Look up beans showerhead. I will not look that. I don't want I'm afraid that I'll get I'm gonna get some sort of

1123
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:09,040
It's a thing, it's a Luxego shower head with replacement hose and bracket on Amazon.

1124
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,560
And it's got little beans in it.

1125
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm gonna put your beans in my shower.

1126
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,920
It's got little brown beans and it's got big blue beans in it.

1127
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:16,920
Ugh.

1128
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:22,720
That's, what, I'm, as soon as we're done recording I have to go vomit I think.

1129
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,200
Oh yeah, this is a, I don't like the look of this shower head at all.

1130
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:29,080
I'm so sick right now.

1131
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,920
Is this really how we're, oh fuck.

1132
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,560
Don't look this up if you're listening.

1133
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:38,800
These are stones. These are stone beads. Those are beans. That's disgusting.

1134
01:02:38,800 --> 01:02:46,040
Oh, there's one with a T-Rex skull. Okay, that's actually pretty cool. Where's that?

1135
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:50,320
I'll link it to you right now. We're all using one big computer right now.

1136
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:56,480
Yeah, check this out. Take a dino bath. Does this have beans in it? No.

1137
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:01,320
No. But it's just a thing you put on your shower head. I'm gonna put Pat in my shower and

1138
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:06,440
he's gonna grow. He's gonna absorb all the water and grow to a normal size instead of

1139
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,960
four inches tall. Dude, I should get this. I should get this dino shower head and this

1140
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:16,920
dino shower curtain. Yeah, anything to make you take a shower. Come on! Oh! Stinky ass

1141
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:23,920
muffin. I'm not stinky. You're stinky. You're disgusting. Alright. Disgusting. I gotta pee.

1142
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,120
All right, bye boys. I'm gonna stop recording. Bye

1143
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:31,880
Bye
