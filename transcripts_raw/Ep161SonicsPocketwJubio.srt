Oh man, he's on his private jet.

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,880

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,400

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,480
though i did not mean to move to the smallest monologue people are that's why

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,360
you're so

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,500

26
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,200
uh...

27
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,080
jimmy is with us this week because he

28
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,640
is going to be taking over the for the most part the twitch channel and uh wanted to get

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,520
the word out we're doing the classic thing of just having hiring a mexican guy to do something

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,240
we don't want to do

31
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:19,440
it's just like one of the best moves honestly yeah works every time that we got to the point

32
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,720
that we were able to do that it's true i mean i never thought the goal in life right never

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,800
thought we'd make it but you know here we are. I was like this is maybe this

34
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,520
isn't a great idea and then I remembered my dad's back deck is like immaculate

35
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,880
yeah and he kind of did the same thing. It's really advanced stuff so I'm hoping

36
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:50,240
I'll be streaming building decks. No don't do that no that's not what I mean. Okay yeah. Don't do racist shit

37
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,240
That's gonna get us in trouble.

38
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,880
- I'll be sure to walk into Taco Bell.

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,720
- No, you--

40
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,560
- In Queens.

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,480
- They don't even, oh, please move to New York City.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,320
- What do I have to do?

43
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,640
- Move to New York and you work at the Taco Bell

44
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,880
and we get free Taco Bell?

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,400
- That would be so incredible.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,780
I mean, it also would work with any other

47
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,160
fast food restaurant, but it should be Taco Bell.

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,360
- Yeah.

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,680
Why should it be Taco Bell, Cameron?

50
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,920
- 'Cause he just, you know,

51
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,280
there's just something about the Taco Bell.

52
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,320
- What do you mean?

53
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,720
- There's just something delicious about Taco Bell food

54
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,640
and the people that make it.

55
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,280
- What kind of people make Taco Bell food?

56
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,020
- Just like these crazy people.

57
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,000
(laughing)

58
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,920
Just these crazy weird people.

59
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,000
- I actually brought, I brought Julio to the Taco Bell

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,200
for the first time in his life and he hated it.

61
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,680
It was like so upsetting.

62
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,400
I honestly thought he was gonna be like,

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,600
"This is beast, this is exactly what Mexican food is like."

64
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,440
This is like--

65
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,520
- I said it was fine.

66
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
I liked it.

67
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,240
- I don't think you even finished your fucking burrito, dude.

68
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,200
- Yes I did!

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,200
Now I was like still hungry. I was like...

70
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,200
Wait, you...

71
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,200
You threw something away.

72
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,200
I did not.

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,200
You did.

74
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,200
Such a liar.

75
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,200
No, I had a Crunchwrap, whatever it's called.

76
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,200
Whoa, okay.

77
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,200
You didn't remember Crunchwrap and forget Supreme.

78
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,200
Yeah, that one.

79
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,200
I had a quesadilla and the soda.

80
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,200
The green soda. I had the green thing.

81
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,200
Baja Blast.

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,200
I went in there, I can have the green thing, and they gave me a big, big, big bottle of green stuff.

83
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
I don't think they'll give you a bottle.

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
They don't give you a bottle, dude.

85
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,200
You have to admit Baja Blast is really fucking good.

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
That should be a Mexican food staple, I think.

87
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,200
It's just like Jarritos.

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
Jarritos?

89
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
It's pretty good.

90
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm Colombian now.

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,200
Last night I learned a man came up to me at a bar last night,

92
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200
pointed at me and said,

93
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,200
"You're Colombian."

94
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,040
and then for like 20 minutes just kept trying to talk to me about being

95
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,560
Colombian mm-hmm yeah and I think Caleb probably remembers more than I do but

96
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,560
yeah I sat there for like about Colombian being Colombian for a minute

97
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,240
and then he turned to me and started saying many Pacquiao number number one

98
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,520
many no no no he wasn't saying he was saying many Pacquiao basura what many

99
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:15,720
Pacquiao Basura. What does that mean? That Manny Pacquiao's trash. Yeah. What? Really? Yeah.

100
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:23,360
I know Basura. I don't know any other Spanish. I don't know a lot of Spanish. And then he tried to box me. Oh yeah, he was trying to box you at the bar.

101
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:32,600
What do you say this? Did he look at Caleb and was like, this guy's a Filipino and I hate my abacado. I think he maybe thought that Pat was Colombian and I'm Filipino.

102
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,120
He thought, no, he thought I was Colombian and just kept in, he was adamant that I was

103
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,200
Colombian and was only speaking to me in Spanish and I kept saying like "Hey, no

104
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,480
hablo, no hablo, I'm Irish, I'm 100% Irish."

105
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,840
"Yo soy Irish."

106
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,840
Yeah, "Yo soy Irish, no hablo, no hablo," and he just would not stop. He just was just

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,200
could just like did not accept that I wasn't Colombian. He looked at my

108
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,820
He looked at my roommate Alex pointed up and said Venezuelan and then

109
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:14,160
Real life they live glasses

110
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:22,680
He knows that I'm secretly Filipino, yeah, yeah. Yeah. What do you miss the most of it with the Philippines the chocolate?

111
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Okay, then the the

112
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,360
the sandwiches the you know, you know

113
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,320
The Cuba has the Cuban and every other you every country has to have a sandwich is just named after the country

114
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
So I like the Philippines

115
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,040
It's one sandwich, it's the Philippine the Philips exit the Philippines

116
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,840
It's a it's a pizza that has it's got spaghetti

117
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:57,720
Yeah, and fried chicken. It's a sandwich with spaghetti and I only know skittles on it

118
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,640
Yeah, it is funny that somebody like somebody who is inventing all the food in the Philippines watched elf with

119
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,960
Will Ferrell and was like yeah, we're gonna make all that

120
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:17,580
Although like maple syrup spaghetti shit, that's gonna be like our whole thing. I think that Filipino food is the best

121
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,880
At the best fry you're telling me you're telling me that that will ferrell ripped off the look I said, I don't think so

122
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,880
I don't think so as a Colombian

123
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:33,320
The Philippines exists. I've been what Columbia is nowhere near fucking the Philippines as a Colombian

124
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,600
I'm not stupid

125
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,680
What do you think I'm stupid just cuz I'm Colombian now. No, you're not Colombian. I'm Colombian

126
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,980
I'm full Colombian now the most popular Filipino foods the most

127
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:50,120
roast pig candy canes candy corns

128
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,460
Pin am I right? Okay. This looks good. What is what is pin a pig?

129
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:58,040
For like a pig type deal. No, it's like rice

130
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,120
You are getting into the list - - yeah, you know, I went to the video

131
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,760
I went to that dim sum place that we went when you were in town. Oh, you went to China

132
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,620
I went to China because there's a part of Queens that is just it's literally China like it's

133
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:16,460
not like Chinatown and you're in a whole different world it rules and I went to this place called

134
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:21,800
Asian Jewels and I was so good when Juvia was in town we went and I went today and do

135
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,860
you remember they you ordered off like a menu when we went yeah yeah so this time I walked

136
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:32,020
in they sat us down and immediately like a lady came by with like a cart like I was on

137
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,820
a train and handed just handed me I had no choice you just started putting like

138
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:42,160
giant like shrimp meatballs all over the table that's how does some works they

139
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,440
ask you what you want and you they didn't ask me what I wanted at all no

140
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,940
that's how I did say no cuz she was just piling the same shrimp meatball over and

141
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,740
over and over again like she thought it was my favorite food in the world and I

142
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:01,660
like we ordered like fucking 12 of these I guess and like they were Filipino

143
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,660
That's a classic Filipino dish.

144
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,660
Well, yeah, it must be that.

145
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,140
But once it was on the table, I can't be like, "Hey, will you put this back in the cart?

146
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,660
I don't want to eat 50 shrimp meatballs."

147
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,140
So I just felt like shit all day.

148
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:16,740
I just had shrimp in my stomach all day long.

149
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,540
Dude, I had a shrimp incident too.

150
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,540
I don't know.

151
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,540
Do you tell?

152
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,540
Same situation?

153
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,540
Yeah, I had a shrimp incident.

154
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:33,980
I went to the grocery store and they had like a thing of ceviche in a plastic like one of

155
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,820
those like the grab and go fridge.

156
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:43,500
I bought ceviche from the grab and go and then ate it and the shrimp was just like mealy

157
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,220
and like it dissolved in my mouth and I was like I can't eat that.

158
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:53,460
And I spent like five dollars on it and like had to throw it out.

159
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,940
- The shrimp was pretty fucked up.

160
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,620
These meatballs looked like,

161
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,440
it looked like it was like a creature.

162
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,620
One of them still had a tail poking out of the top.

163
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,820
- Well that's a garnish.

164
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,660
The tail is a garnish.

165
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,140
- No, no, it was like stuck,

166
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:08,620
it was like a full shrimp that didn't get mashed up

167
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,460
in the meatball.

168
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,120
- Oh, okay. - It was sticking out.

169
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,220
I think there was a big eye on one side as well.

170
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,980
(laughing)

171
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,380
- A shrimp eye?

172
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,300
- No, a human eye.

173
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,900
- A human eye.

174
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,740
- Yeah.

175
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:26,540
A shrimp with a human eye was poking out of your meatball?

176
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,540
Yeah, pretty much.

177
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,540
It was very scary.

178
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,540
And there were a hundred of them on your table?

179
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:32,340
There was a hundred to a hundred thousand.

180
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,140
And they each had an eye and a tail?

181
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,300
Yeah, they each had an eye and they looked at me and they were talking to me the entire

182
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
time.

183
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,300
And I ate so much of it.

184
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,140
Why do you keep eating it?

185
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,420
Because I was like, I'm going to fucking, okay, here's the fucked up part.

186
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,940
I was like, oh my God, dude, they put so much food on this table.

187
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:52,360
Like, I have to eat it all because this has got to be like $200 worth of food.

188
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
You ate it?

189
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,840
I ate like as much as I could.

190
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:01,560
I stuffed myself with these disgusting cold shrimp meatballs and then I get to the front

191
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,760
and I hand the guy my ticket and he like does some math, hands it back.

192
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,560
The entire thing was $28.

193
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
Whoa.

194
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,720
I gotta fucking, I gotta go to this place.

195
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,440
We didn't eat like half of these fucking shrimp.

196
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,840
No, don't go there.

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm saying do not go there.

198
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,160
It's good. It's good. It was fucking evil today. They did something and also it was

199
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:32,600
it was so it was suspicious because they at some point this is what was

200
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,760
suspicious about it at one point you know we're sitting there eating our

201
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:41,240
shrimp meatballs and then I look up and I noticed that everybody else is eating

202
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,760
like delicious noodles like nobody else has anything even remotely close to what

203
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,300
we had they didn't give us a like everybody everything else had a menu

204
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,340
that they were looking at so we walked in sat down and then they just like dumped

205
00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:01,100
the like bad shrimp you might have said the bad food table I must have had it

206
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,940
like a shrimp it's like the shrimp themed table or something like the

207
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,460
shrimp lovers delight that would be a good they should have that like it like

208
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,700
I mean a hell yeah like if you should like walk into McDonald's and you sit at

209
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,100
a table it's like oh if you sit at this table they bring you like five McChickens

210
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:21,980
That's like a chicken table you could sit it that way I never have to look at the menu or go order you sit where you

211
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,260
Want the food from you just get McChickens just and then you just keep coming

212
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,540
You could get up your flow and something different

213
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,340
Don't you think that those other people are table eating? You know noodles maybe ask for those noodles?

214
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,740
Option I was

215
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,940
To the server like I couldn't I couldn't I was buried in shrimp. Yeah, I literally they couldn't hear me if I yelled

216
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,400
I was struck. They needed to call the fire department. I was covered in shrimp. I swear to God

217
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,660
It was a fucking nightmare

218
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:55,820
And then there was like one thing that didn't have shrimp in it and we all just like fought over it like it was like a

219
00:11:55,820 --> 00:12:01,060
Big point of contention at the lunch. Oh wait you like you didn't get anything, but shrimp is what you're saying

220
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:08,020
It was literally all shrimp actually the one thing that I said I'd be in heaven it was it was sharp

221
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,220
- Shumai, which is like--

222
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,220
- Is it shumai shrimp?

223
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,620
- Shumai has shrimp in it.

224
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,460
- Yeah.

225
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,280
- Shumai is shrimp.

226
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

227
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:20,060
It was pork with like a little less shrimp on it

228
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,440
than most of the other shit.

229
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,820
But it was still shrimpy and it just felt,

230
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,980
dude, I like walked around smelling my own burps

231
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,740
and wanting to vomit all day.

232
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,460
- Dude, I fucking, I love eating,

233
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,740
like shrimp is my favorite food.

234
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:32,380
- Shrimp is like--

235
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,120
- Put you through the shrimp gauntlet.

236
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,860
- Shrimp is one of those fucking, yeah,

237
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,180
I will take you there and put you

238
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,900
the $30 shrimp gauntlet. I'll fucking, I'll pass with flying colors. You will not defeat the boss.

239
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:48,860
I will defeat the boss level of shrimp. No, no, no, no. I do feel like if I had eaten the entire thing

240
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:54,780
like they would have brought out like a, like a, like a bigger shrimp. Yeah, like the shrimp from

241
00:12:54,780 --> 00:13:00,060
like the like Bubba Gump logo. Oh my god, I did that thing in a heartbeat. Are you kidding me?

242
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,660
To defeat and fight. I'd fucking, I'd destroy that thing. Patrick, you wanna go to Bubba Gump with me

243
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:12,460
in Cancun? Yes. Okay, I'm going to go to Cancun. Oh my god, I went to, so I think I've talked about

244
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:19,900
this before, but I went to a Bubba Gump in Universal Studios Orlando with my ex-girlfriend

245
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:31,100
and it was just like me and her and then like this Australian family. The way that Bubba Gump works

246
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,900
is they put you in a different like section like quadrant section things like there's like

247
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,980
different spots in a bubblegum. They put you in different quadrant sections. So it's like

248
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,460
the shrimp zone it's the same system from the dim sum place where you sit that's where they

249
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,820
what they bring. It's one of those well no it's just like a weird thing where they put us in this

250
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,220
like room and it was just me and this me my ex-girlfriend at a table and then an Australian

251
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,220
at Bubba Gump in China.

252
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,220
(laughter)

253
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,220
This is the worst dim sum ever.

254
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,220
(laughter)

255
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,220
It was us at this

256
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,220
fucking Bubba Gump and we're in this room

257
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,220
and the

258
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,220
you know at Bubba Gump it's a

259
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,220
Forrest Gump themed restaurant

260
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,220
so like

261
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,220
Do people think you work there?

262
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,220
Yes. No, they uh

263
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,220
the waiter comes out and

264
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,220
starts like, he's like alright well

265
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:27,900
You know, while you wait, um, you know, they're playing like Forrest Gump on every TV, we're like watching it.

266
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,560
While you wait, we can do some Forrest Gump trivia, and he starts like doing trivia.

267
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,960
The fucking Australian family has never seen Forrest Gump.

268
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:47,360
So, it's me, and it's just my table and this family who has never seen Forrest Gump.

269
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,320
I find out then

270
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:57,220
She's also never seen Forrest Gump, so I had to just do Forrest Gump trivia by myself

271
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:03,940
Until I got my food. So you did work there. Yeah, how dare they you don't get to go there

272
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,380
I feel like if you didn't want to do the trivia you could have just stayed silent

273
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:09,380
I don't think you had to do trivia

274
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,380
Until your food got there

275
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,380
You know I felt bad

276
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,380
I felt bad this dude came into the room

277
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Yeah I could have fucking done that

278
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:19,380
You could have been like I don't want to do trivia

279
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,260
that's a requirement for their job like

280
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,660
yes I have to do this. If somebody walks in and is doing

281
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,740
fucking trivia at you like yeah they

282
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,900
have to fucking do that. I feel like he

283
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,860
would have gotten in trouble if I like

284
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,060
nobody wanted the trivia. I'm sure that's what was going through your head when you when you were

285
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,380
spouting off your favorite Forrest Gump facts

286
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,820
for 15 minutes straight with no

287
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,220
interruption. Look you know what? The guy wasn't even doing trivia.

288
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,260
He came in to take your order and you just

289
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:47,380
immediately started rattling off facts about Forrest Gump.

290
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,980
what though I fucking I aced that quiz that's that's one of the first quizzes

291
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,220
I've ever gotten an A on. You aced the Forrest Gump quiz? I did. You know I guess all the

292
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:03,500
questions are like what is Forrest Gump's girlfriend's name? Yeah it's a quiz

293
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,780
that like Forrest Gump could answer and you yeah that's great. Pat walking into the

294
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:14,160
Bubba Gump shrimp company is like is like walking into like a Best Buy in a

295
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:23,600
blue polo shirt. He just feels like he fits in so perfectly. Yeah, that's how I felt at

296
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:29,800
Margaritaville last night. Oh yeah, Margaritaville. Oh wait, just speaking of like fucked up food,

297
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:37,280
I ate at a British restaurant and like a couple days ago, not really a restaurant, it was like

298
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:43,760
a bar but it had food, and I ordered something called bubble and squeak. It was a pub, I believe

299
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,980
That's what they call it. I ordered something off of the menu that was called Bubble and

300
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,120
Squeak and it was one of the worst things I've ever eaten.

301
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,180
What is it?

302
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,580
It's cabbage and potatoes.

303
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,060
Yeah, it's like a quiche.

304
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,060
And some mystery...

305
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,980
No, it's nothing like quiche. It was literally cabbage, potatoes, and a disgusting third

306
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,940
root vegetable that just like...

307
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,300
They usually put an egg on top of it. Did you get an egg?

308
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,060
I didn't get any eggs, dude. It tasted like shit.

309
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
That's the squeak.

310
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,060
The squeak is the cabbage.

311
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,060
The squeak is the cabbage.

312
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:12,060
Because the chicken squeaks.

313
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,060
This chicken doesn't fucking squeak, especially not an egg.

314
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,560
An egg squeaks too.

315
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
Yeah, an egg can squeak.

316
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,560
If you like, polish an egg, it can make a squeaking noise while you're rubbing it.

317
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,060
Mm-hmm.

318
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,060
What?

319
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,560
Checkmate, bitch.

320
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,560
Checkmate.

321
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,560
That's not checkmate. You put yourself in checkmate.

322
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,560
Cameron got you.

323
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,060
Yeah, I checkmated you.

324
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,560
You checked out your mate because she's your boyfriend.

325
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,060
And a potato looks like a bubble.

326
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
And a potato looks like a bubble.

327
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:40,560
That is true. That's, I believe the potato is the bubble.

328
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,560
The bubble is the boiling water that you put the potatoes in.

329
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Well, they don't serve it with the boiling water, so it's that a potato looks like a bubble.

330
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Okay, good point. I've been chest-mated.

331
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
What's the squeak, though? It's the cabbage, right?

332
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,560
The squeak is the cabbage.

333
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,560
Okay. Anyway, that's fucking terrible. Talk about Margaritaville, though. I do want to hear about those.

334
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,560
So, I went to Margaritaville with Ben and Jacques from Seeking Derangements,

335
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:11,560
and Clark from group project and a couple other people.

336
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,500
- Which podcast were they from?

337
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,340
- I don't know.

338
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,120
I don't even know if they had podcasts.

339
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,040
- Can you not shout them out?

340
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:18,880
I think Jack's hating them.

341
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,600
- I wanted to give them shout outs

342
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,440
'cause they're my friends.

343
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,640
- No, he hates me.

344
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,480
- Oh yeah.

345
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,300
- Who?

346
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,140
- Jack.

347
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,980
- Oh, Jack.

348
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,840
- Oh yeah, Jack Kashubia, yeah.

349
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,680
- Good point.

350
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,520
- I kept replying to their--

351
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,600
- All right, so let's censor out their name.

352
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,760
- Wait, how did you get Block?

353
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,120
- So Ben and Boop from--

354
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:42,120
So when they were like, I think it was you guys turning out the promo for the live show.

355
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:48,120
I think I kept replying like, "No thanks" in an angry emoji.

356
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,120
And then I went to check the account and I was blocked.

357
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,120
And I was like, "Damn, I was joking."

358
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,120
But yeah, I was hanging out with them.

359
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,120
And you know, Margaritaville is a fucked up place.

360
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,440
The restaurant or the real place?

361
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Both.

362
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,560
Uh, we tried to go, like, up the stairs and, uh, we got yelled at.

363
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:17,240
And then me and Clark were like the- Clark was wearing, like, a wig the whole time.

364
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,760
What was the wig?

365
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,320
It was like a gray wig to make him look like an old man.

366
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,000
We went there with the intention- so Clark found out that there's a synagogue in Margaritaville

367
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,080
because the place where the Margaritaville resort was put in Times Square had a synagogue

368
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,080
in it and I think like legally it has to have a synagogue. So there is a Margaritaville synagogue

369
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:48,080
and Clark wanted to go there to go to the Rosh Hashanah services the next day and we ended up

370
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:56,560
like we were pretty much asked to leave. We were like about to go and then like somebody

371
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
did you do to the synagogue?

372
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
what did you do to the synagogue?

373
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,560
what?

374
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,560
what did you do to the synagogue?

375
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
did you wipe it off the face of the planet?

376
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:08,560
the synagogue is not built yet

377
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,560
the synagogue does not exist yet

378
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
yeah, because you wiped it off the face of the earth

379
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,560
you completely

380
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,560
desecrated the synagogue

381
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,560
with a weapon

382
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,560
of mass destruction

383
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,560
you completely destroyed it

384
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,560
yeah, why did you do that?

385
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,760
don't know what kind of answer is that? I was bored. It was a full synagogue. I said I was

386
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:40,160
bored. That's not good enough for me. Alright, well, I'll figure out a better excuse later.

387
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,000
But Clark insists that we were kicked out because somebody came up to us and said "have a good

388
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,200
night everybody" and then like three security guards popped up behind them. So I think we

389
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,120
were asked to leave sounds like you guys are scared. How do you know there's no security

390
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,420
guards? You're already, I mean it's already a costume night, one of you is wearing a wig.

391
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,860
It could be three, it could be just three men in business suits going to the Margaritaville

392
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:11,980
resort. Yeah, maybe they just got off their job as security for, I don't know, the best

393
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:15,740
band in the world and then they just want to go to Margaritaville and enjoy themselves.

394
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:19,580
the best one in the world. Red Hot Chili Peppers.

395
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:28,620
Had a lot of fun with that group. Yeah. Would love to get kicked out

396
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,540
of Margaritaville again with them. I'm sure you would if you went back. This

397
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:37,700
time if we go back we have to wear more disguises. You know like

398
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Clark was in the wig. I think maybe we switch it up. We all wear wigs. Wait, why are you guys

399
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
wearing disguises. What do you guys think?

400
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,700
Is it so you can get into the synagogue?

401
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
Yeah.

402
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
Why do you...

403
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,700
You already did enough damage.

404
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,700
What disguise would I wear to get in there?

405
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,700
I feel like visually, like, I don't know that it matters to wear a disguise to get in,

406
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
but I'm curious to know what your plans are to like, you know...

407
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
You know, as a...

408
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,700
How would you hide your facial features?

409
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,700
Like any prosthetics on your face that you're thinking of using?

410
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,700
As somebody who just learned that they were Colombian,

411
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,700
I think maybe just like a Colombian flag yarmulke.

412
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,620
That's good. I think maybe that's my only disguise.

413
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:18,620
Because I'm not ashamed to be a Jewish Columbian man.

414
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:24,660
Look, regardless of

415
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,300
what time my

416
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:33,060
my grandfather moved to Columbia,

417
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,620
you know, my grandfather, it doesn't matter what

418
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,780
time in the 40s that he moved

419
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,300
there you know that in nineteen forty five uh...

420
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,940
the unanimous is a hitler

421
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,820
yeah

422
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,500
patricia

423
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,780
it also has been a girl

424
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,260
yes that's right what you're you're cut your beautiful columbian girl like the

425
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,780
mall on the other hand

426
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:02,580
you're fucking going all over you now pat and you won't be able to you know you

427
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,460
have been three c_o_ patricio

428
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,380
their guard

429
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,860
Oh my god. Can I put you in a little dress?

430
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,860
That name just made me squirt a bit.

431
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,860
[Laughter]

432
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,860
Fuck, I'm squirting.

433
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,860
I don't know. Oh my god.

434
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,860
I think you have such a tight butt.

435
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,860
Me? I bet I could bounce my penis off your ass.

436
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Oh my god. What?

437
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,860
My butt or my butthole?

438
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,860
Which one is loose?

439
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,860
The butthole. Why is your butthole loose?

440
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,860
Because I keep coins in there.

441
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,860
[Laughter]

442
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:33,860
[Laughter]

443
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Is that what you're in disguise? You're breaking into the Margaritaville reserve?

444
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,860
Wait, that's your way to get into the synagogue is put a bunch of coins up your ass?

445
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,860
Come on, bro.

446
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,860
That's not what I said. I didn't say that was my disguise.

447
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,860
They say, "Hey, we kicked you out last week." You say, "Uh-uh-uh."

448
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,860
How about that?

449
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:59,860
And I just jump up. I do jumping jacks.

450
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,860
Sit all over the floor

451
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:07,380
You do a reverse Mario you jump up and a coin a big coin

452
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,920
Like I shit I shit on the floor and then like I'm like, oh my god. I'm so sorry. Oh, oh, I'm so sorry

453
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,180
I'm gonna throw up and then just a bunch of coins jump out of my mouth like fucking like Sonic getting hit

454
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,620
fucking rings in his mouth.

455
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,620
It's true.

456
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,580
Yeah, I guess asked and answered.

457
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,580
In his pocket.

458
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,580
He doesn't have a pocket.

459
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
He's naked, you fucking idiot.

460
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,580
He has a mouth and he has, he might have something in the back, who knows.

461
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,580
Don't search Sonic Pocket.

462
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:39,580
I'm searching Sonic Pocket.

463
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:45,700
I see you searching Sonic Pocket right now.

464
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,980
Sonic doesn't have a pocket and if it was his pocket, he wouldn't be big enough to keep

465
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,980
all his damn rings.

466
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,980
It would be too small to fit even one ring, let alone a thousand.

467
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,980
Those rings are as big as his fucking body.

468
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,300
Which is how many I would score.

469
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,300
They're big rings.

470
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,300
You would never score a thousand.

471
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,500
over a thousand rings and I saw him put them in his mouth when I scored them

472
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,540
because I got the special version of the game that shows you where they go.

473
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:07,020
Hang on I got it. Really? Where'd you get that? It shows an x-ray of Sonic's stomach while you're

474
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,700
playing so you can see all the rings in there. Are you serious dude? I'm serious. I got the

475
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:18,860
Sonic Pocket. Rule 34.us. Okay yeah. That's nice. Damn that is crazy. Oh okay. This is where he's

476
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,420
hiding the rings. This is humongous ass. Oh and he's playing uh what is that Sonic

477
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
Shadow the Hedgehog?

478
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Alright, here's the tags.

479
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,420
So Sonic is playing, it says Pocket Mania, he's back.

480

This is honestly, like, you know, there's a lot of tags on here that are like, you know, big balls, uh, humanoid feet, etc.

502
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,100
But the, the tag that's really skeeving me out here is that there's a tag that's just looking at another, looking at another.

503
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:43,100
There's also one just called "inside".

504
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,500
Yeah, and above inside it's "Imminent Sex"

505
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
*laughter*

506
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,500
"Imminent Sex"

507
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,100
What does that mean?

508
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:53,620
Oh my god, veiny penis

509
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,380
Humanoid penis, I don't see why-

510
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,580
Imminent sex has at least-

511
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
Dipstick tail

512
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:04,300
That is like 20- over 20,000 tags

513
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:09,380
It must have sucked so much to be like a caveman who wanted to see this so bad

514
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:15,140
Yeah, yeah, caveman who was like like, oh, I wish I could see sonic fuck. Yeah

515
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:21,260
Well, he's no just like a caveman looking at like a rock and he was like, oh someone should draw that with like a really

516
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,700
Wet penis, but yeah, I don't have a ship put up, but they should put a bulge on it. Yeah. Yeah

517
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:33,660
Gum is also a bad hashtag on there gum. Yeah, I can't figure out

518
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,860
What about this rule 34 sonic thing is gum? Oh, he's blowing

519
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,500
I was so distracted by the humongous blue ass. I didn't realize he's blowing bubbles.

520
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,340
I was watching the first, looking at the first one.

521
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,220
How do you butt?

522
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,380
Hyper butt?

523
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,740
Oh this is, don't click on hyper butt. Do not click on...

524
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,540
What?

525
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,940
This is not good dude.

526
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,860
Oh wow.

527
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,380
This is crazy.

528
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,180
Oh my god.

529
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,580
And this is all for free?

530
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,780
There's like...

531
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,940
There's like Pokemon?

532
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,060
I don't have to pay for this?

533
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:13,920
This is one, some fucked up Pokemon or something has eaten every Pokemon and is shitting out

534
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,420
their bones in this one.

535
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,100
Out of their huge butt.

536
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,980
I'm gonna send this to you guys.

537
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,980
I just found...

538
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,140
What do y'all think of that?

539
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Who's this?

540
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,140
Which Pokemon is this?

541
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,140
I have no idea.

542
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,140
That is not a Pokemon.

543
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,140
What is it?

544
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,140
It's shitting out bones.

545
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,140
What the fuck?

546
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Yeah, what is it?

547
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,140
Wait, there's more.

548
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:36,700
Why did you assume this was a Pokemon?

549
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,580
Because it was, there's outlines of all the Pokemon in her stomach.

550
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,580
That's not, those are bones.

551
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:41,580
What Pokemon do you see?

552
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,580
What Pokemon bones do you see?

553
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,580
Yeah, I don't see any Pokemon in here.

554
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
No, in her stomach, look, Gengar.

555
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
Where?

556
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
In her stomach, not in, in her ass.

557
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,580
Oh, yeah, okay, I see that.

558
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
Oh, I see.

559
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
Yeah.

560
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
Okay.

561
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:51,580
So I just assumed, and then there's another one with no outlines.

562
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
Oh, yeah.

563
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,260
It's a smoother version of the same photo.

564
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,580
Yeah, I think, I think over here is, uh, what's his name?

565
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:03,540
Uh, well I can totally see Dratini over here.

566
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,140
Oh, this butt has hair all over it.

567
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,140

00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,140

It's a giant evil woman with a hairy ass who farts on you and then crushes your head with

582
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,260
her hyper ass.

583

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,980
Yeah.

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,660
She's an elf too.

That's your thing.

587
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,180
I mean, these people make so much money off this shit.

588
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:57,180
It's insane.

589
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,740
Do they make money or are they doing this for the love of the game?

590
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,780
There's a ton of like Patreons and shit just for people who make this.

591
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,780
Oh yeah.

618
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,780
Some clam chowder one of the worst things I've found

619
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,820
What is this one?

620
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,860
Is this the dog one? Oh?

621
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,140
Yep, it is the dog one. What is this? No you saw it. That's from Larry and Steve

622
00:31:54,140 --> 00:32:00,700
I think Larry and Steve was Seth MacFarlane's project that he had on like the, it was like

623
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,260
some Hanna-Barbera thing, and he had that on there before Family Guy.

624
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,900
And that was basically the basis for Family Guy.

625
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,020
So somebody was so into Larry and Steve, they drew Bordo.

626
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,180
There's only two things with Larry and Steve, and the other one is him.

627
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,220
Yes, it's Larry fucking Brian.

628
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,220
Yeah.

629
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,220
[Laughter]

630
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,420
Hey, at least it's two dogs, right?

631
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,420
At least it's not a dog and a person.

632
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,700
Oh, here's one here. This is a Lois Lewis Griffin getting

633
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,460

636
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,900
This is that you know this being fucked this one is making me think

637
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:55,400
How easy how easy it is to animate family guy if you can just animate like

638
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,820

00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:04,620

the same thing over and over again.

644
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,060
Oh, what the hell? It's like a love letter.

645
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,060
Oh man, the same thing that makes me cry is this Minecraft Steve again.

646
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,060
Here, okay.

647
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,060
It's the Mexican flag,

648
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,060
with his eyes crossed and his tongue

649
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,060
out, and he has

650
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,060
he's holding like a rosary

651
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,060
and he's getting just completely destroyed

652
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,060
by a red guy.

653
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,060
I don't like that. Who's the red guy?

654
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:44,060
I don't know, I'm trying to figure, probably the Chinese flag, right?

655
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,060
It says Russia on the left.

656
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Oh, okay. Oh, so it's, okay.

657
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:54,980
Oh no dude, I searched Santa Claus and there's one of a girl sucking Santa's dick and then a dog fucking her

early Daz 3D 2.

670
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Maybe I talked about this before. I got this

671
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
porn game that me and Juvia played

672
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
and we just started making

673
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
people we knew in it.

674
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
She will punish them.

675
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
We made Rex in it

676
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:50,900
And just gave him humongous tits and then just took a bunch of like screenshots of him. Yo lingerie. Oh wait

677
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:57,980
I'm really Rex say Rick. Oh, yeah. Well yesterday is Rex's birthday. So no what's today?

678
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:02,680
What are you so so fuck that shit? I'm not saying happy birthday, but I will say happy birthday today

679
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:06,260
But when this comes out when this comes out he said

680
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:09,340
No, sir. All right

681
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,520
Yeah, are we starting with the Justin Bieber one

682
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:23,200
We can. I'll do. I also found one. This might be more. This one is about gaming. If you guys

683
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,600
want to do a game. Yeah. Okay. I like gaming. So we're on this website called VIX.com, which

684
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:33,680
is basically the biggest news network for the Spanish speaking world as far as I'm aware.

685
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,360
It's pretty much, as far as Jubio has told us, it's basically like CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and

686
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,120
CBS like wrapped into one.

687
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,120
Yeah.

688
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,800
And like it's basically where everyone gets every single piece of news from, right?

689
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,680
Including like, uh, here for example, like I'm, this is like a huge story in Mexico right

690
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,680
now.

691
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,640
A woman can breastfeed her baby through the armpit.

692
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,440
It affects 10% of women.

693
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Yeah.

694
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
This is like huge, right?

695
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,640
Can you send me that link?

696
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,560
Yeah, no problem.

697
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
I mean, here's another really big story.

698
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,640
Queen Elizabeth epically trolled some tourists who did not recognize her.

699
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,360
We have the story.

700
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,600
Whoa.

701
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,800
This website is all in Spanish so we're using Google Translate to look at it.

702
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,160
Yeah, because I can't speak Spanish.

703
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,080
I can, I just don't want to embarrass Cameron and Pat since I can't.

704
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,080
Here's one.

705
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,080
I appreciate that.

706
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:27,840
Here's a, I don't want to spoil this, but click this link here.

707
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:31,600
What are we clicking here?

708
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,080
How to make paper boats.

709
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,040
Yeah, I mean that's like one of the biggest things in Mexico right now.

710
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,860
It's a huge story that I noticed on this website that's going on right now is top 10 blue drinks

711
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:43,860
has been really big.

712
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,860
Yeah, that's like...

713
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
Wait, I want to see the one.

714
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,520
I want to see the top 10 blue drinks.

715
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Yeah, I bet you are.

716
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,040
That's why it's selling so well in Mexico.

717
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,240
Yeah, let's look at this one.

718
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
Let's look at this one first then.

719
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,040
They know exactly what you want.

720
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,320
The top 10 blue drinks.

721
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,360
Okay, here, let me send this link over to you guys.

722
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,840
Number one's got to be water.

723
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,400
That's not true.

724
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,440
No, no, no, no, no.

725
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Agua.

726
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,240
In the world of drinks, there are thousands of delicious varieties.

727
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,800
We always talk about the best drinks for this or that occasion, or the drinks to accompany

728
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,560
such a dish, etc.

729
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,640
But we rarely refer to the immensity of drinks that can be made with just one color, blue.

730
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,760
Check out this top 10 blue drinks that you are sure to love.

731
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,760
I would really like to just completely skip this list except for number one on this list.

732
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,640
Number one is Smurf.

733
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,640
Yup.

734
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,640
What is Smurf?

735
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
No way, it is.

736
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
I have no idea.

737
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
I have no idea.

738
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,640
Smurf?

739
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,720
Smurf cocktail is served in a tall glass decorated with a lemon wedge and made with strawberry

740
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,320
vodka, blue carousel, lemon juice and lemon lime soda.

741
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,720
That sounds really good.

742
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
I want to try that.

743
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,720
Sounds amazing.

744
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,720
I want to drink the Smurf.

745
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,320
I think this list is just cheating because everything here is a cocktail made out of

746
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
like blue carousel.

747
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,320
Yeah, it's true.

748
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,320
Yeah.

749
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
How about where the soda's at?

750
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,320
Yeah.

751
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
What's a blue soda?

752
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,720
What's a blue soda?

753
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,800
Blue soda is like the one that they had at Friendly's.

754
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,920
Yeah, like a blue raspberry soda.

755
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,400
The blue soda at Friendly's is probably one of the best sodas in the world.

756
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,400
Blue Mountain Dew.

757
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,400
There's a blue mountain dew.

758
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,840
Wait, fuck you.

759
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Blue Mountain Dew.

760
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,840
Voltage.

761
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,840
Voltage.

762
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,600
So you want to suck my cock now, don't you?

763
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,600
There's also blue game fuel.

764
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,160
This is one of the smartest things I've ever seen.

765
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:33,640
we get into the main list. This is three alcoholic beverages that leave the least

766
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,320
hangover. And so number three is wine, number two is white drinks, and number

767
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:45,880
one, best drink for no hangover, drinks with a lot of ice.

768
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:53,600
So genius. Oh here's one, here's, wait, hold on, we saw that, we saw the blue drinks.

769
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:58,140
Here's a list of red drinks here.

770
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,320
This is breaking news.

771
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,940
You hear someone speaking Spanish on the street, you can go up to them and say, "Have you ever

772
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,080
heard of what's going on with the drinks Rojo?"

773
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,120
They'll know exactly what you're talking about.

774
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:19,240
Yo baby Rojo.

775
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,000
This doesn't really have a lot of...

776
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Yeah, anyway, this list here.

777
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,000
There's only three drinks and there's one drink called Red Liquid.

778
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That's the number one drink is called Red Liquid.

779
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
It's two ounces of tequila, one ounce of natural strawberry juice, one ounce of pink grapefruit juice.

780
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I don't care about what goes into Red Liquid.

781
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Yeah, can you just shut up?

782
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Here, so this is the list.

783
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
You know what, I'm screenshotting this page.

784
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,320
I'm gonna make red liquid. I'm not bad it's lag six situations that only real

785
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,920
gamers understand this is again this is huge news. This is all me. Yeah this is

786
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,440
2008. TV shows are being interrupted yeah for a breaking news

787
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:11,560
bulletin from a guy who looks exactly like Juvio. I don't look like that.

788
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,520
Since 2008 August 29th was marked as gamers day by specialized magazines that wanted to

789
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,760
celebrate the gaming community around the world. Video games are becoming more

790
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,560
popular and accepted. It has even become a career for some people. It says some

791
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,120
people on that. Not this fucker. It says some people. That is not why they cease to be

792
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,880
enjoyable casually and that is why we bring six situations that only gamers

793
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:41,120
understand. The first one here, B.O.G. O.G. is part of the English slang that stands for

794
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:44,360
original gangster and is used to refer to people who have been followers of

795
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,920
something in particular for a long time. The term evolved and can now also be

796
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,440
translated as old school, old school, or has its adaptation to video games as old

797
00:40:52,440 --> 00:41:00,600
gamer or original gamer. I'm an OG. What's your first game Cameron?

798
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:10,400
I probably have to be like tag, hide and seek, one of those. Probably like Jacks.

799
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:18,620
yeah Jack's was good online Jack's yeah yep yeah I was really into online jump

800
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,720
rope you know you know that that that thing where it looks like a lawnmower

801
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,320
for a baby and you push around and it pops I was really into that online that

802
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,880
was a good one yeah wait wait online online rock-paper-scissors

803
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,640
you remember online pretend was really good you guys ever play you guys ever

804
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:43,360
play ball in a cup online? Oh my god, dude. I was pretty much high score on it. Yeah. We

805
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,320
didn't have that one down here. What's this about? Really? You didn't have ball in a cup

806
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:50,760
online? No, we didn't. It's pretty much, I mean, it's just like a cool game. I guess

807
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,280
you're not like an OG like me though, but it's just fine. I started gaming on the Nintendo

808
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,440
64, so I guess I'm not a real gamer. Yeah, you're right. I started on the Nintendo 1.

809
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,000
I didn't even have graphics or games when I was gaming. It was like literally like...

810
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,480
personal video. When I started gaming I wasn't even alive yet. That's how early I was gaming.

811
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:16,480
I was poop when I started gaming. I was just shit in my dad's ball sack. A pile of poop

812
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,480
outside. That they forgot about. That's what I was for so long. I was like a bug in the

813
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,640
dirt back before I was born. Then I crawled up somewhere I shouldn't have gone. I was

814
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:34,860
a stinky pocket of air and then I was gaming. I was basically this like

815
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,280
brown ball of slime that was just flying around everywhere trying to get

816
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,100
into people's houses and stuff. Yeah, I was like a piece of hair on a fly

817
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,920
like that was like all I was

818
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,480
and I got bored. I was just kind of this spec that was like just kind of

819
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,880
a spec of dirt. There was nothing just lying around kind of just a

820
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,400
chill and then I was more. I was like a game. I was like a piece of ice

821
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:06,420
a fridge. Yes I'm pretty much an original gamer. Number two, F in chat. What does that mean?

822
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:15,420
I've seen Jubio drop some F's in chat. I've seen Jubio. Everybody go and drop some F's

823
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:24,940
in the chat for Jubio right now. Twitch.tv/pod about list. Podcast about list. Podcast about

824
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,580
Yes, make sure to give them all the Fs you got.

825
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:34,660
In recent years, with the popularization of video game streaming, F became a meme used

826
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,820
by gamers and non-gamers for different situations of failure or shame.

827
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:44,420
However, only true OGs know the origin of the F, which was a command used in Call of

828
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:49,800
Duty Advanced Warfare that was pushed to show respect at the funerals of fallen soldiers.

829
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,500
F for those who thought it meant fail.

830
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,500
Is it really that recent?

831
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,000
Yep.

832
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:56,500
Yeah.

833
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah.

834
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Call of Duty Advanced Warfare?

835
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,500
I think that's not a very recent game, Caleb.

836
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
I think it's like almost 10 years ago.

837
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,000
Really?

838
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Advanced Warfare was uh...

839
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,500
That came out in 2020.

840
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,000
Yeah.

841
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,500
No.

842
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,000
No.

843
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,500
Yeah, it came out in 2020.

844
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
That's when FNChat started.

845
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:14,000
Really?

846
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
It came out in 2014.

847
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
2020 actually.

848
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,500
2022.

849
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
That still is not...

850
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
That's 2014.

851
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,500
Not recent enough.

852
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
2014 it came out.

853
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:27,500
I know dude, I- Modern Warfare, the like first Modern Warfare came out in like 2007 or some fucked up shit.

854
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:30,000
Oh, it's a Kevin Spacey call, did he?

855
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Oh, that's the one?

856
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Oh, yeah!

857
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, they should like, they should release all the assets for that game so that you can just do whatever you want to his body.

858
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,500
Yeah, you can just put- you can get a Kevin Spacey 3D model from that guy.

859
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,500
I'm sure, I'm sure there's like data miners or whatever who have figured out how to get it.

860
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:52,580
it, but I think maybe we should like, you remember like Interactive Buddy on Newgrounds?

861
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,500
They should do that with the Kevin Spacey model.

862
00:44:55,500 --> 00:45:00,620
They should release a remaster and they have no Russian, but the airport is just Kevin Spacey.

863
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:02,060
Filled with Kevin Spaceys?

864
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,060
Yeah.

865
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:04,060
Yeah.

866
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,060
That would be a good way to show respect.

867
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,060
That would be good, yeah.

868
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:11,500
Yeah, just a million clones of Kevin Spacey in an airport asking each other how old they

869
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,900
are and you walk in with a machine gun.

870
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:15,900
Yeah.

871
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:16,900
Yeah.

872
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:22,660
I'm not bad, it's lag. If you are beaten in the game, it is unforgivable to accept the

873
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:28,380
opponent is better than you, so lag or internet delay is to blame for losing. That is why there

874
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:34,100
is the saying, "Video games don't make gamers violent, but lag does." I hate lag.

875
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:38,780
I actually do. GBO can attest that I get so mad.

876
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,940
Kaelthas lived in New York for 10 years now, and he didn't think of getting a better ISP

877
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,940
until yesterday.

878
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:52,200
And then I yeah, and I didn't even get a better ISP because Fios won't fucking they think like I think my there must be like

879
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:58,380
A ton of lead in the walls here because they don't want to like replace anything or install Fios in my my apartment

880
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,380
I got I got Fios. Yeah

881
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:09,500
Fucking stupid and fat and yeah, they even have Fios in fucking Mexico. Oh you can use

882
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:13,100
These

883
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:19,540
These EOS guys would rather go from New York down to Mexico to install it at Juvio's house

884
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:25,400
Then go fucking like one mile down the street and put it in my fucking they wanted a vacation

885
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,340
They wanted to see the sights of Mexico. That's the thing. That's the thing. It's like beautiful down there

886
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:38,280
What I've seen in Breaking Bad it is beautiful and yellow and it's so yellow. It's golden. It's the most golden. Oh my god

887
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,280
It is very yellow.

888
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,840
It's the golden state in America.

889
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,120
Did you, have you ever met the evil brothers from Breaking Bad?

890
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:45,120
Do those guys live around you?

891
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:46,120
Yeah, the twins.

892
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
Do you know Gus Fring?

893
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,120
Yeah.

894
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,120
Yeah.

895
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,120
I went to school with him.

896
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,120
Do you know Tuco?

897
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,780
Dude, Tuco, that guy's crazy.

898
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,360
I would love to, if you, dude, if you know him, I'd love to hang out with him sometime.

899
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:57,360
Can you get me in with Tuco?

900
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:02,540
Do you know La Tortuga?

901
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,540
You know Hustle Tortuga?

902
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:06,280
I don't know any of these guys actually.

903
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:07,280
I was lying.

904
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,280
Well, I know Hustle Tortuga.

905
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,280
No, you don't.

906
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,280
I do.

907
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,280
Why?

908
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:13,280
Because I made him up.

909
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,280
Okay, next one.

910
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,280
Can't pause online.

911
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,560
How many times are we going to have to explain to parents that Nintendo cannot be paused if

912
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,920
we are playing online?

913
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,320
The child from China you are playing against is not going to wait for you to return from

914
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:27,280
the tortillas to continue the game.

915
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,400
Okay, okay.

916
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,760
This is one of those things that actually happens to me all the time.

917
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,360
I guess I do have to go purchase some tortillas from the store.

918
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,160
You have to go return from the tortillas.

919
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,120
Yeah, well...

920
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,120
Return from the tortillas?

921
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:46,120
What is the...

922
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,760
What the fuck does return from the tortillas mean?

923
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:52,160
You know, where they make the tortillas.

924
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,520
There's like tortillas stores?

925
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,960
Only real OGs go buy fresh tortillas.

926
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,520
Oh, I've been doing that.

927
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,520
If I could...

928
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,280
Actually, I could probably buy fresh tortillas somewhere around here.

929
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,280
They don't make them over there.

930
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,120
They don't have tortillas in America.

931
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,200
It's only, it's a secret recipe.

932
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,200
It's corn!

933
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:11,880
And it's only in Mexico.

934
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,440
It's pretty smart.

935
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,360
The child from China, I mean this kid is just lapping.

936
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,360
Huge.

937
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,800
I hate that guy.

938
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,640
Yeah, they're, just eat your tortillas later man.

939
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,640
Finish the damn game.

940
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,680
This Chinese kid is waiting on you.

941
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,800
It's a child actually.

942
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:39,080
of smash brothers. Deceptions. What? The translation says the disappointments.

943
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:42,160
Yeah I'm going with Google Translate I think. Yeah I don't really I mean I don't

944
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:46,200
know yeah. You're not like like you want a billion results when I tell you. Here

945
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:54,400
show me pictures of a naked woman right now. Yeah. A billion results right now.

946
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,760
Yeah I got it right here. Wow this is a long Google search. This is taking way longer

947
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:07,760
than Google. That's a car! That's not a naked woman, that's a car!

948
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,760
Smash Bros is characterized by adding characters from different franchises to

949
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,600
the game's catalog of fighters which has led fans to make requests and

950
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,960
predictions of their favorites. Sometimes the franchise... that's my own self. Don't...

951
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,760
I'm not naked, I'm not that naked. Damn, I look bowlegged. My ass... you can see it from the front.

952
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:26,760
(laughter)

953
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
You look so scary!

954
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,260
I have a lot of scary photos of myself.

955
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,500
Sometimes a franchise is surprised with important additions, but at other times it has been

956
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:38,060
downright disappointing.

957
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,720
How long are we going to have to wait to have Crash in Smash, Nintendo?

958
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,560
They can't have him in there because people will get confused.

959
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,400
They'll be like, "Is the game called Crash or is the character Smash?"

960
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,800
I would get confused if he was Star Fox.

961
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,520
Right, yeah.

962
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:53,520
Right?

963
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,960
Maybe I would think like he was like Lucas or Ness or something. Yeah

964
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:05,360
I was might like that though. He's moving really fast and I just saw the pants. I might think it was like Lucas or Ness

965
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,600
Hmm, or I might see like I don't know

966
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,160
I might think he was like the piranha plant if I saw I just saw the inside of his mouth

967
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,200
It could be the piranha plant. What's that?

968
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:21,400
What's that show that they would play on Telemundo and it's all the adults and they're dressed up like little kids. Oh

969
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,400
Oh, El Chavo?

970
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,400
Yeah, El Chavo.

971
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:33,400
I think if I, I think uh, I think Ness probably looks like that if you saw Ness in real life he'd look like El Chavo.

972
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,400
You think he looks like a homeless Mexican kid?

973
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,400
Yes.

974
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,400
Yes, I think that's exactly what he would look like.

975
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,400
This is a great show. I used to watch this a lot when I was a kid.

976
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,400
El Chavo?

977
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,400
Yeah.

978
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:57,840
I would watch El Chavo. I would watch El Chavo by accident and it always scared me.

979
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:04,040
How would you watch El Chavo? I would put it like 3 a.m. I'd be like channel surfing and

980
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:07,960
then I would like see that and it's like why like I don't understand the language

981
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,760
why are these grown-ups acting like little kids. So it was a horror show like

982
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,720
a scary show? It was like it was like accidentally seeing the Twilight Zone as

983
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,160
a kid. You thought it was like that David Lynch Rabbits thing? It's like Candle Cove dude.

984
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,080
You're like what the fuck is this? It's like one of the most beloved like Spanish speaking

985
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:32,080
shows of all time and just my stupid like American ass is just like "OH GOD WHAT THE FUCK IS

986
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:39,080
THAT?" It's like Candle Cove that like creepypasta thing where like you're like freaking out about

987
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:43,040
it and then the next morning you find out you were just watching static the whole time.

988
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:50,560
It does look like they are reusing the first season SNL set on this fucking thing.

989
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:51,960
It's true.

990
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,320
Yeah, no, it does look, it looks a lot like...

991
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,360
So they played homeless children.

992
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,000
I didn't know, the homeless aspect of that I had no idea.

993
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,720
So they live in like this, this like neighborhood, and El Chavo is the one homeless kid living

994
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:11,360
in like a little, like a barrel in the middle of the neighborhood.

995
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,020
to close the show

996
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,900
uh... distros run him and his

997
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,280
various adventures in his friends

998
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,900
and the people of the neighborhood like three times

999
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:25,600
world and there's the one guy is el chavo el chavo is the one that uh...

1000
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:28,340
he's got like huge like cheeks or whatever

1001
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,240
you know it was it was a very good at a child's cheeks

1002
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,460
no child's huge bouncing cheeks you know i look at the bottom of the government

1003
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:40,300

You're not going to learn literally a single thing from Ratatouille.

1035
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,060

Exactly.

1044
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,580
And who doesn't need a funny John Leguizamo type friend?

1045
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:40,860
If you don't want to be friends with the pest, you gotta go to the mental hospital.

1046
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:41,860
No cap.

1047
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:47,060
If you don't want to be friends with Luigi Mario, you disabled mentally.

1048
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,300
I can't lie to you.

00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:51,300
That's just how it is.

1050
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:52,300
That's the truth.

1051
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:58,500
Alright, 11 valid reasons to hate Justin Bieber blamelessly in front of his fans if he still

1052
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
has them.

1053
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,560
Number eleven, he has bad manners in his everyday life.

1054
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,760
Using toilets to relieve ourselves is something natural for everyone, but less

1055
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,100
so for the adolescent.

1056
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:10,220
Justin not only did not use the bathroom in a restaurant, but he also recorded

1057
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:13,200
himself while doing his things to later make his video public.

1058
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,420
Where would the funny part of all this be?

1059
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:16,380
In the toilet.

1060
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,540
I don't remember that. Justin Bieber taking shit in a restaurant?

1061
00:55:20,540 --> 00:55:23,020
He took a piss into like the mop

1062
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,660
and bucket at a restaurant and uh...

1063
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:27,180
and looked at the camera and said,

1064
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:29,180
"Hey yo, fuck Bill Clinton!"

1065
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:33,180
'Cause he was on some odd future shit in 2013.

1066
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,180
That kinda- he sounds great, dude.

1067
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:37,180
Yeah, that's like, kinda sick.

1068
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,180
Um...

1069
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,180
And on more than one occasion he was disrespectful.

1070
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,180
"Just as it is not advisable to tease and spit on your fans,

1071
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,180
it is not good to take advantage of them.

1072
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,180
Do you remember an unusual fact that he wanted to be hidden by his henchmen,

1073
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,180
but could not be left behind due to photographs taken at the exact moment?

1074
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:57,860
moment no one believed that the singer did not want to cut touch the girls

1075
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:04,220
bodice we are not stupid come on what the fuck it I don't know what this is but

1076
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:08,060
this means at all I think it's different like a bra yeah oh

1077
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:14,100
Julia what's a bodice it's like a bra for girls like a girl's bra I thought you

1078
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,500
know what genuinely thought there was a Spanish I think it's part of a dress I

1079
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:23,380
looked it up as part of a dress it's like a what about a bow vice instead of a

1080
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:24,380
What about Bo Dice?

1081
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,380
Yeah, a bovine.

1082
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:26,380
A Bo Bice?

1083
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,580
Remember Bo Bice from American Idol?

1084
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:29,580
No.

1085
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:30,580
Bo Bice?

1086
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:31,580
Bo Bice.

1087
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:32,580
Bo Bice?

1088
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:36,900
There was the same year as Bo Bice and Constantine?

1089
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:37,900
This guy's fucked up.

1090
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,900
Constantine whatever?

1091
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,140
What does Bo Bice look like now?

1092
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,140
He's got short hair.

1093
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:43,140
He's got sh- what?

1094
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,140
No.

1095
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,020
Yeah, shaved his head down.

1096
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,260
And choose this title yourselves.

1097
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:53,560
He already had his bad reputation in Argentina, but after his concert in the Latin American

1098
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:57,540
country he earned, he ended up earning the complete hatred of each of them and with much

1099
00:56:57,540 --> 00:56:58,540
much reason.

1100
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,140
Sweep the ground with the flag of that country?

1101
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,060
Disrespectful and ridiculous.

1102
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,060
Which number was that?

1103
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:09,220
That was number four, I'm just skipping around here.

1104
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:10,620
Number three, heartbroken.

1105
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:15,020
If you didn't know about this lousy Bieber gesture, it's about time you knew about it.

1106
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:19,300
An attitude of contempt that he had with a child with cancer, who after meeting him only

1107
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,780
managed to be disappointed.

1108
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:24,500
Despite the fact that this helped him get money for his foundation, the star did not reach

1109
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,260
even five minutes with the little one."

1110
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:31,140
I guess that is like a hard part about being like a famous celebrity, is that people with

1111
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:33,780
cancer just have to spend time with you.

1112
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,780
Yeah.

1113
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,820
That's also, I think that it's funny because that is the last person I would want around

1114
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,740
a little kid who's about to die.

1115
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:43,740
Is like a celebrity.

1116
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:49,860
a celebrity. Yeah, exactly. And also, like, if I was about to die, I would not be like,

1117
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:57,300
I need to spend my remaining moments with, like, John Cena. Like, that's crazy. I would

1118
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,620
try and kill the celebrity to leave my mark on the world, I think. Oh, that's actually

1119
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:08,540
a good idea, Juvia. If you just have, like, go tell, like, the WWE, like, listen, I'm

1120
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:13,020
nine years old, I have cancer, I'm going to die in, like, three weeks. What if you guys

1121
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:17,660
just like pulled me out of the audience like a like a like a folding chair in the

1122
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:23,980
middle of one of the matches and just beat the shit out of me until I fucking

1123
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:29,540
died. That would be so sick. That would be how if I was 11 with with like bone

1124
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:33,620
cancer that's exactly how I'd want to go out. Oh yeah. It's just like me completely

1125
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:39,300
beaten to death in the ring. I want Chris Jericho to throw me off a bridge.

1126
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:45,060
Yeah, yeah, bring me to the top of the fucking the the the cage match cage and

1127
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:51,060
toss me off like you're the Undertaker. If I get a terminal disease I

1128
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:55,160
would love to like be the mocap actor for Megatron getting his head ripped off in

1129
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,820
the next Transformers movie. Yeah, exactly. Like they put a big tennis ball on my head and then and then like

1130
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:04,640
the Rock or whoever just you know twist my head off. Leave a lasting legacy you

1131
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,860
know? Yeah. Like I just let those wrestlers get so fake at throwing

1132
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:14,080
so sick of throwing fake punches just let them land a couple of fucking crushing

1133
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:19,320
blows on my soft spot. Plus the bones are probably softer. Yeah way softer I'm gonna be

1134
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:24,240
pliable as fuck you could like do the backbreaker to me over and over and over again.

1135
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,760
Yeah and like I'm already fucking I might as well already be dead right I have

1136
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,280
like would I rather just waste away for the next three weeks in the hospital

1137
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,840
yeah and if you're worried it's like too much of a heel turn to like you know

1138
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:42,360
just start beating me up I can dress like Hitler and like walk out. Yeah dress me up like Hitler I

1139
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,280
already have cancer I'm gonna die it doesn't matter what my fucking. Exactly and you can like swing me

1140
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,960
around by the feet and throw me into the audience. What if you survive and then like there's just

1141
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:58,120
footage of you dressed up like Hitler and like they're throwing you from the top of the cage.

1142
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:02,680
Come back the next day you're gonna die one of these times. Yeah. What is the craziest thing

1143
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:05,400
- And they can just ask the Make-A-Wish Foundation guys.

1144
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:08,740
Like, he'll be like, "Oh yeah, I wanna do like 9/11 again."

1145
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:10,640
(laughing)

1146
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,200
- Like, come on, come on, just let me do it.

1147
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,940
- Look, look, I'll get the Pentagon for real this time.

1148
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:18,620
Like, I'll like, it'll be gone.

1149
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:21,740
- Yeah, that was the 9/11 commission.

1150
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:22,580
They didn't look into it,

1151
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:24,440
but that was what happened the first time.

1152
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,680
(laughing)

1153
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:31,200
It was five young boys from Saudi Arabia.

1154
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,200
(laughter)

1155
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,200
Well, we can't really say anything.

1156
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:37,200
They had cancer.

1157
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
What are we supposed to do? They had cancer.

1158
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,200
We paid for flight school.

1159
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:43,200
I froze.

1160
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:45,200
Oh, Patrick froze.

1161
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,200
How's that Fios treating you, you asshole?

1162
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,200
Fuck you.

1163
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,200
Well, I don't feel... We should end this so I don't have to

1164
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,200
re-sync it. It's over.

1165
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:55,200
It's done.

1166
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,200
I said, you want me to yell, "I had a kid with cancer."

1167
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,200
I don't care.

1168
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:03,760
Yeah, it would have already showed up because when you freeze you're still recording on audacity.

1169
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,760
UGH!

1170
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,760
You are so brainless.

1171
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,760
So stupid.

1172
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:07,760
Get him!

1173
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:08,760
Twitch.tv/podcastswithoutlist.

1174
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:16,000
Jubio's gonna be live 24/7, every single day, every single moment.

1175
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:19,640
He's going and he's gonna be naked.

1176
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:22,720
You can give bits to move to Ankit.

1177
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,560
You can do virtual buddy with his body on Twitch, I swear to God.

1178
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:30,120
You give different bits and he'll smell literally anything for four bits.

1179
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:31,120
It's four cents.

1180
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,120
It's four cents.

1181
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,120
In Mexico it's a fortune.

1182
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,560
Look, he'll even smell his finger.

1183
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:37,720
He'll smell his finger and you know where that's been.

1184
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:41,360
We're going to do shows in the weekends where we kill bats all this money away and rope

1185
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,360
it.

1186
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,800
I will also be doing that.

1187
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:48,600
I will be at the digital casino and everybody's invited.

1188
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,640
Alright.

1189
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,640
Is that allowed?

1190
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,640
Yeah.

1191
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:52,640
Bye.

1192
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,640
Digital casino and Twitch?

1193
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:54,640
Bye.

1194
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:54,640
Alright, bye.

1195
01:01:54,640 --> 01:02:04,640
