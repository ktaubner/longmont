00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,960

17
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,640
Actually, Cameron, he did get you there. No, it's false. Do you guys think that

18
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,840
he faked the moon? Do you think he faked the moon landing? Who failed? I think

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,920
certainly is someone else. I honestly think they went to the moon. I don't

20
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,820
know why you would fake that. They went to the moon, but not that day, not on

21
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,780
this, not in the hell. Are you talking about man? I don't think they went to

22
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:37,420
the moon in the six. Why would they not in the fifties? Yeah, I think they went

23
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,440
way before that. I think they went to the thirties yeah way before silent

24
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:46,080
movie era. I saw somebody went to the I saw somebody go to the moon and put a

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,560
they landed their rocket right in the moon. I saw somebody on the moon in

26
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:55,580
1732. I bet somebody went to the moon, but they weren't these show off tell it

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,520
all the world needs is we got to put this on one of these modest countries.

28
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,500
Yeah, like

29
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,960
probably ancient the Ming Dynasty. Probably they went to the moon. Yeah,

30
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,920
there's a lot of research that you can look up and you can see that the Ming

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,000
Dynasty went to the moon. So well, it was truly the Sumerians within their

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,480
the war by losing it. Yeah, not the one you're thinking of the war. Well, the

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,120
war you're thinking of is still raging. Yeah, but we lost a battle, but the war

43
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,860
that we are in our war is over. You know why man,

44
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,960
because okay, here's what happened during for those who did not listen to war

45
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,440
diary number one. We go listen to that. That's important diary number two. We

46
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,480
are in a bloody endless war in the middle of in the middle queens,

47
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:30,920
and it is us versus garbage people, and you might be thinking that these are

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,080
people made of garbage, yes, and you'd be close. They're people who pick up

49
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,160
garbage for a living and not even and I God bless these good garbage men and

50
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,260
women who pick up this nasty, disgusting, these shits that and

51
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,480
the toilet wiping that I put in the trash bags. It's the bosses. It's the

52
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,680
PMC class of the garbage world. Yeah, though, honestly, I fall on the side. I

53
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,520
kind of don't like the blue collar picker uppers. I mean, I don't love them

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,680
either. They smell bad, but the people who are actually sending their capos are

55
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,900
where I have actually the blue. The blue in their collar is from all the

56
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,920
blueberry juice coming out of our trash. Cameron drinks a lot of V8 blueberry

57
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,560
juice. Did they make blueberry juice? V8 blueberry pomegranate.

58
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,520
Drinking what? Pome wonderful. Pome wonderful. I don't know what that is.

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,840
What are you guys remembering? What are you texting right now? I'm just

60
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,240
relaxed. People thought that that was a... It's important. People thought

61
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,840
Pome wonderful was healthy, but that's basically like a soda. Yeah, it's just

62
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,760
sugar. Yeah, it's a fruit cocktail. Yeah. It tastes good as fuck, though. It

63
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,160
because sorry to interrupt about juice. So the war is now over and I'll tell

64
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,240
you exactly what happened guys.

65
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,300
We had a

66
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,120
I mean we were building a dossier on this on this trash company security footage,

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,680
security footage, security. We were gonna give them a trouble stories told by

68
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,240
us about what happened. Security's fraud. Maybe they were engaging in. We really

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,200
don't know. They were. They allegedly alleged by allegedly they were engaging

70
00:04:54,200 --> 00:05:00,320
security fraud. Yeah, because guys, we were, they attempted to sue us. We got a

71
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,480
letter from them that says that in seven days they're going to start suing us if

72
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,780
we don't pay them $800. And we got it, the letter was sent on the sixth from a

73
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,240
lawyer and we got it on the sixth day. We got it on the 11th. Yep. And so I had to

74
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,680
scramble. Those sneaky, sneaky, sneaky. And at first, at first I got the letter and I

75
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,800
said, you know what man, let's take this shit all the way to the Supreme Court

76
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,240
because there's no fucking way shot man that I will give these fucking pieces of

77
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,940
shit and let me dime. Let me let's back up and explain this a little bit here.

78
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,880
The intent to sue is because we they so here's what happened. We hired this

79
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,920
trash company to come and pick up the trash from our office. They come

80
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,720
reasonable request, by the way, which we're paying them to do yeah. They

81
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,720
come. They don't pick up the trash. They come again. They don't pick up the

82
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,160
trash. Hey man, can you pick up the trash? Yeah, we're going to pick up the

83
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,720
trash. They come again. They don't pick up the trash. This happens and happens

84
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,140
that happens. So eventually we say okay, we're going to get a different company

85
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:57,480
who we're in love with and we love and we like them and they always become our

86
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,220
friend. What's his name? Thank you, Mr T. Mr T. Mr T, we love you and then we

87
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,520
say so we're not going to pay you guys this some four hundred dollars that

88
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,520
you're some forty four some four hundred dollars that you're you're asking for

89
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,240
because you didn't do the job. You never did it once. They did not once pick up

90
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,820
the trash. So why should we single you're breaking your contract? How we

91
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,880
signed a contract with you and you are breaching it and what do they do? They

92
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,660
get a lawyer to send a letter to us that says excuse me, you have breached the

93
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,560
contract by not paying, and now you have to pay twice as much money. That's

94
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,580
bullshit. Guess what, motherfucker? It's not even a breach of contract. Guess

95
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,900
what? We got scared and we paid the bill. That's right. 'Cause we got really

96
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,740
scared. 'Cause you, even though you, you motherfuckers at whatever your trash

97
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,820
company, I don't even care enough to remember the name of your company, you

98
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,380
guys know, you're trying to scare us 'cause you, that's why you had the extra

99
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,120
because you know the second we step foot in court, three guys representing

100
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:56,560
themselves, a triple lawyer situation. We represent each other for your fucking

101
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,560
lawyer, man. We would represent one another. He can't debate us. But you guys?

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,680
He can't debate us. You guys? Here's what I would say. We have the security

103
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,000
footage. We can talk fast. Here's what I would do. I can talk over two friends.

104
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,160
We can talk over each other. Imagine what I can do to a lawyer.

105
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,520
We can talk over each other completely. We talk over each other all the

106
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,920
time. Here's what I would do if we got into court with them. Here's

107
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,160
what I would... Here's how I would prove our case, okay? I would say,

108
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:21,200
your honor, I'd like to call to the stand the Mr waste connections and then you

109
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,520
okay and this fucking big fat idiot would bumble up and how you doing coughing

110
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,460
and burping. He's got he's got boils and pimples. He looks like the onion from

111
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,000
veggie tails and here's what I would do. Okay, he'd be sitting on the stand and

112
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,520
I would say

113
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:41,960
pick that up and if he says no and he there's no way that he would do it, you

114
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,080
know what and I would know he wouldn't do it. You know why he doesn't know how

115
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,180
because he doesn't know how to pick the trash. Oh no, I would drop my soda on

116
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,400
the ground. I'd say pick that fuck, pick that up. If you're such a trash, if

117
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,780
you're such a trash man, pick that I can tell you what I would say if I was on.

118
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,520
If I was I was representing myself here in this case, I would you know how I

119
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,160
seal the deal. I say I would say I would say well, I do the kiss at the end.

120
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,100
Okay, this is how I would start. I guess the judge would start sealing the deal,

121
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,220
but I would finish sealing the deal with a kiss. I would say could I please have

122
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,740
everybody direct their attention to exhibit a and then I would have all an

123
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,800
exhibit with all the evidence that proves. Oh right, but you guys, I have to

124
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,600
say one thing,

125
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,360
this, these, this court fantasy is very,

126
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,520
I'm loving this a lot, but you guys, we did get the last laugh.

127
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,560
We did get the last laugh. We got the last laugh. And this is what I was,

128
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,800
this is what Patrick was asking me when I was texting, I was sending this over.

129
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,400
Okay, thank God. This is a strike that we made in the war. Listen, you guys may

130
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,740
won the war by making us pay money, but we got soldiers of fortune. We have

131
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,040
mercenaries working for us. This is like the guys in Japan that didn't know that

132
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,420
World War II was over. Oh yeah. Wait, this is the call?

133
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,920
Okay. This is a... A soldier in the field. We got shooters.

134
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,520
Yeah.

135
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,340
Turn that up.

136
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,400
It's up as it will go.

137
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,000
Okay. I just had some questions for you, if that's all right.

138
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Um, do you guys pick up feces?

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah.

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, do you pick up human feces?

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Okay, what if I hide it in a bag? Like, will you check?

142
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They'll check that for human feces.

143
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,200
How do you guys check that?

144
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,200
The driver will check that.

145
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
He opens up the bag and he checks for that?

146
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,200
Yep.

147
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,200
Cool.

148
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
Seems strange.

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:55,920
I think that's the end of the call.

150
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
Yeah.

151
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Yeah.

152
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
And if you thought, if you think...

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,840
The driver will open the bag and check.

154
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,000
And check for human feces.

155
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,520
that's what that's apparently what waste connections is going to do. I don't know

156
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,180
if we should be saying their name because we just admitted that we could get

157
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,040
prank calling. We could get pierce in a lot of legal trouble. I don't think you

158
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,920
can go to jail for break, and I think that we said the name of the thing, and I

159
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,800
think that these little rabid soldiers. Well, there's a bunch of different things

160
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,220
called that name, but the point is this man, if you think that's if you think

161
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,240
that is the end of the prank calls that we're about to unleash on your small

162
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:27,800
company,

163
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,760
you are sorely mistake. You really may have ended, but the other war has just

164
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,480
started. Well,

165
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,320
end of World War One everybody. Oh, we're going to go kiss in the middle of

166
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Times Square. Oh yeah, let's go. Let's just let's disarm Germany. Yeah, yeah,

167
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,280
that'll really work and then Germany comes the fuck back. We are Germany,

168
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,120
that's right,

169
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,600
versus you. Oh, we're going to take away all Germany's armies and weapons. Yeah,

170
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,760
great idea. Wait for us, yeah, you fucking idiots. Do you know what you've

171
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,600
Everyone at the bus stop in front of this building just heard us say that.

172
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,000
The other shoe is about to drop.

173
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,160
Uh-huh.

174
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,960
And it's a 400-pound shoe and it's dropping directly--

175
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,640
A 400-megaton shoe.

176
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,240
And it's dropping on your ass.

177
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:15,160
And you are about to take yourself out to the trash can and put yourself into a compact cube.

178
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,480
You're going to end up in a bag that you work in.

179
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,160
The morgue is going to have to check your body bag for human feces, buddy.

180
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,800
Yep.

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,760
We're shitting on you.

182
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:23,880
Yep, because we're shitting on you.

183
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,920
This is what we need.

184
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,000
What are you going to do?

185
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,920
We need another legal battle right now.

186
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,600
send us another letter with intent to sue for defamation. Oh wait, I

187
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,580
think I forgot. You know what I'm doing? We're saying allegedly the

188
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,880
whole time, so you can't sue us for shit. Yeah, we're saying allegedly.

189
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,420
It's not a slander or a libel because we're just making it up. And also,

190
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:43,640
we're playing characters right now. And my name is... I'm Mr. Fruit. Hey,

191
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,800
guess what? If you do send us a letter with intent to sue over defamation

192
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,160
for saying we're gonna nuke you with a shoe and poop on your body at

193
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,320
the morgue, that means you had to pay $5 to hear this shit. Yeah. And

194
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,740
We are making back our money one month at a time, buddy.

195
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
Uh-huh.

196
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,300
Because you're going to forget to cancel that.

197
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,660
You're going to forget like a lot of people did.

198
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,660
Over months and months and months.

199
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:10,740
All it's going to take is 1,600 months, buddy, and we're going to pay back our legal fees.

200
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:11,740
And guess what?

201
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,180
I'm at home right now.

202
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,500
I'm doing Mark Wahlberg and fear type shit.

203
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,060
I'm punching myself in the chest.

204
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,900
I'm punching myself in the...

205
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,900
You know what I'm doing?

206
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:24,260
I'm bringing my trash from home here, and I'm throwing it out because I think that that

207
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,700
that affects you somehow. Yeah, I think in my twisted brain, I think that that

208
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,420
affects you. And let me tell you something else, waste connections. If

209
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:33,280
anything,

210
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:39,060
anything happens to your business, to your personal apartment, to anybody in

211
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,380
your life, if any, they get injured in any way that seems accidental, if they

212
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,380
contract any disease, if anyone dies or is hurt or feel sad in a day, yeah, we

213
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:51,700
claim responsibility for that shit. We did it. We're planning to do it. And

214
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,380
Another thing, we're not so smart, so we're gonna start eating our trash because we think

215
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,380
it makes you mad.

216
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,860
We're very, very stupid about this whole thing.

217
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,660
We thought that you could just stop paying a guy who has a contract, okay?

218
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,220
Imagine the type of stuff that we do at home that's just when people aren't looking.

219
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:11,700
I'm so stupid that the guy said, "You signed a contract."

220
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,140
And I said, "No, I didn't."

221
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,420
And then he sent me a photo of it with my signature.

222
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,420
This is how...

223
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,420
You don't want to fuck with somebody who's this dumb, man.

224
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,240
well, we'll go all the way up and down every which way we're going to go at you

225
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,440
like wonk is elevator. Okay, we're going all the way and you buddy, you're

226
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,600
going to need a gob stopper because I'm going to be gobbling up all this damn

227
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,060
trash.

228
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:37,500
Every piece of trash because we know that you like that shit stop our gob and

229
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,740
guess what? We're going to get

230
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:43,560
everyone in the city to start recycling and composting

231
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,940
apartments, their own backyards, and then there's going to be no

232
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:56,580
trash. You should pick up your own. You could pick up your own stuff. Pick up

233
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:01,180
your own body and also by the way, and I don't even like saying this kind of

234
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:06,780
thing, but you will soon be replaced by AI, aka Wally. And when Wally starts

235
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:10,180
pulling up, I'm gonna pet him. Uh-huh. And there's gonna be a Wally listening

236
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:15,620
to Wally. Wally listening to Wally. Listening to All Day. Listening to All

237
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:21,580
all day by Chitty Bang all day all night by chance, the rapper yeah he's gonna

238
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,740
while I while he gonna pick up a wrapper and and but for real, I do have a map of

239
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:31,700
all your stops on where you pick up trash and I'm going to be hiding feces

240
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:34,520
and we're going to pick up the trash before you get to it. Yeah, we're

241
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,740
starting it to the next house down. Oh, that's what we're going to do. We're

242
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,180
going to take every piece of trash from every house on your on your route, move

243
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,540
it to the very last house. You go, oh, what a quiet night. Nobody's throwing

244
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,580
taking away tonight, get to the last house, you're not going to be able to

245
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,920
pick it up. It's going to be too much for your little muscles. There's too

246
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,780
much trash. You know what we're going to do? We're going to take the trash

247
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,140
from one side of the street, the even numbers, we're going to put it all

248
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,500
over on the odds, and we're going to take the odd number streets, put it on

249
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,100
the even side. You're going to have even and odd trash mixed up. That's how

250
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,820
we get back at them. We start our own trash company. Yeah, we're turning this

251
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:06,220
whole building into a trash thing. All the people who live upstairs and stuff,

252
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,780
they're going to smell it all the time. They're going to love it. I can't tell

253
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,060
you how badly I want to go to court with these motherfuckers, man. We want it.

254
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,780
we thought maybe I want to be I

255
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,860
funny we're talking about I'm seeing a about like a

256
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,280
situation of us three because they're still the company they're still in all

257
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,140
of us. We three we get we step into court with this guy, this lawyer that

258
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:30,080
he's probably a good lawyer of the this trash company. I heard some trash lawyer.

259
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,740
Yeah, send a letter with his name on the top of you guys. I think maybe we step

260
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,940
into that courtroom, three of us representing ourselves. Yeah, we got

261
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,820
little we got little levelier Mike packs on we go. We got Pearson, Jubio

262
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,860
sitting in the in the pews, the church pews of the house with cameras. We turn

263
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,700
that shit into content. We make the absolute funniest best episode of a

264
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,280
podcast that's ever been made, and then we each owe fifty thousand dollars to

265
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:00,460
the government for perjury and go to jail for execution, tax a ten years

266
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,700
stuff like that yeah. I don't give a fuck. Can you imagine how they would

267
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,820
fucking mythologize us if we went to jail? If we defeated I mean the trash

268
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:12,020
people who pick up trash have been a scourge on this city for God knows how

269
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,940
long since the since forever. Okay, because it used to be right in this

270
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,780
world. You used to shit out of your window, used to shit in a bucket and

271
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,100
throw it out the window. And there's a little

272
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,500
you to be able to litter. Well, someone just walked by wearing a David S

273
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,820
Pumpkins costume. No way. I really hope. Not a big deal. But bring them back

274
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,660
here. That kind of stuff doesn't scare me anymore. It doesn't bother me either.

275
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,300
I actually want them to come back in here and we can interview them. Weird

276
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,460
shit like that doesn't bother me this time of year. Exactly. You just got to

277
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,420
get used to it. I saw a lady dressed up as a clown the other day. We should

278
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,020
interview David S. Pumpkins on the show. He's a really hard guest to get. Okay.

279
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,820
He doesn't do much public appearances unless it's on Saturday Night Live and

280
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:53,460
he plays himself. Alright, alright, alright. I just had that amazing thought.

281
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:59,420
Yeah. That soothed me so much. Your bloodlines over. Waste connections,

282
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:03,220
allegedly. You're done for. You're done for. The only connections to waste is

283
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:07,580
the connection of your veins to your heart. Wow, your blood is a waste.

284
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:11,900
Your blood is waste. I wouldn't even let your heart is a trash. We don't

285
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,660
believe in violence, but that's not gonna stop us from killing you,

286
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,780
from killing you with our gun and our hands. Yeah, just our hands. We don't

287
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,620
have to. No, I don't have any guns.

288
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,160
I have a gun, but it's for me, it's for me, it's more about falling in

289
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,620
love with every single one of your family members and getting them to move

290
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,780
a different city far away from you. Oh, that's smart. And we're going to rising

291
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,940
them all one by one and I'm going to break up with my girlfriend, getting

292
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:44,860
them to move, get this, getting them to move out further onto the coast. Maybe

293
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,660
we take them to Cape Cod or something and they're all there in 50 years.

294
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,660
That's going to be underwater. You are taking your whole family on a all

295
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:56,220
expenses paid trip to Provincetown. We're going to take you,

296
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,020
family. We're taking them all the province. That's right. We're going to

297
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,360
we're going to take your we're going to take your eighty five year old mother.

298
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,820
We're going to take her to Provincetown. We're going to introduce her to her to

299
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,060
where

300
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,560
she's going to be hard. We're going to introduce her to some really kind, nice

301
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,460
bears that are going to completely change her perception about the entire

302
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,060
homosexual community and she is going to start supporting gayness and bringing it

303
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:22,500
into your home. A man, and these guys, these trash guys are really homophobic.

304
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,180
Of course they are. We take your grandmother right, then we take a plane

305
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:32,100
private jet out of out of Provincetown. We give them pills so they don't freak

306
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,740
out on the plane. Then we go to and this is going to be whenever the Folsom

307
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,300
Street Fair is we're flying direct flight Provincetown straight to Folsom

308
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,780
Street Fair where they are going to be in

309
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,140
the Folsom Street Fair. Everybody's going to think it's just part of a

310
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,980
normal thing that gay people do in Provincetown one where they take

311
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,960
no, it's P town. I love this time of year in P town. I do want to go to the

312
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,780
Folsom Street Fair, man, but yeah, it's farting and having sex with each other.

313
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,080
It sounds amazing. There's that

314
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,360
photo of that dude getting fisted in the middle of the street. It was crazy.

315
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,140
That's what I mean. Why do people complain about that shit? Yeah, it's fine.

316
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,740
Seems so funny. Who cares? Well, the thing, the reason that people complain

317
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,340
about it is they think that it's not like the street isn't blocked off. They

318
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:22,780
have like- The guy who, the guy, the like sixty five year old straight guy

319
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,680
who's lived in who lives in like on the on an apartment on the top floor and

320
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,320
Folsom Street is looking at us and windows like

321
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,120
province. I'm like fuck shit. That's not it's in San Francisco. Okay, yeah,

322
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,040
the Folsom Street fair.

323
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,080
That's why we're taking the private. Yeah, there I was making kind of a whole

324
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,840
gay city where no, no, no, no, no province town is where the gays who

325
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,160
don't go to Folsom Street fair. I was probably seventy five percent girls from

326
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,200
my high school. I love Provincetown, man. You see a bunch of couples that look like

327
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,440
twin brothers. I liked it when I was a kid because they have a bunch of stores

328
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,760
with puzzles and games. There was a lot of puzzles. What's that? That Navy store,

329
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,340
dude? Yes. Oh, my God. That place was so sick. Old Navy. Old Navy. I bought a

330
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,880
military helmet similar to that one there as a kid, and it was like a really

331
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,080
heavy one. Yeah, it made it. They have it to block all the stonk. But Waste

332
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,240
Connections, I'm gonna pay so much money. I'm gonna get your mom and your dad. I'm

333
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,380
gonna take him in a limousine every day to Peter Luger.

334
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,220
Your mom, you'd man me a grease-fied--

335
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,220
I'm gonna lose thousands of dollars doing this.

336
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
You think, "Oh, that's so nice to do."

337
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,220
You think it's nice to do, okay, until the day that I stop.

338
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,220
They've adapted.

339
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,720
Yeah.

340
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,020
They want a limo every day.

341
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,220
They want the steak every day.

342
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,520
Can you give that to them?

343
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,020
I don't think so.

344
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,220
No, man, you got $800 in your pocket.

345
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:43,220
Now, Gels, I know nobody else is paying for your stupid company shit.

346
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,020
I don't want to eat chuck roast.

347
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,720
I don't want to eat chuck roast.

348
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,120
I want to eat for a minion. They're going to be saying that to you. There's a

349
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,000
gross and you want you want to take your I'm going to take your old ass mom to

350
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,540
Sephora and I'm going to make her a I'm going to dress your mom up, but I

351
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:04,280
want to be a jeans. I want to be a slut. Now I want to be a slut. You can't be a

352
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,560
slut, Grand Mama. We got to pick the trash up. I want to be a slut and I

353
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:13,220
want I don't want to I'm going to exert an influence over her life that changes

354
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:18,860
I don't want to eat pork chops. I want to eat steaks. I'm going to start hurting

355
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,060
myself and it'll be your fault.

356
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:24,160
Straight up. That's what we've already been doing. That's what I said. I was

357
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,160
doing doing fear, Mark Wahlberg type shit. I'm punching myself in the chest

358
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,160
and head. I'm doing everything from every movie where I'm doing. I'm doing

359
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,460
that. I'm doing taxi driver holding the hand over the fire. I'm doing where

360
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,460
maybe Forrest Gump runs too far and he hurts his legs. And I did. I did an

361
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,660
impression of your grandma and it was scathing. Does Forrest Gump sleep? No,

362
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:46,480
I've never seen that for us, except for one minute of it. I in that movie. I

363
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,140
think he doesn't sleep. I think he runs all the way across. Nobody does sleep

364
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,680
most movies, though. No, he does not sleep well. I guess he sleep. He sleep

365
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:58,780
runs. They wake up usually yeah, yeah, a lot of is a bad movie, but it

366
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,740
grows. I think they should go back to having every single movie start with

367
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:05,180
the main character waking up and with them going to bed early in the morning,

368
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,820
because how else am I going to relate to this guy? Me that I tell you there

369
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:13,520
There's this one time I went to a Bubba Gump because I won a gift card at Universal Studios

370
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,240
for doing a survey about a show.

371
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,320
You went to Hubby's Bump.

372
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:23,080
I went to Hubby's Bump and I had to do a focus group and then I got, I think it was like

373
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,000
fifty bucks to any restaurant on the city walk.

374
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,160
Went to Bubba Gump.

375
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,800
My ex-girlfriend, never seen Forrest Gump, because they do trivia there.

376
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,720
Ex-girlfriend, never seen Forrest Gump.

377
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,840
Australian family, sitting at the table next to us, never seen Forrest Gump.

378
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,800
they put you in pods and then in the middle of the dinner, the way to

379
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,420
comes over like little like the bugs, eat the shrimps, eat the eat the

380
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:47,760
shrimp, shrimp or bugs true. They put you like into groups in the restaurant,

381
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,340
then a waiter comes over and is like all right, so now we're going to do

382
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:56,500
some forest gump trivia and I had to do I had to answer every single question,

383
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,260
because I was the only person who'd seen the movie. So is the movie I

384
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,800
haven't seen the movie for us gump is it about for his gump eats shrimps as

385
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:07,920
bugs. He doesn't know any better. He owns a shrimp restaurant called Bubba Gump.

386
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,180
It's a

387
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:12,180
restaurant in that movie. He owns a restaurant and doesn't know he owns it.

388
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:17,020
He doesn't pretty much. Okay, it's a movie about- He doesn't know shit. He

389
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,700
doesn't know much. It's a movie about if

390
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:23,340
he's a doofus.

391
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:28,860
He's a doofus and he's- everyone around him is a douche bag. You know, that guy,

392
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:32,260
I always thought Forrest Gump kind of looks like David S. Pumpkins. A little

393
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,200
I feel like they should play brothers and stop getting me. I keep thinking that

394
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,000
because he said somebody walked by earlier. I keep thinking that he's going

395
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,400
to walk in and it's going to be like us like doors locked. It's like a David

396
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,860
s. Pumpkin David. I'm going to tell a nightmare that somebody tried to break

397
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:49,000
in here. Yeah, and I would let them. Are you kidding me? What are they going to

398
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,200
take our people are going to kill me man. People break in all the time, man.

399
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,440
People walk in and they say, I'm sorry. What is this a store? You say dude, I'm

400
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,600
in there. Somebody right now. Everybody walks in here goes literally exactly

401
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,100
like this dude. What is this? Yeah, we said I don't want to fucking know man.

402
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:08,860
It's just our room. I don't want to know what do you wait? I'm trying to

403
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,300
trying to

404
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,340
we don't want people. You will cry. If those people come in, you actually will

405
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,560
get so I would not you will have to deal with it. Well, we would do it by

406
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,940
saying hey, we can finally okay. Sorry, my friend here actually is some

407
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,020
difficulties and inefficiencies. People people come by all the time and open the

408
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,180
door and say what is this? We say it's a podcast studio. We finally have the

409
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:34,220
we can actually show them us in action. This is like you know when you go to

410
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:39,580
like the the factory and you see where the sausage is made and I never go to

411
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,580
the factory. You see where the sausage is made and two guys are competently

412
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,580
excitedly making sausage and one guys like this.

413
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:51,480
I can't make the sausage when people are watching.

414
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,980
This is how the sausage which should we start doing podcast tours for fans. I

415
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:02,780
I was thinking of renting out the studio to anyone who wants to start their own

416
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,300
podcast and then I sit right there and I operate the switchboard for them.

417
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,620
Remember a lady wanted to...

418
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,660
Yeah, she wanted to do an America First podcast.

419
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:14,260
No, the other lady who wanted to rent the space.

420
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,260
Oh, I forgot about that.

421
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,260
She scared you.

422
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260
Me or him?

423
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
Me or Caleb.

424
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:20,260
Oh, yes.

425
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,260
Oh, well, she thought that she could... She thought this was an apartment for

426
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,260
rent.

427
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Yeah.

428
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:26,620
No, we actually have a lease here, lady.

429
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,100
And then we went on a date, romantic.

430
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,220
And I give her a flower.

431
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,740
You didn't go on a date with her.

432
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,820
I'm making shit up, man.

433
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,100
You did not go on a date with her.

434
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,340
Did you guys know that they're doing a Bachelor show?

435
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,780
With olds. With olds?

436
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,360
Yeah. That's disgusting.

437
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,380
I kinda wanna watch it,

438
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,800
but I don't know where to watch it.

439
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,720
I was told that it's the saddest thing ever

440
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,300
because it's like, the Bachelor is kinda funny

441
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:51,060
because he's like telling these money-grubbing whores

442
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,540
to get the hell off the island.

443
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,180
Now these are money-grubbing olds.

444
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,980
These are beautiful old women to be honest. The love part of the bachelor

445
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,340
is by far the worst part. It should they should get rid of the bachelor and they

446
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:04,620
should just put all the crazy women on the love part is fake and they should

447
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,940
just well it's real. They get married, but then they always come out as gay

448
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,220
after yeah or is it with each other? No, I mean both.

449
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,940
Did you guys ever watch much of the bachelor? I've never watched a fair

450
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,420
amount of you watch the reality show ever watched his Jersey Shore. I like

451
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,900
watching reality TV. I would I probably wouldn't turn it on when I was on my own,

452
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,940
but I when it enters into my life, I enjoy it. I was housewives. The house

453
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,940
wives are fire doomsday preppers. I watched that's a and then I've seen

454
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,920
clips barely even counts yeah. I've seen clips of like dance moms and like

455
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,780
Vander pumps and stuff dance moms is crazy. The Abby Lee Miller was that

456
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,580
her name. She's the one in the wheelchair shows I've ever seen in my

457
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,520
life. She's just yelling always wasn't always in a in which it's literally

458
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,220
all too much candy and put herself in a wheelchair right. I don't know.

459
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,620
cow member honey boo boo. Yes, the dance, the dancing, the dance mom show is like

460
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,780
completely so horrible and it makes you want to kill myself. You like you ever

461
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:02,060
watch the dancing bear. We talked about this. We've talked about the dancing

462
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:06,420
bear, the reality show. No, yeah, what he was that we talked about it already.

463
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:10,540
We've talked about we talked about the dancing bear with react. Wait, that's

464
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:14,140
real yeah. That stuff is actually happening. Reality show.

465
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,660
they go to real women's bachelor parties and make the way it's sad. They go to

466
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:23,060
the reality. What I want to see is the other. I want to see the man watching.

467
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,520
I heard there was one that got banned where they went to a funeral and they

468
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,220
made all the women start doing it anyway.

469
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:32,100
Dancing bear showing up to a yeah. I heard that they didn't have a place to

470
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,420
film that day, so they just kind of mixed in. They kind of like there was a

471
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,100
funeral going on.

472
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,820
There's a mix up on the

473
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,940
widow with a veil over

474
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,600
the fate yeah.

475
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,440
Yeah

476
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,800
no, but for real that's not

477
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,700
that would be tragic death. Honestly, I want that at my funeral. Yeah, the

478
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,320
dancing bear to show up, not telling anybody, sort of putting plans into

479
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,560
motion for when I die. If I will, it's a you can't tell anybody this yeah,

480
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,640
dearly beloved

481
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,560
way. The best part of the dancing bear videos is is when they're just dancing

482
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:19,180
the guy's penis. I like the guy dancing before that when they don't do any sex

483
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:23,180
or anything, I just like this. I like the naked guys in it is my favorite part

484
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,600
probably that I like when I have clothes on, but they're still hot. I like just

485
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,440
their bodies. I like when he's in the bear costume because I think that these

486
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,540
women are being getting attacked by a bear. You know it would be my version

487
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:36,380
that I like that if I was a girl because I would not would be my CTE. I wouldn't

488
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,840
be like a slutty girl, so I would my version of the dancing bear that would

489
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:43,260
really good is that he comes out and instead of taking off his clothes, he

490
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,060
takes the head off the bear and he shows his face. Patrick said he has CTE and it

491
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,260
makes him like when women are attacked sexually by a bear.

492
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,660
What? And we're letting this fly by? I didn't even hear that. Yeah, we're letting

493
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,580
you, we're letting you skate, letting Pat skate by on this one. He's making shit up

494
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,580
right now, Caleb. He sounds insane, doesn't he? Are you, I mean he does, but

495
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:06,460
if he's saying something you said, then you sound insane. That's a weird thing to

496
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,100
I'm watching women get attacked by a bear. You are making things up and then you

497
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:14,140
added because of I have CTE. You're acting crazy man. You're acting insane

498
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,660
Cameron. I'm not acting insane. You're acting completely crazy.

499
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:21,420
He's, look at him. He's off his rocker. He's off his rocker.

500
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,140
Stop, whatever man. See he's making no sense. This is probably what people

501
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,940
want instead of me talking. Nobody wants that. No, people, people like how it

502
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:36,340
works. You can't press it. It's not like an MPC. Sorry? MPC. MP3? It is an

503
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
You see? Hello, traveler.

504
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Like a...

505
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,340
Yeah, you can't make beats out of those.

506
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
Well, I could set a drum.

507
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
Or you could set it that way.

508
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
Yeah? Whoa.

509
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:46,340
Wait, you've learned so much new technology recently.

510
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,340
I know.

511
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
It's easy, man.

512
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,340
Wait, can you...

513
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
(beatboxing)

514
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,340
(laughter)

515
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,340
There we go.

516
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,340
It's not that funny.

517
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,340
It's really not that funny.

518
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
What are you talking about? That's awesome.

519
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
(beatboxing)

520
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,340
What are you talking about? That's awesome.

521
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
Wait, that's actually fucking cool.

522
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,340
(beatboxing)

523
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,340
You can't even do it, man.

524
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
(beatboxing)

525
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,340
Just press it.

526
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,340
Why are you doing a weird finger trick?

527
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
Doing drums.

528
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:08,300
That's not how you play drums. You play drums like this.

529
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,300
You use a stick.

530
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:15,220
That's a sharpie. That didn't even work, man.

531
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,420
This is not working at all.

532
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,420
This is nothing at all.

533
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,420
Alright, yeah, you're done.

534
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,420
Alright, alright.

535
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
We cut your ass off.

536
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,420
Alright, alright, alright.

537
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,180
Even though I started it, it's Patrick's fault.

538
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,940
I agree. I agree. He took it too far, man. He took it to another level.

539
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,180
Once again, I don't know. I don't have good instincts and I ruin everything completely.

540
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,180
Pretty much.

541
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,380
Let's list things that you didn't ruin to make you feel better.

542
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,720
You didn't ruin the trash.

543
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,720
Let me think.

544
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:39,720
My dinner last night.

545
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
I ruined the trash.

546
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
Oh no.

547
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
What?

548
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,220
He's not talking about his dinner.

549
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,300
You just muted the mic that isn't plugged in.

550
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,260
There we go.

551
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,860
You're getting a little too comfortable here.

552
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:52,860
Yeah.

553
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,220
Bitch don't get too comfortable in the future.

554
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,500
Oh you know what I learned?

555
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,620
Wait, start talking about your dinner.

556
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,820
My dinner was so amazing white boy.

557
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,260
That doesn't do anything.

558
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,900
that doesn't do anything. No, you just do what do you mean? Do you want that? I

559
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,540
learned that this is like a fader.

560
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,820
I'm about to fade you, you don't catch this. I had my fade

561
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,580
the people who listen probably think I'm beating you up. Yeah,

562
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:20,580
stop, stop beating me.

563
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:26,460
Can you say hi? Yeah, anymore? Is that no? So I've definitely said hi. Yeah, a

564
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,860
bunch of times and every time had somebody recoil a little bit for hi. Yeah,

565
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,040
that's because they think you're about to attack. I definitely felt a kind of cringe from Hayao,

566
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,900
which surprised me because I never thought of it, but I guess it is kind of maybe racist.

567
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,980
I thought it was a word that meant I'm hitting you. Yeah, I thought you just say it, but

568
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:48,420
I guess it's maybe an approximation of the Japanese language. They are recoiling because

569
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:52,940
you're going, "Whoa!" True, it might be. Yeah, anytime you say Hayao, people block

570
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,460
it. Yeah, they're instinctively blocking. Racist cringe. Guys, I look nice. I don't

571
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,100
look like the kind of person who would say, "Hey, I need somebody." You look like a sensei.

572
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:11,340
Yeah. Exactly. You do look like you've done some time in a dojo. I did not do a tenny

573
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,460
time in a dojo. I thought you were a tenny time? A tenny time, yeah. I did some time in the dojo.

574
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:23,500
I told you guys, I did taekwondo and I was the best at push-ups. Yeah. I was one most obedient

575
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:30,440
multiple years. I had two. Yeah, I had two awards for most obedient years in

576
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,460
a row. They finally invented an award below most improved. Yeah, they finally

577
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,940
like this. The poor most improved. He's feeling so bad, but he did. We're

578
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:41,660
trying to be nice. Okay, we have to make something up. That's even worse.

579
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,460
So obedient because I never got in trouble. One time, imagine imagine.

580
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,820
Yeah, you got most obedient and most improved the same year.

581
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,020
you are the slave of the I was I would get all the pads and put them out and

582
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,760
they only I only really trained with kids who are younger than me because I

583
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,960
was so bad. Oh my God, but it wasn't. I remember any of the moves now. I think

584
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,440
maybe I did do some karate as a kid. I'm trying to remember. I remember of it,

585
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,920
but I think I had I think I had a what's the first is the first belt, a white

586
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,000
belt. Yeah, I think I had that do I remember any moves on me.

587
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,880
I don't think

588
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,620
you jumped him. He jumped. He said, Hi, he said, Hi, it's okay to say, Hi, I

589
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,980
was a I was a I think it's probably a tone of what I think you know what? Oh,

590
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:24,780
you know what? You probably

591
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,400
you probably can't say any, but you probably can't have trouble getting away

592
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,620
with going like, oh, and a high pitched for type of

593
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:35,700
oh, like a kind of yeah, but one yeah, that that's probably the one that will

594
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:39,780
really probably that's probably worse. That's that's why you can say in a

595
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,380
minute. You can be like, Hi, yeah, and you can also go. That's even a little

596
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:44,780
like that's still maybe, but for me, like maybe it's just because I'm so

597
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,680
Japanese. If you just don't change your voice, if you just go like this,

598
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:47,880
like

599
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,380
yeah,

600
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,180
yeah,

601
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,420
yeah, strike, strike, oh strike, yeah, people say. Yeah, maybe you gotta start

602
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,180
saying it, maybe you just gotta start saying, calling your moves up, calling

603
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,720
your shots. You know, if no other culture is gonna step up and invent a

604
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,380
thing to say when you hold your arms in the air and your leg in the

605
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:11,640
air, we're gonna use the Japanese one. And it's also not wrong,

606
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,000
like no yeah, there's not an alternative. Give me one alternative. What does Gael

607
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,160
say in Street Fighter? Gael. Does he just say Gael? He doesn't have the how do

608
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:24,800
ken? No, he doesn't. He shoots a sonic blast. That's Ryu. Oh, does he say

609
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,200
sonic blast? Well, I think that's what his move is called maybe, but I could

610
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,360
be an inventing, sonic blast. Camilla Caballo from motherfucking Street Fighter.

611
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,640
She was fine.

612
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,320
I keep adding fine characters to Street Fighter.

613
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,200
That bear.

614
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,760
Why can you not make a game called Street Lover?

615
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,360
Yeah, Street Lover.

616
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,360
Street Lover.

617
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Wait.

618
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,360
What's up?

619
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,800
Why can you not make a game called...

620
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,240
How come there isn't a game that is a fully simulated sex?

621
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
There is.

622
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
There surely is.

623
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:01,800
And I can guarantee that Chun-Li is a character in it as well.

624
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,800
Chum-Li?

625
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,800
Chum-Li.

626
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
From Pawn Stars?

627
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,540
Oh my God, the Pawn Stars game where you are a seller.

628
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,380
- They put Chumlee in the Chumlee outfit.

629
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,720
- You are the seller to the Pawn Stars, right?

630
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,640
And it's like one of those, it's like a text-based DS game

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,020
that has a bunch of mini games.

632
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,120
But-- - Oh, that's a text-based DS game?

633
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,680
- Or, you know, like it's mostly like text at the bottom

634
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,600
and you're like clicking different dialogue boxes

635
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,480
at the bottom.

636
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,480
And there is a heart, there's a heart and then a hand.

637
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,080
On the left side is heart, hand is the right side.

638
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,920
- Love or hit. - Love or hit.

639
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,760

647
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,980
this is the exact cover of love her or hit her.

648
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:15,320
You play as that guy and you decide to love or hit yeah and you're you're

649
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:21,280
talking to chumly or whatever at the the what's it called the gold rush pawn shop

650
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,620
and there's a pond, gold and silver pond and then there's the romance button or

651
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:25,940
the

652
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:31,840
I would romance an old guy who died. He seemed so cool, which one the old one

653
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:39,680
who passed which is new all cramps, all old gramps, yeah, it didn't make sense

654
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,320
until he got older, but he was always old gramps. Maybe I'll name my kid,

655
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,580
never grandpa grandpa's a good name for you never watch ponsters. Did you watch

656
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:48,000
storage?

657
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,520
Road show that storage war stories, wars, road shows, the like yeah, so

658
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,560
George was at the guy that went yeah, yeah, Darrell or Dale or one would say

659
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:03,600
up and add the couple who guys love is not real. They broke up

660
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:10,200
every couple on TV ends up breaking up except for us. Yeah, it's okay. Pat

661
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,920
they're going to probably get back together later in life after they'll be

662
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:17,320
in heaven together. Lesbian is at least they're going to experience lesbianism.

663
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,000
You know, no, actually they will stay straight forever.

664
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,800
Okay, it's going to be okay. All right, they're not going to experience

665
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,800
I don't like having sex with girls normal.

666
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
I feel like lesbianism is the best way to do it.

667
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,800
Imagine the sisterhood you would feel with all your other lesbians at the bar.

668
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:43,800
If we three were women, would we be chilling at the bar and trying to pick up one guy to share between us?

669
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
I think we would be lesbos.

670
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
No, we would be lesbos.

671
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,800
You think that's not lesbos?

672
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Three of us fucking one guy, that's not lesbo?

673
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,520
He would be funny shirt, funny t-shirt lesbian and he would say, "Damn, it feels good to be a lesbo."

674
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,000
With the two shockers, with two shockers on.

675
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,440
You'd be one of those fake lesbians where they...

676
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,960
Where I only do it when the camera's on?

677
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,280
Yeah.

678
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,840
Damn.

679
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,760
Being a lesbian is going to be so awesome.

680
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,800
And got the camera on me.

681
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,960
Dude, okay, here's why being a lesbian is awesome.

682
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,680
I love doing that.

683
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,240
Oh yeah.

684
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,940
yeah, when you're a guy, here's what sex is. Oh, I'm lifting you up, I'm

685
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,200
throwing you and I'm jumping around and oh look at me. Oh, I'm bouncing around,

686
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,640
I'm having to pretend I'm King Kong in your ability doing hula hoops. Oh crap,

687
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,220
but here's your sex. When you're a lesbian, you guys just sit there, you

688
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:43,740
talk, you talk, that's sex to sex for lesbians is sitting and watching TV. You

689
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:47,640
watch like a period piece and you think about the boobs in a corset. That sounds

690
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,640
awesome. I guess so much better than I have a lesbian sex all the time. When I

691
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,800
go home. This is basically this is basically

692
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,720
when you put it like that eat dinner.

693
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,320
What is lesbian? What the fuck do they do man? I really never learned. I was

694
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,720
completely

695
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,120
I would have to imagine that has to do with the living room. You're sitting in

696
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,240
the living room with your mom and dad, Downton Abbey's on, you just go whoa,

697
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,560
that was crazy.

698
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,160
please fuck on down Nabi and no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no

699
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,520
I'm saying that that's that's lesbian sex is watching. I'm asking a separate

700
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,400
question. I've never seen down. Have you all seen blue is the warmest color? No,

701
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,160
what's that? It's basically a movie about lesbian. So they like they pick up food

702
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,400
together and they walk around. They look at trees at the same. Why is every

703
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,880
romance movie about walking around and looking at trees? Why does every give me

704
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,400
one? Then listen, give me a romance movie that starts at the end of dinner and

705
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,780
ends when you go to sleep. Yes,

706
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,460
yeah,

707
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:59,260
where are these in one location or on a to maybe to maybe to one position,

708
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:05,140
maybe for two minutes, a two minute long movie in one location, one position

709
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,980
that's now here's a sex move. Let me put you on what's you say hey girl flip

710
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,860
over no all the way over back to where we started.

711
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,900
What do you call that

712
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:24,020
The waffle. The pancake. The hotel waffle maker. Flip that thing all the way over.

713
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,020
Do you remember that E-Fucked video? I remember every single one, just name it.

714
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:31,020
That one where it's like the... Except for the really sad ones.

715
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,020
Well, this is the saddest one. I skipped all those.

716
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,020
The E-Fucked was so awful because half the time it would be somebody farting

717
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:41,020
and half the time it would be people having sex and then the guy would be like

718
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,020
"Argh!" and like punch the girl's arm or something.

719
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,920
oh, this one isn't funny. Who's watching this shit? No, the saddest one was the

720
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,720
one where it's like the guy.

721
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,120
It's like, I just like this is the virgin who won the contest and he nutted

722
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,620
immediately. That's not sad. That's a that's a giant victory. That's a victory.

723
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,520
That's a victory for him and the girl. Yeah, I guess you think that when

724
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,620
someone nuts too fast, it's a tragedy. Well, he's embarrassed in the but when

725
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,820
they not too long, it's a comedy. They not too long and

726
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:15,120
not too long plus time beforehand equals comedy equals comedy, nothing plus

727
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:20,180
equals sex, nothing plus mouth equals funny, nothing plus poop equals funny

728
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,760
for some. Would you guys sexual for you guys were a girl? Would you eat nut? I

729
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,800
would I would try both ways. I would have two boyfriends, one boyfriend. I

730
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,420
would always swallow the other. I would always spit one boyfriend, vegetarian

731
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:38,560
and I would switch it up on him after a while. So you think it sure to make

732
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:43,020
sure it's not just about which guys not see. I knew I knew that if Cameron was a

733
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,980
girl, he'd be a complete. Do you think you think nut is more? You think that

734
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:50,820
having two boyfriends makes you a slut? You have not seen anything of the modern

735
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,860
world. Yeah, yeah, basically women these days will have forty to fifty

736
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,380
boyfriends. If you're in New York,

737
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:06,920
they got fifty boyfriends. Sorry, thirty to fifty, thirty to fifty,

738
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,840
boyfriends,

739
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,460
thirty to fifty, feral boy. Can we bring that shit back man? Bro, I want to

740
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,180
transport to do

741
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:19,280
calling your penis a hog. You too, man. That's what I have you ever seen the

742
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,960
video where Joe Rogan's at the gym locker room and he has his first of all,

743
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,820
I don't know why saying my thing a hog gave me a like a heart,

744
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,020
phantom pain. You have one. Oh shit, I cut my thing off. Listen,

745
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:38,700
Joe Rogan in like 2008, he hired Brian Redband to walk around with him and film him all the

746
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,700
time.

747
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,700
Is that different from Brian Regan?

748
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,700
Yes.

749
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,700
It's different.

750
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,700
Brian Regan is a guy.

751
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:44,700
Clean comic.

752
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,700
Brian Redband is another guy.

753
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,700
Is Brian Regan a clean comic?

754
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,700
Yes.

755
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,700
Yeah.

756
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:49,700
Yeah.

757
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,700
And he's also one of the funniest comedians that has ever lived.

758
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,700
He says moosen.

759
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,020
He says, "Damn, these bananas are good."

760
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,020
It's funny.

761
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,020
Remember that joke?

762
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,020
Remember the...

763
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,420
I only know the one about the moosen.

764
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:01,300
He has that joke where he says he wrote on the Planet of the Apes movie and he's like,

765
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,500
Yeah, it's when the ape general is coming out and he's like walking, he's bringing all the

766
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,940
prisoners into the prison and I wrote this line where he says, "Man, these bananas are

767
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,220
good." Great joke.

768
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:18,340
Joe, what's the, I think the one before that though is like where they put in the title

769
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,780
at the top, they always put the title at the top of the book that you're reading on the

770
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,780
pages.

771
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,780
Oh yeah.

772
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:24,780
They always have the title at the top.

773
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,780
And he does the act out.

774
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,100
He does the famous gif.

775
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,100
That shit is funny.

776
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,100
God damn, that special was amazing.

777
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:30,100
I'm going to go home today and I'm going to watch Brian Rees.

778
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,700
I'm going to go over to that

779
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:37,240
funny anyway. Brian Redman was his cameraman and there was this guy who

780
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:42,020
went to his gym, who went to Joe Rogan's gym that Joe Rogan was like you're gay

781
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,140
and you always look at my penis in the locker room. They film the the

782
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,520
consultation yeah, so they fit they bring a camera into the men's locker

783
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,880
room and film him being like

784
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,620
man you've been looking at my penis. You're looking at my dick the whole time

785
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,940
and the guy clearly is like mentally disabled yeah and it's just like looking

786
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:03,080
down at the ground all the time and Joe Rogan decided to bring in a camera to

787
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,200
the

788
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,800
men's locker room.

789
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,580
That's a no no to bring a camera into a locker room. It's not supposed to happen.

790
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:15,660
Except for a Dancing Bear reverse video. They don't do those in locker rooms.

791
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,460
Flip side of that coin,

792
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:22,700
he also brought his camera to the comedy store and there was just a time where

793
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:26,220
he was just confronting motherfuckers. He brought his camera to the, his flip

794
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:46,260
video

795
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,260
It's a little loud.

796
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:48,260
Scrams.

797
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,260
I guess I could turn it down.

798
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:50,260
You're addicted to scrams.

799
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,460
If somebody plays scrams, I scram.

800
00:44:52,460 --> 00:44:53,580
I'm getting the fuck out of there.

801
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,580
I'm getting ice cream.

802
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:57,900
I'm sitting down watching the rest of the show at the ice cream parlor.

803
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,820
Everyone keeps making fun of our genre.

804
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,880
It's called Screamo.

805
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
We gotta think of a cooler name.

806
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,880
Scrams.

807
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,380
We gotta think of something no one will make fun of anymore.

808
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,380
Scrams.

809
00:45:05,380 --> 00:45:06,380
What about Scrams?

810
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,220
What about like the name of like an alien that you didn't know the name of from Star

811
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,220
Wars?

812
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,100
What about a weird snack from the 90s and the Middle East?

813
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:14,100
No.

814
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:15,100
Scrams.

815
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:18,060
we have to call it something different. We have to call it midwestern

816
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,240
emo.

817
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:25,220
That's not emo. Emo is already such a bad name. Yeah, emotional, hardcore.

818
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,100
Yeah, that's fucking way and it started with dag nasty in the eighties and and

819
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:34,140
I ended with fucking black parade bro. Yeah, that murdered it. Yeah, when I

820
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,980
was fucking hate what these scene kids did to emo because I'm sitting over

821
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,900
here. I'm trying to listen to stuff like cool bands like cap and jazz. Yeah,

822
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:45,900
And I'm trying to listen to them do a cover of "Take On Me" where they can't

823
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,860
sing any note that's above a B or below a C. I hate these scene kids wearing

824
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:54,360
skinny jeans. It used to be you pull up to the Hardcore Show and the 55 white

825
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,860
guys wearing propeller hats. That's what we need to bring back. Exactly. Oh my

826
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:01,300
God. Now that now... Propeller hats, bro, you got me thinking of death grips.

827
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,300
Yep. I have a death grip on my propeller hat, so nobody takes it.

828
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:09,660
When you're in a meme battle and you...

829
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,940
I need to me battle your opponent's a death grips fan.

830
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:18,580
Damn that would be a fucking annoying. I would kill myself if I was in death

831
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:23,320
grips. I would feel so horrible. I that guy has a big cock, big white car.

832
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:29,280
Yeah, yeah, I got that. I have that on on vinyl, and you lick that. I like it.

833
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,040
You put using it. You use it like a look at this. You thought it was a

834
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:35,740
place mat yeah, yeah, I should make a place matter that that'd be funny. It's

835
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,600
a funny album cover. It's a very good thing to make and when you first hit

836
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,520
they just they don't deserve what no, no, no, that really should not have

837
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,160
happened. It could not have happened to people who I feel like would take it

838
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,120
harder. They seem like very like esoteric, kind of like serious people

839
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:53,120
like they have that video. The interview with M.C. Rodney's like I'm

840
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:56,300
not interested in surface reality. That's like yeah and you're like okay

841
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:00,000
man, you probably want to die so bad right. You know what you brought in

842
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,140
all these fucking annoying as teenagers,

843
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:08,880
all these like demons names tattooed all over you and like yeah spiders and

844
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:12,720
stuff. Yeah, yeah, man, sometimes the most cringe people make the most based music

845
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,640
bro. Yeah, but I honestly can't imagine how death grips feels. I don't have any

846
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,680
experience that's like that at all, where I do anything and the people who like it

847
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,080
are annoying or strange. The people who like this show are good working class,

848
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:28,400
good blue collar folk, working class sixteen year olds, yeah, with

849
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:32,240
boogers, they always got boogers in their nose, like that little kid in Wind

850
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:36,600
Waker running around with a big snot bubble. Oh yeah, why do they do that in

851
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,720
Is that a common problem in Japan that somebody will have a giant bubble of

852
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:45,040
snot because they fell asleep? So disgusting I had to that was that you

853
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,920
did not have a giant snot bubble. It have a big snot rocket. I was walking

854
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,800
home from school. I had a

855
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,960
I shot it out my nose and it I'd let it hang for a second. I took a photo one

856
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,240
time the entire inside of my mouth turned into snot dude. I'm really feeling

857
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,160
like not and it came out when I was a kid. So it's let me see on let me bust

858
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,100
I just try it man. You don't want to see my mouth. I'm really feeling recently

859
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:08,860
like not. I don't want to

860
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:14,600
man leave my mouth leave his shit on stop trying to bust in. Jeez dude, I'm

861
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:18,280
really insecure about the inside of my mouth. Don't put your penis in his mouth

862
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:22,540
and jack. I'm going to buy that's not what busing means for me. I work hard to

863
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:27,700
keep a biome that is acceptable. My cousin's got a mouth. How come people

864
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:31,120
didn't have to brush their teeth until we invented toothbrushes? They think

865
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,540
they died at fifty years old. Yeah, they lost all their teeth at twenty five.

866
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,840
Yeah, I'm going to lose my teeth soon. I'm losing a lot of mine. I think mine

867
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,440
are I think mine are all going to go at the same time. This out. I think my

868
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,900
entire front top row of teeth is going to all fall out in the next two or three.

869
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,660
You see that right there in the next two or three dreams. I didn't have enough

870
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:52,300
money to get a crown and then I had a temporary filling and then the temporary

871
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,620
filling fell out. So now I just got a cracked tooth again. I haven't had a

872
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,300
tooth dream in a minute. Remember I had that crack tooth for like a year. Yeah,

873
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:05,480
That was evil. Yeah. I've been feeling recently not like I want to go to Tokyo.

874
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,440
I've been feeling like I want to go high up on a mountain somewhere in Japan and

875
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,640
become maybe a fisher. Yeah. Yeah. For me, it's China. I just don't. I think

876
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:21,360
Japan clears China all day. All day. I'm going to stay where I want to go, which

877
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,680
is South Korea. It's kind of so five years ago for you to say that. I just

878
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,980
please don't I don't know it's a little cringe to be honest. Well, then I

879
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,080
actually like it's a little normy. I want to go to the north, the Santa Claus

880
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:33,640
North Pole.

881
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:40,240
Okay, that's honestly even more cringe. Is that why because that is for kids?

882
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,680
They don't take adults there. I want to go to toy land.

883
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:50,560
Why do I do a podcast with these freaks? I want to go there and I think that I

884
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,680
could, but I keep watching these videos. Have you seen this guy? I don't remember

885
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,780
his name, but he's this guy who like interviews people in Japan. No, you

886
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:01,180
haven't seen this dude. He walks around and he asks people like, "What do you

887
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:04,880
think of foreigners in Japan?" And they're all like, "I think they smell bad."

888
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,140
So a lot of them like them, though. There's a big... That's why... That's what

889
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:12,440
every... It really breaks my heart. Every real life jumped out of the TV screen

890
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,160
comic book guy, they wanna go to Japan because they read that in Japan, when

891
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:21,160
people... When Japanese people see a person with white skin, the women will

892
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,840
basically jump all over them like the which is not credibles. The video is

893
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,640
sticky ball scene. I've been you get you go to Japan, you get covered in black

894
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,920
sticky balls. Well, the black sticky balls in this case are a metaphor for

895
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:38,280
Japanese women. Oh, okay, you've been on a crazy tip lately, but

896
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:43,640
yeah, straight up, you've been saying some weird shit, but it turns out, but it

897
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,400
turns out that as much as Japanese women like white conversations have got me

898
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:53,100
don't so much like fat and stinky guys. Oh yeah, which is oh maybe maybe that it

899
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:58,520
maybe it's a selection bias where the the kind of people who moved to Japan

900
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,200
from America just smell kind of bad yeah yeah,

901
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:05,220
but no, I think we definitely talked about this before, so we don't have to,

902
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,300
but I feel like I want to live in rural China, but I don't want to be the white

903
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,280
guy who moved to rural China, so I'd like to just steal the life of a Chinese

904
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,520
guy and take away. Yeah, we talked about this two weeks ago yeah, and then he

905
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:18,020
said he wants to move to Japan and become a high schooler and then I

906
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:22,480
change my answer. I want to live on the island of misfit toys or I guess I

907
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,480
could be a werewolf. You're only one to live on the island misfit toys,

908
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,880
'cause they got a dentist there.

909
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:34,160
Maybe that elf, maybe it would be why did he get free dentistry? I don't

910
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:38,360
think it's free. He only did dentistry on the king. Dentists are the biggest

911
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,280
scammer. Crazy shit to come up with an elf dentist. They must have been

912
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,760
smoking a toy. Stick to the normal Christmas shit. They must have been on

913
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,600
nitrous. They must have been on crazy toys.

914
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,160
But think about it. That's the most evil elf of all time because he wants to say

915
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,840
like, "Oh, well, I can't take that tooth out because you don't have enough.

916
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,280
You don't have insurance." No, he wants to take the teeth out.

917
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,440
There's no insurance. Why is he Jay Leno?

918
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,480
Yeah, well, you look at this, you got a little piece of shit in your mouth.

919
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:04,080
Oh, dude, that would break my heart if you went to the dentist and said,

920
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:08,360
"I don't, I listen, I hate saying this. I really do." You need a brush better, man.

921
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,720
You literally have a piece of shit in your mouth.

922
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,580
listen, listen, and your dentists, Jay Leno in this in their hard turd, your

923
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:18,900
teeth in general, they're very clean, pretty you're taking yeah, you're taking

924
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,900
good care of them, you're on the right, you're clearly flossing, you're clearly

925
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,880
brushing too, but please get a love of God, just at least brush one time before

926
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:30,800
you come here, because there you left shit. There's actually you must I can

927
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:35,020
tell you a shit before you can maybe you didn't even eat it, but you did put it

928
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,600
in your mouth. It was in your mouth. If you're going to put shit in your mouth

929
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,260
and again, your teeth are clean, they're fine. Besides the shit, you teach that

930
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:45,600
we have the worst prank on a dentist is walking, walking in and you have a

931
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,000
horse poop in your tooth

932
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,980
and it's just the dentist is picking around with that little stick.

933
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:55,780
What do you think's the most embarrassing thing? You know all those

934
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,780
stories of like, oh, this guy had a toy shoved up his ass, there's an x-ray.

935
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,300
What's the most embarrassing thing to find on that x-ray if you go to the

936
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:06,340
doctor? The doctor or the dentist? Specifically, are we still on dentist?

937
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:09,260
The doctor. I feel like there's almost nothing more embarrassing than just a

938
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:13,340
big turd in your body. No, that's what's him yeah. Well, no, because you're not

939
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:16,000
going to go to the you're not going to like go to the super market, get

940
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,540
embarrassed of the food in there is

941
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:22,060
what go to the super market. Yeah, well anyway, based on what Patrick said was

942
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:25,860
maybe extrapolate think what he was trying to say is that the poop isn't

943
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:28,900
really your fault. So yeah, so maybe it was a poop that they could clearly tell

944
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:33,100
did not belong to you, but maybe be really embarrassed, but it's like a big

945
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,740
poop. It's like okay, you're something your body did clearly. You didn't a dog

946
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:40,480
it's a with a name tag on it. We're going to we got the poop out. We're

947
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,020
going to have to run

948
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:46,600
it's a is actually we can tell if this poop came from a girl in the in the in

949
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:50,080
the in the x ray. You can see the poop is wearing a name tag that says Brian

950
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:54,240
yeah and it's like dude. You got Brian's poop in you. This is actually made.

951
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,940
This is now we've ran. We had to run a bunch of tests and it was kind of

952
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:01,040
confounding the lab guy a little bit. He this is he said it was the strangest

953
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,920
case he's ever seen. This is actually a hundred different people's poop. It's

954
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,600
would mix together. We're able to tell it was mixed together with a spoon in a

955
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:10,440
bowl. I think we're going to have to bring in Doctor House on this one. Yeah,

956
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,440
well, the thing I think the most embarrassing thing that could happen is

957
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:20,360
you go into the MRI machine and you got a fully metallic, but plug in you forgot

958
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:24,000
to take it out from the shoes around shoots right through you like a bullet.

959
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,840
You'd probably like it, though that should be a mortal combat fatality.

960
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,100
should put a doctor in the

961
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,200
M. R. I.

962
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,400
They should put a nurse in mortal combat that can't fight back

963
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,160
why

964
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,120
is killer.

965
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:49,480
They're adding all types of characters. These days, superheroes to mortal

966
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,480
combat. They put Jason and Michael Myers in it. I was

967
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,760
a

968
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,920
so did you guys hear this Jason Mamou? Apparently he was drunk and he said

969
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,320
that Amber Heard was going to die. He dressed he dressed up as Johnny Depp and

970
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,300
was all drunk and came to the set and demanded that she be fired. Oh my God,

971
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:10,400
the new Aquaman trailer. I've seen it a couple times in theaters before movies.

972
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,900
It makes me laugh every time for the two things in it make me laugh or one

973
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,920
when black man it's like a normal trailer and then it just cuts to black

974
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:23,200
man and he says I'm going to kill Aquaman, destroy his family and also

975
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:27,280
always try the world and maybe on every and then there's a and then there's

976
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,340
also at the end of the trailer, the amber heard is back in the movie, I

977
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:35,600
guess, but they only show reveal her literally for point two seconds. I do

978
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:38,400
like a shorter than any cut has ever been in a movie. They just show her

979
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,160
for a like clearly just be like okay contractually. We have to show that

980
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:44,100
she's in the movie, but we need it if we do it fast enough. Maybe nobody will

981
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,840
notice and get

982
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:49,640
that's so for that. I thought you were saying we're not taking side of this. I

983
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,580
you're saying like like you know in like they reveal that like Spider Man is

984
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:56,820
going to be in the MCU. Oh yeah, I do it like

985
00:55:56,820 --> 00:56:03,340
clearly trying to black is so hard. It's like it's crazy. What does she even do

986
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:08,640
so she she moved in a bed and she I guess was also what's wrong with that

987
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:13,840
the rude to him over him biting her finger. Oh, she was rude to him. She this

988
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:18,420
guy bet bit her fingers off and then she said ow did somebody's finger get bitten

989
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:23,260
enough. I don't know in this case. There was a photo of Johnny Depp asleep next

990
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:27,100
to a bed. Somebody's finger got bitten off in this. I'm like eighty

991
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:32,460
two percent. Do you think that us three any one of us could put together a

992
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:36,380
pretty good kind of like case it like a against Johnny,

993
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,260
we should do a mock trial.

994
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,700
It probably will be

995
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:47,540
probably will be a trial. You said I said mock trial. You left you said yeah,

996
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,280
when you press the button for ketchup. Yes,

997
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,480
why

998
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:56,360
okay, imagine that us doing the mock trial right, okay, you guys order in the

999
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,080
court. This is

1000
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,100
what does that have to do with anything? I don't know that's a flop. That's a

1001
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:01,780
certified

1002
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,580
flop.

1003
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:08,080
We recorded two episodes back to back. Explain yourself though. Crazy as hell

1004
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:11,060
or so you're thinking I'm gonna we're on another level. We're on we should

1005
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:14,680
record two episodes every time and throw away the first hour. I kind of agree.

1006
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,920
feels so good. Yeah, I feel energized beginning of the first episode. We

1007
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:20,920
recorded that will come out next week, so I guess we could hint about stuff in

1008
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,720
it and do I was tired. I was sinking into the ground. I was getting dragged

1009
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,720
into underground heaven and now I'm being affected. I am wide eyed,

1010
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:33,280
bushy tailed and I'm ready to fuck. There were certain factors to the old

1011
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,840
program that we did before we shifted into this video where we would sit there

1012
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,840
for I think thirty minutes and just sit at the microphones and not hit record.

1013
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,000
when we would do it. When did we ever do that? We would do that all the time.

1014
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,000
We'd sit in front of that. We would sit there and then I remember doing like

1015
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,320
six hour stints. Every single time Caleb would go, "Okay, wait, press record

1016
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:56,360
right now," and then that's how we would start everything.

1017
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,080
I'm not sure I remember that. I think I remember Caleb saying, "Press record

1018
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,360
right now," when someone sang a funny song or had a weird butt. We would

1019
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:08,440
basically just sit. Yeah. We used to sit there until we had a song. We would sit

1020
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,240
there until we had a song. We need to sit there. I'm on cloud nine. Yeah. I

1021
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,960
think I was cleansed. How can we bring you back to earth? Yeah, let's get you

1022
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:19,080
back to maybe you could get that what I'm in like you're addicted to drugs,

1023
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:24,060
man. I'm not into drugs. White cocks. I'm on is the cold, brisk air of the

1024
00:58:24,060 --> 00:58:26,760
autumn season. What is this? Five o'clock right now, right? It's four

1025
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:27,120
forty

1026
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:30,440
o'clock. I'll chug one right now. Grab to do

1027
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:35,320
what man? There's two. I'm not an able. I can't chug one right now. I gotta go

1028
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,760
to the dog park. This is bullshit. I'll fall asleep if I drinking it. This is

1029
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:44,320
bullshit. I'm flipping out now. I'm having a meltdown. I'm freaking out.

1030
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,660
You're keeping me from the thing I love.

1031
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,800
I'm not keeping you from anything. You're keeping yourself from crawling

1032
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,400
under the table. You're afraid there's a monster down there or something.

1033
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,520
Look at me. There's no bugs on the floor. Look at me in my eye. Pat,

1034
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,840
can you check under my chair for a bed bug?

1035
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:02,080
Here, I'll check.

1036
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,500
why are you making the dick sucking noise? I never done that before

1037
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:16,320
yeah yeah, hey check this out guys.

1038
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,460
You just think that's what you're supposed to do. Are you okay?

1039
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:23,340
I'm

1040
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:29,800
supposed to do. I ever saw a video of two guys, sixty nine each other. I saw

1041
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,860
that video. The was I saw the video video, the dinosaur never seen a video

1042
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,920
two guys sixty nine. How did guys sixty nine the balls are around? I think they

1043
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,720
like the balls. I think most guys who well fuck they like wearing the balls as

1044
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:43,460
sunglasses

1045
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:49,480
really sunglasses type. I think I'm gay yeah. That's just funny. Have you ever

1046
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:53,980
had balls on your eyeballs? No, but one time all my cousins took turns farting

1047
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,120
in my face while I was asleep

1048
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,700
and then I woke up and I hit and then my the last one to do it was my brother and

1049
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,060
I woke up and I thought just he did it and I beat him up yeah and then it

1050
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:07,420
turns out just walk around. All my cousins ran a fart train on my mouth.

1051
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,460
There was this there is. I think I told you guys about this, but there is this

1052
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:16,000
we were all like is me my cousins and then like our friends from school. My

1053
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,460
my cousins live down the street. We're having a sleepover and

1054
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,300
this one kid was like I have to go to bed early. I have a wreck basketball

1055
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:27,860
game in the at seven in the morning and I'm not going to miss it and it's like

1056
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:31,480
zero. Why did you even sleep over? You were the first one to fall asleep.

1057
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:37,240
There's there you are in for a night of pranking and we put I think it was like

1058
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:42,000
his legs, icy hot on him or something. We might have like done like a icy hot

1059
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,800
slap to the face or something or some crazy thing we did with icy hot and then

1060
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:52,240
he ran out and attacked our one friend who did nothing. Yeah, that's how it is.

1061
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,960
It's always if you wake up from a if it's like a bunch of people, you find the

1062
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,460
one guy who's just like that's because he's the we know no defense. Yeah,

1063
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,840
because of course the the weakest guy is not going to do the prank. He said he

1064
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:07,840
screamed, fuck you, cocksucker, and then wasn't on the ground, kicking up and

1065
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:12,400
said, only pussies kick, but he was kicking while he was doing the the while

1066
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,640
he's doing that phrase. Okay, call it, tell that to Bruce Lee. Yeah, only

1067
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,880
pussies dead. Yeah, tell that to his son. Then one of the funniest movie, one of

1068
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,060
the funniest you know after when Bruce Lee got popular, they

1069
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,740
they tried to make a bunch of like they tried to capitalize on it. So they got

1070
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:32,220
a bunch of other guys who are not Bruce Lee, but we're just also Asian and they

1071
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,960
named them like they gave them stage names like Bruce Lee, L, I and like all

1072
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,520
a bunch of guys and like that that was like a big. It was it was like like a

1073
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,440
bunch of copycats, obviously movies and then when Bruce Lee died, there's

1074
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,800
something that came out. It was with I think it was with Bruce Lee, L, I may

1075
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:51,760
very different bruce lee an imitator type guy, but it was it was called exit the

1076
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:53,200
dragon enter the tiger.

1077
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:55,720
Oh my God, okay,

1078
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:59,960
exit the dragon, exit the drag, enter the

1079
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,040
so funny

1080
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:08,920
that's insane. Imagine if there was like

1081
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:15,240
like just they were doing that for like Daniel Tosh or something Daniel Dosh

1082
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:20,700
we're putting in your thoughts. I guess is exactly what happened with Rob dear.

1083
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,940
That's ridiculous, and he's Daniel Dosh Daniel Dosh. You know you,

1084
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:29,340
hello, it's me, Daniel Dosh, Daniel Dosh. Hey, imagine if there was like a

1085
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,280
sketch show at little field on October twentieth that that happened yesterday

1086
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,300
and no, no, okay, wait tomorrow. Oh my God, this happened back. Well,

1087
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:41,660
right, this we backlogged yesterday's or Wednesday. This is exit the dragon

1088
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:46,300
enter the tiger. Now it can be told see Bruce Lee choose his successor and then

1089
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:51,480
because Bruce Lee his death avenged by Bruce Lee, I the new martial arts master

1090
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,660
was that's sick. That's actually fucking disrespectful. That is so

1091
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:00,420
disrespectful to do that. I feel like this guy actually chose his successor.

1092
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,040
It's the guy who we gave a name. That's the

1093
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:07,440
exit and Caleb. What were you saying

1094
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,540
you need to exit the dragon and enter the sketch show at Littlefield on

1095
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:18,600
October 20th. Guys, it's us, it's Podcasts About List as well, and it's also Pierce Campion

1096
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,300
and Alex Forrest and Joe Gleason.

1097
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,720
Why'd you say Podcasts About List as well?

1098
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,540
Because those are our altered egos.

1099
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:25,540
Those are our stage names.

1100
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:31,340
And then also, you, it's, also.

1101
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,340
It's tickets at swaggroup.com/joe.

1102
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,940
You gotta buy a ticket, man. It's gonna be fun and it's completely different from the

1103
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:37,940
last time.

1104
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:42,940
We've grown all completely. Look at the new sketches over there.

1105
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:45,940
Okay, now be a nerd.

1106
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:47,940
Oh, you look weird, man.

1107
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:48,940
Now be a nerd.

1108
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,940
Okay, yeah, well, I think we have to end now because now we're just playing with a GoPro.

1109
01:03:52,940 --> 01:03:53,940
But, come on out, guys.

1110
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:54,940
Time to eat.

1111
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:55,940
Time to eat.

1112
01:03:55,940 --> 01:03:56,940
Ketchup.

1113
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:57,940
Ketchup.

1114
01:03:57,940 --> 01:03:58,940
Ketchup.

1115
01:03:58,940 --> 01:03:59,940
Ketchup.

1116
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:00,940
K-K-K-K-K-Ketchup.

1117
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:01,940
Bye!

1118
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:02,940
K-K-K-K-Ketchup.

1119
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:07,940
Is it unattractive to women when you throw your back out?

1120
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,940
Yes.

1121
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:09,940
Really?

1122
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,940
Man, if you hurt yourself.

1123
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:11,940
That sucks.

1124
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,940
If you ever stub your toe, this is what you should do. You say, "I didn't stub my toe."

1125
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:17,940
"I didn't stub my toe."

1126
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,940
"I didn't stub my toe."

1127
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:20,940
Number two.

1128
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,940
Wait, can I just ask your fans real quick?

1129
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:24,940
Lady fans, what is more attractive?

1130
01:04:24,940 --> 01:04:28,940
When a man peels off his shirt like this and then kind of drops it?

1131
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:30,940
Well, you just did that gaily.

1132
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:31,940
Right.

1133
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,940
Okay, well, if he did that straightly.

1134
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,940
If someone did that straightly.

1135
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,940
If he's peeling off his shirt.

1136
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:39,940
When he peels off his shirt?

1137
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:46,560
or if you just pop out of it. If you pop out of it. If you pop out of it.

1138
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:50,960
Do you mean rip out of it or you mean pop out of it as a different thing?

1139
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,680
Like if you kind of flex. Like you go like this, you go like this and then

1140
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,760
you're next to all your clothes falling in a pile next to you. You get raptured

1141
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,940
out of your clothes. You get a nice crawler bamf out of your clothes.

1142
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:05,600
Like you have clothes that are on you with suction cups. No, like there's a

1143
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:08,780
tear on your, you flex your bicep and then your bicep pops out of that. I

1144
01:05:08,800 --> 01:05:12,000
I don't think a single person has ever done that.

1145
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
That necessitates having a very tiny shirt on for anybody.

1146
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Right, well that's what I mean.

1147
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Is it more sexy when you peel off a tiny shirt?

1148
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:25,000
If you're a woman, leave a comment down below, address it to Pierce, say "Dear Pierce."

1149
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Write what you think is sexy about a boy taking off his shirt or whatever, however way.

1150
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Is it sexy? Because I think it's sexy when a boy pops out.

1151
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:43,000
The question is, so your question is, women, do you think it's sexier when a man takes off his shirt or explodes his clothes?

1152
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Do you think it's sexier if a man explodes his clothes or takes his shirt off?

1153
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Women, do you like it when a man pops out?

1154
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Pops out or takes his clothes out?

1155
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Slides.

1156
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Slides or pops?

1157
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Do you like it when a man slides on you?

1158
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Sliding or popping?

1159
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,700
Dear Pierce, I like sliding. Dear Pierce, I like popping.

1160
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:05,400
This is a new column. This is a new column for the show.

1161
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,200
Amanda.

1162
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:07,200
Dear Pierce.

1163
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:09,800
'Cause all men have this relationship.

1164
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:12,400
My boyfriend has been taking his shirt off.

1165
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,400
He's been sliding.

1166
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,400
He would pop. I wish he would pop.

1167
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,000
How do I get him to pop?

1168
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:21,000
All men have this sliding and popping dynamic that they do in their daily lives, right?

1169
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,000
