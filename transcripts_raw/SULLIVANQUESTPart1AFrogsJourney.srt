1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The year is 2042.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,440
It's a summer day in Brooklyn, hot as hell, and I'm sweating my balls off because President

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,480
Xi turns off amenities between 1pm and 5pm on weekends after Weird Al's son made a song

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
parody of the Chinese National Anthem.

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,720
My phone is ringing upstairs.

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
It's my agent.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,640
It's going to change my life forever when I pick up that call.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,040
But right now I'm sitting on the balcony dangling my little toesies between the banisters,

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:33,520
tossing eggshells at the crackhead sleeping on my brownstone stoop

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,400
trying to scratch his cornea

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,440
somewhat unconsciously but I know what I'm doing

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,920
when my phone's ringing

13
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,940
so my first instinct, I scream for my wife

14
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,920
then I remember

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,240
she took the kids on vacation again

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,080
she always takes the kids on vacation

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,640
we have these two

18
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,120
miserable

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,840
little redheaded shits

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,620
and that's her side of the family

21
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:04,560
in every way, and I don't care what they say about recessive genes

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,780
that's all her shit

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,840
I'm 5'7"

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,880
I'm swarthy

25
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,100
with a little

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,040
less than generous hairline

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,860
beautiful thick brown mediterranean hair

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,660
she's a 6'1" scandinavian mutt

29
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:20,600
of some kind

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,280
so whatever freak

31
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,840
northern italian blood or sicilian bullshit I have in me

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
you know it's not nearly as responsible

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,200
uh... you know quantitatively

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,520
and uh...

35
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,720
qualitatively right then the sanguine concoction

36
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,000
courtesy of the

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,480
fucking hill people she sprang from

38
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,960
for the redhead thing

39
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,300
anyway

40
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,800
she's always taking the kids

41
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
and and

42
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,720
they're these awful

43
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,680
little kids

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,640
really awful twins

45
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,080
completely dead behind the eyes

46
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,480
and that's my fault really

47
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,360
i was touring nine months out of the year

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,000
for a better part of the decade

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,760
selling out venues everywhere

50
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,480
across the planet

51
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:11,400
podcasting night after night after night

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,000
i probably should have been home

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,640
my wife's a cardiologist

54
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,440
smart lady

55
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,480
but overpaid and underworked

56
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,100
she could have done something

57
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:27,380
She couldn't bother with kids, you know, when they were infants.

58
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,640
So she passed them off to my poor mother, who was a disaster at the time, and continues to

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:41,580
be a disaster, since my father died in the bathtub thing he did with the rope.

60
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,380
So those little pukes, my stupid fucking kids, had free reign.

61
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,620
They're posting note app apologies when they were three and a half to give you an idea

62
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,620
of what was going on.

63
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:57,520
You know I have a buddy who knows President Xi, knows him, and he said his kids, the ones

64
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:06,640
with whatever her name, his fourth wife, Olivia Rodrigo, his kids with her, they were weaned

65
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,380
off all that shit before anybody else knew about the thumb cancer or the Palantir squads,

66
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,240
killing Tim Cook, all that shit.

67
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,320
So he knew, of course he knew, but I didn't know, nobody knew really, but I didn't know

68
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:44,320
I'm

69
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
I lost another egg shell at that crackhead who honestly

70
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,320
looking back

71
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,320
he might have just

72
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,320
might have just been some

73
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,320
amazon guy

74
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,320
you know you can't really tell because so many of them

75
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,320
are the

76
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,320
metal dogs right the Boston

77
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,320
the Boston dogs so you just see a skinny guy

78
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
who looks like he hasn't eaten or slept in 3 days

79
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
and you think uh

80
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,320
you know whatever it's just some fucking crackhead

81
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,320
they're being round up anyway

82
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,320
so

83
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I might as well throw an eggshell.

84
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,920
But so, anyway, I walk to the third floor.

85
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,320
So I have to do that. I go upstairs and I have to pick up the phone.

86
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
And I pick up the phone.

87
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,320
And it's my agent.

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,820
Hey, Price.

89
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,320
Patchy, how you doing, buddy?

90
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
I'm alright, man. Why you calling me though?

91
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,820
I told you, email only.

92
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,820
I know, um, I understand.

93
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,320
But I wouldn't call you unless it was something really special.

94
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Oh yeah?

95
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,820
Yeah, I'm not pulling your dick, Patchy. I'm serious.

96
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,320
Hey, I wish someone would.

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Oh my god! Yeah, see that's what I like to hear, that's actually hilarious.

98
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,320
Okay, so remember when you and the boys-

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,320
Don't.

100
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Okay, right, so you and the um, what are you, the podcast about betraying Patches?

101
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,320
That's right.

102
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:03,320
When you all toured for a while, and we stopped in Nashville one night, and you got your head stuck in a sink, and that girl pulled you out.

103
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:09,320
The one with the ass, what was her name? It was like Sarah or Serena, something with an S?

104
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,680
I don't remember her name, but her @ was Tina Fuego.

105
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,320
Yeah, Tina. Okay, so it turns out the Cash app was bullshit.

106
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,320
'Cause her dad created a chemical that wiped out the homeless in San Francisco after the first cataclysm.

107
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,820
And so I've been blackmailing her, and I think she can get you a good audiobook deal.

108
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,320
I paused for a moment there.

109
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,820
Even when I worked with those traitors.

110
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,320
And I was putting out some of my best shit.

111
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Making more money than I knew what to do with.

112
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
The book deal was all I ever gave a shit about.

113
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,880
This teena girl was really that rich.

114
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,760
Maybe I really could become

115
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:54,260
The guy who wrote and recorded one of the great American Wang Shichuan province audio novels.

116
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:57,640
You not yanking my cock price?

117
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
No, this is 100% brother, it's real.

118
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,640
So, you got something I can show people or what?

119
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,640
The real answer was no, but I said no.

120
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,640
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

121
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I got nothing.

122
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,640
I mean, uh, nothing good enough right now.

123
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
It's, it's, it's, uh...

124
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,640
Okay, so, don't get in your head about it.

125
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,640
Just give me anything.

126
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,640
Literally just give me whatever you want.

127
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
Okay, okay, okay.

128
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Uh, can, a week?

129
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Give me a week, I have this, um...

130
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,640
manuscript.

131
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,640
Yeah, that I'm working on.

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Give me a week to punch it up.

133
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
How's that sound?

134
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,640
That's great, yes. A week is perfect.

135
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,640
Thank you so much.

136
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
This is gonna change our lives, man.

137
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,640
Okay? Yeah.

138
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,280
Yeah, and I really believe that. I'm not just saying that.

139
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,400
And I- and people have been waiting for this, uh, forever.

140
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,160
And I- that's also true.

141
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,800
And the comeback is here, baby!

142
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,600
And that, uh, all- I believe all that shit.

143
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,560
So, I'll call you in a week.

144
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,200
Alright, ciao.

145
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,820
Fuck.

146
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,280
So after...

147
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:05,400
drinking my chemical peel smoothie and doing poppers for what felt like 30 minutes,

148
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:13,240
I felt ready to turn something out, pen to paper, microphone to audacity program.

149
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:19,400
But staring at that blank .AUP file thinking what the hell was I going to say, I started

150
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
to panic.

151
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,160
It was always easier when it was the four of us together, even after I suspected that

152
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,080
they betrayed me.

153
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,720
The pod boy, the pod traitors.

154
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,480
It always made this look a hell of a lot easier than it is, and made me feel like I could do

155
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,480
it too.

156
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,880
Now that I'm on my own in my perfect, beautiful Brooklyn brownstone with my fat-titted wife

157
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,280
and loser children, it's not the same.

158
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,280
Maybe that's...

159
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,280
Maybe that's what I have to do though.

160
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,040
I have to record something that recreates that feeling.

161
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
You know that feeling of

162
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,480
telling stories and jokes with your boys

163
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,320
Recording something for each other not for anyone else not even the audience

164
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,860
Hanging out staying up all night watching

165
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,960
Dashcam vids watching

166
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,720
Stupid fucking movies made by whack jobs

167
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,240
building our own

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,000
stupid weird mythology around all the moron shit we like

169
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,400
Gaming in way way too late into the evening buying each other joke gifts

170
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:37,160
Building children on the internet

171
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,400
Doing it all again the next day

172
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,720
Before we got huge

173
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,680
Before we played at the garden

174
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,440
Before that plane crash killed Chapo

175
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,840
Before Wang Xi Shang

176
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,760
For the blue check killings

177
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,640
I pressed record.

178
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:07,240
It should start kinda classic, like a Princess Bride-y kinda thing, right?

179
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:12,400
So, uh, not ne- an uncle telling a story to a nephew, not like a grandpa to a grandson,

180
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,400
something different.

181
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:18,160
An uncle telling a story to a nephew, a fantastical story, you know all the beats, you know how

182
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,200
it's supposed to go, but, but, you know, you know that I know too.

183
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
Oh ho ho, Sonny Boy!

184
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
How about I read you a bedtime story?

185
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
Hey, redo it. I fucked- I cut out.

186
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,200
Fucking God damn it.

187
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,200
You did- I heard one and then that was it.

188
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,200
I was like, why did he start at one?

189
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,200
Alright.

190
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
We gotta do another countdown.

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Well, Sonny Boy!

192
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
How about I read you a bedtime story?

193
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,200
Uncle Jakey.

194
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,200
I don't want another bedtime story.

195
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,200
I want to play video games.

196
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:01,200
Well Tommy boy, what if I told you there were video games in the book?

197
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Ah, I'd play those instead.

198
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:14,200
Oh my sweet, sweet Tommy boy, you can't play video games in a book, but you can imagine them.

199
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Imagining stuff is always better than actually doing it.

200
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:25,200
(Groaning)

201
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
Okay.

202
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Well...

203
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,200
Read the story then, Uncle Jakey.

204
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,200
And make sure you keep in all the scary bits.

205
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:45,200
I can fucking handle it.

206
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
I know you can, my Thomas.

207
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Well, once upon a time there were three friends.

208
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Caleb, Cameron, and Peter.

209
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,200
And they were about to play a video game.

210
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
Okay, and then we'll have another layer.

211
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,200
And this time, it's three friends who are hanging out, and one of them brings a video game over.

212
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,200
And those guys are a bunch of...

213
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,520
You know, they're mourning their friend who died, who they never betrayed.

214
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Yeah, yeah.

215
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Hey guys!

216
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,120
Can you knock, dude?

217
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,680
Seriously, Pete, what if Caleb and I were doing something privately?

218
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,280
Well, how could that be?

219
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,240
There are no secrets between us.

220
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
That's true.

221
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Yes, that is true.

222
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:38,120
I mean, we'd never take a trip with Steve Harvey to the UAE without any of us, right?

223
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Definitely not.

224
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Especially not Patches, who died defending a thousand women from a shark.

225
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
That's right.

226
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,120
Anyway, I got this new game I wanted us to play.

227
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,360
It's an RPG called Sullivan Quest.

228
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,600
I think it could be really fun and reminds me of Patches, who died, beloved, and was

229
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,600
never betrayed.

230
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Cool.

231
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,600
Pop that bad boy in.

232
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:12,600
[Gameplay]

233
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Press start?

234
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,600
I don't mind if I do.

235
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,600
And then the final layer.

236
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,600
That's the game.

237
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,600
Hello?

238
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,600
Hello?

239
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,600
Where am I?

240
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,600
You must strike now, Sullivan. The organism demands it.

241
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Organism?

242
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,600
Well, where am I in school? What's going on?

243
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,600
Oh God, I didn't study for this test. I'm gonna fail!

244
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Pencils down, please.

245
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
Oh no, I didn't even finish.

246
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,600
Oh no, now I'm making it to the sports ball championships, oh god.

247
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,600
Oh no, it's another bad dream.

248
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:14,600
And now here at the sports ball arena we have Sullivan the frog on the field who is showing us one of the worst bodies of all time.

249
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Am I seeing this right, Jack?

250
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:25,600
Oh that's right, that's right Steve. This is probably the worst body I've ever seen in my history playing the sport and uh, I played it a lot.

251
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:33,600
That's exactly what I was thinking Jack, that this was maybe the worst body I've ever seen. Disgusting in almost every way, even for a frog.

252
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Oh no, my poor sweet Salamander. I can't believe you're such a stinky little...

253
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
Mama no! Not you too!

254
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,600
This is the Gun City Police. Open up! Open up! You're under arrest!

255
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,640
I am Sullivan the Frog, guilty of all charges.

256
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,600
May God have mercy on your soul.

257
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,600
No! You got the wrong guy!

258
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
You got the wrong guy!

259
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,600
You must strike now, Sullivan.

260
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,600
Strike at the organism. Cleave it in twain.

261
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,600
It's a dream. It's a dream. It's a dream.

262
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,600
It's just a dream. It's a dream.

263
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,600
This is no dream, Frog.

264
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,600
This is your nightmare!

265
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,100
*Alarm*

266
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,600
It...

267
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
It says press A to wake up!

268
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,600
Just press it.

269
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,600
*Alarm*

270
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
*Gasp*

271
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,600
*Sigh*

272
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,600
What a terrible dream.

273
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
Surprise, Sullivan!

274
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
*Screams*

275
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Oh dear.

276
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,600
Oh.

277
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,600
Oh, Sullivan baby, I didn't mean to scare you.

278
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,600
I'm sorry about that.

279
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,600
And look, now you fell out of your bed and took one point of damage.

280
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,600
That means you only have one point left.

281
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,600
It's okay, Mama. Thanks for wishing me happy birthday.

282
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Of course, sweetheart. Fifteen years old, you're nearly a man.

283
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,600
I can't believe my own two froggy eyes.

284
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
Well, come downstairs when you're ready. I have your favorite breakfast prepared.

285
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
Spanakopita? Really?

286
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,600
That's right, sweetheart.

287
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,600
Oh, thank you, Mama. I know Gun City outlawed Greek cuisine last year, so that means a lot.

288
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,200
and I plan for my special little tadpole.

289
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Oh, mama.

290
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,000
Well, I'll see you downstairs, hun.

291
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Just use the directional buttons to move

292
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,800
and press A to interact with any objects or characters around you.

293
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,400
Gee, mama sure is sweet.

294
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,600
I better go downstairs right away and eat that spanakopita

295
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,200
before mom goes to jail for making Greek food.

296
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:36,000
So, you can move around now, I guess.

297
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,640
Oh shit, Pete, try to read what's on his desk.

298
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,640
*Pete's desk*

299
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,000
Is it gonna make that noise every time he moves?

300
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,560
God, tablet, check some of his stats.

301
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,440
*Tablet*

302
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,600
Wow, he really only has 2 HP.

303
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,760
He has no weapons or armor either.

304
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,520
Wait! Oh no, he has a banana peel.

305
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Banana peel? Use it, dude.

306
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,400
*Banana peel*

307
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,080
*Pete screams*

308
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,600
*Pete dies*

309
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
He just slipped and fell and died.

310
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,000
*sad music*

311
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,900
Hello?

312
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,900
*everyone talking at once*

313
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,600
Why would they make this unskippable?

314
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
And so they watched the intro all over again.

315
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,100
But Sullivan did have his spanakopita, and it was delicious.

316
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,600
And he gained back that hit point he lost.

317
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,100
But eventually, even frogs need to go to school.

318
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,100

Wow! I can't believe I turned 15 just this morning!

321
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,100
I wonder if anyone will notice how much I've grown and changed since yesterday.

322
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Let me try talking to my fellow students by pressing "A" when I'm next to them.

323
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,100
Bug off, Sullivan.

324
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,100
Bug off Sullivan.

00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,100
Bug off Sullivan.

326
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Oh wow!

327
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
It's Belinda Crokes, the prettiest frog in school.

328
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
A straight 4 out of 10.

329
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Should I press A to interact with her?

330
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Uh, hi Belinda.

331
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,100
Oh hey Sullivan, happy birthday.

332
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,100
Wow, you remembered?

333
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
Sure, why not?

334
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Wow, I can't believe she remembered.

335
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,100
Maybe she'll be my friend.

336
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,100
Oh hey, I'm Belinda Crokes.

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100

Well look at what we have here!

354

Ugh, Bully Frog, you don't mean all that now, do you?

356
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
Hey, what did you just say to the boss?

357
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,100
I don't remember him asking you to speak either.

358
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,100
Oh gosh!

359
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,100
Why don't you knock it off?

360
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,100
Ooooooh!

361
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,100
Oh wow!

362
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,100
Sullivan has a girlfriend!

363
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Ewwww!

364
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Why don't you go back to the hole where you were born in and drink gallons of poison and

365
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
fucking kill yourself you stupid bitch!

366
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,100
Hey, don't talk to her like that!

367
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,100
Ooooooh!

368
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,100
You can have your meat!

369
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,100
Oh that's it!

370
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
You're dead meat Sullivan!

371
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,100
I'll see you after school punk!

372
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:24,100
You know, you didn't have to do that. I can take care of myself.

373
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,600
Oh, I'm sorry. I... You stepped in so I just felt like...

374
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,100
Never mind, Sullivan.

375
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:36,100
I have to go to class. I'll see you later.

376
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Aw, now I gotta deal with Bullyfrog after school.

377
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:46,100
Today, class, we'll be wrapping up our unit on the early days of Gun City

378
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,280
With an AR film directed by Gun City High School alumnus,

379
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:55,320
Melanin Brooks, who made a short documentary about Sullivan de Granouille,

380
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,520
the worst explorer in Gun City history.

381
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,600
Now everyone, put on your Da Matrix 2 gogs and watch the movie,

382
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Teachy Nee Drinky.

383
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,600
[Groans]

384
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Guess I'll equip the gogs and get watching.

385
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,560
Long ago, Gunn City was a barren land.

386
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,960
Many explorers wished to travel to the Gunn City Landmass and pave over all of that shit

387
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,880
and put up 100 apple bees.

388
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:34,120
One such explorer was Sullivan de Granouille, a frog folk explorer pathetic in almost every

389
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
way.

390
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,240
Hey Sullivan, that sounds like you to a freaking T man!

391
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,400
Sullivan de Granouille traveled the vast wasteland of the Gunn City Landmass and documented his

392
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,140
journey in a cyber journal. He traveled with many allies, but his two dearest

393
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,320
companions were a four-hire mercenary toad named Bule Krapad, who was said to

394
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,040
be one of the strongest mercenary operatives in Blackwall, and had

395
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,840
pronounced issues stemming from a broken household.

396
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,840
"Duh, hey, bully frog, that sounds a lot like you."

397
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,340
"SHUT THE FUCK UP!"

398
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:10,200
And the other, a beautiful heiress to a pharmaceutical company named Berendela Croaca,

399
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:15,920
who was said to have amazing abilities and access to a computer.

400
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,960
Together, these three and their crew traveled the Gunn City landmass wastes before any city

401
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:26,800
representatives or corporations did, and apparently saw incredible sights and made brilliant discoveries

402
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,640
about our wonderful land.

403
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,200
DeGranouille documented all of it in his journal, which he called Sullivan's Quest.

404
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,600
However, he misplaced it, so now we don't know what he saw.

405
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Degrenouille tried to tell everyone about his journey, claiming that the land was not barren,

406
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,120
but in fact a verdant paradise, but no one believed him because he seemed a little creepy.

407
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:53,120
When he died he said, "In many years, a young frog just like me will have his own quest,

408
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,040
and he will discover the truth behind Gun City, the things that none of the city officials

409
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,440
or corporations want the people to know."

410
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,080
Ah, the wound in my balls that is spreading to my penis, and then he finally died.

411
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,880
Hopefully, nothing like what he said will ever happen.

412
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,880
And anyone who even thinks of trying to explore anything, or uncover anything, knows exactly

413
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,320
what would happen to them if they tried.

414
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
The End.

415
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:28,080
Well, wasn't that just grand.

416
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,800
Okay, class is now over.

417
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Take your knowledge pill before leaving and you're free to go.

418
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,360
Ta-ta!

419
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,520
I think we have to leave the school now.

420
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,120
Wait, don't just leave.

421
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,000
Try talking to the teacher or seeing if there's like a secret item or something.

422
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,520
I'm off the clock, Sullivan.

423
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
I'm off the clock, Sullivan.

424
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,840
Oh, I think that's all she says.

425
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm gonna order a pizza.

426
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,960
Okay, there are students talking.

427
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,800
See if you can listen in.

428
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,080
I heard the janitor got a new mop that can inflict poison damage.

429
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,800
Uh, didn't he get that from his wife after she passed?

430
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,960
Yeah, someone would have to be a real jerk to take that.

431
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,200
Oh, okay, we gotta go to the closet. Come on.

432
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,800
But, Uncle Jake,

433
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,080
why would they do that?

434
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,760
That's...

435
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,840
not very nice.

436
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,680
Well, in video games Thomas, sometimes you have to do something bad.

437
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:35,680
So you can get cool shit and use it to win the game.

438
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Ah, okay.

439
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,440
I guess that makes sense.

440
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,640
What's on your mind young Thomas?

441
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,640
I don't know.

442
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,640
I guess I'm a little, ornizol.

443
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,640
I guess I'm a little, uh, worn is all.

444
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Well, let's just keep reading the book then, okay?

445
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Fine.

446
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,640
Then what happens?

447
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Hey Sullivan, it's after class. Time to fight!

448
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,320
Uh, perhaps we can resolve this in some other fashion.

449
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,760
Fat chance! Or as my dad would say, if you tell anyone about this I will fucking kill

450
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
you.

451
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,760
I'm gonna pulverize you!

452
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:37,040
Ow! I took one damage, one more and I'm dead. I don't know how to fight. What is this turn

453
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,960
based combat I'm doing?

454
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,160
Hey Sullivan, need a hand?

455
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,560
Belinda, what are you doing here?

456
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,840
Saving your behind!

457
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,360
Look, all you have to do is select an attack, and then select a target.

458
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,560
I'll use my little hacker stun gun to shoot Bullyfrog.

459
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
It's easy, watch.

460
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Yowch!

461
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
A girl?

462
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,560
A girl just hit me?

463
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
See?

464
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
Now you try.

465
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Oh god.

466
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,560
Guess I'll select an attack.

467
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,560
Ow!

468
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
That hurt!

469
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,560
Where did you get that moth?

470
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,560
From a crime man in the supplies closet.

471
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,560
Dammit, I'm actually really sorry.

472
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,560
I'm not going to do this again.

473
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,560
I'm going to get you.

474
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
Ow!

475
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Ow!

476
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Ow!

477
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:18,560
I'm actually really strong, but I have a migraine and also my stomach hurts, and I'm really tired.

478
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,560
But this isn't over, Sullivan.

479
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Wow, we won!

480
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Wow Belinda, thanks for your help back there.

481
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

482
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:39,560
Well my dad was an ex-corporate operative for ASUS, so he taught me how to defend myself at a young age.

483
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Wow, that's cool.

484
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,160
Yeah, I guess. I miss him though.

485
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,360
Oh...

486
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,160
I'm sorry.

487
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:52,160
It's okay. He left my mom and I a ton of money when he died, making everything a lot easier.

488
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,960
Plus my new dad is really nice, and he's a feminist.

489
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,360
Oh, that's great.

490
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,160
Anyway, try to stay out of trouble, okay?

491
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
And here, I got you a birthday present.

492
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:06,660
It's a band-aid! You can use it to heal after you take damage.

493
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,660
Oh, thanks!

494
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,980
Don't mention it. Anyway, I'm gonna go. See ya, Sully.

495
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,980
See ya? Ha, neat-o, a nickname!

496
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:21,180
Well, time to get home. I wonder if Mama made me more spanakopita for dinner.

497
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,700
Why does this frog want spinach pie so bad?

498
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,340
'Cause it heals me.

499
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,940
How do I... how do I open up the map to fast travel home?

500
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,940
FUCK, I FORGOT TO GET THE FUCKING PIZZA!

501
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,300
*Groans*

502
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,640
Wait, you know who loves pizza?

503
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,060
Patches.

504
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,500
Yeah, that's true. He did love pizza.

505
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,500
Pat, just hit start and go to the map and click on home.

506
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,780
I mean Pete.

507
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:46,780
I know. I was just joking.

508
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,780
My name is Pete.

509
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:54,780
Hi, Mama. I'm home.

510
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
Oh, hi there, Sullivan.

511
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Look who's here.

512
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:00,780
Wow, it's my tough-as-nails cousin,

513
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,780
John Carlo, the frog.

514
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,780
Hi, John Carlo.

515
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,780
Dot, dot, dot.

516
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
Oh.

517
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:13,540
Now, Sullivan, John Carlo's going to be watching you this week while Mama heads to Cancun.

518
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Cancun?

519
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,260
You mean Cancun the desert oasis on the outskirts of Gadsville?

520
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
That's right, hun.

521
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,820
Your cousin John Carlo got an all-expenses-paid trip from his job doing, um, what is it you

522
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,460
do again, hun?

523
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,860
Contract killer.

524
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,940
Right.

525
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
And he gave it to me.

526
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,300
How sweet of him.

527
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,060
Oh, uh, great.

528
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,980
Well, I have to go.

529
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,780
The laser helicopter leaves in half an hour.

530
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,780
Ah!

531
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,780
This is so exciting!

532
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,940
Thank you so much Giancarlo.

533
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,740
I really needed a vacation.

534
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
No problem Mama Sullivan.

535
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,980
Have a good trip.

536
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,940
Oh I will.

537
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,020
And please take care of my special little tadpole while I'm gone.

538
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
Oh Mama, come on.

539
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,020
Well alright.

540
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,020
I'll see you in a week.

541
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,020
Woo!

542
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,020
Cancun!

543
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
Errr.

544
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,020
*door slams*

545
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,020
Uhhhh...

546
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,020
Dot dot dot.

547
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Dot dot dot?

548
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
Dot dot dot.

549
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Uh, okay, um, I'm gonna go do homework.

550
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:20,020
It's nice to see you though, John Carlo. Thanks for giving my mom a vacation.

551
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:25,020
Hey Sullivan.

552
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,020
Yeah?

553
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,680
Nothing.

554
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,240
Uh, okay.

555
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,380
Dat dat dat.

556
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:44,280
Whew, well, that was a lot of homework.

557
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,880
I'm pretty tired now.

558
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,680
Guess I'll go to sleep.

559
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,960
[Sleeping Beauty]

560
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,320
Solvin!

561
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
Solvin!

562
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
SOLVIN!

563
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
Solvin wake up!

564
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
We gotta go!

565
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Giancarlo?

566
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
What are you talking about?

567
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
No time to explain.

568
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Do you have that map you stole?

569
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Err, yeah.

570
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,320
How'd you know I stole the map?

571
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Okay, good.

572
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
What's all this noise?

573
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
What's going on?

574
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
They finally came for you kid.

575
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
A bit earlier than I thought they would.

576
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,320
They?

577
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Earlier?

578
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,320
Me?

579
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Look, I'll explain on the way, okay?

580
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
Just let's go!

581
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Woah!

582
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
We got Jolly Roger!

583
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
We got Jolly Roger!

584
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,320
We got Jolly Roger!

585
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
We got Jolly Roger!

586
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
We got Jolly Roger!

587
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
We got Jolly Roger!

588
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
We got Jolly Roger!

589
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,320
We got Jollibee agents.

590
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,320
Jollibee agents? But I don't do nothing to the government.

591
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
I don't even jaywalk.

592
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
That doesn't matter now. You know how to use that mop?

593
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

594
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Good. You're gonna need it.

595
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,320
These Jollibees are pretty speedy. Try using your frog arts.

596
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
My frog arts?

597
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,320
All frogs have the ability to use frog arts to do some serious damage.

598
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,080
Neither Gun City nor the Stankums Federation of Bodies and Spaces wants you to know that though.

599
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,960
Just concentrate on your happy place. A place where froggies love to hop and smile and eat delicious flies.

600
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,140
Then select the frog arts option in the combat menu and let her rip.

601
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:08,680
Okay, I'll try.

602
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:16,220
Whoa, I just shot magic from my mouth! Nice work Sullivan, you took him out in one shot.

603
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,000
A mount caster. It's pretty rare.

604
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,600
Uh oh, watch out! Here they come!

605
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,100
Now it's my turn.

606
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,600
Woah! Giancarlo's dual magnata!

607
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,600
And his gun!

608
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:43,100
Come on Sullivan, let's go!

609
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:46,100
Guess I gotta follow Giancarlo!

610
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,600
Okay, I got the pizza

611
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:55,860
Finally, okay, buddy next time you can get the pizza. Maybe I will guys shut up. They put Sullivan on a motorcycle

612
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:05,440
Stop rocking around the sidecots not swinging your mop at the enemies coming by this is like a mini-game. I think let me play

613
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,960
No, I said we'll switch off after I die. Yeah, but this whole intro you're never gonna die. So it's not fair

614
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,960
Well then next time you can get a game and bring it to your friend's house, then you can play it first.

615
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,960
And then Caleb said, "I love pizza! Yum, yum, yum!"

616
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Uncle Jake...

617
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
*Groans*

618
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm starting to get really, really...

619
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,960
Really...

620
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,960
Really, really...

621
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,960
Really...

622
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:53,640
really really really sleepy you think we can wrap this up soon now hold on

623
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:06,720
there's just a little bit more oh it's the nightmare assassin nightmare

624
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,720
You're an assassin!

625
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,720
Sullivan, you gotta drive the motorcycle.

626
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
I'll hop in the sidecar and hold them off until we break the city barrier.

627
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,720
Oh god!

628
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,720
You can do it kid, just drive!

629
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,720
We meet again Giancarlo.

630
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
Dot dot dot.

631
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,720
What's the matter? Flying out your tongue?

632
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,720
This will be over soon.

633
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
The board will not stand for this betrayal.

634
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
And after all they've done for me right? Blah blah blah.

635
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,840
Let's get this over with.

636
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,360
Have it your way.

637
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,280
Time for my ultimate attack.

638
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,520
Step on it, Sullivan!

639
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,340
Hurry!

640
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,840
Here I go, here comes the barrier!

641
00:31:48,840 --> 00:32:02,480
Blast it all, they got away!

642
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,480
Hmm, that young frog is impressive. Could he be? Hmm. We'll have to find another way.

643
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:16,120
Move out operatives!

644
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:23,120
We did it. We broke the barrier. Nice driving Sullivan.

645
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:37,240
Thanks. What was all that? Why were they after me? You said you'd explain!

646
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,240
I will. I promise. But we'll only be safe outside of the city limits for a little while.

647
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Then they'll be after us again. Never mind all the creepy creatures out here. Let's get moving. We have to get to the base.

648
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,240
The base? What do you mean?

649
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,240
First we're gonna have to walk a little bit to get there.

650
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,840
We gotta be careful though, a lot of random encounters between here and there.

651
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,840
Let's go.

652
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:06,240
Why are there so many monsters?

653
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,640
I feel like we walked half a mile and we just had to fight like a hundred guys.

654
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,640
We don't gotta worry about that any longer.

655
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
We're here.

656
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
What?

657
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,640
I don't see anything.

658
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
Just under there.

659
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Where?

660
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,640
Under where?

661
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
That's, that was good.

662
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,640
You got me.

663
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
Thank you, thank you.

664
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Under where though?

665
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,640
I don't see anything but the wasteland that surrounds Gunn City.

666
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Huh, the wasteland.

667
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
Look, I'll show you.

668
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
You just have to knock on the ground like so.

669
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,640
Whoa, the ground's splitting open.

670
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Whoa.

671
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Stairs?

672
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
What's down there?

673
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Whoa, the ground's splitting open!

674
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Whoa!

675
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Stairs?

676
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,280
What's down there?

677
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,160
Somewhere safe.

678
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,360
Somewhere special.

679
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,360
Come on.

680
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,040
Oh my god.

681
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,680
This place is amazing.

682
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,600
So wet and warm and...

683
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,920
Frogs everywhere!

684
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,920
Welcome to the pond, Sullivan.

685
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Your quest begins here.

686
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Man, I'm beat.

687
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
That last part was tough.

688
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
I think I'm gonna head home.

689
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
You wanna play this again tomorrow?

690
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
If we have to.

691
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Ugh.

692
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:31,920
I just wish Padges were here.

693
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:36,920
He was our most loyal friend and his death hurts us all forever.

694
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:47,920
If he were some bitter, balding podcaster with fat kids and a stupid bitch wife, he would

695
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,880
still be cool.

696
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:57,920
But he's definitely cooler dead, where everyone can miss him.

697
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:02,960
When I stopped recording I was hard as shit.

698
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
This is it.

699
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,560
People were gonna fucking love this.

700
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,800
Goodbye Brooklyn Brownstone, hello Westchester McMansion.

701
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,400
But seven and a half minutes of work was tough, especially at my age.

702
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,480
So I smoked some medical K2 and seized in my recliner until the sun started to set.

703
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,800
My eyes were rolling to the back of my head and my heart rate was soaring.

704
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,800
I tried to remember the last time a recording felt that good.

705
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,800
I thought if I can capture this feeling again and again,

706
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I'll not only have created a great American Wangshi Shan Province novel,

707
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,800

00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,800

712
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,800
As told by Uncle Jake?

713
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,800
Hmm, clunky. Maybe just... maybe just Sullivan Quest?

714
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:09,800
Yeah. Yeah, that's about it. Sullivan Quest. Yeah. Yeah, that's... yeah.

715
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Yeah, that's the one. Woo! Sullivan Quest, baby! That's the one! Yeah. Sullivan Quest. Yeah.
