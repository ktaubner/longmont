[Loud explosion]

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Welcome to the podcast about Caleb's peeing penis.

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Oh, fuck.

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,800
They fucked up, man. They really fucked up this time.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,800
They gave me a regular coke.

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Pat, stop.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Stop what?

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Pat keeps trying to call on Skype from his phone to interrupt the podcast and sabotage...

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,240
Sabotage my Coke moment.

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,960
I'm not trying to sabotage anything.

14
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,760
I'm trying to make the show better.

15
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Yeah?

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,720
By including an extra Skype source.

17
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,880
Including another guest, which is also me.

18
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,200
Saying the exact same thing at the exact same time.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,440
Pat, does it look like, when I hold this little Coke can, does it look like I'm the biggest

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
guy on earth?

21
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:55,440
No.

22
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,280
That looks like a regular Coke can and your hand is small.

23
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,120
(laughing)

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,960
- Take it, okay.

25
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,360
Can we stop the podcast?

26
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,200
- No.

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
- Okay, can you take that back on air then?

28
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,080
- Huh?

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,880
- Can you reverse what you said?

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,200
- I can't hear you anymore, I think.

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:13,160
- You think what?

32
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,120
- I can hear Cameron, but I can't hear you.

33
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:16,940
- What?

34
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,840
That's impossible.

35
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,400
- Yeah, I can't hear you either, Caleb.

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,940
- Oh.

37
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,760
This Coke is making me too strong.

38
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,400
- The Coke is making Caleb invisible.

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
- It's giving me ESP powers.

40
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,280
Yeah, ESP powers. That's what you get when nobody can hear you.

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,920
This is the most amazing thing. I've been drinking only strictly, I've been on a strict

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,320
diet Coke diet for about a month now and now I'm, this is my first real Coke in a long

43
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,320
time.

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,680
I don't know if I've ever drank Coke.

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
Do it.

46
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,680
No.

47
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,680
Come on.

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,640
You expect me to just drink, to ruin a streak of over 20 years just right now because you

49
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
want me to?

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,940
No, I'm not gonna drink the coke.

51
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,940
Just try it.

52
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,940
I want my first time to be special.

53
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:01,940
This is special.

54
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,940
It's recorded.

55
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
You'll always remember it.

56
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,940
Yeah, yeah.

57
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,940
No.

58
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,940
Come on.

59
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,940
This is Cameron's first time drinking.

60
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,940
I don't wanna drink it.

61
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,940
Why?

62
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,940
It'll kill me.

63
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,940
I hope so.

64
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,940
Come on.

65
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,940
A little sip of coke.

66
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,940
Drink it right now.

67
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,940
Or I'll...

68
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Oh my God.

69
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,940
He's gonna light himself on fire.

70
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,940
Patrick's gonna light himself on fire.

71
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:19,940
Come on.

72
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:20,940
I'm gonna light myself on fire.

73
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,940
Alright.

74
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,940
We're doing a first time ever coke review.

75
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
I'll drink it really close to the...

76
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
I'm gonna spill it all over the microphone.

77
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,940
Okay.

78
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,180
- Oh, it smells bad.

79
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,380
- It just tastes, I promise it tastes good.

80
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,740
- I accidentally smelled it.

81
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,580
It smells gross.

82
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,420
- Don't worry about the smell.

83
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,140
Okay, so the smell review is taken care of.

84
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,240
Now move on to taste.

85
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,780
- Wait, should we get him a glass?

86
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,860
- No, 'cause I still want the Coke.

87
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,060
- I'm gonna pour it out on the ground if I don't like it.

88
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,480
- Can we get him his own?

89
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,460
- I don't think so, unless he really likes it.

90
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,820
- He's drinking too much of it.

91
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,420
- No, yeah, I don't like that at all.

92
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,260
- What do you think?

93
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,220
- Actually, I think I have had Coke,

94
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:03,620
I think I've had it mixed with like with some kind of adult drink. Now that I think

95
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:10,020
about it, I drink coke every day. By adult drink I mean cum. The ultimate adult drink.

96
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:13,100
The ultimate adult beverage. What age do you have to turn before you can drink cum?

97
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:22,820
18. 12. 18? You're a little backwards. You think 18 year olds should drink cum? Huh?

98
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:30,100
Okay, so in Patrick's words, 18 year olds should be chugging cum daily?

99
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,420
That's kind of fucked up, Pat.

100
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
Yeah, man.

101
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,420
That's not that fucked up.

102
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,020
That's of legal age.

103
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,060
That's actually barely legal age.

104
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:42,460
Yeah, that's of barely legal age.

105
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,460
Nice.

106
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:47,220
Yeah, I don't like regular coke.

107
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,380
It's too sweet and also-

108
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,580
Because you're drinking it out of the can.

109
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,180
What do you mean?

110
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,180
It tastes different.

111
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,180
It tastes different.

112
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,180
It tastes different.

113
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,180
It tastes different.

114
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,940
God, you're a human fucking crack.com article.

115
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,260
I'm not a human crack.com article.

116
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
You absolutely are.

117
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,260
You take that back.

118
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,260
Yeah.

119
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,900
Tell me about ten times Einstein really wasn't that smart.

120
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,700
God damn it, dude.

121
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,740
That's a really mean thing to say to him.

122
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:15,300
Coke tastes different in a can than it does in a glass bottle.

123
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,300
That's true.

124
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
How would you know?

125
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,300
You're so owned.

126
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,300
You eat it.

127
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,980
Tell me how you would know.

128
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,980
Tell me.

129
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,260
Yeah, how could you possibly figure that out?

130
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
It tastes different.

131
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,260
Yeah, oh and you've tried it?

132
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,900
No.

133
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,020
No, didn't think so.

134
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,020
I'm sorry.

135
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,060
The sugar is making me lash out a bit.

136
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,860
I haven't had sugar in so long.

137
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,860
You have sugar rage.

138
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,900
I'm getting a sugar rage.

139
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,500
I feel a sugar rage coming on.

140
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I do, sugar does, it does get me.

141
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,820
Yeah, I've noticed.

142
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,980
I don't like hanging out with you right after you drink coke.

143
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,500
Yeah, it's not fun.

144
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I do get a little weird.

145
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,660
You just go, "Oh yeah, is that true?

146
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,660
And you're gay?

147
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,660
And that's it?

148
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,660
Huh?

149
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,660
Yeah?

150
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,660
Yeah?

151
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,660
Yeah?

152
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,660
Yeah?"

153
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,660
It's tapping a button on the podcast.

154
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:10,660
You're actually doing an impression of yourself.

155
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,660
Fuck.

156
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,660
See, sugar makes me a genius.

157
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:13,660
I have sugar brain.

158
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,660
I have sugar genius.

159
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:24,540
- Today, I texted you guys this, but I thought it was so funny that today I had a 1-800 flowers

160
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:29,020
order that is coming in for my girlfriend's birthday and they called me today from a number

161
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,020
- Is that what you just said?

162
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,860
- No, I did not say boyfriend, I said girlfriend.

163
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,260
- You said girlfriend's boyfriend?

164
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,580
- Yeah, my girlfriend's boyfriend.

165
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,820
- You ordered flowers for yourself?

166
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,860
- You got your girlfriend's boyfriend a bunch of flowers?

167
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,860
- Yeah, I did.

168
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,820
Yeah, he's gonna be pumped.

169
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,460
a bunch of flowers but it's a it's or it's orange flowers inside of a small

170
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:52,860
bonsai tree that has been cut to look like Master Chief's helmet. Damn that

171
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,660
sounds sick. Dude I would love I don't understand bonsai trees at all I don't

172
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:02,500
know why they stay small. They're trees? But why are they so small? Well they it's

173
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:11,020
probably in the DNA of the tree. If I had to make a scientific guess. I'm no expert but if I had to

174
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,980
guess it's DNA it's probably a psychological thing it was a big tree

175
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:21,500
got bit by a small by a bug and it split the difference it became a small tree a

176
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,460
bug had sex with the tree oh so what yeah tell it to the tell it to the fans

177
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:34,540
cuz Cameron I already heard oh yeah yeah yeah so the 1-800 flowers called me from

178
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:38,660
a number that was listed as potential spam which is when I should have started

179
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,100
recording my screen, but I just didn't even think about it. And I answered it

180
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,840
and it was a woman and I didn't-- she had a very heavy Indian accent. I hate that

181
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,260
all my stories have accents I can't do. It sucks! But it was-- and then she was

182
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,820
like, "Hey, do you have an order coming in?" And I was like, "Yeah." And she's like,

183
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,660
"There's a card attached to it that you wrote, correct?" And I was like,

184
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:07,180
"Yeah." And she's like, "Okay, I just want to confirm that this is what you meant to

185
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,740
write on the card and then she proceeded to read the first like two lines of I

186
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:19,060
Miss You by Blink-182. She was like, "Hello there, the angel from my nightmare, the

187
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,980
shadow in the background of the morgue." And she was like, "Did you mean to write

188
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:29,020
this?" And I was like, "Huh, I was like, 'Can you keep going? Because I want to make

189
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,180
sure it's correct.'" And she was like, "Yes, of course, sir. The unsuspecting victim of

190
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,860
darkness in the valley we can live like Jack and Sally if you want and you can

191
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,180

192
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:51,380
Hallowreen on Christmas. And she just sang the entire thing.

193
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,180

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
He subscribes to every single Patreon just in case somebody uses one of the songs.

219
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Yeah, just in case someone plays "I Wanna Fuck a Dog in the Ass."

half in the middle for no reason bunch of beautiful Japanese schoolgirls I

347
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:11,460

348
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:19,620
movie I mean yes it was it was sexy yeah what did you I used to play I played tag

349
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:27,380
or hide-and-seek rather pretty pretty far into pretty close to adulthood yeah

350
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,820
because me and my dad would go camping with you play tag with your dad I play

351
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:38,100

352
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,300
with him and his friend and his friend's kids who were like,

353
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,380
one was like a couple years older than me.

354
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,940
And we would play hide and seek

355
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,080
every time we would go camping.

356
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,000
And it was always really fun,

357
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,860
but this kid who was, he was like two years older than me,

358
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,500
until he was like 18, if he lost at tag, he would cry.

359
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,740
- Oh, nice. - Yeah.

360
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,700

00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,540
- No, it's not.

362
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,360
- Yeah, it's sad.

363
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,700
I mean, to be that guy, that would be sad.

364
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,740
Yeah, I know, it's sad to be a loser.

365
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,580
- I guess so, yeah.

366
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,900

368
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,000

375
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:38,660
the president. I just touched Patrick. No you didn't. Patrick's the president now.

376
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,620
Yeah Patrick president. Whoever gets tagged is the president. President Patrick.

377
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:49,380
But Patrick what would you be your first policy? My first policy is I'm not it.

378
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:55,580
Yeah I'm not it. What is your first policy as president United States? First

379
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:02,020
policy no tag backs. Fuck. So you can't tag Cameron back then. Yeah that's actually

380
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:06,020
good for me. Well yeah but if someone tries to tag me. But you're it right now.

381
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,020
Yeah but if I tag Caleb. Then Caleb's president. Like I just did. You didn't tag me.

382
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:14,020
You didn't tag me. And your policy goes away. Your policy's gone so you're still the president.

383
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,020
What? Fuck you, you're the president still. You idiot. You fucking loser.

384
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:22,020
Were you, did you sign an executive order that I'm still the president? Yeah.

385
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:26,020
It's right here. Yeah I just signed it. Ah!

386
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,020
Curses! Ah! Confound it all.

387
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,820
God, there was a guy in my in my high school who legitimately said curses when

388
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:40,740
he was upset. That's cool. He had something wrong with his brain, though. I

389
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,700
knew this kid in my like high school co-op that I went to in like 2014, I guess,

390
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:50,780
who told me all the time he was like, "Buy Bitcoin. You have to buy Bitcoin as soon

391
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:55,620
as possible. Please buy Bitcoin." When it was like $60 and I remember being like,

392
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,620
I don't have fucking $60.

393
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,120
Yeah.

394
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
And now he has to be...

395
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,620
Yeah.

396
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,620
Either really rich or very poor.

397
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620
Yeah, probably really poor.

398
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,120
Did you guys see this video?

399
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,620
No, I didn't see it. I don't see any videos anymore.

400
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,620
That's kind of my thing.

401
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,620
Is it a guy looking at like an Ant-Man costume?

402
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,120
Oh no.

403
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,620

404
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,620
It's a fuck doll.

405
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,620
It's a woman going in a hole.

406
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,620
No, it's a real lady.

407
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,620
That's not a real lady.

408
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
It's a real lady.

409
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,120
Yeah, it is.

419
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,480
No she's an illusionist because she never was in any danger in the first place.

420
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,240
Right. So what is the is this a fetish thing?

421
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:41,080
How much is this a gay thing? Well it is that too. To get rid of the women so you can fuck men.

422
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:46,320
Yeah. Wow and it perfectly matches up on the carpet. That's kind of scary.

423
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,420
Yeah. Anybody you know could have one of these. Ready? This is the best part.

424
00:23:51,420 --> 00:24:04,820
He puts the... He's putting an ottoman over the hole. And then just sits down on the couch and drinks a glass of water and goes to sleep.

425
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:13,260
That's sick dude. Yeah. Wow. Oh yeah but speaking of the tag thing. Yeah. I just

426
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:30,260
this

427
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:37,260
it

428
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:44,220
join in the boat sleepover and we'd only known him like one hour so we my brother

429
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,580
like explained to him like oh yeah we're we're like sleeping on the boat tonight

430
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:55,380
and like something like that and then he his mom like eventually found my uncle

431
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,300
and was like cornering him at this thing is like come on just just just let my

432
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:04,300
That kid sleep on your boat.

433
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,300
Did he?

434
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,300
No, he didn't sleep on the boat.

435
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,300
Why not?

436
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
I don't know.

437
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,300
Who is he?

438
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,300
You are a really bad friend to Mickey.

439
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
That's kind of fucked up.

440
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
No I'm not.

441
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
No I'm not.

442
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,020
You should have let him sleep on the boat dude.

443
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,020
I don't think so.

444
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,060
What if he was going in there to steal my shit?

445
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,300
He would be on the boat.

446
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,860
He's going to swim away with your shit?

447
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,620
No, the boat was docked.

448
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:34,100
Oh, you weren't even oh, so you were so it doesn't even count as a boat. Yeah, I didn't

449
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,440
No, this is just the lamest thing ever. I slept on a boat one time. I was

450
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,240
going to a family member's wedding and

451
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:52,580
For some and with like my parents and for some reason they decided they get to got Airbnb and they decided to an Airbnb

452
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:57,620
That was a boat. That's what my fucking mom did when it was in the boss horrible sucks

453
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,860
So why would you choose to do that?

454
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,820
Well, when we, when my mom did it was because she found a boat in Charlestown that was $30 a night.

455
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,940
Yeah, I guess that's like, yeah.

456
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,140
And she, okay, and we-

457
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,580
And that probably was part of it, yeah.

458
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,060
Yeah, I mean, it made sense, but it, it also took, it was like in the biggest dock,

459
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:18,580
maybe of all time, and it took like 45 minutes to take our stuff from the car to the boat.

460
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,380
If I remember correctly, it was like storming too.

461
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,820
Nice.

462
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:23,780
Yeah, it was not that cool.

463
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,380
And there was a giant octopus.

464
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,780
And there's a giant octopus and King Kong was fighting it.

465
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,780
And he was attacking the boat.

466
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,020
Oh yeah, it's all coming back to me now.

467
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,620
We had to fight it with spears.

468
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,460
Yeah.

469
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,500
Yeah, and I had a beautiful woman in a ripped dress.

470
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,340
Me and Caleb watched, and Pierce watched

471
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,540
the beginning of King Kong versus Godzilla,

472
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,020
so Caleb's got that on the brain.

473
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:48,180
Yeah, it's so funny hearing you and Pierce

474
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,740
talk about like kaiju movies,

475
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,660
'cause it just sounds like you're making them up.

476
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,500
Yeah.

477
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,320
Yeah.

478
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,160
You guys are just like,

479
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,640
You guys had one that was like, "Oh, have you seen Japan Man?"

480
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,640
Big Man Japan?

481
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,640
Yeah.

482
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,000
And I was like, "That's not a movie."

483
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
That one's like a mockumentary.

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Ah, that's cool.

485
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
About a guy who gets big.

486
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Like a scary movie.

487
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
A bunch of cops outside.

488
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Yeah?

489
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,040
Uh-oh, Patrick's getting arrested for what he said about 18-year-olds drinking cum.

490
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Yeah.

491
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,600
That's the response time, 20 minutes.

492
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,400
Were you aware that the women who were the subject of that joke were barely legal?

493
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Your Honor.

494
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,400
Your Honor, she was barely legal.

495
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,400
Calling a cop your honor.

496
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
May I approach the bench?

497
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,400

That guy's just like peas in public and he like peas under the table and like a burger king

00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,940
Just like he takes his day. I just peas on the floor

527
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:17,180
He's on an airport moving sidewalk. They're so funny. And then I saw one where he pees in a ball pit

528
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,700
No, he's like, oh god. No, I've been thinking

529
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:27,180

00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,660
Yeah, and Bill Cosby's that's right. Yeah, and Donald Trump's I

532
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:43,120
When we first got to LA you were doing that thing you were walking down we were walking down the walk

533
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,640
They just spit on every single star and I was laughing so hard cuz they're just like families taking pictures with stars

534
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,800
I said on one that somebody was taking a photo with

535
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:59,200
Yeah, just spitting on all the stars. What's Patrick doing? Patrick is such an such an online freak

536
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,260
We got frozen again

537
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,980
Dude the cops hate us

538
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,780
Well you're back it happened again, yeah, I don't know what the fuck's going on I

539
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:18,820
Think you're the glitch dude. I think you're the you're the glitch and you're glitching every piece of technology

540
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,460
They're the glitch you're the glitch you're Jack black and be kind rewind and you got electrocuted so badly that you're

541
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:27,060
demagnetizing the tape inside of your computer

542
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:30,300
We're gonna have to remake the internet.

543
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
What was going on?

544
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:35,780
I didn't hear any of that Hollywood story.

545
00:31:35,780 --> 00:31:36,780
Well the listeners did.

546
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
Yes.

547
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,780
So you just have to pretend you heard it.

548
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,780
React.

549
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
React to it.

550
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,780
Yes.

551
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,780
Cool.

552
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,780
The people are gonna go nuts for that one.

553
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:44,780
Yeah.

554
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,780
Alright, moving on.

555
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,420
Beatcon Rewind is such a good movie.

556
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,420
Yeah.

557
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,020
I saw that for the first time like last year.

558
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
So good.

559
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
So fun.

560
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
I saw that.

561
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,620
Because my mom and I thought the commercial for it with the Ghostbusters

562
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:03,660
theme was really funny. That's the only reason I saw that. I got that movie from Redbox

563
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:07,820
two different times and forgot to bring it back so I had two Redbox copies of

564
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:13,520
Be Kind Rewind. Yeah. Don't know where they went. I should steal all the movies

565
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,060
out of a Redbox. That'd be fun to do. You steal all the movies? Just when I have a lot of money.

566
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:24,420
Yeah, you have to take the entire row not so just like borrow them all and just pay a lot of money

567
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,180
But just keep them all

568
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:32,020
Just like when I'm yeah, there's no I mean in red box. There's no real like you don't have an account

569
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,780
No, but you did you have your credit card? Yeah, exactly. So when I'm rich, I'll have 1,000 credit card

570
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:39,700
Oh, that's just go to a different red box

571
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,260
Or can you use cash? I don't think so

572
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,840
thousand credit that'd be terrible business did you guys ever go like just

573
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,280
to the grocery store with your parents and just look at red box while they're

574
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,300
checking out I always looked at the games and I'd be like how about this dad

575
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:02,180
how about this how about you let me have this game and I get to play it I yeah I

576
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:06,060
looked at the games and I was like damn imagine playing a video game yeah I

577
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:09,340
would love to do that someday bucks a day they're way more expensive than the

578
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:13,100
fucking movies I mean yeah yeah it makes it they can make bank cuz they know like

579
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,920
parents that will let their kids buy a video game from a red box will pay a lot

580
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,680
of money I feel like you like this by the game at that you will never remember to

581
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:27,920
return a video game from a from a red box yeah I used to live really close to

582
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:33,080
a movie gallery and which is like a just a DVD rental place yeah and that was

583
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,840
like honestly that was like the best time of my life yeah there was like a

584
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,760
video store like a video rental place like right walking distance from my

585
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:45,440
house I used to go there all the time. It's the best. I used to look at Jurassic

586
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,280
Park 3 and never get it just like look at the case I was like damn if the claw

587
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,680

588
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,720
GameCube. Yeah dude Turok. Turok fucking rocked. I never played it but I watched so

589
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,560
many YouTube videos of that game. It was so good. Anything with dinosaurs man. Also Turok

590
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:08,040
was the it was like dinosaurs, guns, yeah and also like people when you shot people

591
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:20,160
the

592
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,160
miles away from my house. I don't know why I used to do this.

593
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,160
But I used to move to this video store

594
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:32,160
and then I would bring my friends with me and we would try to go into the

595
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,160
adult video section in the back. And all jack off on each other?

596
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,160
Yeah. No, just because it was a game to see

597
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,160
how long we could stay in the back or if we could even get in.

598
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:48,160
Yeah. It's like jackass.

599
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,760
there's a there's like a triple X. I want to try that now with you guys.

600
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Let's see if they let us in. He's giggling.

601
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Just walking around, "Oh my god, they're gonna kick us out!"

602
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:02,320
Similarly, there was a, all through high school, there was me and my friend

603
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,460
John would drive by this like triple X movie store and we would like it had in

604
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:12,240
big flashing red X's like a sign with big red X's on the front we are there was

605
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,360
never anybody there and we just thought it was a funny place and on his 18th

606
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:26,360
birthday he we made him a ghost outfit out of a like a big sheet and he just

607
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,360
ran into them into the store and just like ran around and like knocked over a

608
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:36,400
bunch of DVDs and then ran out and then realized somehow he dropped his wallet

609
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,120
while he was in there and so then he had to just go back in and be like hey man

610
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,800
have you seen like a wallet anywhere and he didn't even take the ghost thing off.

611
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,600
It's so stupid. There was a I think it's in Hudson but there's an adult bookstore.

612
00:35:54,600 --> 00:36:00,200
Nice. Whoa. But I don't know if they have I've never been in it but they have. Why do

613
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,560
you have a Lolita section? Yeah. That's weird. It's just one copy of Lolita.

614
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,280
just all the different editions of lolita but um there's that one and then I know

She's in my room. How do you pronounce her name?

619
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,280
Gislaine

620
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,320
Ma'am, isn't it? Like I know jerk

621
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,740
British people like to like jizz pronounce it with it. Yeah, they like jizz and they like the song Penny Lane

622
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:49,520
Yeah, so they combined that's how they got her into the perfect woman. Yeah, I

623
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:56,640
Like you know what say what she will about just laying Maxwell, but she stood by her man. Yeah, that's a girl boss

624
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,020
Mm-hmm. Yeah, she didn't really stand by her man. She kind of

625
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:04,420
- Yeah, she kind of killed him, honestly.

626
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:06,660
- Hey, that's cool too.

627
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:07,500
- That's true.

628
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,340
(laughing)

629
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,500
- It's also, also fine.

630
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,920
- Yeah, that's cool.

631
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,860
- It's better, those are the two,

632
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:16,100
better than any other alternative.

633
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,820
It's either standby or kill.

634
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,660
That's the other.

635
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:19,500
- Yeah.

636
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,340
- Yeah, and if you have, I mean,

637
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,420
yeah, Jeffrey Epstein, that's a tough one

638
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:25,880
'cause, you know, he was bad.

639
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,860
- What?

640
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,700
- He was like a bad, he was the bad guy.

641
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,540
I'm the bad guy.

642
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,580
- It's funny that like at some point,

643
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,020
there was a switch with him where it was like,

644
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,580
oh my God, he's like the worst guy ever.

645
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,300
It's like, how could you possibly?

646
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,460
He was so close to taking them all down.

647
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,500
He was almost a hero.

648
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,420
- Yeah. - Yeah.

649
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,260
I don't think.

650
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,380
- I didn't look at him as a hero like Caleb did.

651
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,220
- I did.

652
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,980
Me personally, I thought of him as a hero.

653
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,220
I thought of him as a-- - It doesn't use a--

654
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,060
- I didn't think of him as a hero.

655
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,500
I thought of him more as a main character

656
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,340
that I could play. - I thought of him as a hero

657
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,460
everything I thought he was a hero because he had 1 billion dollars. But he

658
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,620
was a pussy for getting arrested. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's when I lost respect

659
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:11,620
for him. That makes him a loser. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's kind of fucked up guys. Hey

660
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,580
hey hey you want to hear something really fucked up? Yeah. Jeffrey Epstein

661
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:19,300
was good. What? Yeah he was the good guy man. Oh my god I don't think I can handle

662
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,780
this. Jeffrey. I think it's comments like this that caused Jeffrey Epstein to self

663
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:31,900
harm. That's true. Yeah. There's a... me and Cam have been doing something every time, for

664
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,980
some reason only when we're in my car where... It's state-dependent memory. Dude, it's the

665
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:43,300
car. I guess you're right. You remember it whenever we get into the car. Anytime we're

666
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:50,060
just like driving by people and we pretend a cat called them by going like, "Hey mama,

667
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,780
damn you looking good. Yo, come here and let me give you some.

668
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,520
[Honking]

669
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
[Laughter]

670
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,940
And just go like, "Hey, let me holler at you."

671
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,940
[Honking]

672
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,600
Damn. Shit.

673
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,600
[Honking]

674
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,600
[Laughter]

675
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,600
It's kind of, it's endless fun.

676
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,600
It's so much fun.

677
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,100
It's like the greatest car game you can have.

678
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,100
It's a good road trip game.

679
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:14,600
Yeah.

680
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Who you gonna [Honking] that?

681
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,600
[Laughter]

682
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,100
It's a good one.

683
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Yeah, you're gonna make me...

684
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,100
Yeah, I'm about to...

685
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,100
Oh man, I'm about to...

686
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,100
Now you're getting into it, yeah!

687
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,100
Yeah!

688
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
Do it again, man!

689
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:35,100
Oh, I'm about to...

690
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:38,100
See, we all have a different technique, you know what I mean?

691
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
That's what makes it special.

692
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:40,100
Yeah.

693
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Yeah.

694
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
That one, when I do it, it really hurts.

695
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
It really hurts to hear. It's so bright.

696
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,100
Bright.

697
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
Bright? Yeah.

698
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:51,060
It's bright? It's bright. It's a bright noise.

699
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,340
How is that a bright noise? Loud.

700
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,420
Okay. You're the stupidest man on earth.

701
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Damn, I'm about to... See, that's dark.

702
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:10,940
Damn, you're looking like a whole ass...

703
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:15,900
It's funny to me every time. It's so funny.

704
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,900
It's such a crazy noise.

705
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:23,900
Screaming into my own stomach.

706
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,900
Damn girl let me.

707
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,900
It's really slow and loud.

708
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,900
Hey girl.

709
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,900
Hey girl.

710
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,900
Hey bitch.

711
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,900
Hey bitch.

712
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,900
Hey what's up bitch.

713
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,180
It's not even cat calling, just running up to women on the street.

714
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:47,680
"HELLO!"

715
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,180
"UGH!"

716
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,620
*laughter*

717
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,120
"HELLO BITCH!"

718
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:50,620
"AHHHHH!"

719
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:51,440
"YOU'RE A BITCH!"

720
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:51,940
"UGH!"

721
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:55,360
*laughter*

722
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,360
It would be terrible to listen to.

723
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,580
*laughter*

724
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:01,200
*snorting*

725
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,200
I'm not screaming at you, I'm screaming at myself.

726
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
I'm screaming with you.

727
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:04,700
Hmm.

728
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,200
Because you're screaming because I ran up to you holding a knife.

729
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,200
No, no, I'm screaming at you because I know you're an alien.

730
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,000
Yeah.

731
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,000
I can sense it.

732
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,720
I'm screaming at you because I love you.

733
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,720
I can smell it.

734
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,720
You're a different species.

735
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,720
[Laughter]

736
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,560
You're from Jupiter.

737
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,720
That's where you got more stupider.

738
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
This is how Jupiter people talk.

739
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,720
Yeah.

740
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,200
You went there and you got stupider.

741
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,200
Yeah.

742
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Boys are from Mars.

743
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,480
I went to college to get more knowledge.

744
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,520
Boys are from Mars, drive fast cars.

745
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,080
Girls are from stupider and you're...

746
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
[Laughter]

747
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,320
(laughing)

748
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:43,720
- The other day I was,

749
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,900
I thought it was really funny to pretend to be Lenny Bruce

750
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,700
and say, Lenny Bruce on stage saying,

751
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,700
"Yeah, and here's something they won't tell you.

752
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,120
"Milk, milk, lemonade, round the corner fudges me."

753
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:57,660
(laughing)

754
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:58,860
And he gets arrested.

755
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,840
(laughing)

756
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,480
You know, he was a free speech hero.

757
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,980
He really, he put his life on the line.

758
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,700
(laughing)

759
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,820
You know, he really, he just told it like it is.

760
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,220
He told it like it is.

761
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,060
(laughing)

762
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,660
He told it like it is.

763
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,340
Yeah, yeah, and here's something they're not talking about.

764
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,140
Up your butt and around the corner.

765
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,140
(laughing)

766
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,980
That's the way to California.

767
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,740
(laughing)

768
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,840
Hey, listen, and listen here and listen real closely.

769
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,260
Mama mia, papa pia, baby got a diarrhea.

770
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,020
(laughing)

771
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,340
Sir, get off the stage.

772
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:36,580
I'm speaking truth to power, thank you very much.

773
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,580
I'm munching up.

774
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:41,020
I'm munching up at Mamma Mia and Papa Pia.

775
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:44,740
Their diarrhea baby.

776
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:53,100
Dude, it would suck if you had a baby and it was a diarrhea baby.

777
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Am I right?

778
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,180
It would suck if you were Mamma Mia and Papa Pia.

779
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,780
It would suck if you were both Mamma Mia and Papa Pia and your baby had the diarrhea.

780
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:02,780
Yeah.

781
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:03,780
Yeah.

00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,540
dirty knees so what are these?

783
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:14,060
Why were so many of those like like middle school rhymes about being Chinese?

00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,660
offhandedly saying oh the Chinese have found a new way to put pee in coke.

789
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,460
Definitely a worse joke honestly. Yeah. Dude you should write for Mr. Show. Yeah

790
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,940

00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:56,620
Mrs. Show. Nowadays it would be called Mr. / Mrs. in parentheses they/them.

They/Them gender fluid show. They/Them, Starbucks, sponsored by Starbucks,

795
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:21,420
he'd be David the Quran. Am I right? It'd be David Sharia Law. Yeah, and Bob Al Odenkirk.

- I was laughing about this at work.

816
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:22,540
Just a guy who has to talk to his Spanish speaking coworkers,

817
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:26,180
so then he just starts saying English words in an accent.

818
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:30,780
That's just what my dad does anytime he goes to a Mexican restaurant.

819
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,880
My dad will be like, "Oh yeah, let's go to La Costa."

820
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,480
And then walk in and be like, "I'll have a burrito,

821
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:41,380
y... y... uno enchilada."

822
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,880
"Kids, what do you want?"

823
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,480
"Ah, two aguas."

824
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,280
[laughter]

825
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:51,580
And they're like, "Sir, sir, this is Taco Bell. Please stop."

826
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,480
"My name is... my name is Jeremy."

827
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,480
Yeah, there's no Mexicans in North Carolina.

828
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,580

Yeah, I forgot.

00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,380
I'm actually so stupid, I forget things

00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:11,580

850
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,300
He puts his wife's ass in every fucking movie. Yeah, thank God. I read this

851
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:27,140
angry comment where someone thought that it was his daughter. That would be so funny

852
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,980
if he's putting his daughter naked in every movie he makes. Didn't Kevin Smith do that?

853
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:36,940
Kevin Smith? I think so, maybe. Is it Kevin Smith's daughter named like Star Wars Jedi

854
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:43,420
or something? Kylo Ren, he changed her name when she was 15. This is my daughter

855
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:49,740
What's her actual name? It's something, something. It's Harley Quinn.

Yeah. Her name is Girl Jar Jar Binks. Jar Jar Binks with boobs. Yeah. Jar Jar boobs. And she's

857
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:04,900

was taking a picture of somebody who's taking a picture?

886
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,920
Christopher Nolan one time, he was visiting Rome and he took a photo

887
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:38,920
that he later realized was a photo of somebody taking a photo and he said well

888
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:43,560
it's like freaking Inception and then he wrote the movie. Why Rome?

889
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:47,520
Rome because he was in Rome. Oh yeah that makes a lot of sense. You fucking idiot.

890
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:52,960
Yeah and then he also said he said when in Rome yeah he said I should write this

891
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,560

892
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:03,160
photo and somebody jumped into the photo? That's Inception. And and they made a

893
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:09,100
crazy face yeah much anything is inception yeah if you what if a cat

894

00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:11,160
dreamboat you got one hunky you got a chunky pussy. A heartthrob pussy.

903
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,400
(laughter)

904
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:19,120
- Oh my god.

905
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:24,640
See, you do it too, some.

906
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:25,480
Some.

907
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:26,320
- Oh, fuck.

908
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:29,840
That's just 'cause the diet, the regular Coke.

909
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,680
- Just 'cause of the Coke, yeah.

910
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,280
- I think the sugar has blocked my pineal gland.

911
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,920
- Yeah, your penile gland.

912
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,500
- My penile glands have been blocked by sugar,

913
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,800
and I'm unable to have penile thoughts now.

914
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:47,740
We should do IQ tests for the Patreon. Absolutely. Do you remember when we used

915
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:52,800
to we were at work and we do IQ tests all day? I'd score one point more than you.

916
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:58,080
Like three different IQ tests, Cameron just scored one point higher.

917
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,660
I know I'm getting the lowest score already. Yeah, what would if you had to

918
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,900
- What's ballpark your IQ?

919
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,480
- Me? - Yeah.

920
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,240
- I'm probably a 96.

921
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,800
- 96?

922
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,140
- That's me being modest.

923
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,100
- Yeah. - Yeah.

924
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:17,100
- Mine's probably like, I don't know, like one 2,004.

925
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,340
- 1,004. - 1,004.

926
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,940
- And 1,3006.

927
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:22,780
- Yeah, it sounds like it's actually zero.

928
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,920
- I have two separate IQs for my two different minds.

929
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,500
I actually have a dual mind system

930
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:27,940
that makes me twice as smart.

931
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,320
- You get 100 IQ points just for writing your name

932
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,540
on the test.

933
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,500
- Yeah. (laughs)

934
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:36,460
- Yeah, did you know if your IQ score is 15,

935
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,660
you're allowed to leave?

936
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:39,500
- Yeah, my son's been super busy recently

937
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:41,420
studying for his IQ test.

938
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:42,260
- Yeah.

939
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:45,580
That's stupid, you can't do that.

940
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,620
- Yeah, that's why I said it, dude.

941
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:48,460
Fucking idiot.

942
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:49,300
- I'm already having a hard time.

943
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:50,120
- Did you know that if--

944
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,340
- Are you taking, can we see?

945
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,660
- No, don't do it now, we should do an episode.

946
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:55,340
- No, let's do it, we have time, let's do it.

947
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,660
- All right, yeah, fine.

948
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,520
- I'm not, I have nowhere to go.

949
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,360
- Boy.

950
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,140
- Which number logically follows the series?

951
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:03,540
Yeah, this one's hard.

952
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:04,540
No, this is easy.

953
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,380
Three, three, six, okay, let me remember.

954
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,740
Three, six, nine, damn you fine.

955
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,320
Okay, oh, ah, shit.

956
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,840
Figure series, which of the figures in the bottom row

957
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,980
should logically be in the spot

958
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,460
of the question mark in the top row?

959
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:23,020
I'm not gonna give you any hints.

960
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:24,620
Yeah, but I know the answer for sure.

961
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:25,460
But the answer--

962
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,280
It's this one.

963
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:27,780
The answer is yo mama.

964
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,860
Which conclusion follows from the statements

965
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:33,620
with absolute certainty?

966
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:37,360
One, none of the stamp collectors is an architect.

967
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,400
Two, all the drones are stamp collectors.

968
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:43,240
Architects are not drones.

969
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,500
That's true.

970
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:45,700
I guess that's true.

971
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:46,760
Yeah.

972
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,600
What does--

973
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,700
If you were to fold this cube together,

974
00:55:49,700 --> 00:55:51,300
it would probably look like--

975
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:53,700
Probably like a little something like this.

976
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,540
Hit it, boys.

977
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:56,180
(laughing)

978
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,000
I don't know the answer.

979
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,120
- I just know it'd look really cool

980
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,840
'cause cubes are one of the top 10 coolest shapes.

981
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,520
- Top one coolest shape for me.

982
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:03,360
- All right, all right.

983
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,200
- Cubes?

984
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,020
- I think cubes are the coolest.

985
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:06,640
- Tom has a new set of golf clubs.

986
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:07,480
- Not a shape.

987
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:08,660
- Using a club eight,

988
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,340
the ball travels an average distance of 100 meters.

989
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,740
Using a club seven,

990
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:17,460
the ball travels an average distance of 108 meters.

991
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:18,700
Using a club six,

992
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:22,840
the ball travels an average distance of 114 meters.

993
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,100
How far will the ball go if Tom uses a club five?

994
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:27,100
pretty damn far.

995
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,100
It's probably the most.

996
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:30,700
Yeah, so it's probably the, I'll just pick the highest number.

997
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:33,260
Because you're trying to get a high score on your IQ test.

998
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:34,260
Yeah, exactly.

999
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,260
Alright, what's the opposite of tough?

1000
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:36,260
I think it's masculine.

1001
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:45,260
Yeah, I think it's probably starch.

1002
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:47,740
Water is to pipe as...

1003
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:48,740
Blank is to a wire.

1004
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:51,300
...cold water is to wire.

1005
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,300
Patrick's so smart.

1006
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,300
He's answering me so quickly.

1007
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,380
That's because I've already taken the test.

1008
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:58,380
Oh, alright.

1009
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,380
You know all the answers.

1010
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,660
So what's the best meaning of displeasure?

1011
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:02,980
Oh, come on.

1012
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,460
Did it just freeze?

1013
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,980
Oh, we're back.

1014
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:06,980
Okay.

1015
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:07,980
Alright.

1016
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,980
That was fast.

1017
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,780
So I just finished the test.

1018
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,780
Yeah.

1019
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:13,580
No, you're in college.

1020
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,580
Put college.

1021
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,580
Too late.

1022
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,580
You're a 22-year-old high school student.

1023
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:20,940
You got 4 out of 10.

1024
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:22,140
Under or up to 100?

1025
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,380
This is pretty good.

1026
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:26,860
That's a lame, that's a bad ballpark, that's stupid.

1027
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:30,340
I think, uh, you guys froze again.

1028
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,340
No, we didn't.

1029
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:32,340
You guys are frozen again.

1030
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:37,420
Well, this is probably a good place to end this episode when he gets back.

1031
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:41,100
A perfect natural stopping point.

1032
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,540
Let's just hang up and call him back.

1033
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,540
No, don't do that.

1034
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:44,540
Why?

1035
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,540
Because it's about to reconnect.

1036
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:54,220
I'm going to edit this out anyway, so.

1037
00:57:54,220 --> 00:58:10,660
to

1038
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:11,500
I think you're embarrassed.

1039
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,980
I'm upset that my internet keeps shutting off.

1040
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:13,820
I think you're embarrassed by the number.

1041
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,200
I think you're embarrassed that you're 30 IQ.

1042
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:17,300
I think it said that you have a baby's IQ.

1043
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,860
I don't even care about the IQ test.

1044
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,620
I think you're more upset that the fans

1045
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:24,180
are gonna be upset about this.

1046
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:25,860
About the internet?

1047
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:26,700
Yeah.

1048
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,940
How will he connect?

1049
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,780
That's my impression of the fans.

1050
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,780
How is he gonna connect and get online now?

1051
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,180
What if he has an ailment pop up?

1052
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,500
Oh, and he just hung up on us.

1053
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,480

- For great service.

1072

And then they tell you that they're shutting off your bill

1073
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:28,640
because they forgot to set up an auto pay thing.

- Xfinity's gonna flip their shit when they hear this.

1077
