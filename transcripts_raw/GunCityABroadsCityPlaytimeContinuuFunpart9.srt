1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
Okay. All right, you ready? Make your announcement really quick. Okay, today's

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,480
episode, first things first, today is the no swearing episode. There will be in-game

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,520
penalties for us if we swear. Every time you swear. You can swear if you have to,

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,080
but you do lose, we'll say, 10 points of damage. If Patches swears, then we get a benefit.

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,240
If Patches swears, all of our HP gets raised by a point. That's a good idea.

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,600
answer one question of ours that is not like yeah like a major plot point yeah

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,320
we'll we'll we'll work it out yes I think that's fair and then if you guys swear

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,280
something bad happen we lose one HP every time you swear that's not enough no

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,800
that's it needs to be fine okay we have if we swear all right okay this is by

10
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,620
the way we're doing this the rest of the time and that we do D&D forever this is

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:55,680
like our twist on D&D is there's no cussing no and if you're mad about it

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
It's called Patrick's Law.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
So yeah.

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
Who would be mad about that?

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
Some people like

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,680
c-c-crussing.

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
Some people like crussing.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Alright, do this.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
Last time on Gun City, a broad city.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Playtime continue fun.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,680
Whoopsies, looks like

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,680
the fellas got in the trouble.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
After accepting the task of

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,680
clearing the Greeches out from the Greech Queen's lair

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
from Bear McGinnis'

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,360
kind gang. Our heroes barreled ahead into danger. Not without Patrick Yoda first

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,360
making a surprising discovery about Janet Blowjob's double life as Bam

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,200
McGinnis' girlfriend. Blowjob is a swear. Is that a swear? I'm gonna take this to

29
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Julio. Julio, we need a ruling. Is it a swear or what? It's not a swear. Okay.

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
Alright, yeah it is a last name.

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,100
Okay.

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,100
*laughter*

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,100
Can we say swears at their names?

34
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,100
You can say swears at their names.

35
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,600
We're gonna figure that out.

36
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,100
But no time for that.

37
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,100
Into the Greech's lair they went.

38
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Immediately being way too loud and attacking a guy made out of Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

39
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,600
Blotoss handily defeated them.

40
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,100
But soon after, Greech's and Monster's started coming down the way.

41
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:17,100
Blotas went invisible and Ray and Patrick jumped to escape into a horrible pit of toys and flesh

42
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,100
where a big katamari ball slammed into them, nearly killing them I think three times.

43
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
And Sullivan.

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:29,100
Luckily, Patrick Yoda's new best robot friend, Scuta, made a quick dial to Blotas,

45
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,100
who was just about to enter the Greech prison,

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,100
where they could discover more about the mysterious Greeches

47
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,260
in the connection to their missing son, New Sullivan,

48
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,060
in playtime with the serial killer.

49
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,940
Flotas dropped what he was doing

50
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,180
and heroically, invisibly sprinted through the greech lair

51
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,060
back to the pit and saved his friends

52
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,540
using Patrick Yoda's amazing foreskin.

53
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,580
Once the end--

54
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:53,460
- It's anatomical.

55
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,300
- That's anatomical, yeah.

56
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,700
- It's on your eyebrows.

57
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,260
- But he did say it was amazing.

58
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,100
- Foreskin.

59
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:58,920
(laughing)

60
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,760
- Which a doctor would never say.

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,860
- It is literally amazing.

62
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,460
- A doctor would never say, "Amazing foreskin."

63
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,940
- Well, if you had phimosis and you got surgery

64
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,980
and then it healed up.

65
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,740
I think a doctor would say it after.

66
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:11,900
- That is the exact scenario we're in right now.

67
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,860
- Yeah.

68
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,820
Once the DM decided to not let them starve to death

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,660
in the pit of toys,

70
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:18,740
they rolled the Konamari around and around

71
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,780
and climbed it up out of the pit.

72
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:24,260
With more lair to go, will they even survive?

73
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,420
Will I throw them another bone like that?

74
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,700
I think that's one bone too many.

75
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,180
Next time, they might not be so lucky.

76
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,580
So, yeah.

77
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,980
You guys, you're probably in pretty dire straits.

78
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,340
I don't even remember where your health is at.

79
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,180
I think it's pretty low.

80
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,460
- Mine is six.

81
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,300
- Yeah.

82
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,120
- What's my health?

83
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,180
I think I'm at six too.

84
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,300
- And you had--

85
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,020
- Yeah, it says six on your list.

86
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,580
- You should subtract the techno slime

87
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,940
that Blowtoss used for you.

88
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,060
- Okay. - I'm at 31.

89
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,660
- So look at the cost of the foreskin

90
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,720
and make sure you're subtracting that from what you have.

91
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,980
- We'd have to do a checkup on that

92
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,760
'cause I did not subtract it last time.

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,840
- Yeah, so I think you did that like,

94
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,320
let's say you did like three, I think you did like,

95
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,800
let's say like two times at least.

96
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,280
- Okay, let's see, so that is three technoslimes.

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
- 'Cause you did other stuff too.

98
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,240
- Minus two, three minus two is five.

99
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,080
- You got this. - Negative five.

100
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,800
- Three minus two is five?

101
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,520
- No, negative five.

102
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,600
- Hold on, that's not what's happening I think.

103
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,280
- Three minus two is negative five.

104
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,540
(laughing)

105
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,320
- Okay.

106
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,840
- Hold on, let's think about this.

107
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,600
- It's negative one.

108
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
- No, because you had--

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
- No. - It's negative one.

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,760
- Oh, wait, let's try that all.

111
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,040
- If it was two minus three.

112
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,160
- Yeah. - Well, it was two minus three,

113
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,040
yes, but so it costs three to do that.

114
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,880
So it's two times three. - So it's negative three.

115
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,720
- So it's six, you're subtracting--

116
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,960
- It was negative three minus two, which is five.

117
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,080
- How much total TechnoSlime points did you have?

118
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,080
- 15. - Before this.

119
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,320
So we're taking, and it costs three to do the healing?

120
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,480
- Yeah, so three, so I did it two times.

121
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,020
- So you're doing it twice, so it's minusing six from it.

122
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:01,860
- Yeah.

123
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,180
- So you're at nine.

124
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,280
- I said that already.

125
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,240
- It's one of those, like,

126
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't think you're that bad at math.

127
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,760
- I think, honestly, I could not.

128
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,600
- I think there's just like--

129
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,160
- Three minus two is negative five,

130
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,760
and I'd be like, no, it's negative one.

131
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,360
- It's like you go on your gut.

132
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,920
It's like you go like a gut instinct.

133
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,480
- Yeah, it's like whatever sounds right.

134
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,160
- Yeah, I will say, Pat, it is at the point

135
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,880
where I really don't know if you were kidding there or not.

136
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,040
I really have no idea.

137
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,480
- And you're not gonna know if I was.

138
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,160
- I know, I know, but it really elicited

139
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,360
almost no reaction out of me.

140
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,200
I really was like, okay.

141
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,920
- Well, so yeah, it kind of blew my mind

142
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,120
'cause I heard him say three minus two,

143
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,080
which usually he says something out loud

144
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,320
when he's working through the problem,

145
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,440
so I was like, oh, he's working through three minus two,

146
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,080
and that's what got me initially.

147
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,400
(laughing)

148
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,240
Negative five.

149
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:55,460
- Just imagining like a techno-slime meter on the screen

150
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,720
(laughing)

151
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,020
- Just going up and down.

152
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,980
- Just like not unsure.

153
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,980
Okay, so where you guys are is you crawled out of that pit,

154
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,280
which was kind of like a side,

155
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,860
like you entered the Greach's Lair,

156
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,640
you walked through a bit, there were kind of two paths.

157
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,220
One was towards that pit,

158
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,440
one was down further into the lair,

159
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,220
which you already kind of sprinted down,

160
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,120
so you have the lay of the land of that.

161
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:19,960
- Damn.

162
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,780
- Booyah.

163
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,580
- So I can tell you what, some of what you saw.

164
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,620
- You know that there is a sort of like stretch,

165
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,700
Armstrong kind of monster, like fuck monster,

166
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,540
that's kind of like--

167
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:32,360
- Whoa!

168
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,220
- I didn't even think about it.

169
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,680
- Yeah, you didn't think about it.

170
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,520
- That's right.

171
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,340
- Dummy.

172
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,140
- So how do we kill him in one hit?

173
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,980
- Wow.

174
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,820
- Yeah.

175
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,620
- I'm actually, I'm like, that's not good.

176
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,920
- Yeah, have another drink.

177
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,620
We get that, yeah, wait, what is our question

178
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,460
we're gonna ask him?

179
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,620
- How do you kill it in one hit?

180
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,020
How do you kill all the monsters in here in one hit?

181
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,540
- There's not, it has to be something that we think

182
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,620
'cause he's just gonna say,

183
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,980
his answer's just gonna be, there is no way.

184
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,220
Like we need some kind of actual information

185
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,060
that we know exists.

186
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,620
- He's like a genie. - We need a known unknown

187
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,220
that we can actually-- - He's like a genie.

188
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:06,980
We have to think of like how to--

189
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,020
- What was the darkest room in the group?

190
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,420
- Why did we come in here?

191
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,380
(laughing)

192
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,220
- Oh yeah, we didn't do a recap.

193
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,540
We didn't do a recap. - Yeah, he did do a recap.

194
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,660
- I did kind of have the last session.

195
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,980
I mean, I could give you a little bit more time.

196
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,100
- No, no, no, no. - No, no, that's not

197
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:21,940
the question we want. - We know exactly where we are.

198
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,980
- We know why we're here. - The problem is

199
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,640
- There's one obvious question that we have to ask,

200
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,480
but it's the solution.

201
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,300
- What is it?

202
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,140
- I mean, who is the killer?

203
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:30,980
- No, but I--

204
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,800
- I know we said no major plot points.

205
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,700
- I know, but that's the only thing I care to know.

206
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,540
- Okay, so I would say--

207
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,940
- What's the first letter of their name?

208
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,980
- I would say, is there anything, wait,

209
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,380
so we should ask about the Stretch Armstrong thing.

210
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,020
Is there any fatal flaw or huge weakness

211
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:47,860
that these monsters have?

212
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,980
- No one was paying attention, I said an F.

213
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,820
So I have one health point.

214
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,620
Okay, subtract it. That's very honorable of you.

215
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,420
Yeah, thank you. I didn't even process it.

216
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,220
That's how that's kind of how inundated we get with swear cussing in our day.

217
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,120
Like this is what we need. We don't even notice it.

218
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,920
We should just go. We should do one year of no cussing.

219
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,320
No cuss. We should do one full year of no cussing.

220
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:15,420
We have to. What is today? Can we put a swear jar on the table for the rest of the year?

221
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,320
$100 a year. My mom has one in our house.

222
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,820
We literally need to put a swear jar on the table. It's getting out of control.

223
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,960
no matter what is in our wallet we have getting really out of no coins you got

224
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,940
to put a 20 and I almost wanted to say the f-word right then it's getting out

225
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,680
of control she turned it into like it's $20 every time and that is that has

226
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,100
helped me a lot when I'm at home yeah all right well then we'll figure out

227
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,040
that we will be doing that and we are doing a fully no swear podcast for the

228
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,320
first I think so um so you asked me is there what is like a main weakness with

229
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:53,160
these monsters yeah they are they are insatiable there are ways in which you

230
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,140
can distract that we asked the killers first name we could we could throw down

231
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:01,760
some stuff from our in there like areas food yeah they're pretty I have a

232
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,000
relationship in that and this is a stealth level like it's not just a

233
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,700
sexual appetite I had the perfect distraction and everyone these are

234
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,840
creatures Wowed what is it missing something you know I have in my

235
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:18,800
inventories to every Xbox game ever. That's not food. Do you think that they

236
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,480
could be fooled easily by a worm? There are some Xbox games. Your weapon is a sandwich.

237
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,640
Yeah but I have every Xbox game. Leisure Suit Larry is an Xbox game like that

238
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,560
would maybe get them. I could throw the disc. They could be fooled by a worm. A worm could

239
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,240
certainly fool them. Skinny donuts. Simpson's Hit and Run.

240
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,760
Simpsons donuts. Simpsons Hit and Run disc is a donut. Oh the disc looks like a donut. Okay let's just

241
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,880
empty out our pockets like like just random lint and crap. Okay, in care, in care. Crap is good.

242
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:55,400
Wait, hold on. That's a good, that's good. Take that off. Does that count? No, no, crap is, that was me saying it because I wanted to say the S word.

243
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:04,840
Crap is, you're saying, we're saying C is okay. That C. What, wait, no. No, well, which. That C, the C we're

244
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,080
talking about right now. Crap is okay. Crap is okay. That's okay, right? If it's a proper noun.

245
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Well that's not a crop, that's a semi crop.

246
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,840
Either way, bring it back to D&D. I want in character, I want you guys to be

247
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:24,680
emptying out your pockets in a circle talking through this. Okay I just want to

248
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:31,760
say one thing, the planet that Patrick Yoda is from, Dagobah. No? Oh it had a

249
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,560
different name. It has a different name. And also, no I'm Italian.

250
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:43,660
can it be said no because you have to bleep yourself out okay we're gonna know

251
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:49,540
Yeah, I say that again we can definitely say

252
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,100
Okay, I'm a bunch of peep and I'm gonna be all over it. We need to we need to we need to put a

253
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,540
trail of

254
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,820
goes

255
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:21,020
Off into a different direction to distract him. So

256
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,020
because they want to beep it!

257
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,020
and I can't get out of the beep voice!

258
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,020
(laughter)

259
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,020
(laughter)

260
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:31,020
He's stuck in the beep voice!

261
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,020
(laughter)

262
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,020
I'm stuck in my beep voice!

263
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,020
You have to stop beeping!

264
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,020
Get me out of the beep voice!

265
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,020
I need you to beep me, get the beeping voice!

266
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,020
(laughter)

267
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,020
Okay.

268
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,020
Get me out of the beeping voice!

269
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,020
(laughter)

270
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:54,020
- Yeah, like paper clips and some of his video games.

271
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,700
And I'm not gonna sacrifice my whole worm to this

272
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,100
because the worm was really, has come in handy so much.

273
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,340
- If you cut off a worm's tail, it'll grow back.

274
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,460
- That's an amazing idea.

275
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,100
No, I won't do that to my worm.

276
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:06,940
- I'll do it.

277
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,980
- No, I do, no.

278
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,100
That's off the table.

279
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,820
But maybe I put, maybe I squeeze him like toothpaste

280
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,940
and get a little poop out of him or something.

281
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,020
I put that on the ground.

282
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,260
- I got a bunch of lint.

283
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,080
- Okay.

284
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,080
I have feces in my pocket.

285
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,080
That is a sensory overload of a pile. I do like that.

286
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,080
So how are you gonna present it to me?

287
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
I'm gonna have a pizza.

288
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,080
Am I a ventriloquist?

289
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,080
Am I a ventriloquist?

290
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Like in the game, do I have ventriloquist abilities?

291
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,080
Can I throw my voice?

292
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,080
In a way.

293
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
Am I invisible still?

294
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
I could just walk over and be your voice.

295
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
Definitely make sure you check your technical sign points.

296
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:50,640
because you've got invisible a couple times now if you can go over you also

297
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,120
have refills you can use you go over and pretend to be the pile of beep and say

298
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,520
just like random random oh that's a pretty good idea actually yeah then what

299
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:11,080
do I do I think I still I can be in the pile I can be part of the pile I still

300
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:18,080
have enough to go invisible. You don't have to do anything. You get to be a ventriloquist, he gets to be the whole evil eye.

301
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,080
It's not we don't get to do anything, we're just trying to get out of here.

302
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:27,080
And he's not even doing anything, I'm just doing it. I stole it from him. Can I have a soda then?

303
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:33,080
A soda? Can I just have a soda to drink? Is this in real life or? No, just in the thing.

304
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Does anyone have a soda in their inventory they can give me?

305
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,440
Sullivan does but he's tied up on Ray William Johnson's body. Okay. Oh, yeah

306
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:48,460
I use pockets. Mm-hmm. So what? Yeah, you have these pockets. Nobody keeps you can't keep soda. Okay, I'm invisible. I'm in

307
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:55,620
In your inventory, no, he has he has like a he Sullivan doesn't wear pants

308
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,680
And he has so he has like the cartoon like pocket like kind of shows up as you reach

309
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,360
Or he has exactly a soda in there. Okay, so I guess the whole thing

310
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,540
I guess we're making everything up Mountain Dew typhoon. Yeah, it's Mountain Dew typhoon because he knows it's Patrick

311
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,260
You're his favorite. That's BS, but I do appreciate your

312
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:17,880
You are you getting all

313
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,320
Managing, you know

314
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,000
Are you doing that for drink your be? I?

315
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,960
Don't I almost am feeling like it's worse

316
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,720
Yeah, cuz you're making me say the word

317
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,080
also I'm gonna say that like I think there's got to be a limit on that too

318
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,260
what the number of like cuz then you might as well just be cursing yeah yeah

319
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,120
I think no letters I think it's more creative positivity and if we're

320
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,980
replacing swears with shorter swears what that is going on okay yeah so here's the

321
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:54,260
thing about here's the thing about cussing cussing is instead of maybe

322
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,920
instead of saying what the you know you know I would I would replace that with

323
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,200
something like I can't believe it yeah I can't believe this I'm impressed yeah

324
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:08,280
we need to say what we mean and so saying so we're saying right now it is

325
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:12,280
not language has degenerated nowadays we have a word like the four-letter word

326
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,080
that I won't say that begins with LGBT it begins with the same letter that the

327
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,680
word fun begins with but it's a lot less fun than fun yeah is that means

328
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,520
everything nowadays why don't you roll for a check on that

329
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,200
that was incredible that made that basically people say let's go eat some

330
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:37,400
f-word let's go do some f-word people do talk like that these days they use it

331
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,320
like it means anything that's a four all right but I thought it was good so

332
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:50,720
four plus 20 okay so let's get the - - one a persuasion it's a 23 guys let's

333
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,080
get out of here okay all right so you guys have the pile out it's on the the

334
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,760
thing like it's like it's by the it's like sort of near where the the stretch

335
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,000
armstrong thing started lurking around I definitely got a wit not a whiff I guess

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,320

- Boom shakalaka, eat me.

366
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,680
You guys can roll stealth with advantage to get by it.

367
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,260
- That's not sexual.

368
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,080
- Right now.

369
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,100
- So his head, his mouth is fully in the pile of stuff.

370
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,560
- Yeah, he's like eating it.

371
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,020
- Dung is okay.

372
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,220
- Dung is okay.

373
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,060
- He's eating.

374
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,580
(laughing)

375
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,020
- Spore.

376
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,180
- Dung is fine.

377
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,780
- Wait, he just said dung is fine.

378
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,620
- Dung is definitely fine.

379
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,440
- You like dung?

380
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,300
- This guy likes dung.

381
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,860
- Okay, so we just need to get around this guy?

382
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,700
- I love dung.

383
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,340
I'm just gonna sneak then I don't have any kind of thing, but I have a still I mean

384
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,140
I have any other things you want I guess I could try you have an advantage on a stealth role now

385
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
You can also do others, and I'm invisible

386
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,900
Okay, and an eight so so 19 do I roll yeah?

387
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,580
Yeah, if you're trying to sneak by am I invisible have to roll

388
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,420
Did you spend on that yeah? Yeah? Yeah? You're invisible. Yeah, then you don't you you don't have to roll, okay?

389
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,300
You'll just be fine. I mean roll. Let's see if you don't get a one. I got a 13 and a 16, okay

390
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:35,700
I got a one. Alright, roll again because you have an advantage. Oh my god, you better not get snake guys.

391
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,700
I got a one. Oh my god!

392
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:42,900
There's no way you just rolled two ones back to back.

393
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:55,360
What did you say? He said if he gets a one, but he had advantage so he had two chances to get anything but a one.

394
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,840
I thought he said D though.

395
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,640
- Yeah, it's a one out of 400.

396
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,680
- Wait, wait, wait, did you say D?

397
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,960
- Well, no, I said man.

398
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,800
- Okay. - Okay.

399
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,320
- D's, can't say it, but--

400
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,320
- D's friends. - I'll put the idea

401
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,360
in your head. - I'll say you're even

402
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,000
invoking. - Wow, that is--

403
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
- I think invoking's fine.

404
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,120
- D's coconuts. - That is crazy.

405
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,600
- Okay, so you two sneak by very easily.

406
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,160
- Yeah, and he's invisible.

407
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,280
- You're invisible. - Yeah.

408
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,560
- What do you, do you just like make the pile?

409
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,360
- I'm just still doing the pile voice.

410
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,200
(laughing)

411
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,040
- He like sees, oh, I'm a pile.

412
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,880
- He sees your teeth like a Cheshire Cat

413
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,960
saying, "Oh, I'm a pile," right next to it.

414
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,280
- This thing whips around. - I'm a sneaky pile.

415
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,280
- And you are gonna roll initiative against this thing.

416
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,040
- Oh, Lordy Lou! - You two don't have to.

417
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,480
- Well, but we might have to help him.

418
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,200
- Can he just flee? - I can't help him.

419
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,160
I have one. - I wish I had a stretch

420
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,320
Armstrong thing, that's what I wanted to get.

421
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,440
That's we forgot we have this crab

422
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,680
That will work

423
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:19,640
What did you get on the 20 but not a natural 20 that's still wonderful though for real

424
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,980
All right, you're gonna go first for sure. This thing is gonna try to fight you for real though. All right

425
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:35,580
I'm gonna kill it. Okay. Kill? No burping. Kill is fine. Yeah you can kill. No burping into the mic.

426
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,340
You can't, yeah that's bad manners. I'm sorry I didn't know we're doing a manners thing.

427
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,620
Can I give you guys some more buff debuff abilities? All right well I'll just fight first.

428
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:49,820
First off, I'm still invisible too so I should get to automatically hit it. And then me and

446
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,520
- That's great, and then you get another attack.

447
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,700
- And then my other attack.

448
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,500

455
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,400
- Probably. - 16.

456
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,380
- You just, this thing whips around and sees you.

457
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,780
You're going like, "I'm a pile, I'm a pile!"

458
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,020
And then you just go crazy on it.

459
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,860
(laughing)

460
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,700
You just start whipping it.

461
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,860
Like just like insanely hard with your pipes.

462
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,540
It is looking really bad.

463
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,460
- Yeah.

464
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,020
- Yeah, yeah, it's got real low health.

465
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,220
- Wow. - How do you like that,

466
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,060

00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,340
it's like stretch arm.

477
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,420
You see there's also little arms kind of come out of it

478
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,180
with like, with a little thumbtack,

479
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:48,100
so try to like, stab at you, but it misses.

480
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,820
It's gonna swing around one more time.

481
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,780
So roll another dexterity saving throw.

482
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,420

483
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,700

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,440
- Oh my, Lanta.

490
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,540
- No it doesn't.

491
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,940
- That would be my version of that show.

492
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,780
- What?

493
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,260
- My Lanta.

494
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,820
What show?

495
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,620
There's a show called Oh My Lanta.

496
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,100
You take 17 damage.

497
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,980
17?

498
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,820
Yeah.

499
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,700
There's a movie called The Ringer where that's from.

500
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,260
But you're back up again.

501
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,460
You guys, I mean, look, here's the thing.

502
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,500
I'm doing the worm.

503
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,740
If you, okay, 'cause I could have you guys rolling.

504
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,580
I don't wanna die.

505
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,400
I'm being completely--

506
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,980
You're not participating in the combat at all?

507
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:32,540
I'm just on the sides.

508
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,700
Yeah, I've already shuffled by.

509
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,540
You guys could get a surprise attack.

510
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,180
We're trying to do a two-man pyramid.

511
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,020
Okay.

512
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,180
Dude, for cheerleading.

513
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,900
- Low toss, you're up.

514
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,740
- All right.

515
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,560
- In that case.

516
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,800
- I'm gonna attack.

517
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:48,500
And that is a 11.

518
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,340
- No good.

519
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,780
- I'm gonna attack again.

520
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,220
And that is a 24.

521
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,140
- That's what happens.

522
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,240
- And that is a 12 damage.

523
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,060
- Also, describe your kill on this little crab here.

524
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,660
- Okay, I will first--

525
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,980
- He's stretchy, remember this.

526
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,820
- Oh, he's stretchy.

527
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,500
He's not a, I was about to describe a kill on a crab.

528
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,340
- Oh no, no, no.

529
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,180
- Sorry, yeah.

530
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,020
- Stretch up.

531
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,840
- I messed up.

532
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,680
- Mr. Stretch.

533
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,940
- I wear him like clothes.

534
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,140
- Oh my goodness.

535
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,900
- I'm wearing him for the rest of my life.

536
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,940
Fashion, I strut my stuff, I'm like this.

537
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,060
- Whoa.

538
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,300
- Oh my god, you have your hand on your hip too?

539
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,900
- Dang.

540
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,620
- Watch me, now watch me strut.

541
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,220
Now watch my fashion.

542
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,820
Now watch me strut.

543
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,300
Now watch my fashion.

544
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,900
And yeah.

545
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,740
- Let me get the fish.

546
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
- Basically that tears into a trillion pieces.

547
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,740
- Dang. - Letters away in the wind.

548
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,740
- Dang. - Yeah.

549
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,740
- I love how many-- - Disposable bag.

550
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,740
- How often when you describe a kill, I just instinctively say the D word.

551
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,740
- Oh, did you say it? - I just said "dang" twice,

552
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,740
- because I said "dang." - Nice.

553
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:52,740
- Because I say it slow enough that I can catch the last two letters.

554
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,740
- All right, cool. So you took care of that.

555
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
You took some damage, but you're all right.

556
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,740
- Taking care of business.

557
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,740
- All right, guys. So you guys can keep going.

558
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,740
You guys bend up back in that sort of--

559
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,740
- Try this. - Wow.

560
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,740
- Wow. Okay, yeah, that's better.

561
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,580
- The main area.

562
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,420
(laughing)

563
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,240
- It's a little scary.

564
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,900
- With the bed that you saw, that disgusting giant bed

565
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,660
where creatures were writhing, waiting for monsters,

566
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,380
greeches waiting for monsters to scoop them up

567
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:20,880
and embrace them, and the door to the prison.

568
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:21,980
So there's a door to the prison,

569
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:25,020
then there's another door that leads somewhere else.

570
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,820
But you were about to go into the prison

571
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,960
'cause you were trying to see if there was

572
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,420
new solvent in there or something.

573
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,700
- Oh, we were trying to break out those

574
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:43,180
fucking leprechaun. Oh, you're dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. He's dead. How did that happen?

575
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:53,260
All right. That was so bald-faced. Roll d20. Wow. You guys can try to stabilize him. That's a

576
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,700
failure. He's gotta do this by himself. All right, keep going. Five. I'm as bad as a customer. Are you

577
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
You're gonna die?

578
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
Nat 20.

579
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,700
Wow, okay.

580
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
So it's two and two.

581
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Two wins, two fails.

582
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:07,020
Oh wait, then we should stabilize him if he's on the edge of a bank.

583
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
He was on the edge already.

584
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
Hold on, wait.

585
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,820
Pat, before you do it, do you guys want to stabilize him?

586
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,260
You should probably stabilize me because I am not, I'm not getting, there's no luck.

587
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
This could be it.

588
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
This could be it.

589
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
I mean, we could try.

590
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
Yeah, I'll try to stabilize him.

591
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,260
What do I do?

592
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,260
Just roll the 20 as your medicine.

593
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,260
He did it.

594
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,260
Medicine, 11.

595
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,260
Okay, cool.

596
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
He did it.

597
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,260
You're stabilized.

598
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,260
I rolled a 20 as soon as I did that.

599
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,100
- Okay.

600
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,220
- So, he would have to use his four skin again,

601
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,760
so subtract three from you to get some health points back

602
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,800
if you wanna be conscious again.

603
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,520
Yeah, so God, I guess, just struck you down for swearing.

604
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,360
- Yeah.

605
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
- You just had like a little mini heart attack.

606
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,760
You had like a stroke.

607
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,320
- Your second one, by the way.

608
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,480
Me and Blowtooth haven't had a darn one.

609
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,960
- I just love that F word.

610
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,680
- Yeah, you need to go to therapy.

611
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,520
- Yeah.

612
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,360
- Go to rehab.

613
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,560
- You need to go to rehab, that's wrong.

614
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,400
- Yeah.

615
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,720
- Yeah. - What you did was wrong.

616
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,680
- Did you? - I'm really excited

617
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,520
to know what comes next. - So how many, wait,

618
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,280
how do I, how do I get the points,

619
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,120
my health points back?

620
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,360
- So, oh yeah, it's using your force gun

621
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
when you're knocked out, I think we did it,

622
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
oh God, I don't remember.

623
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,960
- Do I get six points?

624
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,360
- Lord's at the end of vain.

625
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,960
- No, that's Christian, that's different.

626
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,520
- Wait, wait, Andrew said D. - That's Christian.

627
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,040
- What? - Is it God, don't?

628
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,840
- You said God, D. - I don't remember.

629
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,680
- No, you said, you said, you said God.

630
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,520
But you said it like, God, you didn't mean like,

631
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,280
- Yeah, you were kind of cursing.

632
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,880
- Not that he said G-Date.

633
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,640
- Is it okay if you say, so we're not supposed to curse,

634
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,400
right, if I were to say like, curse you Elon Musk,

635
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,520
like I'm cursing.

636
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
- Well, politically I wouldn't do that.

637
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,360
- Let's not get into the semantics of this.

638
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,200
Or we'll stay out of the semantics.

639
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,200
- Let's get into some antics though.

640
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,200
- Let's get into some crazy A antics.

641
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,080
- Yeah, maybe you laugh.

642
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,520
- Crazy butt antics.

643
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,000
- You almost did it again.

644
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
- You almost did dead butt.

645
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,560
- So I think what we did, and I don't remember

646
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,400
'cause I should've listened to the last episode,

647
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,240
I think what we did is that when you use a Foreskin,

648
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,020
when someone uses a Foreskin on you

649
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,920
while you're knocked out, you heal for half.

650
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,280
I think that's what we did.

651
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,120
- Okay.

652
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,460
- And it's also gonna subtract the--

653
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,480
- So I roll to see how much I healed.

654
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,000
- Well, so first look at your, on the sheet,

655
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,680
how much heal you, it's not there.

656
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,520
- You said sheet.

657
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,360
(laughing)

658
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,760
- It's not that sheet.

659
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,600
It's the next one over.

660
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,120
- Yeah, three Technoslime.

661
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,920
Okay, so I heal all allies in range for one D10 plus four.

662
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,820
- So that's gonna be roll one D10,

663
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,840
add four of them, divide that by two.

664
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:37,340
That's her.

665
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,280
- I have 70 health points.

666
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:45,400
- No, okay, you're rolling a D100, so plus four is 11.

667
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,360
So it's 5.5, we'll round down to five, so you get five HP.

668
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,200
- All right.

669
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,080
- It's like he never swore at all.

670
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,920
- Wow.

671
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,480
- He got five back.

672
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,920
- But you also lose those three Technoslime points

673
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,760
for using that.

674
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,600
- Yeah, I said that.

675
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,280
- Oh, did you subtract it?

676
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,100
- I subtracted it.

677
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,320
- Okay, sorry, I'm sorry.

678
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,500
So yeah, you guys are about to go to the prison.

679
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,340
- Yeah, let's go to the prison.

680
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,080
- After a heart attack and you have to

681
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,720
put his foreskin over his face.

682
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,560
- Yeah, he is, I will say he is one cuss away

683
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,280
from just being back to dying.

684
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,760
- Yeah, back to that, so just be careful.

685
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,600
- All right.

686
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,200
- I at least have a buffer, six health.

687
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,560
- So you guys go down into the prison.

688
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
It's similar to everything else.

689
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:28,840
that has that yellowish glow that you saw

690
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,560
in Huge Fax's lair, I guess.

691
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,400
Can we say?

692
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,940
- No, I guess it's a name. - It's a name, right?

693
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,780
It's a name, right?

694
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,420
- Huge A Fax. - Use the letter.

695
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:38,560
Use the letter. - Use the letter?

696
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,980
Okay, Huge A Fax lair.

697
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,900
So that same yellow stuff.

698
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,740
The same yellow stuff you saw above his lair,

699
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,120
and the same yellow stuff you've been seeing in here,

700
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,380
and now you see a bit more of it too inside this prison.

701
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,140
You see some of the leprechauns in there,

702
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,780
and they're going, "Oh, oh, over here, here, let me out.

703
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,860
Please, let me out."

704
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,620
- They have to swear. - Racial stereotype.

705
00:29:58,620 --> 00:29:59,460
- Wait, what happens if we make--

706
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,660
- Oh, we're gonna do that?

707
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,660
- Can we force NPCs to swear to kill them?

708
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,480
- Yeah.

709
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,320
- Oh.

710
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,860
- Well, you're out if you swear.

711
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,460
- No, but that's just gonna affect me.

712
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,860
- That's what my great uncle did.

713
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:10,940
- Wait, do you think this--

714
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:11,780
- Okay, so wait, yeah, here.

715
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,060
- You say this applies to anyone.

716
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,500
- How much do you want the leprechauns

717
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,700
that you think that these--

718
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,540
- That's a very funny idea. - These people

719
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,020
should be kept in prison?

720
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,260
'Cause we'll let them out if you swear as them.

721
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,260
That's what my uncle did when we were at a Christmas party when I was six.

722
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,840
He said I had to say a swear for a piece of candy.

723
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
What?

724
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,820
He had lined all the kids up and made a swear for candy.

725
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:33,420
I want a cut at you right now.

726
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,580
I'm just saying we could do that.

727
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,580
You don't line up on candy.

728
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,820
You just spit all over me.

729
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,820
We could make a game.

730
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,580
It's like the Dark Knight Joker boats.

731
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,580
Okay.

732
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,580
PG-13 reference.

733
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,580
Huh?

734
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,580
You reference a PG-13 movie.

735
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,580
- It's after 9 o'clock.

736
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,580
- You're right, that's a very good point.

737
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,580
- Finding a stranger in the house.

738
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,580
- So basically, we'll let out the leprechauns if they swear.

739
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:01,580
So you have to show that you care about your characters.

740
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,580
If you don't want them brought in jail as leprechauns.

741
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
- Yeah, this is going to work.

742
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,580
- A very clear caricature of a racial group.

743
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,580
- One that all three of us are affected by.

744
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,580
- So if you think that they should stay in prison,

745
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,580
then go ahead and don't swear.

746
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,800
in prison then go ahead and don't swear.

747
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,400
But if you think that this real life group of people

748
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,760
deserve to not be in prison for the rest of their lives.

749
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,600
- Do you want to say that?

750
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,380
- Do you think leprechauns should stay in prison?

751
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,220
(laughing)

752
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:30,280
- You're saying that in front of three Irish laddies

753
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,880
right now, so don't forget that.

754
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,960
- I don't really follow.

755
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,440
- Okay, we give up on it then.

756
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,000
(laughing)

757
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,840
- I just don't know where my incentive is yet.

758
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,160
- You don't have one.

759
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,000
(laughing)

760
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
- Okay.

761
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,320
- It's friendship.

762
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,160
- Oh.

763
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,980
- It's about the dark knight.

764
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:51,700
say that that does work on me I am simple that way so do you want to let them out

765
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:59,860
or not no okay we'll let them out of the aisle accidentally let them out yeah

766
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:12,180
I lean on the bars I'm so strong accidentally rip them apart yeah they

767
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,020
- They wink at you, they're like, "Oh, very coy, cool."

768
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,620
And they leave.

769
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,560
They leave you free, the leprechauns.

770
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,780
They're gonna try to find their way back.

771
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,820
All of you roll per--

772
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,400
- Careful now. - Perception.

773
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,220
Per diem.

774
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,060
- Daronette is a bad word that starts with per.

775
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,900
- Perfidy?

776
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,020
- Perjury? - P-E-R-S-S-Y.

777
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,420
- Those are bad things to do.

778
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:40,020
I got a two.

779
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:40,980
- Wait, what are we rolling?

780
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:41,820
I got a 17.

781
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,660
- Perception?

782
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,480
- Wait, wait, wait.

783
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,320
- Nine.

784
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,140
- 17 plus eight.

785
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,540
- I got a five.

786
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,300
- Wow, 17 plus eight?

787
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,140
- Yeah.

788
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,960
- That's 25.

789
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,300
- Yep.

790
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:54,260
- As Blotas is letting out the leprechauns.

791
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,100
- Blotas will.

792
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:55,940
- Accidentally.

793
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,100
- Well, piss is not a curse.

794
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,180
- P.

795
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,020
- Say P.

796
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:00,840
- Oh, he said it.

797
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,820
- We're not gonna punish you this time, but say P.

798
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,660
- Come on.

799
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,820
- Yeah, he had to make the rights.

800
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,900
- Yes, really.

801
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:09,220
- Would you around your nephew or little, little cousin,

802
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:13,720
would you say I gotta take a I say it around if you and no you say I have to

803
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:21,300
go potty if you say that's trashy if you say I'm a save pee around your nephew I

804
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,660
even to be quite honest I say I don't say that one of my biggest regrets so

00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,980

808
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:55,220

809
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,780
photograph an analog photograph one of the very rare ones you look down I say

810
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:00,800
"What the flip?"

811
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,320
- You start to notice that, I mean,

812
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,560
this prison isn't just a prison,

813
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,520
it was, it looks like it was a lab at some point.

814
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,760
There's sort of like beakers strewn about,

815
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,120
there's broken centrifuges, you know,

816
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,640
there was like all this equipment that's been

817
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:18,900
covered in grime and time and age and all that stuff,

818
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:21,280
and then the yellow goop as well.

819
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,400
And you see this photograph.

820
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,840
- Said the G word.

821
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,320
- Goop is not a, come on. - Don't worry about it.

822
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,400
And you see this photograph and it has on it,

823
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,380
- Goop.

824
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,240
- You just liked saying it.

825
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,240
- A picture of, sorry I'm finding it here.

826
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Yeah, a picture of--

827
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,680
- Careful now.

828
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,580
- Oh, and I have to roll the dice too.

829
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,280
Okay.

830
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,400
A picture of the scientist, Ebenezer Keech.

831
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,420
He looks younger though.

832
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:02,060
As well as a younger Tool Lateralis with him.

833
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,900
- Oh, we like him.

834
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,240
- They work together at, if you guys remember,

835
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,600
they work together at Papi Chuka's Techno Slime.

836
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,760
- We miss him, we miss Tool.

837
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,120
- And a third person who's a woman

838
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,760
that you don't recognize with red hair.

839
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,600
And you--

840
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,440
- Wait, red hair?

841
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,720
- Mm-hmm, and you, Patrick.

842
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:20,500
- Is it Janet BJ's alternate persona?

843
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,340
- And you, Patrick.

844
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,840
- Can I wipe the dust off the mirror window frame?

845
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,680
(laughing)

846
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,520
- Picture frame.

847
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,340
- What are you talking about?

848
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,540
- Doesn't look like Janet BJ.

849
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,580
- Okay.

850
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,460
- But you, Patrick, you also recognize a younger,

851
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,820
less sort of like, you know,

852
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,820
if you remember Huge A Facts has these sort of like

853
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,620
shifting eyes and like weird kind of alien--

854
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,820
- What kind of haircut does he have?

855
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,940
- At the time he had a bowl cut.

856
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,780
- A bowl cut?

857
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,020
- Yeah, now he's got a cooler haircut.

858
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,980
- It's called a surfer cut.

859
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,300
- But you see him when he's younger also,

860
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:53,500
and they're all smiling in front of a facility

861
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,900
called Playtime Industries.

862
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,060
- Whoa.

863
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,900
- OMG.

864
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:03,140
- You can call Tool Lateralis if you want.

865
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:03,980
You guys are his friends.

866
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,820
- Oh, heck yeah, we can.

867
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,900
- Oh yeah, let's call him up.

868
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,940
- Let's call him up.

869
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:10,860
As soon as I see this picture,

870
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:15,700
I take out my PSP and I hit the speed dial

871
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,380
for Tool Lateralis.

872
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,020
- It's time for a late night buddy call.

873
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,040
- That's right.

874
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,880
- And you hear him, he's--

875
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,880
I was buddy calling my friend.

876
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,380
Dude!

877
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:26,380
*laughter*

878
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:29,380
I was up late night getting a buddy call.

879
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,880
*laughter*

880
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Don't you buddy call me.

881
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,380
A buddy call?

882
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:32,880
What am I just?

883
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,380
*laughter*

884
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,380
Ryan, another buddy.

885
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,380
*laughter*

886
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,880
Am I just a buddy call to you?

887
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,880
*laughter*

888
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,880
A buddy call?

889
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
*laughter*

890
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,380
Um, anyways, so you call and um, you do this buddy call.

891
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:45,880
Uh huh.

892
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,880
And keep in mind, so like, you guys are on this space station, right?

893
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,380
And so this, he's, he's all the way back.

894
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,380
He's service bad.

895
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:58,360
Um it's it's not bad. It's just like he just sounds a little bit. I'm on the ship's right by yeah the Wi-Fi is pretty good

896
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:02,620
It's just that you're where you are in the ship is kind of like in the gut so just like a little bit weaker

897
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:08,020
Where the servers are well stronger? Let's get to the thing we don't have to worry about this

898
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,460
Hello

899
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,460
Pat Patrick you was up

900
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:18,020
Oh, it's good to hear from you. What what the flip is uh?

901
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,340
Make sure to call me on

902
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:26,240
You know I am I am still in hiding, but what's going on is everything okay?

903
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,420
I'm looking at this picture you right now, bro, and you are young as F

904
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:39,780
Now it's that's on the line. Yeah, you're kind of where you take two damage. No. Where did you get this what picture?

905
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,780
I oh, I'm in the guts of a ship

906
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:47,680
Okay, and it says in the picture says playtime industries, and you're there with

907
00:37:47,680 --> 00:38:00,240
with Dr. Ebenezer Keech and this woman, I think her name is Jessica Brownlee. That's just an

908
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:08,120
educated guess though. Her name was Maude. Maude Brownlee. Marge? Maude. Marge? Oh, I

909
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,280
got you on speaker by the way. Say what's up yo. No he doesn't, that's why I can't hear

910
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,640
what he's saying. I almost always assume I'm on speaker if I'm on the phone with Ebenezer

911
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,180
any of you three.

912
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:21,140
- Yup, smart move.

913
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,500
Even if the other two aren't there,

914
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,940
maybe just sitting on the bus with you on speaker.

915
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,720
- What?

916
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,120
- Sitting on your butt?

917
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,040
- On the bus.

918
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,420
- Well, where did you find this picture?

919
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,760
- Prison.

920
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:41,400
- Yeah, I'm in like a prison for leprechauns.

921
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,440
- It's underground.

922
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,880
(laughing)

923
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,560
It's underground, but there's no,

924
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,560
I guess it's not ground.

925
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Under chip.

926
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,560
Yeah.

927
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,560
Greach.

928
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,560
Greach.

929
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,560
Oh, are you on?

930
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,560
Okay, so you're on...

931
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,560
The pleasure dome.

932
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
The pleasure palace.

933
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:56,560
Palace.

934
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,560
Oh.

935
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,560
Okay, this is...

936
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,560
Well, the play time is...

937
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:04,560
What are you watching?

938
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,560
What?

939
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,560
What are you watching on TV right now?

940
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,560
I can't hear that.

941
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Chips.

942
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
Yo!

943
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
Okay.

944
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,800
Yo

945
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,280
Okay, don't you have a Boston? It's like the oldies. Yeah, this is a new I like the new voice

946
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,380
I we did a new thing with beeping and I gotta keep my

947
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:28,280
Normal well, okay

948
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:32,200
So playtime industries was a company that Ebenezer and I started

949
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:39,400
Uh-huh. So and mod Brownlee was there and so mod ready. Yes mod ready. Yes

950
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,400
I was close. Um

951
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:50,160
When we were and then this guy with the bowl cut he was our benefactor facts. Yes, Hugh. Yes huge huge a fax

952
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,080
Can the character no he can't right?

953
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:59,760
Good

954
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,920
When we worked together at Papi Chuko's Techno Slime, we were close working partners and,

955
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,920
you know, like most companies in Gunn City, and after Stakem's labor statute was passed,

956
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,920
it was at-kill employment, so they could kill you at any time if you tried to leave.

957
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,920
So, we managed to get out, though, thanks to this wealthy benefactor, Hugh J. Fax,

958
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,760
who worked for the New England Federation.

959
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,360
That was before it was an empire,

960
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,160
it was a federation run by Leo and he had subsidiaries

961
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,000
and all that.

962
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,800
Obviously you know how that worked out

963
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,880
'cause I ended up working for Papi Chuko's Techno Slime

964
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,040
and making the C-U-L-O-S Rift,

965
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,080
if you guys remember from the first campaign.

966
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,000
Can you spell it?

967
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,840
Yeah, I remember.

968
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,520
C-U-L-O-S Rift.

969
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,360
Actually, that could be a chicken, so you can say that.

970
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,360
- The Coculus Rift.

971
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,900
But anyway, Ebeneezer and I were given this opportunity.

972
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,140
- I got my voice back.

973
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:13,460
- Because the benefactor, via discovery made

974
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,860
by the New England Federation,

975
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:17,540
he gave us access to a mysterious alien ship.

976
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:20,620
It was floating just out of orbit of E-Bomb,

977
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,860
and it was remarkable, and the resource they were using

978
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,260
was just like Techno Slime, but it was more chaotic.

979
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,100
- And it was glowing yellow?

980
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:28,940
- Yes.

981
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:31,500
- Holy Moses.

982
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,780
(laughing)

983
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,780
We called it Star Goo.

984
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,780
Star Goo.

985
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:38,140
Okay, so if I eat this Star Goo...

986
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,140
Do not do that!

987
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,140
Do not eat the Star Goo!

988
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,140
Okay.

989
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Do not eat the Star Goo.

990
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,140
Why?

991
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
So wait, wait, wait.

992
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,180
Where on the ship that you're talking about that has the Star Goo?

993
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,180
Do not eat the Star Goo.

994
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Okay, but you didn't answer that last question.

995
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Why?

996
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,180
What will happen if we eat it?

997
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,180
What happens?

998
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:56,100
Because I think I might have ate some a long time ago and then I had a crazy dream that

999
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,300
showed me where...

1000
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,820
Oh, we lost our nephew.

1001
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,820
Oh, we got we have so much to tell you

1002
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,820
Yeah, we have a nephew now I have

1003
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,740
They have son will text you okay, so just just

1004
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,140
When we were working on this I

1005
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,980
Started to get cautious the ship

1006
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:25,520
Was weird it made these weird noises and there's an alien species that live in the bowels of the ship called the Greeches

1007
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:28,640
Well the greet I don't know what creatures are well

1008
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,540
We've been dealing with them all day reaches are if you remember creatures are people who were on the ship

1009
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,220
Oh, yeah

1010
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,060
work

1011
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:41,700
Who were workers on the ship and who got corrupted over time by the lack of nourishment and maybe this goo?

1012
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:46,140
Okay, so there's a let me fill you in there's a

1013
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:53,220
It's a group on this ship, and they were old workers, and they maybe have been affected by the goo

1014
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,820
And they're called Greeches.

1015
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,320
The point is, listen, we think that Maude is a serial killer.

1016
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:02,520
Or you are.

1017
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,320
Or Hugh J. Fax is.

1018
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,520
No, I think it's Maude.

1019
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,720
Well, Maude...

1020
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:11,520
Oh my god, did Maude eat the Starglobe and become part of the ship and is a serial killer?

1021
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,020
I think Maude died and turned one person into a serial killer from grief.

1022
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:17,220
Well, I...

1023
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,520
So...

1024
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,720
Or it's an entity.

1025
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,720
If it'll help, I can tell you.

1026
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,220
Yeah, tell us.

1027
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:28,900
At the time, I started to get boxed out of the project a little bit more.

1028
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:35,300
Um, Ebeneezer, he may seem demure, but he's the real maverick, or he was back then.

1029
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,300
He was the one who said we should leave Papi Chuko.

1030
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,900
He was the one who found Hugh J. Fax.

1031
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:46,700
And soon he and Fax were doing lines of the goo together, just snorting it.

1032
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,700
And then they brought on an assistant who was mawed ready, and she was...

1033
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:55,260
She was brilliant, but she was very much taken by Ebenezer,

1034
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,480
and soon she was into the goo,

1035
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,220
and I was getting frustrated.

1036
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:03,380
The plan was for us to develop technology

1037
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,860
that could power a space station the size of a county,

1038
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,100
though it's good to see that it seems,

1039
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,580
if the goo is there-- - Yeah, we're on that

1040
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,180
spaceship right now. - Maybe that didn't happen,

1041
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:13,420
but-- - No, I just said

1042
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,860
that we're on it.

1043
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,900
- Oh, well, yeah, so that's,

1044
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,260
well, Maude got pregnant at one point.

1045
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,100
- Okay.

1046
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:26,940
It all stank of startup stuff, you know. And did she have the baby and maybe it

1047
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:32,500
was a really bad circumstances? I left the project. So you don't know at all?

1048
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,100
There was no serpents involved. A snow serpent was involved. It had a serpent stance, it was a wiggly baby.

1049
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:44,620
That's actually really scary. I was trying to track down this alien ship, it

1050
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:49,180
did not... the project had lots of strange things. The sounds were coming out of the

1051
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:53,180
There were artifacts. I was trying to track that down when you guys were doing that heist.

1052
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:58,500
It was uh, there was an artifact kept in the ICUP facility

1053
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:04,300
Run by Fatima Mankizziface. Mommy Goodlegs was supposed to help me with that. I don't know what happened, but

1054
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:09,060
Just if you're on this ship and

1055
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:14,900
I'm assuming Ebenezer is there. I had heard he had taken a job there and that this ship is being now being powered by this.

1056
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:16,900
We've met him. I would just be

1057
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:23,080
Careful then I don't we a buddy we are not being careful at all on here

1058
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:29,220
I have not one pretty like I have time. I feel like I have to say it, but we keep dying pretty much

1059
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,120
Yeah, I had a heart attack as I said F. Yeah, okay

1060
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:38,580
Don't I guess don't say that you whoa just that one

1061
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:43,560
Well, I just just be careful do not eat the goo

1062
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,920
It might destroy your mind permanently

1063
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,080
I don't know what'll happen.

1064
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,320
I suppose if you see Ebenezer, tell him I said hi.

1065
00:45:55,320 --> 00:46:00,040
- Can I ask him who Maude is, or will he get all weird

1066
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,880
and start throwing--

1067
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,720
- I don't know.

1068
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:03,560
- Or the bio flask said maybe--

1069
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,640
- They were together when I last saw him.

1070
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:07,440
- Is he gonna get all crazy?

1071
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:08,680
- Was Maude with him?

1072
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,960
Did you meet Maude? - I'm pretty sure Maude

1073
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,040
is dead. - Okay, guys,

1074
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,920
let's go find Ebenezer.

1075
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,520
- No, we gotta get these leprechauns out of the jail.

1076
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,760
We already got the leprechaun, we have to get the Greech queen.

1077
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,280
The Greech queen.

1078
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,000
Oh, yeah.

1079
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:20,500
Yeah.

1080
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,240
I don't really care.

1081
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,000
There's some bull crap we got to--

1082
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,840
look, if we get the leprechauns at it--

1083
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:25,400
I don't know.

1084
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,760
The leprechauns are already gone.

1085
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,760
Oh, they're already gone?

1086
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,040
No, they're Greech food right now.

1087
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,000
That's not our problem.

1088
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,880
We did not kill the--

1089
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,440
We did our job when it comes to that.

1090
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,040
OK, let's go kill the queen.

1091
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,480
Tool, it was good talking to you.

1092
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:36,800
What's up?

1093
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,600
Hey, it was good catching up with you guys.

1094
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,200
You give me a--

1095
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,480
Really?

1096
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,000
Seriously?

1097
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,680
If you guys are ever interested in more weird science

1098
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,500
kind of adventures you just hit me up I always got stuff going on. You're just one of those

1099
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:51,460
guys were like I always thought we would be pretty good friends if we like made the time.

1100
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,400
It's one of those it'll happen one day like we don't have to I like I do we're on the

He's been squirting too much.

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,640
You've been squirting too much.

1106
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,640
Thank you, Julio. I agree 100%.

1107
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,640
You don't know what I was going to say.

1108
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,640
Listen to this.

1109
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,640
You've been doing it the whole night.

1110
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,640
You've been swearing more than usual.

1111
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
I just said BS.

1112
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,640
Like BS the words BS.

1113
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,640
Like the letters BS.

1114
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
You're fine.

1115
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,640
I was going to say, do you smoke that sherm?

1116
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,640
Get out of town.

1117
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,640
Why can't we say stuff like that?

1118
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,140
- Sherm. - Yeah.

1119
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:45,040
- Just keep it in mind, in the future from you,

1120
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,280
you will, the rules will be stricter.

1121
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,200
- You got one more chance in like--

1122
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,480
- That was last strike.

1123
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,960
- In a reasonable amount of time,

1124
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:54,920
you can't be doing stuff like that.

1125
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,520
- Yeah. - You know what I'm saying?

1126
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:57,840
In like a reasonable amount of time.

1127
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,400
- It really is like, I am surprised at how upset I am at you.

1128
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,880
- Yeah, I'm like really angry.

1129
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,680
- Like he's skirting the rules, it's not fair.

1130
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,840
- I could take it out on you.

1131
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,440
- Because we've been trying really hard.

1132
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,800
- Yeah, I wouldn't do that, I'm kidding.

1133
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,960
- I don't even know what you guys are talking about,

1134
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,480
what the flip you guys are saying.

1135
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,320
- Take two damage.

1136
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,140
- What are you talking about?

1137
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:16,980
- Take two damage.

1138
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:17,820
- DM says take two.

1139
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,640
- Take two damage.

1140
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,480
- That's right.

1141
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,320
- That's absurd.

1142
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,400
- That's like when you just got sent to your room

1143
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,960
and you slammed the door one last time.

1144
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,200
- That's so...

1145
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,520
- Your mom said, "Don't slam the door!"

1146
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,320
And you opened it and slammed it again.

1147
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,160
- Yes.

1148
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,120
- And you went like this.

1149
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,960
- But you did one of those slams.

1150
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,780
- But the door was closed.

1151
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:35,920
- You did like maybe almost a slam, but it wasn't.

1152
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,000
- You were gonna say that, I'm not touching you.

1153
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,840
- Yes, yes.

1154
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:39,760
- Yes, you did though, yeah.

1155
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,760
- I didn't slam it.

1156
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,960
- A level of slam that like maybe--

1157
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,800
- What are you talking about?

1158
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:43,620
- We can't say what the flip now?

1159
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:45,240
- Uber driver would get mad about it.

1160
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:46,520
- It's just the amount you're doing it,

1161
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,520
you're just like rubbing it in our face.

1162
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,080
And it's like we're all trying to quit cursing right now.

1163
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:51,320
- You're toeing the line.

1164
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,140
- And it's like--

1165
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:52,980
- You're really trying to toe the line.

1166
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:53,820
- You're like looking at us

1167
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,320
who are really trying to quit cursing and you're going--

1168
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,520
- You're literally, you're like a guy--

1169
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:57,360
- I can do it any time I want.

1170
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,960
a guy who comes to Narcotics Anonymous and tries to sell heroin.

1171
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,960
Definitely.

1172
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,360
Because you are making me want to cuss so bad.

1173
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:06,120
You are the heroin dealer at Narcotics Anonymous.

1174
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,120
So enjoy your three hits.

1175
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,600
I guess I just won't say anything.

1176
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,600
Why?

1177
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:13,600
Because you're incapable of talking without cussing.

1178
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,600
Because that's all you say.

1179
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:15,600
You swear.

1180
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:16,600
You swear.

1181
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:17,600
You swear.

1182
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,600
You swear.

1183
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:19,600
That's all you say.

1184
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
It's all swearing.

1185
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,440
I'm not going to say what the flip.

1186
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:26,240
I'm not going to say what the fruit.

1187
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,080
- The fruit.

1188
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,320
(laughing)

1189
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:30,700
- Oh lordy.

1190
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:31,540
- Okay.

1191
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:32,360
- Alright, cool.

1192
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,200
You guys wanna go to the,

1193
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,040
you guys wanna go to the,

1194
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,860
- Yeah, we'll go to the queen.

1195
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:36,860
- You guys wanna go see the Greech Queen?

1196
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:37,700
Okay.

1197
00:49:37,700 --> 00:49:39,800
- Alright, we're gonna take her down.

1198
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,040
- Yeah.

1199
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,080
- You walk out back into the sort of main lobby area

1200
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,160
and see some of the Greeches,

1201
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:47,760
they distractedly are like,

1202
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,040
kinda trying to paw at you.

1203
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,440
You guys can like, literally like run,

1204
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,040
just run through them very easily.

1205
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,040
- Yeah, do we, oh, who do we distract with the pile?

1206
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,160
- I thought we distracted all the Greek guys.

1207
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,280
- Stretch killed the guy.

1208
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,840
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - You killed the guy.

1209
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,720
Yeah, you guys run through that other door,

1210
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,500
down these stairs to another hallway.

1211
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,440
And I will say, before you sprint through--

1212
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,640
- Can we take a long rest?

1213
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,680
- No.

1214
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,520
- Can we rest at all?

1215
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,320
- It's like in Elder Scrolls, you can't rest

1216
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,640
in where enemies are hostile kind of thing.

1217
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:22,640
- I can't take, do I have a potion of health?

1218
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,920
- I guess you could try to rest

1219
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:27,600
- We and Caleb have potions of health.

1220
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,880
- You can try to rest, unlike in Elder Scrolls,

1221
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,520
you just might get interrupted.

1222
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:32,360
- Okay.

1223
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,600
- You don't have any health potions.

1224
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,000
I said there were health potions at the shop

1225
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,760
and you guys were like, let me look at the shiny thing,

1226
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,960
and I said you guys can't afford that,

1227
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,200
and you're like, aw man.

1228
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,960
But you now have 25,000 tokens,

1229
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,840
so when you leave here, you guys can go shopping.

1230
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,000
If you--

1231
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,480
- When did I get 25,000 again?

1232
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:50,960
- 'Cause you gave that intel to Hugh J. Fax.

1233
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,800
- Oh!

1234
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:54,320
- And now you have to kill the general.

1235
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:59,880
I'm at 6 HP, but I still I need to fight we have to fight okay. Yeah, all right fight. It's fight in time

1236
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:03,400
so you guys get to the hallway, I'm gonna do a hit list run and

1237
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:08,980
You walk down and you notice that the the sort of like makeup of this hallway now is like a little bit less

1238
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:11,100
Because it's the Queen

1239
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:17,840
But when you get to the doors and they open up you see sort of a long

1240
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,000
bridge like 15 feet wide about 45

1241
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:25,800
- Why, is this like the Borg Queen

1242
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,120
in Star Trek First Contact?

1243
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:32,120
- It's more like the power core area in episode one.

1244
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,400
- Okay.

1245
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,440
- Where they have the Darth Maul fight.

1246
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,640
- Got it, got it, I know exactly what you're talking about.

1247
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,600
- Star Wars, oh who knows what Star Wars is?

1248
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,480
- Is it like that thing in Toy Story 2

1249
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,800
where he jumps on the little--

1250
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,240
- Or maybe it's like a football field.

1251
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:49,000
- Yeah, or maybe a race car driver track.

1252
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,960
- Or maybe a footy track.

1253
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,480
- Maybe a footy pitch.

1254
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,200
- It's a lot like a footy pitch.

1255
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,080
- Or a beautiful banquet table filled with meats.

1256
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,040
- Yeah. - And breads.

1257
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,480
- Okay, that one I'm down with.

1258
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:03,240
- And it's a large atrium, and you will notice,

1259
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:04,540
'cause you guys have now seen this

1260
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,880
from a couple different angles,

1261
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,800
you guys saw it from up top, on the top part of the ship.

1262
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,440
You saw it from when you were in Hugh J. Fax's lair.

1263
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:16,520
This is a power core, one of the three power cores

1264
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:17,520
that power the whole ship.

1265
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,680
- I would like to destroy this.

1266
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,640
- Yeah, I wanna shoot it right now.

1267
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,240
I wanna shoot my hoverboard at it.

1268
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,840
- I'm gonna use my atomic bomb.

1269
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,080
(laughing)

1270
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:31,000
- I forgot I gave you that.

1271
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,340
Really bad idea.

1272
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:36,200
But you don't just see that though,

1273
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,720
I'm sorry, I'm like drifting from the mic.

1274
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,320
I don't know what you're gonna say,

1275
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,880
I'll tell you this right now, I'm gonna riz.

1276
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:48,880
But you see also a undulating flesh,

1277
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:53,380
flesh creature inside of where the core is.

1278
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,960
- Underwearing?

1279
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,960
- With flowing red hair and this sort of spiraling

1280
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,800
- Oh my god.

1281
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,340
- Mouth of like, sort of like,

1282
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:03,180
- I should say oh my gosh.

1283
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:06,240
- Labia is kind of like going inward, inward, inward.

1284
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,080
- He said Edward, Edward, Edward!

1285
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:08,920
- He said it!

1286
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:11,040
- He said Edward, Edward, Edward!

1287
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,040
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1288
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,360
- After a certain anatomical word.

1289
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:22,320
You saying that n-word made OBS crash. No it's not that's definitely not what

1290
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:27,440
happened. Uh-oh OBS crashed. Did we lose that recording?

1291
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:35,680
I don't know just keep going. Okay. So no first of all no. No I did not I said

1292
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:45,640
n-word I N W A R D. Yeah. It's that's not my fault. You just spelled N W A R D. I didn't.

1293
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,900
(laughing)

1294
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,700
- That might work on me.

1295
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:54,080
- But it's okay to describe sensitive parts

1296
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,760
of the female anatomy though.

1297
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:56,600
We're ignoring that part.

1298
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,840
- Yeah, without her permission by the way.

1299
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:02,560
- He's saying inward labia.

1300
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,200
- Okay.

1301
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,240
- At the $10 tier.

1302
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,280
- At the center of the--

1303
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,440
- It's what he's saying.

1304
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:13,400
- I almost wanna make you take a swear to your head.

1305
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,240
- At the center--

1306
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,060
- What are you talking about?

1307
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:17,220
- I'm saying you were taking the opportunity.

1308
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,060
- This sort of like--

1309
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:18,900
- You reveled in it.

1310
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,740
- Yeah, you did.

1311
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,560
- This sort of like--

1312
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:21,400
- You reveled in it.

1313
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,240
- Uh-uh.

1314
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:23,060
- Yeah.

1315
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:27,060
- Like inward going like circles of like these

1316
00:54:27,060 --> 00:54:30,580
like fleshy holes are a dozens and dozens

1317
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:32,700
of shiny yellow eggs.

1318
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,780
The same yellow you've been seeing throughout this ship.

1319
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:39,260
- I tap Ray and blow to us on the shoulder

1320
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,100
and I say that's the same.

1321
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,940
- You tap that?

1322
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:43,620
- That's the same yellow we've been seeing.

1323
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:45,580
and you start to notice that the power core

1324
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:46,940
is kind of similar to that.

1325
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,420
And you see her vomit up these eggs

1326
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:52,160
and you see these creatures start to writhe inside of it.

1327
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,980
You see a GI Joe head pop out of one,

1328
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,380
and then you see a tongue sort of like pop out of another.

1329
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,580
And then you see them start to like

1330
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:02,460
become these like weird fleshy,

1331
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,660
kind of like, almost like they're like crawling fetuses

1332
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:07,500
of like toy flesh.

1333
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:10,420
- Wait, there is no playtime killer.

1334
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,180
It's these toys that are killing.

1335
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:13,020
- It's toy eggs.

1336
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,860
- And then the Greech Queen, when she faces you,

1337
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:17,020
now she like turns.

1338
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,620
- I look at her and I point and I say, "Maud!"

1339
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,380
- You see, whoa.

1340
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,700
- That, can music play?

1341
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,700
- That would be powerful.

1342
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:24,540
- Epic.

1343
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,360
- She,

1344
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:29,340
she has, so it's like, she's like basically like a hole,

1345
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:30,580
like her whole mouth.

1346
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,420
And then she has these slivers.

1347
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:32,740
- Yeah, that's nice to say about a woman.

1348
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:33,580
- That's not.

1349
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:34,460
- She's basically like a hole.

1350
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,700
(laughing)

1351
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,540
- And she has these slivers.

1352
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,740
- And a queen, no less.

1353
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:38,780
- These sort of slivers.

1354
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:40,540
- Even above a normal woman in terms of--

1355
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,700
- You're calling this queen just a hole.

1356
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,860
- She has these tiny slivers of blue eyes

1357
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,700
that are kind of around.

1358
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:53,360
And when you say mawed, you kind of see her,

1359
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,220
she kind of recognizes for a second.

1360
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,580
- I'm friends with Tulle Lateralis.

1361
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,100
- And you were pregnant.

1362
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,240
- And it's gone.

1363
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,080
- Okay.

1364
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,420
- Whatever that recognition was is gone.

1365
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:05,260
- Why?

1366
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,260
- Then we're gonna play golf with your mouth.

1367
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,140
- She has these legs that are like

1368
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:13,500
these floppy tentacle penises,

1369
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,820
they're flopping around.

1370
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,300
Sometimes they'll get hard, randomly.

1371
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,140
- Mother of Mary.

1372
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:23,100
- And just shoot seed, is that okay to say?

1373
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:25,140
(laughing)

1374
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:27,080
- You have to say semen.

1375
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:27,920
- Semen out.

1376
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:28,860
- Seed is biblical.

1377
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,960
- And you'll see it shoot across the entire thing,

1378
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,820
like the entire, this giant room you're in,

1379
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:38,020
and just hit the wall and start to dissolve it.

1380
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,820
- Ugh, blast.

1381
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,460
- Yeah, it is a blast.

1382
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,780
And then you hear--

1383
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,740
- Crikey.

1384
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,700
- Over the speakers,

1385
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,060
like the speakers that you've been hearing

1386
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,580
when you've been hearing this voice.

1387
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,780
- Yeah.

1388
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:59,780
- Say, "Mama, can you turn out the lights?"

1389
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,980
And then you hear--

1390
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,300
- Whoa.

1391
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,440
- That laugh.

1392
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:10,120
- Wait, that was the same voice as Two Lateralis.

1393
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,820
- I'll work on the voice.

1394
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,300
(laughing)

1395
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,140
- What laugh?

1396
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,700
(imitating baby laughing)

1397
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,660
- I'm scared in the dark.

1398
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:22,600
- Oh wait, mama, 'cause Maude is the mama,

1399
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,580
so the laugh is the baby.

1400
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,060
- And she walks out of the power grid,

1401
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:30,180
and when she does, that's when the lights go down

1402
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:31,920
like we saw just a second ago.

1403
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,940
And when the lights are down,

1404
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:39,080
you hear the voice say,

1405
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,060
you monsters, you'd attack mother.

1406
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,180
You know, that kind of character.

1407
00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:45,640
- No, we wouldn't.

1408
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,180
- And he says, now,

1409
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:54,300
that's the Snow and Play time starts.

1410
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,380
And...

1411
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,820
- I said we wouldn't.

1412
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,980
I told him we, I just told him we wouldn't.

1413
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:05,340
- Okay.

1414
00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:07,600
(laughing)

1415
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,580
- Scary.

1416
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:14,460
- That, the whole light thing scared me so bad, by the way.

1417
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:15,300
- It put me on edge.

1418
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:17,540
- Putting the lights down, I'm like,

1419
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,000
I cannot believe that scared me.

1420
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,340
- You flipped that one.

1421
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,180
- I did not flip it.

1422
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,000
- And he just pointed at me.

1423
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:22,840
- I saw you flipped it.

1424
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,660
- I saw you flip that one.

1425
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,820
- For audio people, he just pointed at me and did nothing.

1426
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:26,660
- Sorry.

1427
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:27,940
- He flipped the dice.

1428
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,540
He flipped it.

1429
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,500
He flipped it.

1430
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,580
- You're just saying flip 'cause you know what we're thinking.

1431
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,180
- He's so scared that he's just talking through it.

1432
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:38,460
like you're gonna get your your back with the back to one

1433
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:42,080
why you flip in them it was it was not on one

1434
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,140
what the biggity dog mama you're dead I'm dead

1435
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,260
haha you're a wait wait I have six HP he has three

1436
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,940
your throat it was just luck of the roll your throat

1437
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:57,500
cuts open blood squirts out

1438
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:00,300
I'm

1439
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,340
Roll for initiative.

1440
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:03,620
Well, I said mod.

1441
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,660
I said mod.

1442
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:05,260
OK.

1443
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,260
He's-- could die.

1444
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:07,060
Roll for initiative.

1445
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,140
OK.

1446
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:08,900
Fuck.

1447
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:09,700
I got a two.

1448
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,540
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1449
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:12,700
You need that health.

1450
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,620
Fun times.

1451
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,020
Fun game with--

1452
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,900
I got a--

1453
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:26,300
Say it.

1454
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:27,020
What is that?

1455
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,100
I don't remember where my initiative at.

1456
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:29,860
You have 15.

1457
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:34,980
Okay, and would you get Pat? Oh wait? I got a three and you know you roll over as well as episode

1458
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:37,740
Why do it you roll initiative as well? Okay? He's dead

1459
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:41,900
Yeah, but still he's on the turn order 14, okay?

1460
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:45,760
My heart is I

1461
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:51,420
Said the lady's name, and I said that we weren't gonna attack her when he said you'd hurt mother. I said no

1462
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:57,580
Yeah, and my stomach hurts. Yeah, and this is gonna happen now, and you're giving him fucking pain. Oh, I'm dead

1463
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,840
(laughing)

1464
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:04,060
- No!

1465
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:04,900
- Oh my god!

1466
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:05,740
- No!

1467
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,480
- It was all leading up to this.

1468
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,320
- Okay.

1469
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,260
- You are lucky that you go first.

1470
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:12,740
- The only way you're gonna win this

1471
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:15,220
is if you somehow induce him to swear.

1472
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,060
- I'm so scared.

1473
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,600
- You have to grab Pat's foreskin.

1474
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,180
That has to be what you do right now.

1475
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:22,020
- Okay, that's what I'm doing.

1476
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,060
- You have to heal them or you will be done-zo.

1477
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,620
- All right, all right, I'm running to heal Patrick.

1478
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,120
I have to heal one at a time, right?

1479
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:29,960
- Okay.

1480
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,540
- We'll have to stabilize him first, I guess.

1481
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,140
- I have six techno slime points,

1482
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:33,980
so after that you can't heal anymore.

1483
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,940
- With the four skin, you can just wrap it over his head

1484
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,300
or wrap it over his head.

1485
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:40,140
- Okay.

1486
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:43,740
- If you will do half heal, he can do full heal

1487
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:44,580
when he does it.

1488
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:46,500
- So I should wake him up first, probably.

1489
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,100
- Well, the only thing though is that you know

1490
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:49,760
he's sooner in the turn order.

1491
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,980
The way, yeah, so it's up to you.

1492
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:55,320
I'm just giving you the information here.

1493
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:59,180
- Okay, I will get him because then both of us,

1494
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,940
one of us could get him back up.

1495
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,140
- Yeah, okay, cool.

1496
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:05,580
So, Pat, you roll 1d10 plus four.

1497
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:06,500
- 1d10?

1498
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,000
Wait, I didn't get to do that?

1499
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,180
Is this one?

1500
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:12,440
- Yeah, you could just, that's like basically your action.

1501
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,540
Let's set this up, by the way.

1502
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:17,020
Sorry, I didn't really make this all...

1503
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:20,660
- It's so hard to-- - Oh, a scary monster.

1504
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:22,280
That's maud.

1505
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,120
- She is.

1506
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:23,940
- I got a Greach Queen. - I got a three.

1507
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:24,780
- I got a three. - I got a three.

1508
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,620
- I got a three.

1509
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,820
- You got a three total?

1510
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,660
- Yeah.

1511
01:01:27,660 --> 01:01:28,480
- Three plus four is seven.

1512
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,920
Seven divided by two is 3.5.

1513
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,720
Three health for you, Blowtoss.

1514
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:33,760
- Three?

1515
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,700
So was I, did I just go down to zero?

1516
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,800
- Yeah, you went down to zero.

1517
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,640
- I just went down to zero?

1518
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:42,160
- So you give yourself three and a half.

1519
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:43,000
- Three.

1520
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,720
- Can I get three and a half?

1521
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,720
- No.

1522
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:47,560
- No? - No.

1523
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:48,380
- Go ahead.

1524
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:49,320
- Well, just 'cause it's not,

1525
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,800
just 'cause it doesn't work that way.

1526
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,600
- I would give it to you if I could.

1527
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:53,440
- If you could.

1528
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,700
- You could do it.

1529
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:55,540
- No, I can't.

1530
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,360
- If I could.

1531
01:01:56,360 --> 01:01:57,800
- Game doesn't let you do that.

1532
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:58,840
- Yeah, fair enough.

1533
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,040
- Okay, cool.

1534
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:02,880
- That looks better.

1535
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,140
- So, you're up, Blotas.

1536
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:08,440
- Okay, I guess I will,

1537
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:12,860
so did we see the person whose voice that was?

1538
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,920
- No.

1539
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:14,760
- You just heard them.

1540
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,280
- And also what, my throat just got slit?

1541
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:18,480
Or did anybody do it to me?

1542
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,280
- I can tell you, so I can tell you a little bit more

1543
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:22,600
what you experienced, 'cause now you have,

1544
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:27,600
similar to, oh lordy, O'Neal?

1545
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,800
- If it's your turn first, you should get Pat back up.

1546
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,920
- Similar to that Irish guy who got his throat slit

1547
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,640
by Playtime and Liv, you're the second person

1548
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,040
to have done that.

1549
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:42,040
So it was this warm feeling that glid, glid.

1550
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,400
- People, they always make it whenever--

1551
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,240
- Glided across.

1552
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,640
- They always make it sound like it's so good

1553
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:47,680
to get your throat slit.

1554
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:48,520
- Yeah.

1555
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:49,880
- Or like, you ever hear someone talk about

1556
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:52,360
getting stabbed and they're like, yeah, I had this warm feeling.

1557
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:52,720
Yeah.

1558
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:53,920
I kind of want to get stabbed.

1559
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,240
Yeah, that's kind of what I'm trying to do for us here tonight.

1560
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:01,200
So you get your, he felt that warm feeling and again, it didn't feel like,

1561
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,600
it felt kind of just like a opening.

1562
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,280
Like it didn't feel like you were getting like, it was jagged through.

1563
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:09,760
It felt very just like, this is just a natural way.

1564
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,880
Just what happens.

1565
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:11,520
Yeah.

1566
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:12,480
It's just what happens.

1567
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,760
Come on.

1568
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,120
I actually felt bad just now.

1569
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,360
Please put that away.

1570
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,480
I'm feeling bad.

1571
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,240
- I was raised way too Catholic for that.

1572
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:23,980
- I was trying to get him to swear.

1573
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,300
(laughing)

1574
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,000
- I was too Catholic for that too.

1575
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:35,440
You also felt that what had like touched you,

1576
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,320
'cause something had touched you besides

1577
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,880
that whatever the throat slitting was,

1578
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,520
it felt--

1579
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:43,880
- Slit, really?

1580
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:45,360
Okay.

1581
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,160
- Did I say slutting or slitting?

1582
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,520
- Whoa, now you know.

1583
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:50,320
- Oh my god. - Slut is not.

1584
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:51,640
- Slut is not. - Yeah it is.

1585
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,120
- Yeah it is. - What?

1586
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,000
- That is a curse. - Could you say that

1587
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,320
in front of a kid? - You were fine

1588
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,920
until you said it wasn't. - Yeah.

1589
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:00,560
- So now we're not gonna get you for two,

1590
01:04:00,560 --> 01:04:01,720
we are gonna get you for one though.

1591
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:03,480
- That's fine, you can get me for one.

1592
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:04,920
Let me finish describing this.

1593
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:09,640
And the feeling of this person,

1594
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:11,720
whoever this was,

1595
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:16,080
that moved by you as they slit your throat.

1596
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:18,680
(laughter)

1597
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:22,880
Felt kind of like they were phasing through you.

1598
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:24,240
Felt kind of like they were like

1599
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:25,480
clipping through you a little bit.

1600
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:27,320
- Oh my god, they're part of the ship.

1601
01:04:27,320 --> 01:04:30,600
- Don't yawn after he tells a detail like that.

1602
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:31,960
Don't yawn in his face.

1603
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,400
- That's kind of cool though, to do that to me.

1604
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,080
- So what's our question?

1605
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,080
- I would say, our question is,

1606
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,120
is there any way to, because the big thing is

1607
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,280
we just need to avoid damage,

1608
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:46,520
because I think we're at 10 HP between the--

1609
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:47,560
- Can we keep-- - Yeah, the lights,

1610
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:48,920
by the way, are just flickering.

1611
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:51,160
- Yeah. - Yeah, so is there any way,

1612
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:53,520
is there any way, what would be--

1613
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,360
- We know her name. - What would be

1614
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,640
a good distraction for this thing to--

1615
01:04:57,640 --> 01:05:00,360
- Think you kind of unlocked it a little bit with him.

1616
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,680
- Or is there somewhere to hide, I guess, in this room?

1617
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:05,120
- You could run away.

1618
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,000
- We can run away?

1619
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,160
But we're supposed to kill her, though.

1620
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,800
- That's what the leprechauns want you to do.

1621
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,920
You don't have to do anything.

1622
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,120
- Yeah, but if the leprechauns--

1623
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:17,320
- You could retreat and come back later even.

1624
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,080
- Maybe we should tell Tool Lateralis about this.

1625
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:22,860
- Yeah, oh my God, get your phone out and call him.

1626
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:25,040
- I will say this got way scarier than I thought.

1627
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,680
I thought it was gonna be literally

1628
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:28,520
the cow fight queen for Women's Day.

1629
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:32,200
- What about her hearing Tool's voice?

1630
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:33,040
Wouldn't that like--

1631
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:34,120
- Oh, that's a good idea.

1632
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,560
- That's a really good idea.

1633
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,640
- That's a wonderful idea, we need to get you awake.

1634
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,280
- Okay, I'll wake him up right now.

1635
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:41,240
- You can just use my phone, you don't have to do that.

1636
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:42,320
- But I still will wake you up.

1637
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,880
- We didn't have that idea, we need you to be awake.

1638
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,840
- Okay, so roll another D10.

1639
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,940
Keep in mind-- - Chill.

1640
01:05:50,940 --> 01:05:52,320
Seven.

1641
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:53,760
- Keep in mind-- - Seven.

1642
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,080
- The only thing I'll say though,

1643
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:57,080
I mean, we'll commit to that as the heal.

1644
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,240
Seven plus four which is 11,

1645
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:00,000
do that with two so it's five again.

1646
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,220
But we'll commit to that as a heal.

1647
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:02,640
Before you do it though--

1648
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,640
- 11 points, I could have been fine.

1649
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:09,680
- Hold on, before, just remember that the next turn

1650
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:12,020
is Mama's turn.

1651
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:15,080
Mod's turn, not your turn.

1652
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:20,080
- But I could still, I mean, someone could still,

1653
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,040
using a cell phone is not--

1654
01:06:22,040 --> 01:06:23,080
- Is that a free action?

1655
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,460
- That is a free action.

1656
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:25,360
- Oh, what you just did?

1657
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:26,200
No, that's your act.

1658
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:27,020
- You can be--

1659
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,080
- But is using a cell phone a free action?

1660
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:28,920
- We have done a bunch of--

1661
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:29,960
- So then I'll dial two red arrows.

1662
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:30,800
- You'll do it?

1663
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:31,620
Okay, fair enough, you got it.

1664
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:32,460
- Yeah. - Yeah, good job.

1665
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:33,920
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, call him.

1666
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,760
You call him.

1667
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:35,600
- Okay.

1668
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:36,420
- Beep, beep, boop, boop, beep, beep.

1669
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,080
And these are not swearing beeps.

1670
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:38,920
- Thank God.

1671
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:39,760
- It's Morse code.

1672
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:40,720
- Boop.

1673
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,720
I'm gonna call him.

1674
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:43,720
Beep!

1675
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:44,720
Blowcast!

1676
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,720
Beep!

1677
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:47,720
Wait, you're already over them.

1678
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:48,720
I'm also gonna beep!

1679
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:50,720
I guess I got the wrong...

1680
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,720
Don't hang up! Wait, don't hang up!

1681
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:53,720
Am I alive? I don't remember.

1682
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,720
No, you're not.

1683
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,720
Okay.

1684
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,720
Speak your phone.

1685
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:57,720
Put him on speaker.

1686
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:59,720
I don't know how!

1687
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:02,720
Okay.

1688
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:03,720
I'm pressing the button and...

1689
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:04,720
Beep!

1690
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:05,720
Okay.

1691
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,720
Can you hear me now, Tool?

1692
01:07:07,720 --> 01:07:08,720
Yes!

1693
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,080
So we're here with Maude. She's a monster.

1694
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:14,440
What? Maude?

1695
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:17,000
Yeah, so we're just gonna kind of throw the phone towards her,

1696
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
and if you could just say something to save our lives, that would be great.

1697
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,560
Okay. And I toss the phone over towards, maybe within a couple of feet of Maude.

1698
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,560
Yeah, you like us. Here's the phone.

1699
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:29,360
I was gonna pick something smaller.

1700
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:31,360
That's how big the phone is.

1701
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,360
I was gonna pick something smaller.

1702
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,920
But yeah, you slide that over.

1703
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,200
Mod! Mod is that you?

1704
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:47,280
I have a mod on my phone that I have a subwoofer attached to it.

1705
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,800
I think she can probably hear it.

1706
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:49,800
Mod!

1707
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,320
And Mod sort of like looks perplexed.

1708
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:58,120
We're going to do a little bit of a, we're going to do a little persuasion check here.

1709
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:05,640
And as he's saying that, you hear over the like, the sort of like loudspeaker thing again

1710
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:10,440
Uh, uh, like, "What are you doing? Stop! Stop it!"

1711
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,640
Um, as he's talking...

1712
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,240
Okay, that's a nine plus two, well...

1713
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:20,840
And what is her... I mean, it's really kind of like that.

1714
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,440
She kind of like pauses for a second and then kind of like...

1715
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,040
Kind of pushes the phone, like, further from her.

1716
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:31,640
Um, so no dice just yet. So it is her turn.

1717
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,440
Um... - Uh-oh.

1718
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,000
- Tool, stay on the line.

1719
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,340
- I will, I will.

1720
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:38,720
- So he says he will.

1721
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,640
And let's get her attacks out here.

1722
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:44,340
- Holy guacamole, what's coming next?

1723
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:46,580
(laughing)

1726
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:55,360
What does it say?

1727
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:59,120
- Say the F word or I'll kill you.

1728
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:00,640
You're not supposed to, it's between me and him.

1729
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:02,360
Okay, well, you know, read that.

01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,080
- I don't even think the video worked for this one.

1733
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:07,920
- Yeah, the video might not work.

1734
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:08,760
- Don't look at it.

1735
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:11,360
It's not for you, 'cause it has my stuff on it.

1736
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,440

I would like to say this is the first time

1742
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:27,200
I've ever not wanted you to say that.

1743
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:29,960
I was a little bit excited, but we'll see it next time.

1744

- Yes.

1745
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:31,880
- Bye. - Bye bye.
