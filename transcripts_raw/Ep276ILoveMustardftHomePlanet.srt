1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,640
- Okay, welcome everybody.

I'm cause to snipe everyone who leaves the video

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,880
before the end of it.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,360
World's biggest army is going on tour guys.

00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,820

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:48,520

00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:04,480
Somerville, kid. Chicago on April second at Shoebus. Shoebus. Day after April

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,000
Fools. I love that place. We are doing our first international show ever in

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,680
Toronto on April twelfth at the Garrison. We'll be back in Atlanta April

20
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,360

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Philomoka. You can get your tickets at swagpoop.com/shows, but if you're a

22
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,800
crazy type person who's listening to this right when it comes out, the tickets

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,000
be up until noon. So if you're going to complain about it, complain to Alex.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Alex Forrest.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,240
He will handle all complaints about tickets.

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,240
Uh-huh. I'll take care of it.

27
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
And related issues.

28
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,240
I'll do it so good.

29
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,840
So imagine, if you went to our first live shows, right? Now imagine that with six guys

30
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,440
and it's not anything like our first live shows and it's sketch comedy.

31
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,440
It's somewhat like it.

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,440
I would say it's not anything like it.

33
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,440
It's not any, imagine it's a show.

34
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,320
We're new now, we'll enjoy it. I think Patrick's trying to get you not to come.

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,120
I think imagine it's like the second half of our live shows that we did.

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,020
Basically that don't imagine that just imagine a fun time out with your

37
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,920
friends. You're going to go with your no, I think that it's kind of similar

38
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,020
as a new video out to which is on Instagram and YouTube and everywhere.

39
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,620
So go and you know, if your city's not on that list, just get a better

40
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,720
city, get a better city. Keep your ear to the ground, especially in La La.

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,520
Fuck you.

42
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,820
La is not happening.

43
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,620
We're never going to go.

44
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:26,640
it's too scary. Unless you're a venue that wants to fly us out or something

45
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,380
pay for us. I think is obsessed with the idea that somehow a venue in La is

46
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,120
going to fly us out to do a show. I think they're going to fly us out like

47
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,000
a like we are instagram models and they are a prince in Dubai. If this episode

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,580
goes viral, it could it has a pretty good chance. It could go viral. We

49
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,560
should make an La only episode. Yeah, only releases in an hour. It's an hour.

50
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,220
It's an hour of us just going to

51
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,820
one. We had a lot of that's way too close beach episode. I think I think we did a

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,660
beach episode.

53
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,580
I don't know if we did a

54
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,220
think that you're. I think that you're stealing from our past catalog beach. We

55
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,680
did. I don't think we'd a beach episode. You recorded on the beach. No, we did an

56
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,040
episode about the beach. When did we do an episode about the beach? We definitely

57
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,780
did an episode about the beach. If we haven't done an episode about the beach,

58
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:20,420
Lord strike me down right now as I stand.

59
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,620
Wow he's asking for it doesn't work when you're indoors man. God can't see

60
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,260
God. God can make this. You can't see you can only see you if you're walking

61
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,300
around outside like Google map. God can make the wall behind me fall forward or

62
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,900
make maybe no didn't get electrocuted could have got electrocuted. He wouldn't

63
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,620
make the wall behind you fall forward because it would kill me and Alex and

64
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,220
Joe. Yeah, beautiful God fearing yeah, we didn't noted that's why the capital

65
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,540
building the it looks like that because it's to protect because they're doing

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,400
evil stuff inside and so it's to stop God pricks his finger when he tries to

67
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:54,820
reach

68
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,600
there inside. God looks down at the Capitol building and he thinks it's a

69
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,380
giant boob. Yeah, and he gets a

70
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,640
it stabs him and then he

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,500
jacks off with his blood. And the devil, I don't know what else to tell you. The

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,800
devil celebrates. So many state buildings in this country are

73
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:18,120
pointy like that because the Washington Memorial. God boobie. Yeah, that's a

74
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,180
dick and that's well that one's also very pointy. He could maybe stab his

75
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,120
entire hand on that and you know they do all types of evil stuff inside there.

76
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, all the politicians get together

77
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,980
dance around. They have their dance parties inside. Inside there's like a

78
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,020
hundred floors that two people can fit on.

79
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,980
They're all playing beer pong against each other. That's where beer pong was

80
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,340
invented. Actually, it's in DC in the Washington. Be careful with that.

81
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,740
we have a toy on the desk today. I brought a toy over with me and I brought

82
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,700
the shades. I just like to have my hands on things yeah. I feel that times yeah.

83
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,340
I get that you yeah, we know man

84
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,580
yeah, yeah,

85
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:02,780
we should have got him a fidget cube or something, because I know he's going to

86
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,840
be messing about and need a cube. Yeah, he needs a cube. Well guys, what the

87
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,320
hell is up? What's the gossip? What's the tea? What is the deal with you guys

88
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,000
tomorrow. Clancy gets his my dog gets his first brother heart.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,180
My brother dog gets his first heartworm shot. Well, they have to they have to

90
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,420
stab him through his back into his heart. Whoa! Super long needle and that's what

91
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,720
you guys are here to plug. Yeah, well, don't do the whole thing. We'll say

92
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,760
all right, all right, all right, all right, they stab him with a knife to

93
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,200
like open him up. Yeah, it's really brutal. It's like to see what's inside

94
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,840
the Nick. They're just doing like experimental. What's the Nick? That's

95
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,200
Clive Owen. Oh, and Harry Potter? No. Isn't Harry Potter on that? No, no,

96
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:51,040
you're thinking of like Frankenstein's assistant or something. You're thinking

97
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,720
of Harry Potter. I'm thinking of Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe and John

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Ham were in a weird show on BBC. Oh, okay. Which I only saw posters for.

99
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,920
But then Clive Owen was on Showtime. Yeah, it was on one of those premium

100
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,840
shows. I've never seen it. It's really good. I've never seen it either. It's

101
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,540
you see it either. All the medicine and they like to like fuck. I use long

102
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:09,800
need.

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,720
How do you going to do when you show up to you? I'll go like this to the vet

104
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,920
with Clancy and it's a guy from dead space. Yeah, so one with he has a long

105
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,200
ass needle and he's wearing like he doesn't know dead space. We don't know

106
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,680
the Nick can imagine dead. That's the best. This is the

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,000
divide in the table. It's like a scary

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,240
spider and a dead space spider enemy. This is going to be the vet. When you

109
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,460
the vet. Oh dear, the vet is a big spider.

110
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:42,540
Well, who knows an animal better than a spider? That's true yeah. I would know

111
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:46,560
oh and even more so who know the inside of an animal's body better than a

112
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,460
spider. A spider could have been the thing that gave him heartworm in the

113
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,080
first place. Yeah, really imagine you come home heartworms, old mosquitoes do

114
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,060
so. I assume it's a type of spider, kind of kind of web, spidery type of thing.

115
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,300
Imagine you came home one day and you just saw clancy on the wall and a big

116
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,140
spider web.

117
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,000
like

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,640
I would be very I'd be scared, but

119
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:16,640
I would take a picture first. I'd be pretty cute. He was I should have had an

120
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,300
enemy of the worm. The worm is it would have been too easy for him to be

121
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,640
because he could have just webbed him up yeah about all next issue

122
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,420
put him in a web man. Why did you just swear around? I do like how like it

123
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,260
Spiderman's just lacking right now. Just web him up, come on, swing towards them

124
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,580
and then wipe him. I thought the new Spiderman movie was so stupid because

125
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,840
he should have just webbed up. I probably yeah could have literally

126
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,500
been five minutes long. He would I green goblet. If I was through a portal web

127
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,360
yeah, if I were Spiderman, I would have webbed up Zendaya right away.

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,680
It was so good, got a lot of Zendaya. It is funny that I would have webbed

129
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,800
Zendaya and the friend, every single one of Spiderman's like villains.

130
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,000
If they are impervious to web, the only thing that that makes them impervious to

131
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,680
webs is being bigger than him.

132
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,040
Why rhino and that's the only one I can think of right now. Here's a man,

133
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,620
here's a funny little turn into sand, turn big turn to water. What about the

134
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,840
little kid? Here's a funny thing, a little kid, a little kid, his arch

135
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,340
nemesis.

136
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:19,080
You guys didn't read those issues. Yeah, so I read all the old Spider Man

137
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,000
comics and something funny is that Spider Man's like main one of his main

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,840
attacks. He does on every single villain, every single issue as he shoots webs

139
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,000
into their eyes and they go

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
no

141
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,540
and then there's at one point it's probably like you know, like sixty

142
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,300
issues in so like five years into spider man's run and doctor octopus is

143
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,940
like he's fighting doctor octopus and he shoots web at his eyes and it is like

144
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,460
any no doctor. Octopus has those glasses yeah and the web falls off the glasses

145
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,820
and doctor. Whoa! I invented glasses that can't be way

146
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:55,560
like bro and vent a whole suit yeah, yeah, the glasses it took you years.

147
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,220
you'd think a scientist would be like up on that right away. Isn't he a doctor?

148
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,660
Yeah, he's a he's a mad. Oh yeah, you think he's a doctor crazy. He's a doctor.

149
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:06,580
He's not a scientist. Developing tentacles. He's a doctor who does a

150
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,180
mass. I

151
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:11,460
know he's a doctor, because those are those are prosthetics. You can be a

152
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,980
doctor of he's a he's a pediatrician. Yeah,

153
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,860
it's a lot of that's why his enemy is spider man, because spider man's a kid.

154
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,020
He's a teenager. Yeah, he had strep throat and you went to the pediatrician

155
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,220
and then he's trying to get some areas on May at the beginning of the comic

156
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:28,580
really

157
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,780
spider man step uncle really

158
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,740
duck on

159
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,380
dock on

160
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,620
on

161
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:43,860
how are you on

162
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,980
you can't be calling your uncle that you can't be

163
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,280
If you're watching or listening, that's the new challenge. Call your uncle cock.

164
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,800
Yeah, recorded on video.

165
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,800
See what his reaction is and send it to him.

166
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,400
It's a new Jimmy Kimmel, like I stole your Halloween gift.

167
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Cock.

168
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
Hey, cock.

169
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Cock.

170
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Hey, cock.

171
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,400
Hey.

172
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,400
What the fuck did you just call me?

173
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Oh, come on. Is this the new cock challenge?

174
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
Oh, come on.

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
Is this going on Jimmy Kimmel?

176
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Hi, Jimmy. Hi.

177
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,440
like a guy who the uncle start reacting like the kids who got their Halloween

178
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:22,800
to

179
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:28,080
you have anything to say to Jimmy Kim. Oh no,

180
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,800
no, no, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel told me to call you that

181
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:36,760
it's going to go viral. I'm telling you that we Jimmy Kimmel challenge. Take

182
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,800
your uncle cigarettes,

183
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,800
threw cigarettes. I threw all your smokes

184
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,720
just

185
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,200
got those for me. I like cigarettes. I got those on Halloween,

186
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,160
and then you're like not as Guillermo told me to and then yeah. What is up

187
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,320
with Guillermo these days? I don't even know what he's just doing red carpet

188
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,120
stuff right. He's chilling. He's sold out. Yeah, he's sold out.

189
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,720
He's still there. Yeah.

190
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:12,720
How do you know? Because Gus. Oh yeah. Guillermo really liked Gus. Yeah, yeah.

191
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,400
little inside industry secret. It's cool. If you know, I don't think you can

192
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:24,400
be old and you know Gus. Whoa, damn flow. Yeah. If you know us and you know Gus,

193
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,340
then we're gonna get Guillermo on the bus

194
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:35,520
and would go and get a get on the set of rust and stop the gun. Gonna have some

195
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:35,880
fun

196
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,960
that so that what I just did there was called lyrical storytelling,

197
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,440
kind of create a world. How are you guys here in a stop the old when yeah let's

198
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,280
all the way rust. Let's your take on more like but Baldwin, but when, but

199
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,880
when I'm in a place where a kind of

200
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,480
I kind of think Alec Baldwin can do no wrong for me. I for good. I gave him

201
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,320
yeah months and months. He's too good. I gave him the day after he did it. Yeah,

202
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,920
so good. I forgave him before he did it. As soon as it came out, I was on his

203
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,280
side. I didn't even need to know what did she do? She probably yelled at

204
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:18,120
yeah, not knowing it was an accident.

205
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:29,540
He was filming him. He probably was shy. He probably thought he was shooting. He

206
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,060
was on going to be on Jimmy Kimmel because of it was a challenge. Don't

207
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:35,580
shoot.

208
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:41,120
I mean I'm happy for him. You know, keep doing your thing boy. He's like ten

209
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,620
he's

210
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,880
you see all the footage that like the they leaked or whatever the footage of

211
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,320
him on set like before it happened now where it's like it's like footage.

212
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,320
They're like we think this footage was leaked by the defense, because it's all

213
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
footage of him on set and he's just go like he's going up to different actors

214
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,720
and he's he's literally like going up to people that he's working with and being

215
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,680
like like I just want to make sure that on this movie set, nobody ever gets

216
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,200
hurt

217
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,280
and like someone trips and falls,

218
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,000
he's like, "Oh my God, are you okay?

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,080
"The last thing I would ever want on a movie set

220
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,320
"is for someone to be injured.

221
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
"No, we need to end this shoot now.

222
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,840
"If you're tired, we need to stop

223
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,800
"so you don't exhaust yourself and get injured."

224
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,440
There's a bunch of videos of him just doing that

225
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,840
on set, and then the next day he killed somebody.

226
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
(laughing)

227
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,680
- Crazy.

228
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,640
- It was premeditated. - So karmically insane.

229
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,000
- Dude, it was premeditated.

230
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,840
- He went back, he got a time machine,

231
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:36,200
went back in time, and he didn't fix the gun

232
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,400
'cause he wanted to kill that lady.

233
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,320
why hasn't that been explored yet that time travel might be involved.

234
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,640
I like every every crime ever that should be the if I was an attorney,

235
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:53,760
do we not consider at least okay, we've been through like two or three

236
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,600
possible explanations. We heard the suspect talky. I mean he's convincing.

237
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,940
I believe he may not have done it, so now might be the time to think about a

238
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:06,000
time machine. I just want to rule out time travel at the beginning, and then

239
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,740
I can move for your honor. Look at that necklace. Doesn't it look suspiciously

240
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:16,120
like the time Turner from Harry Potter? This could be time travel. That's that

241
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,800
could work. If the person was wearing the time Turner, if they were wearing the

242
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
time Turner or they could be like look at that necklace. It looks like it's

243
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,080
from the past. Oh yeah, this looks as the sixteen hundreds necklace. There's no

244
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:30,880
other owes this man is a not the time. Yeah, and I think he's a not see and

245
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,300
then you kind of flip the yeah. If I start, if I start killing people, I'm

246
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,900
put scarab beetle charms on them and be like there's no way this

247
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,820
person

248
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,220
to court in like old victorian clothing.

249
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:54,740
I have no idea how I've become gotten here. I'm not from this time. You like

250
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,140
say that and then no one reacts and then you just like pull out your phone

251
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
or whatever. I'm actually from the future.

252
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,920
I start dressing like Victoria's again. I am an android. It comes back in style.

253
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,320
It that could come back and it is check out the lighting, check out the lining

254
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,960
and it's just got like another phone

255
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:19,480
made of phones. Yeah, I think made of phones is going to be the I can't

256
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,480
fucking wait. But in Tron like Tron, yeah, the clothing made of phones and

257
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,280
Tron is made out of electric made of lights. Well, those are not clothing,

258
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,020
but that's computer. If you think about it, phones are just lights. I mean this

259
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,000
shirt kind of looks like an app a little

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,060
how

261
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:40,240
yeah, no, like you click the different ones. I can click it. This is kind of

262
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,640
like three colors. It's kind of like a game. You can play a runner.

263
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,400
You need to play an app so bad.

264
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:56,800
Sorry, I'm just playing your shirt.

265
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,120
yeah your shirt has. I can't get past the first level of your shirt. This is a

266
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,380
really hard when the shirt when the shirt unlocks or when I unlocked level

267
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,620
to the shirts going to come off

268
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,340
and then nipple nipple play. I feel like your outfit is thought would be fun to

269
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,460
play to play yeah. The Vietnam veterans reunion

270
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,320
is much

271
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,780
level one

272
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,760
I'm just kidding. Have they made a game yet that's kind of like one of those

273
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,900
artistically styled games where it's

274
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:34,500
mostly about like Pokemon three, like one of

275
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:38,160
those games that's mostly just about depression and

276
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,200
and living your life day to day, making breakfast and such that's about a

277
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,060
veteran and it's and they could call it call of duty. The aftermath. Well,

278
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,500
haven't they done that with its excellence? Wait a second that could

279
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,960
literally be and yes, I'm sure they actually have done yeah, but this could

280
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,240
actually be an incredible addition to the call of duty franchise where they

281
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,840
could have a whole other side of it and it will appeal to girls. The boys like

282
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,480
the war, the girls like the emotions and it'll or it could be like a game where

283
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,520
it's like based on the it's all the call of duty characters like ghost and all

284
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,600
the other ones that I don't know the names of so McTavish wives and homes and

285
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,160
their homes and there it's a savvy game. I was going to say and I have to like

286
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,920
find a date. Yeah,

287
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,920
date while their husband is gone yeah and then the husband, the husband,

288
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,320
every once in a while and it's like a video of him. He's like Hey, honey,

289
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,580
like

290
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:35,600
bombs and gunfire in the back yeah, that would be really cool and then you

291
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,840
could download like dlc's for like the different like dating, yeah

292
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:45,780
and then you kind of have like dating infused video games. Okay, you're you

293
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,680
are you are one of these wives. Okay, describe your perfect man

294
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,420
seven feet tall black as hell

295
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:58,860
can eat non stop,

296
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:05,860
but it doesn't bloat physically doesn't put on any weight skinny yeah very

297
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,320
skinny. Oh wow! Seven feet tall, skinny, real thin, black and

298
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,620
yeah so frozen. Oh God, I just described my dad

299
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:20,580
and paging Dr Freud.

300
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,080
seven

301
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,420
seven feet

302
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,940
over the opposite. I'm going for like I'd say like four foot six kind of

303
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:37,500
mutton shops, super lots of body hair all over braided beard as well. Orange

304
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,140
orange facial hair, oh yeah, black hair on head

305
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,740
helmet with one of those cross guards that comes down over the nose chain

306
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:52,900
male battle acts. It sounds like you're describing what's the the from Zelda. I

307
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,020
was describing Gimley.

308
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,500
I would say mine and

309
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:01,660
mine. I would say probably like one inch tall. I would say they're sour.

310
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,780
They're sweet. They're gone. I would say you're just a you're describing a

311
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,540
child yeah

312
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,620
your perfect man is a child. I just say what

313
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,340
I really miss my husband.

314
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,980
I just need it's so you're kind of willing to submit to the darker side of

315
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:19,980
desire. Yeah,

316
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,340
I just want a sour patch in my life man. Well, you can

317
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:28,940
grown on it's one thing. If your husband comes home from war and you've

318
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,100
been fucking some guy that lives across the street, we'll see this. He comes

319
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,420
home and he's mad in one way. He's kind of just he's mad because you're

320
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,460
cheating. He's mad about the disloyalty, but you can get you can kind of just

321
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:42,300
skip the whole romance angle of it. If you cheat on your husband with a kid,

322
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,980
he's going to send you to jail. He's not going to care much. I don't know this is

323
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,520
this is how I see it playing out. He's not going to feel so a masculine. I

324
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,120
thought you were going to say that he's going to be even angrier because he's

325
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,120
coming home catching you fucking a celebrity like the our patch. Have you

326
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,200
seen the sour patch commercials? It's he's going to come home. The sour patch

327
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,240
kid is going to be on top of me or whatever, like a terrible sour thing and

328
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,540
he's going to say, Oh my God, you for my gosh and then the sour patch kid is

329
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,140
going to give him like a

330
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,740
sour than their than their sweet and then we eat them. We eat them together

331
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,500
his husband's home and it doesn't matter. I want to eat him the sour patch yeah

332
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,640
and then he eats your okay perfect man as a military wife go.

333
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,360
My perfect man would be definitely

334
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:30,080
seven feet tall, black as hell. It's Alex's dad.

335
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,460
I kind of all this before boring yeah

336
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,560
- No, that's cool.

337
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,040
You and my dad would be a really cute couple, actually.

338
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,480
(laughing)

339
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,720
- I don't think I've ever met your dad.

340
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,480
We've lived together for three years.

341
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,840
I don't think I've ever met your parents.

342
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,560
- They've only visited once,

343
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,580
but they came when you were asleep in the apartment,

344
00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,280
and we had that fake gun in our old apartment

345
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,600
for a really long time. - RIP, it's broken.

346
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,540
- And it looks real.

347
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,940
Yeah, it was broken, but it looks real.

348
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,100
and my parents both came in and my dad like saw the gun

349
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,780
and like got like really nervous.

350
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,700
And I was like, no, no, it's a toy, it's fake.

351
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,520
And then he's like,

352
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,980
I'm just really uncomfortable with that being out.

353
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,100
Like, please put that away.

354
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,780
And then I was just being silly

355
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,580
and I like picked up the gun and like pointed it at my dad.

356
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,940
And he was like, stop, stop, please stop.

357
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,780
- And he's never visited you since.

358
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,100
- And he never came back.

359
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,580
He had a really bad time that trip.

360
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,560
He was also trying to like park the car.

361
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,580
We were going out to brunch and me and my mom, my sister

362
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,740
like went into the restaurant to eat and my sister like left, I think like her

363
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,280
phone in the car and so then like she went back to the car and my dad saw her

364
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:45,260
and I guess he like didn't know it was my sister, so he like ran away from her.

365
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:51,200
And he like, he like, you know, he's on edge. He is, yeah, he's got a lot going

366
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,220
on. He ran away from your sister. Yeah, he like hid, he ran around and like hid

367
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:03,160
on the other side of the car and they haven't been back yeah. I've met Alex's

368
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:08,100
dad like fifteen times yeah, they're very cool man yeah brag about fucking care. I

369
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,780
literally don't even want to meet him and I've met Patrick's parents a lot and

370
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,060
I've never met your parents well not going to happen. That's true. We went to

371
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:19,100
a restaurant with my parents once. I think your parents are here like every

372
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,900
week. Yeah, my parents come up here a lot. I don't know why supportive family,

373
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,740
yeah, a real strong family union yeah yeah you need

374
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,420
the doron yet

375
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:34,560
yeah. I think it's very funny that people in our parents generation, the

376
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,940
way that the people who aren't from New York, so Joe you can sit this one out,

377
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:42,820
but everyone has everyone had kind of I feel like a lot of a lot of people from

378
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,940
our parents generation and my parents, maybe not so much, but a little bit

379
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,300
definitely have the kind of like eighties New York. Oh, it on the

380
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,880
absolutely so fucking funny. It is it's insane. They literally think they'll be

381
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,900
like sitting in a restaurant that is like you know it's a brunch restaurant

382
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,900
with like like leaves and grass on the walls and like an eighteen dollar one

383
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,380
egg over easy on the menu and they'll think they're in a wasteland. Yeah,

384
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,500
just oh my God, yeah, it's crazy. Yeah, that made sense. When you watch the

385
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,060
news. My mom will just watch like whatever local news thing and she's like

386
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,400
be careful on the like they're pushing people into the tracks on the always

387
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,360
fine. So it has been crazy lately, though I saw a lady gets slapped in the

388
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,400
case. Okay, there was a serial slapper running up and down this train and

389
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,800
there was like I guess like because like we were trying to get like get this

390
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,240
lady off the train. She was a serial slapper did she was going up and down

391

392
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,120

But this dude, this dude kicked her off the train.

399
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,080
physically like he like stood up like he was like stood up like now this is my

401
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,840
woman in the chest off of the train.

402
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,120
Always the scariest shit when people they have that they get the vigilante

403
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,640
yeah when they see something going down that's like a that's iffy. But instead

00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,480
of like do instead of doing what you should do, which is be a cartoon. Hey,

your blow over

422
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,320
Oh,

423
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:42,520
more of the so yeah, I learned I learned that she was a serial slapper

424
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,820
because there's two women on the train who were on FaceTime with their friend

425
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:49,800
who were just going yeah. This lady's slapping bitches. It's crazy.

426
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,280
It's just like

427
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,060
not helping at all. How many people did you see her slap? I didn't see. I

428
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:01,540
just saw her get off the train and just slap the lady and then like me and

429
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:04,680
like this other dude like stood in front. We're just like stop stop and

430
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,740
and like the one dude jumped up and just kicked her in the chest. It was so

431
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,780
fucking weird.

432
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,420
That's crazy yeah kicker.

433
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:20,220
I can do it again. Check your pants on that one man.

434
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:25,820
That was a full wait

435
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,700
shitting your

436
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,120
my shit.

437
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,320
Okay, now

438
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,280
I heard it still sounded like a part again to me. I know that's why I made

439
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:37,760
those like

440
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:43,020
all that reaction. A good invention would be a shoe that sounds like a fart,

441
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,080
so you can so you can always far you can hide your no, no, no, look it was

442
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,880
my shoe yeah and then it for you have a first or you can just play it

443
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,200
on your phone parts, but I was playing it. I was needed to have I was

444
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,480
playing it on my phone yeah, now listen, it sounds exactly like that one. You

445
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,600
record all your farts beforehand. It's like the sleep app that records your

446
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,960
we use your a yeah you're sleeping it. It's a little watch style thing that you

447
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,520
put on your butt cheek and it records your it detects and records when

448
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,840
there's the volumes. You know it detects the transient of the fart. It stores in

449
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,440
a memory, so I was like Oh my God, did you just fart and you say no is my

450
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,540
pants, my pants make these weird noise. What you kind of tug on your pants and

451
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,520
it'll play it if you're talking and it's

452
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,320
it's called tugboat dot a I that's a great name for it funny tugboat, a I

453
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,760
tugboat dot a I know I didn't know it's my pants. I didn't fart. It was my

454
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,200
pants

455
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,480
my

456
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,840
my pants. I can do it as many times as you need and you're just pulling the

457
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,200
pants. Yeah,

458
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,200
I can't like the Todd Margaret ringtone. Oh, that's so funny and he keeps having

459
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,320
a fart. Yeah, I'm on a big Todd Margaret me to today. I've also been on it. I

460
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,880
I was I was showing my girlfriend the deaf signing thing. I'm crazy. Yeah, I've never

461
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,800
I still haven't seen season three, but doesn't he nuke North Korea or something

462
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:06,680
it's a little season two is spoiler Korea one, but that right guys are talking TV.

463
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,560
My TV nerd brain talking TV is to go over this, which you guys have a new movie.

464
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,640
Yeah, don't talk about the movie yet because I have a good segue that includes

465
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,120
a movie for the well, then speaking of well, we're like wait, wait, can we not

466
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:21,680
movies. No, speaking of movies, charge of it, it's my thing. I made it. I know

467
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,560
how long it is, but so back the fuck off mister or I'm going to kick you in the

468
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,480
chest like I just learned as possible and thus the villain was born.

469
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:35,260
See real life is like a comic book. Sometimes you have yellow yellow man

470
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:38,760
yellow mister swole. You said he said real life is like a comic book and you

471
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,180
said yep

472
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:45,400
no you're wearing you're wearing a lot of yellow to a lot. You're wearing

473
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:50,460
almost exclusively, barely any just a little, just a little, just throw on

474
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,660
some yellow. I call you, I

475
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,980
just throw on some yellow. I felt yellow today.

476
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:02,500
Yellow is a is a happy color. I call you Mr Lemonade. It's the color of

477
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,900
cowardice. I can't wear yellow too big too big yeah. You're too big to wear

478
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,700
you or yellow. I just want they go a big one. So when I was a kid, I was at

479
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,500
I was wearing a god as I was at a yellow shirt and I was at like a street fair

480
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,320
thing and there's a drown the cloud, you can't alone and he went you you big

so

483
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:27,700
yeah I was a little kid. Well, you know I will and that clown probably so Neil

484
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,700
yeah and he's dead now and Joe killed him. Oh my kill put him. I

485
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,420
diabetes. You can wear a type of yellow that doesn't look like a banana. Yeah, I

486
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,040
don't think anyone's going to call me banana. No, but they could call you

487
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:49,340
lemonade. Lemonade's fine. You darken that shit up. They could call you lemon

488
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,540
lemon zest mustard. Yeah, lemon zest. I call mustard lemon zest. It's a good

489
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,260
colonel mustard colonel mustard. Damn, I would love to be a colonel one day.

490
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:03,460
I'd love to be if I can follow my dreams. I do love mustard me too. I like spicy

491
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,980
mustard. I like different types of mustard as well. I like

492
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:12,380
mustard mustard, yellow, brown, pink. Oh my God, I love mustard.

493
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,860
Mustard.

494
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:29,980
So gravely, it's crazy.

495
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,560
different kinds of monster. I'm imagining hearing this voice, hearing

496
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,660
this voice saying you getting this, you had a call. I was gonna say I

497
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,980
wouldn't know when you pull up to the

498
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,840
getting

499
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:51,020
my scenarios. You imagine being a ketchup lover and yeah, getting that

500
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,460
mustard.

501
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,140
My scenario is you pull up to the McDonald's, you pull up to the

502
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,740
McDonald's drive through, you say, Hey, yeah, can I get

503
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,940
burger and I'll get some ketchup on it and you know it all gets a

504
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,700
mustard to

505
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,300
the speaker on the

506
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:11,140
yeah yeah. Okay, you want a big you want a big Mac yeah muster and some must

507
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,740
muster

508
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,620
this is the this is the cashier who's yeah. I can to you through the speaker

509
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,380
and I'm actually pretty funny. I guess I'm playing the guy in the restaurant.

510
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:22,740
Okay, cool you so just get ready for your big your big moment because it's

511
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:26,060
coming. Okay, but it was very funny for that to happen for

512
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:30,500
for someone for you. Pull out you pull up to the to the drive through and

513
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:34,100
you're saying like yeah. I want a burger and then say oh yeah. I bet you do want

514
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:37,780
over girl and you pull it they're like okay next one. Don't you pull up and

515
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,280
it's just the guy you just there

516
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,600
very cheap, but you're like sorry about that

517
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,060
the wind

518
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:48,220
forgot about trying to prank you. I forgot how the word got about this part

519
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,380
of it. I'm new here. I forgot you were going to see me. It's my first day on

520
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,740
the job yeah, he's like

521
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,500
he ducks down really quick and then he throws the bag in the car like a

522
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:03,920
grenade

523
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,520
restaurant is like

524
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,120
and then the guy in the restaurant is like

525
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:16,320
this is so much better than the McDonald's in the paris.

526
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,960
It's all about

527
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,620
developing a

528
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:28,720
yeah. You learn a lot about that guy in that one line yeah, it's kind of

529
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:34,360
everything you need to know. I wish my daughter was a food fan. Oh, that's

530
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,360
good. I wish my daughter was here. I wish my friend. It's been five long

531
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,600
years and then the daughters in France cut to the daughter in France to the

532
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,800
diner and she's going for

533
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:49,440
I don't see my father anymore because he moved and he hasn't been here in five

534
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,040
years. So you think you think that he's talking. You think that he's lost his

535
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,800
daughter, but no she just her dad moved and he can't get back in. That's good.

536
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,780
that's he's stuck in McDonald's, but he does like it yeah. It's like terminal.

537
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,940
He likes it better than the one in Paris. We know a lot about him. That's

538
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,500
why he went like terminal, but McDonald's yeah and get this and he

539
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:09,920
just doesn't

540
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,240
a mountain doors. You say you can communicate more information by the

541
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,800
character. Even beyond the lines you hear those lines. You think oh, I know

542
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:22,100
okay for one is French. I know he's at McDonald's. I know he's enjoying his

543
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,020
food and he's enjoying it more than the food in Paris and get this. Then you

544
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:29,700
you hear the line, you open your eyes, you see he's wearing a police officer. Oh

545
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,100
my God,

546
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,580
he's a police officer, he's a police officer story telling and he's

547
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:36,580
environmental. He's living in the McDonald's and the McDonald's manager

548
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:39,620
like in terminal. They keep opening the doors and being like just walk out the

549
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:44,220
front door. All you need to do just walk out the front door and he refuses yeah

550
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,420
too good and he's he's wearing a sandwich board that says I'm a fan of

551
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:54,020
books. What's a sandwich board? Oh double side yeah world is nine. I'm a

552
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,260
fan of books and then the back side says, but I'm also a liar.

553
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:02,260
That's actually great because it establishes he not only is he not a fan

554
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,100
of books or if is he could be one. You think he is trustworthy yeah,

555
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,320
I'm a I will narrate it. There you go had been narrating the story. These are

556
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,040
all things that are perfect in a script to France. His daughter's nowhere to be

557
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,740
found. She doesn't she doesn't last cut. She is a memory. She moved out of the

558
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,380
frame. What you and then he takes that as well. He takes out his wallet. He

559
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,060
hope he pulls out his ID Indiana. Well, his name is Indiana Jones. His name is

560
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:30,660
Indiana Jones name is yes. First name is Indiana. He's from Ecuador

561
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,700
Ecuador. I that's not funny.

562
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:40,180
Chill on that chill on that we got a lot of Ecuadorian listen that we already

563
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,980
saw where she was saying that she doesn't see her dad anymore and then

564
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,180
she's still saying this stuff and then suddenly you hear cut. Okay, that was

565
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:50,740
terrible. Let's try it again with a different accent. She doesn't even

566
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,580
isn't even related to the last part. She's in a different movie in a

567
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:56,980
different movie yeah about a girl with a father. Yes,

568
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,920
oh my God,

569
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,820
a great movie, but then one day she goes to McDonald's

570
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:06,340
that's in Perry in America and

571
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,620
yeah

572
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:13,420
question mark on this is perfect movie writing. That's the next okay. This

thing I know about film makers, they're always hard at work on the next on the

596
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,860
next project. So I've prepared a little presentation here for us where I found

597
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:04,060
some movie ideas from this blog that I found.

598
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:10,420
So hopefully the maybe these will give you some inspirations for your next

599
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,340
movie and maybe you can. We can discuss some of these and maybe you can end up

600
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,820
confusing one. If you even want to that's interesting, so this is a blog

601
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:20,180
post I found from I don't remember the name of the blog. It's just a random

602
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,340
blog. It's from the twenty ninth of February on twenty twelve, so it's from

603
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:28,260
a leap day. That's interesting, scary, and this is

604
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:33,860
this is a post that says I need movie ideas and then all the text is in

605
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,940
rainbow colors and it says anyone have any movie ideas. I haven't been making

606
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:43,020
movies in a while and I and like I'm short of money. My friend is suggesting

607
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,620
making a rude movie, but I don't like the idea of being reported for making

608
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:51,440
unsuitable movies. How about I get a animation of like being a ghost and I

609
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,000
could make a scary movie is the animation VIP. I don't think it is I'll

610
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,800
check it out. My ideas scary friendship make a random movie mail me your

611
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,720
thoughts by and this is from rose one three three one, and this is from the

612
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:10,100
director. Can we figure out where one three three one two is it goes positive

613
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,740
this is a child Joe yeah Joe. What the hell are you? I'm trying to get you on

614
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:15,660
today. Oh my God,

615
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:21,780
what was this posted on a blog spot blog spot? I think that's a road press.

616
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,060
Maybe that's a Rwanda

617
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,660
okay

618
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,300
cool. So here's the first movie idea that was posted.

619
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:36,020
This says my English, my English English, which is bad. I'm German, maybe

620
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:42,140
the girl and her BFF are falling in love, both in the same boy from the BFF are

621
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,840
now not BFFs more. They argue and makes strach. I don't know the word in

622
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,380
English

623
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:53,740
race on of the girls landing in the hospital and they are BFFs again. Sorry

624
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,620
for my English. I think strike

625
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:59,780
maybe that's straight. That's the character's fighting. That's the

626
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,500
character's name. I would believe it means fighting. They make they argue and

627
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:06,280
they are you and make and then that's like a response from my missus money

628
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,420
penny says that's an awesome idea. So what do you guys think about this idea?

629
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,360
I mean so girl and her best friend forever are falling in love with the

630
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,400
same boy, both with in the same in the same boy from the boy best friend

631
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,840
forever are now not oh so they're not best friends anymore. They argue and

632
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,600
they fight. They make fight, they makes fight

633
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:29,440
and then the girl lands in the hospital, and then their best friends again. It

634
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,800
mean strike. I mean go on strike, so they go on strike. So it's like a union

635
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,020
movie yeah right. It's like blue collar Jimmy Hoffa, how to blow up a pipeline

636
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:42,280
and the boy they're falling in love with. It's like the same because it's is the

637
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,680
president of the union yeah and they're sharing it because it's sharing the

638
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,520
wealth. So there's actually a lot of subtext going on okay.

639
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:54,240
This is why I'm always glad to have film analysts. Yeah, I cast well and really

640
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,520
get to the deeper. The thing that's really striking to me is that this

641
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:02,200
comment was made a year after the post went up and then this was like five

642
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:06,840
months later. Yeah there's been all through time. This post has lived on for

643
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,980
a long period of time. You can if you can find this post comment your ideas.

644
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,280
What would you name this movie?

645
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:18,640
I would name it stretch. I think stretch makes the strike. It's strike a strike.

646
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,160
Strike. I like strike. I would call it right if it was called strike. I would

647
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,220
it was an X men thing yeah yeah as of strike. I mean it could be all we could

648
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:27,560
all

649
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,400
X men. I've it's really be on board if it's road

650
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,620
rogue, I lock I was thinking store, Rogan, Cylock yeah, Rogan storm. Are

651
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:41,820
they friends? Are they BFFs Patrick? They I don't think they're BFFs, but I

652
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,960
know they interact who's rogues BFF rogues BFF

653
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,040
or gambit has to be female in the movies. Yeah, her boyfriend is gambit in

654
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:56,580
the car, so maybe rogues or the cartoons, but it's ice man, ice man, BFF is

655
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,500
probably, I mean just going off of the animated series, it's probably Jubilee or

656
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:04,420
somebody, oh right, or maybe it's

657
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,620
in loop. I think I know it's loop. That's numb, yeah, yeah, this is an elephant and

658
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:14,820
an animal, yeah, that's loop a rogue and loop a and they both love wolverine. That

659
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,940
seems like and strikers. This is a perfect, this is how we bring back the

660
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:24,020
MCU yeah yeah Indy Indy emotional character, Mogan's Kang you don't even

661
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,700
you don't wait. What are we going to guys?

662
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:29,560
What are we going to do about Kang? They should make a whole movie that's

663
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,400
about Kang the search for me

664
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,820
into a white guy.

665
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,580
It's like the

666
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:41,320
yeah, he gets like someone kidnaps him and injects him with like glowing like

667
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,120
purple like

668
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,540
chemical and he starts turning white.

669
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,420
I've seen of a mutating into a little white guy into Liam Schreiber yeah be

670
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,960
awesome. They wouldn't use him because he's already Saber to and then all the

671
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,160
and then all the the MCU, the Avengers are like okay now he's really evil yeah,

672
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,680
because he's white, he's white man. Now he's a white verse guy. Wasn't he

673
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,640
purple in the movie

674
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:07,660
purple? I think of Thanos actually didn't see him in any. I didn't see any

675
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,740
of the things I had to stop watching those. I don't think he's purple, though

676
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,580
I've been watching the I lived with them baby. I watch the X men. They are

677
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:20,120
here's the here's the next the next reply. I put up here and this one I

678
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,620
might share privately, but believe it's better than the strain and several

679
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:28,260
others that I okay. What's the strain? The strain was a show on FX and this

680
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:31,680
idea is a secret idea that is not shared, but it's better than the strain

681
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,540
better than the strain. Oh, they don't I see okay. So this is yeah, this is

682
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:39,300
a separate country. I hate all the this gate keeping in a hollywood this next

683
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:42,880
idea. I think this one is going to be perfect for you guys for the next home

684
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,880
planet short film great next one. It says okay, here is my option, the runaway

685
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:52,280
well a story about a little girl about six to seven called Danny. Her father

686
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,320
tried to kill her mother, but her mother managed to run away, so her father had

687
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:58,280
to look after her. He tried hunting the mother down, but never managed to find

688
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,460
her. Then one day, when Danny had grew up into a teenager, fifteen, her father

689
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,180
started abusing her and she couldn't take it anymore. She knew her father

690
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,920
cared for her, but he just kept up the abuse and soon she got sick of it. She

691
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,360
and her father had a row and he aimed at her physically hurting her.

692
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,400
She threw her in the cellar and went out to calm down.

693
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,200
Now Danny was mad.

694
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,940
She tried opening the staircase out, but he had locked it from the other side.

695
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:17,940
So she tried the window.

696
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,880
She had managed to get her hand through, but not her body.

697
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,840
Then she realized she had her mobile in her pocket.

698
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,940
So she clambers and pulls it out and dials 911.

699
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,840
When they answered the phone, her dad was already home and coming closer

700
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,580
to the cellar, Danny started worrying and screamed down the phone.

701
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,140
Help me.

702
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,800
The police were now asking her questions.

703
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,280
She quickly told the address and straight.

704
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,500
She managed to put her phone away before her father got to her.

705
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:39,300
He opened the cellar door and shouted her to come out.

706
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,960
so she did then she then heard police cars pulling up. Her father was

707
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:46,440
staring at her this at this point. He started screaming at her and telling

708
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,680
her to make them go away, but she refused the police were soon or

709
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,600
were soon knocking on the door and asking for it to be answered.

710
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,780
Her father went to the door and three minutes later was taken to prison and

711
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,440
Danny was free. Two years later, Danny had found her mother and had her

712
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,360
husband and two children. They were rich and her father was given seven

713
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:05,760
years.

714
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,600
I hate when they give the plot away the whole movie in the log line. I know in

715
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:15,960
these trailers, I know this on the tag line on the poster.

716
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:22,580
So do you guys think this is a good fit for for home planet for yeah? Do you

717
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:26,640
think that you and the runaway you guys could do this? Yeah, I'm thinking Neil

718
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,040
Lenski is Danny yeah

719
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,680
Patrick Doran as the father. Totally

720
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:36,780
I reject the role. I'm busy. I think one of the best parts of this idea is that

721
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,240
the the police and knocking on the door and they were also asking for it to be

722
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,080
yeah. Can this please be answered

723
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,280
please

724
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,860
be answered already,

725
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,820
but there's deep themes in this about daughterhood yeah. It also feels like

726
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:54,640
running away. We're missing a lot. There's a lot of stuff to fill in. You

727
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,160
know we can really learn a lot about what is that

728
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,260
what's happened. You just do I was trying to skirt it like a

729
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,160
squeeze the water into your face.

730
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,680
that's classic

731
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,800
like what's happening in these two years right and also like what does the

732
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,320
basement look like? What color is the door? How many police officers are

733
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,520
there and how many are asking please? Hey man, please right is it one with a

734
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:25,480
carpet yeah and or is it just one that's bare or bare stone floor with a

735
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,960
rowing machine? A finished basement reads a lot. Is there a rowing machine

736
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,720
could be a wrong machine for her to erg in those years? She's in the cellar.

737
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,200
is there is there a treadmill there's so much there's so much time to that's not

738
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,720
filled in like, for example, what happens in the three minutes between the dad

739
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,960
being at home and being in prison yeah yeah that that could be a spin off

740
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,000
called the three men. It's the three minutes. That's the world's fastest

741
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,580
court case that can be the Pixar

742
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:59,600
yeah seven years in prison, but only seven years. There's something

743
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,520
interesting about it being a like a beautiful finished basement and it's

744
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,520
like how long do you have to be trapped in a finished basement, which is like

745
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,260
the best place you could be yeah for it to become your own with a mini fridge

746
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:13,540
stocked with food, exact fridge food oven down there as well a tv and like

747
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,080
some games, maybe a freezer that has all the frozen food from Costco,

748
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:22,640
futon. I love it. We could even maybe go a step further and create like a cgi

749
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,000
world of the basement. Oh, it's a terabithia yeah, where she's a wonderland

750
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,020
Tim Burton style world exact and that can kind of be where like the real meat

751
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,420
of the movie is yeah she's coming up with all these different things that like

752
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,240
this, like this

753
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,300
couch cushion is cash, but also this stuff is it's real. It's really

754
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:45,540
happening right is a magic couch cushion. Yes, yeah, it's you think that

755
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,560
it's bridge to terabithia and she's creating a magical world just because

756
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,400
her father tried to kill her mother who escaped and then tried to yell at her,

757
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:57,100
but actually they're the plot twist at the end. It's all revealed as magic like

758
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,020
at the end of father, the end of labyrinth, the police come take her dad

759
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,060
away and they're like how did you survive in that basement? You must have had to

760
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:06,800
create an imaginary world or something and she's like yeah. I guess I did that

761
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,420
over her shoulder. Does that happen to the couch couch? Kill she

762
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:17,140
what's up your bested cops because the couch is got a cigar hanging out of his

763
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:18,060
mouth. I'm

764
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:23,500
pushing and in the pillows and I learned how to roll my own cigars down in his

765
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,220
basement.

766
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:29,740
It's a good idea yeah, and then the pillow can sing yeah song. Maybe when

767
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:39,020
you're a couch, you're a couch, everybody sits on you. Nobody listens to a couch

768
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:39,760
cushion

769
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:46,140
that's fire. That's pretty good. I like that okay, here's the next here's the

770
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:51,260
next post on here. These ideas are fine, but way too long and complicated. Also

771
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:56,240
all of the drug slash abuse phrases will he and then a bunch of pound signs out

772
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:02,360
people won't watch long movies over about one minute. How about doing a family

773
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:06,080
series as they always get lots of views? You could do a royal family, poor family,

774
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,220
celebrity family, chav family. It's I like chav family. What if one child is a

775
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,540
breakaway and it's completely different to the rest message me if you use this?

776
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,940
I love the idea of a chav family where one child is a breakaway yeah posh child

777
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:23,220
of a chav family, the prince, the prince, the little prince, the little print

778
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,240
called the little prince. Yeah, the little prince. I don't want to be a chav. Yeah, yeah.

779
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:32,120
You gotta fucking smoke a cigarette right now. No, I'd rather sit on a pillow. You better

780
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:37,400
not sit in a fucking pillow. And then it could kind of be like a game of thrones, sort of

781
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:42,680
like family power struggle. And there can be a war that the prince can start. And then

782
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:47,040
the mom starts to become a little bit more posh. And the husband is like, you hanging

783
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,460
hanging out with your fucking son again yeah.

784
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:58,240
I told you to never see him again. I told you not to fucking talk down in

785
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:04,240
room. Don't you dare to you don't see him. You don't even fucking talk to him

786
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,800
about posh living. We're chavs. We've always been chavs. I'll say it is

787
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,040
getting what to be posh.

788
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:16,040
It's giving you never be push. It's giving Kingsman vibes really and he wears

789
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:21,600
posh in that I thought he's a chav. He starts wearing suits and that I think

790
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:25,680
makes him kind of doesn't want to be posh, though he'd want he's kind of like

791
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,240
a chav agent. He still wears a flat brim. See I try to not really think about the

792
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,200
Brits too much in general, so I'm not super sure on the you know the meanings

793
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,200
of all the chav and posh and stuff. I just have seen Kingsman. We will take it

794
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:42,240
a step further. What what was Kingsman too afraid to do? We will do it

795
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,940
kill an actor for real kill an actor. We will kill an actor

796
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:49,080
the one thing

797
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:53,160
the actor is actually kill kill this man

798
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:57,800
and you'd get a lot of a lot of buzz for that. You would get a huge a lot of

799
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:01,840
buzz. Bring it back certainly articles. I don't want you to see because the crow

800
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:06,500
already did it. The crow didn't did they market it like that? No, the crow yeah,

801
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,040
but that was their

802
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:13,800
marketing ploy Emerson alum yeah, Brandon Lee, really yeah, well,

803
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,680
Yeah, I think he was my professor wonder. I've always felt so connected to him. I

804
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:22,040
saw his ghost at Emerson campus. Really yeah, that's crazy. Where'd you see

805
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,300
just like

806
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:28,120
he was making a sand. He looks so different.

807
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,700
He's standing next to that statue. It's like you see like like for like at the

808
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:38,580
end of return to the Jedi. It's like Norman Lear, Brandon Lee. They're all

809
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,480
sitting at the end of the cafeteria, watching you eat lunch like yeah.

810
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:46,680
here's something yeah every movie, also every movie where someone gets when an

811
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:50,500
actor gets killed making the movie, the actor is never here's the other way we

812
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,220
differ from the crow. The actor is never killed

813
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:58,800
during the last well and if they are it's anyway they're never killed during

814
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:03,160
the the very final scene to the very last thing they shoot and the final scene

815
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,940
of the movie, and if they do it's because they stop making the movie after

816
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,500
the person dies, but we need to set it up so that we film everything for the

817
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:12,580
entire movie, there's only the last scene left and then that's when the

818
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,080
actor is killed and then it's and it's like turning a perfect bow and if we do

819
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,240
exactly if we do right, it can be like like a two minute movie right

820
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,360
to go home early.

821
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:26,740
This first says nobody will watch a movie that's over a minute long, but

822
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:30,080
exactly because everybody you see these movies where people get died, making

823
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:34,040
them killed. I have to keep going and well it's always like you're watching

824
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:36,760
the movie and it's always like you know, like thirty minutes and you're like oh

825
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:40,400
that's the scene where somebody died. It's like this is too early in the you

826
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,600
have to save that yeah, because then it's also like you know the CGI scenes

827
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:47,400
are mixed in. They've got the body doubles. They've got whatever you know

828
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:51,320
what I mean. Have you seen the Imaginarium of Dr Parnassus? No, that's

829
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,920
he ledgers last movie. Yeah, he ledger died and then they gave they just like

830
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,040
made it a part of the movie that like he his character looks like three

831
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,440
different guys for the rest of it. Don Cheetle Terrence Howard

832
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:07,280
hands, though yeah. The classic one is the is the

833
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,600
the plan nine from outer space where oh yeah, Bella, go see died and they just

834
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:17,200
have the guy who yeah just do it. The top half of his face looks a little bit

835
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,380
like Bella. Let go see that's a way that's that's. We need to bring that

836
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:24,200
spirit back, so we kill him in the first minute and then the second minute. We

837
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,920
fill in a different guy to be that guy yeah. That's a good idea. We killed two

838
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,400
actors for this minute one. We kill the first one. We killed it's called the

839
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,120
man character. I was thinking the man, the character who kills the actor within

840
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,800
one minute. That's the name of the movie. I was thinking if you want to go

841
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,040
sleek, you go the man who died twice. It's like it's like

842
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,960
that's beautiful, but check this out. It's a role that's like the joker. We

843
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:50,560
say it's a role a thousand times more deadly than the joker. Oh, my God,

844
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,520
everyone who plays this role goes crazy and kills themselves within one minute

845
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,520
of playing the role and there's there's ninety different people playing the

846
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:01,560
the character in the movie, because every minute that they play the role, they

847
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:05,000
can't take it anymore. They slit their throat on cam. So I think we make we

848
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,080
make the two minute version. We get it on the festival circuit. We get funding

849
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,880
for the feature yeah and then it's ninety minutes and it's ninety actors

850
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:17,280
yeah. Exactly that was your he only dies ninety times. He only dies ninety times.

851
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:21,160
What was the joke that we were doing like a while ago? That's like the star

852
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:24,040
wars movie that's called ten thousand Jedi

853
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,840
it's like the first movie to have like yeah, the

854
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:30,980
the most Jedi

855
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:33,140
movie

856
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:41,400
episode eleven eleven

857
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:46,700
yeah, yeah, that's the rest of the star. You've never seen

858
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:52,840
the poster ten thousand. The poster is the thing where they do where that's

859
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,280
like the like like shoulders up of all the different actors faces, but there's

860
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:56,560
ten

861
00:53:56,560 --> 00:54:02,840
you can't see anyone's face. It looks like dots ten thousand Jedi to Sith. Oh

862
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,120
my God, there's come off. That's that should be the sequel. Come off suck off

863
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:07,440
on to

864
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,020
to

865
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:14,400
say come off it come off it. No, they're going to they're going to have a come

866
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,920
off. They're going to have a come off yeah ten thousand Jedi and to Sith come

867
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:23,140
yourself. Here's the next post. This is this is this is a this is a in one

868
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:23,900
here's the next one

869
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:28,860
number one. I'd like to see a movie about the Dallas Ewings as teenagers to

870
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:33,660
or the like to see it's a cast of a soap opera. Okay, two I'd like to see

871
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:36,940
an all black cast of song of the south with antagonist as northern middle

872
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,940
class family head and wife from sapelo island three. So much of remakes

873
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,620
Salem's lot for our time for would love to see a movie showing native

874
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,620
americans involvement in the slave trade and the different aspects of not

875
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,460
coming slavery to end fighting for the Confederacy, falling in love and

876
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:53,500
marrying slave children of all slaves, becoming chiefs and slaves and natives

877
00:54:53,500 --> 00:54:56,040
fighting as the federal government have more ideas. We'll stop here. We'll

878
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,300
waiting for Hamilton to come to the big screen

879
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,940
and then there's one reply to this this post that just says this is the only

880
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:05,380
reply that says you commented on my B day.

881
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:12,900
Wow, I love all those. These ideas are crazy. That's sick. A lot remake, not

882
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:17,040
that bad of an idea directed by the Feige brothers or the Russo

883
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,840
brother

884
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,240
they're revealed. That's that's the only way they're going to get people to come

885
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,800
back to this. We got another. We need a gentleman. We got another one. The

886
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,700
Marvel keynote where it's just like a

887
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,060
a guy wearing a little

888
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,720
smash bros challenge, a new challenge

889
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:38,820
Devin Feige

890
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,920
because of ways yeah up y'all all right here's another idea. So maybe there is

891
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,000
dekta of girl. Her partner is a guy they get on to this big case in New York,

892
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,720
making so many friends along the way and falling in love, but then she finds out

893
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:57,760
her partner is to killer really isn't it. What still loves him, but he really

894
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,480
isn't the killer. She thinks he is, but she finds out that he is, but he is, but

895
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,520
she finds out she finds out, but he isn't. I would say this is this is not

896
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,280
too dissimilar from a lot of ideas that I have yeah. This is the most home planet

897
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,120
one so far yeah. What about this one? This seems very home planet to me.

898
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:15,020
Here's this one. Hmm make it something about a popular girl being transformed

899
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:18,340
into a wear girl. Then she kills people because they don't believe her. Then

900
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:20,780
she goes to prison for a week, then she breaks out and that's the end of the

901
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:25,740
season season. There's a TV show idea. I like that we can do that is

902
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,340
disqualified yeah movie idea. I like someone who goes to prison for a week

903
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:32,000
and then breaks out and then it's over.

904
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,920
Here's another here's. This is a request omg guys. I need help asap. I need a

905
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:41,700
horror, scary movie idea. There should be dad abusing mean girls, changing

906
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,380
appearance, being a singer and falling in love with her boy BFF or the mean boy

907
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:49,220
that helped her later on this feels like it's just combining every single idea

908
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,940
with all of these. Can you combine this one in this one in this one in this one

909
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:56,220
BFFs girls changing appearance,

910
00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:00,780
appearance, appearance, being a dad of you, we got plenty of data, bees,

911
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:04,920
there's a lot of data abusing being a singer is not so much, but that can be

912
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:08,600
call it. No, I think that's the focal point of the movie. Now that you get

913
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Billy Eilish in the movie, introduce us,

914
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,440
introduce in her first acting role, I would literally kill to be the director

915
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,120
who gets that credit on my, my God, producing Billy credit. That would be

916
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:25,840
so much my legacy, Billy Eilish as same man who brought Billy to the silver

917
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,560
screen. That's what they call

918
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:34,560
ooh, Billy Eilish and Sean William Scott. That's not bad as the abusive dad. I

919
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:37,800
I'm thinking he's more like the movie is called Stifler's kid. It's called to

920
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:38,040
do

921
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:43,280
American American Dad, American Pie presents, Stifler's kids, Stifler's

922
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,160
kid, American Dad, American Dad, American

923
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,640
American Dad, American Dad, American Dad. Here's this next one is basically

924
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,400
everything that's wrong with Hollywood. Unknown says try remaking a movie in

925
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:57,240
modern times. No, thank you. How about a new idea?

926
00:57:57,240 --> 00:58:02,200
Here's a new idea. I have an idea it's very bad, so bear with me everyone in

927
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:05,180
the school is thanks for spoiling everyone in the school is put into

928
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:09,180
categories. So you're either smart popular, childish jock, the grub dogs

929
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:14,080
musicians, the nice and the mean the main character. You can pick names is

930
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:16,660
the only one in her school who doesn't fit into any category and everyone

931
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,340
bullies her except for one guy who is secretly in love with her, but the guy

932
00:58:19,340 --> 00:58:22,140
who likes her is one of the popular guys, so he can't be seen with a loser

933
00:58:22,140 --> 00:58:25,260
like her. Plus his sister is her complete mortal enemy. Isn't that the

934
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:28,140
plot of high school musical? Yeah, but high school musical doesn't have the

935
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,940
grub dog. That's true yeah. I wait. I to go to a school with the click called the

936
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:37,300
grub dog. Patrick, you're a you're a skate boarder. I'm a grub dog. You're

937
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:37,380
a

938
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:41,060
someone who likes food. I think so. I think I'm a grub dog. You're definitely

939
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:41,700
a grub dog.

940
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:47,700
I'm the from the childish. I'm a child is click and Alex is the is the musician

941
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:51,540
cool yeah me and we can get me and tae digs as my friend

942
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:53,940
or and we play at the table.

00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:06,560
grub dog.

947
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,520

00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:35,100
Lizzie. That's kind of a fun name for a girl in a movie.

955
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:41,140
This is why you get paid to make movies. I can see that I can see an executive

956
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:43,740
producer for Hollywood. Yeah Lizzie

959
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:57,040

so this is a very exciting app Movie Star Planet next slide. Please it's so

972
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,260

01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:57,220
It's pretty fun to use. This is my profile.

974
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:02,500
This is my profile here. That's me on the left. It says looking to direct my

01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,740
for the tv show. I personally prefer the silver screen and the best book would

981
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:30,000
have to be the portrait of a lady by henry james wow and I made my avatar

982
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,680

983
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,560
you should wear clothes like that. You'd look cool.

984
01:01:35,560 --> 01:01:40,480
This is what I mean. It looks exactly like me. This is my avatar.

988
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,080

992
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,300
So

01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,140
just let me know what you think. Oh shit!

994
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:19,740

01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:22,180
all right,

996
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:27,320
I'll read this war is bitter and brutal and seems to rage on forever more.

997
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,580
(laughing)

998
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:34,120
- Will I ever fall in love?

999
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,360
(laughing)

1000
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:41,200
- Wow.

1001
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:42,040
- The war is over.

1002
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:42,880
- Yeah.

1003
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,280
- Whoa.

1004
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,520
(laughing)

1005
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:56,880
Thank you for watching this film.

1006
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,320
Directed and written by upcoming

1007
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,320
creative Cameron E.

1008
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,760
The end.

1009
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,140
You should have you should have

1010
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:07,200
filmed your voiceover.

1011
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,640
I should have filmed it, but that's

1012
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,220
not where I really have a part of

1013
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,400
it. So I just wanted to kind of give

1014
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:12,400
the this.

1015
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:13,280
They don't have that in the app.

1016
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:14,280
Those so good.

1017
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,140
You're going with like dogma 95

1018
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:17,740
type rules where it's like you can

1019
01:03:17,740 --> 01:03:18,760
only use things.

1020
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,080
I just want to showcase the app and

1021
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,220
this is my creative vision.

1022
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,640
So I was kind of just only reading it

1023
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:23,640
for the audio listeners.

1024
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,980
I would say two things really stood out to me. The first one was how the little

1025
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:28,720
table keeps

1026
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:33,520
yeah. I am a huge fan of the works of Lynch. Yeah, I try to throw in some real

1027
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:37,160
elements like definitely moving and a light that looks like a skateboard,

1028
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:41,660
lynching for sure, yeah, definitely, and then I like her running on top of you.

1029
01:03:41,660 --> 01:03:46,820
There's a special touch. I just liked how that app gave you the tools to

1030
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:50,520
express your creativity. It feels like that easy to make a movie. It feels like

1031
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,120
that app was built to make those little one second things of someone lying down

1032
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,520
like someone running on top of feels like that's the right. It's just like you

1033
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:01,980
don't need to like get a fifty million dollar budget like you guys to make

1034
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,360
something yeah. You can just run out there, download movie star planet, make

1035
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:09,400
your profile, say your favorite things and you don't have to be a nepo baby.

1036
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:13,800
You can be an app baby to yeah on guys. I really wanted to cast all of us in

1037
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,000
that movie, but unfortunately they do not let you make custom characters and

1038
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:22,380
so it had to be a mermaid really stood out. She was good. She was great, an

1039
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:26,000
incredible performance. She was like what was it like to work with mermaid

1040
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,460
now. I guess I shouldn't kiss and tell

1041
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:32,460
a little. Oh my God, TMZ

1042
01:04:32,460 --> 01:04:36,100
don't me no TNC's no. I'm joking.

1043
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,980
Is that on the MZ?

1044
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:42,900
Well, why don't you guys plug your movie again?

1045
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:48,980
Go watch junior associate on home planet Youtube. It's the biggest thing

1046
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:54,080
you've ever made. Yeah, it's very fun and silly and crazy and I think it was a

1047
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:58,020
premier video up of it. There's a premier yeah, right here. Look at that

1050
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:06,260
yeah, we

1051
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:12,940
great guys. Do we have any more pieces of trivia that you guys can say? I got I

1052
01:05:12,940 --> 01:05:17,660
ate. It was like my birthday was the first day that we started shooting it.

1053
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,340
so you can kind of tell in a couple of the scenes. I have served like a

1054
01:05:20,340 --> 01:05:24,320
birthday glow, yeah, as well in a smile and I'm holding a present in a lot of

1055
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:24,480
the

1056
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:30,320
because I was and I open it, but Mr. Director made me wait, but I heard that

1057
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,260
they had to. I heard that you were kind of at the same time as this. You were

1058
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:36,220
also shooting another movie called the birthday and they had to see GI out your

1059
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:38,000
smile and a lot of the things for yeah.

1060
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,320
What we really did was we just had to take the mouth and then flip it the

1061
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:46,200
other way. So it was like a frown. He's up yeah. Spoiler alert, a bit of an

1062
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:50,080
upsetting one. He frowns. There's some frowning going on. There's a lot of

1063
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:50,300

1076
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,860
the most interesting thing we have ever done. Ask Peter Friedman about safe. I

1077
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:50,220
looked up Peter Friedman's pant leg. Yep, we were he's also in the stage. He's

1086
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:25,020
was got to read it and also go job go on. What is it the la chargers posted a

1087
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:30,300
video of Caleb? Oh my God, where did this video go? No way that can't be

1088
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:33,940
really. They deleted it. Oh my God, so

1089
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:38,600
you can save it or screen record. There's no way you can get it a cashed version

1090
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:43,980
of it, whatever someone will have it. The L. A. Chargers put Caleb crazy wow

1091
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:48,260
you're a thing damn. I think they found out what that video was.

1092
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:53,760
That makes sense all right, someone was probably like hey, happy week.

1093
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,780
I love you bye.

1094
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:06,660
He's trying to serpentine his way out in case there's gunfire.

1095
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:11,660
Look at his arms! He's holding his hands in front of him like he's doing a dance.

1096
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:16,660
My favorite part is here at the end, you can see his head go back and forth as he wobbles out of the hallway.

1097
01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:23,660
His head has a foot between each side where he wobbles his head.

1098
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:25,660
He's walking like a South Park character.

1099
01:08:25,660 --> 01:08:26,660
At what point does he...

1100
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,660
Okay, when he gets off stage and he's walking away and he does that walk...

1101
01:08:29,660 --> 01:08:30,660
Full sprint.

1102
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:33,380
Yeah, at what point is he just walk like a normal person?

1103
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,380
How long?

1104
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,380
Do you think that's his normal walk?

1105
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:36,380
That's his normal walk?

1106
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,420
No, he does that when people are looking.

1107
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:41,420
When he gets back onto the street, he walks like a normal person, I'm sure of it.

1108
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,660
He's not waddling around, he doesn't waddle in the subway.

1109
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,940
Okay, you be Mark Norman.

1110
01:08:47,940 --> 01:08:49,500
We need a practice here.

1111
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:50,500
You be Mark Norman.

1112
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:53,220
Mark Norman is coming on the podcast.

1113
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,180
I want to show you how I would drill Mark Norman and get the truth out of him.

1114
01:08:57,180 --> 01:08:58,980
You're about to spew the bullshit, right?

1115
01:08:58,980 --> 01:08:59,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1116
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,980
So first I'll be like, "Oh, hey Mark, nice to see you."

1117
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:03,980
Oh, what are you gonna call this podcast about math?

1118
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:04,980
Yeah, we actually...

1119
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:05,980
It's close.

1120
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:06,980
Thanks for doing the show, man.

1121
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,980
Yeah, what's going on around here?

1122
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:09,980
Well, in New York...

1123
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:10,980
It's just a video podcast.

1124
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:11,980
Yeah.

1125
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:12,980
You should call it "Podcast About Fish."

1126
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:13,980
There's a fish on the wall.

1127
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:14,980
Comedy.

1128
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:15,980
We do like comedy, buddy.

1129
01:09:15,980 --> 01:09:16,980
Yeah.

1130
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:17,980
What are you gonna call this podcast about water, huh?

1131
01:09:17,980 --> 01:09:18,980
Well...

1132
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:19,980
Because they got a water bottle here.

1133
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:20,980
It's an empty water bottle, Mark.

1134
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:21,980
I just went to a comedy show the other night and I was like...

1135
01:09:21,980 --> 01:09:22,980
Oh, comedy.

1136
01:09:22,980 --> 01:09:23,980
It went really...

1137
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:27,660
a comedy show the other night and I was like, what comedy? It went really. It

1138
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:30,940
was kind of like everyone was bombing and there was really awkward. So I was

1139
01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:34,740
wondering, like, what's the craziest show you've done recently? Oh, well, the

1140
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:37,260
craziest show I've done recently is a

1141
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:40,340
wait, where are you going? Mark?

1142
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:44,340
Watch this now. Stay now. Sit down, Mark.

1143
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:52,500
Sit down, Mark. Now I'm gonna show you. I'm gonna show you my method. This is

1144
01:09:52,520 --> 01:09:53,800
I would break his spirit.

1145
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:54,800
OK.

1146
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:01,440
So, Mark, what happened at that one show?

1147
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,440
Tell us.

1148
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,880
I'm not Mark. I'm Kevin Hart.

1149
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:08,440
Oh, hello, Kevin.

1150
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:11,000
Hey, Kevin, did you hear about Mark Norman's?

1151
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,080
What do you think?

1152
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,480
Kevin Hart, we wear a dress for us, please.

1153
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,720
No, no, no.

1154
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:19,320
That is the funniest shit ever.

1155
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:21,320
(Funky music)
