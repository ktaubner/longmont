17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,360
leukemia. You would never get leukemia. No. You're not like, I feel

18
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,720
like you're not big enough. Well I have it. Honestly, I don't mean to say it a bad way,

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:09,040
you're not big enough of a talent to die of cancer. Does that make sense?

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,600
Look at my diet. People who get cancer die. No, no, fuck you, I'm gonna get cancer.

21
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,800
No, you know what? No, shut up. Prove me wrong. You know who had cancer? My grandpa.

22
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Really? He must have been a great man. I think so.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Was he like a great writer or something?

24
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I feel like you have to be really

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,800
No! He wasn't a great writer or something.

26
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
He was my grandpa.

27
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
to

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Yeah. He did.

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,800
He worked at Polaroid.

30
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
He was the CEO of Polaroid.

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
I think you're like high school car crash talented.

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
You know what I mean?

33
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,800
Yeah. I did get in the art show in 5th grade.

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Yeah, that's what I mean.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Oh yeah.

36
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,920
school you would die in a car crash everybody be like hey wow he could have

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,840
he could have made it long enough to get cancer yeah but he died what's the yeah

38
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,040
well so what age bracket is cancer or what's how I bracket are we talking age

39
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,000
or talent it's a mixture okay well I want you to lay out the whole the cancer

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,360
sometimes grass cancer from the ages of one to five that just means that you

41
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,840
were basically just nothing and like nobody ever yeah you were a white blood

42
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,840
So yeah, you are a white blood cell that for like you might as well never even been born if you get cancer when you're a baby

43
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,640
Like that's like a huge waste of like hospital bills and all that

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,120
dot you're just like feeding the

45
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,600
fucking medical industrial

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,080
Feeding like in League of Legends. Yeah

47
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:40,640
Yeah, I quit yeah

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:48,200
system. There's no point in fucking yeah. Just stay in limbo. Just stay. Don't go through

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,320
the big door. We don't need you on this plane of existence. If I got diagnosed like next

50
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:58,360
week. That'd be funny. What do you mean? It'd be so funny. It'd be funny but like. And then

51
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:05,200
I would say ten to twenty five, that's the real like lost talent year. Years. You know

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,880
what I mean? Ten? Well there's some talent. Have you ever seen, what's that fucking. Look

53
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:16,240
up America's Got Talent. That Asian fellow with the violin. Who's that? Yo-Yo Ma. He's

54
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,280
not ten years old. He's still ten. Wait, is he actually ten years old? Yeah, he's been

55
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,920
ten a little while. I didn't know that. No, I think he was really good at ten. Like, I

56
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,160
feel like that's when prodigies get cancer. You know what I mean? It's like ten to twenty.

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,560
We'll say twenty, right? And then you have the post-college years, the twenties where

58
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,680
everybody makes their masterpiece. And then I feel like in your thirties, if you die of

59
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
cancer in your 30s that means that you you were you were stopped from making

60
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,880
from being really truly great. Does that make sense? Yeah like Robin Williams.

61
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:52,320
Yeah like Robin Williams. Yeah. Who died of cancer. Yeah. Cancer of the mind. Yeah.

62
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,080
And then if you die again I would say... Cancer of the soul. Yeah. Yeah. And then if you

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,600
die of cancer late in life you're just like... You're someone's grandma. Yeah. You

64
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:09,240
have a grandma kind of thing to you you know what your talent was fudge if you're

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:13,280
old you got grandma that's right your talent is making a really amazing

66
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,080

72
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,880
around we should make our own kind of bad did I say this on the podcast what to

73
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,560
say what it is for us to know like an evil Shabbos boy that like baptizes

74
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,000
Jewish people why do you have to be a Shabbos boy that could just be like a

75
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,960
Jack the Ripper, Jack the Dripper. Yeah. Right? Well I was thinking it was because

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,360
you know like they can't like during uh was it the Shabbos? I don't know. Whenever

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,040
they need a Shabbos Goi. The Sabbath yeah. When they can't like. That's a

78
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,120
cushy gig. They can't turn the lights on or anything you know so it's just like oh

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:19,520
no no no like he's like pushing like you know it's like oh it's so dark in my

80
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,400
place and he's like oh no trust me trust me there's no, there's nothing there. And he just trips him into a

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,800
a kiddie pool you my friend have a dark and twisted mind I don't think so I

82
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,040
think Shabbos go I think would be a really good job yeah I mean yeah I'm

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:43,040
only saying that you know what and let it out there is the exception get it

84
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,080
what if you get what if you're what if you're going for a Jewish guy who has

85
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:53,520
like a robotic leg and you have to like yeah you have to like take care of it if

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,640
If you got a robotic leg, do you have to take it off?

87
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:59,080
Dude, prosthetic, can you imagine like smelling somebody's prosthetic hole?

88
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,080
Did I ever tell you?

89
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,080
Fuck.

90
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Oh, wait.

91
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,080
Speaking of...

92
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
Did you?

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,080
Yeah.

94
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,080
What?

95
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,080
So...

96
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,080
You smelled someone's fucking leg hole?

97
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,880
So, well not like the stoma, but like...

98
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:11,800
No, the like hole that their leg goes in?

99
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,840
So there is a Christmas tradition in my family...

100
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,280
To smell grandpa's leg?

101
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:23,720
So my mom's grandpa had diabetes and got his leg chopped off and had a prosthetic leg.

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:30,800
And then when he passed away, my family at our family Christmas party put a wreath in

103
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,120
it in the leg and wrapped it in tinsel and shit.

104
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:45,160
And it was tradition for us to take photos with my great grandpa's prosthetic leg.

105
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,960
There's a photo of me fucking crying next to it.

106
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,640
That's like true detective shit.

107
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Yeah, I know.

108
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
What the fuck?

109
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,640
That's fucking crazy.

110
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,000
There's a photo of me just straight up crying next to it because I thought it was weird.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,680
Do you remember the whiff?

112
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,720
No, not really.

113
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,400
Can you imagine that?

114
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Are they plastic?

115
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Is it plastic?

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
One day that smell is going to hit me again.

117
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
I don't like rubber and stuff.

118
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,240
Well, I mean, this was like in the 70s.

119
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,040
So that thing must have been made out of pure oil.

120
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,240
It was a different guy's leg.

121
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,480
(laughter)

122
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
- They could only do swaps.

123
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,480
- The different guys' leg that they put

124
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,040
like a piece of rebar in.

125
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,480
- Yeah, yeah.

126
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,280
It was the, yeah, it was the guy

127
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,960
who couldn't afford the medical bills leg.

128
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,320
It was two guys who lost their leg.

129
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,160
- Yeah.

130
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,800
- It was a Chinese guy's leg with a,

131
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,800
like the marking of like a train wheel on it.

132
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,960
He just put it on his grandpa.

133
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,400
- It's like that fucking, holy shit,

134
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,760
what was that show called?

135
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,480
- The leg show.

136
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,920
- SpongeBob.

137
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,560
No, all right, well I'll just explain the premise of the show and then somebody who remembers it

138
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,840
can reach out to me later. It's like a guy, they had Lego sets of it and you could like,

139
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,040
he could replace his limbs, that was like his power.

140
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,880
Inspector Gadget?

141
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,280
No, no, no, no, no. It was like, it wasn't called like Max Steel. I remember Max Steel,

142
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,840
Max Steel was a different Lego thing.

143
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:09,160
We need to have like a theme song for the segment of the show that is us trying to guess what

144
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,640
Patrick's talking about. Yeah. That would be a good thing to have on hand whenever.

145
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:18,920
Yeah, a soundboard. It's a Lego set and they have like this. If we get

146
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,280
space, office space, we got to get a physical soundboard. Yeah. Yeah, a huge one.

147
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,360
Yeah, they fly around in a blue sphere. Effects pedals. Mm-hmm. See, he's still going.

148
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
We're talking about... Yeah, so if you remember that, just hit me up.

149
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,160
About a blue sphere man. A blue sphere and a guy who can change his limbs.

150
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,640
- That's called the Earth, Patrick.

151
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,880
- Yeah.

152
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,640
- And there's Legos.

153
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,480
There's a Lego tie-in.

154
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
- There was a Lego set.

155
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,760
- There's a TV show.

156
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,000
I think it was on,

157
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,040
I think it was on ABC Family.

158
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,440
I think it was on WBZ Kids.

159
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,800
- It was on my ceiling at night when I closed my eyes.

160
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,880
- What if I, yeah.

161
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,520
'Cause what if I just made this shit up and it didn't exist?

162
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,360
- I wouldn't put it past you.

163
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,920
- But I remember the Lego set.

164
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,760
- It would be funny to have like

shirt with a dabbing unicorn and it says "Fighting HIV/AIDS is my superpower. What

258
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,740
is yours?" Mm-hmm. And I wore that in a bar for a couple minutes.

259
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,300
When I first gave it to you, you seemed so embarrassed. He was so shy. I was like, "Put it on."

260
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:29,740
You were like, "No." He literally balled it up. There were three people like looking.

261
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:30,740
wearing the same shirt.

262
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
(laughter)

263
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,240
Wearing the same shirt, just looking at you.

264
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,940
- Well that bar was like kind of packed

265
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,060
and there was three people looking directly at me

266
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,900
and I was just like--

267
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,580
- Did they seem like they had AIDS?

268
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,420

272
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,100

273
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,840
- With IV drips sitting at the bar.

274
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,020
- I saw their lesions.

275
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,380
- What do you, what they would like if you wore that shirt.

276
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,420
You're saying you're fighting and it's not that you,

or something I feel like I like the link the length is good it's like really I

405
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,160
I think you have to style it a little bit though.

406
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,160
I think you got to maybe.

407
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,160
I think maybe it's...

408
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:32,640
I can't wait for Patrick to be giving me back shots and pull on this and take it off my head.

409
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,640
It's also...

410
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,760
It's a good color.

411
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,400
You're never going to outgrow the Trixie Mattel allegations.

412
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,400
Yeah.

413
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
It's a good color.

414
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,800
You can dye it whatever color you want.

415
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
True.

416
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800

418
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
We should have a wig dyeing episode.

419
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
I think it's really funny.

420
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
It's just like plain white.

421
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,320

435
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,760

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,440

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,800
- He got you like five things, Caleb.

441
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,040
- I didn't get you five things.

442
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,680
- Like every day we hung out.

443
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,360
- I kept buying him one of these.

444
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,600
- Every time I saw him, he'd be like,

445
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,840
"Look, this is what I'm getting for Caleb.

446
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,040
"It'll be something different."

447
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,200
And he'd be like, "No, I changed my mind."

448
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,440
So you have a lot of gifts coming to you.

449
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,840
- I kept buying him stuff and then realizing I liked it.

450
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:53,300
So that means that you got me something good at least at first and then you got me something

451
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,800
stupid that you don't want.

452
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
No.

453
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,800
In the end.

454
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,800
No, because I want to keep the thing I got you still.

455
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,800
Really?

456
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
The thing I got you now is actually really fucking sick.

457
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
God, dude.

458
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,400
We were supposed to get, I hope it's another wig.

459
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,400
That wig is shedding.

460
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,400

I got you something...

464
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,400
Yeah.

465
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Well, I don't need a girlfriend.

466
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
I'm my own girlfriend now.

467
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
That's true.

468
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
I got Cameron something...

469
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,400
I'm so damn pretty.

470
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,520
something that it will complete something else for him. The first half of his penis?

471
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,080
No you remember what I got him. I've been waiting for something like that for a long time. A second penis

472
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,720
half? Yeah. Oh my god. That'd be nice because you have that kind of blank space between

473
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:37,320
you're playing your balls and it's in your plane. Your tip floats like Rayman's dick. You just have a

474
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,920
floating Rayman penis tip. It's floating but when it's not when it's not there it's plain. Do you

475
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,660
I think Rayman just has you know you know like I think Rayman just puts his whole

476
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:50,080
body up in there. Do you think he's very small? Do you think he even has a ball sack or do you

477
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,500

478
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,120
clothes. Yeah. Do you know do you know when you dress up as Captain Hook? Yeah.

479
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,400

480
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,920

Who's one of the knights?

604
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
I'm trying to think.

605
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,040
There's Lancelot, there's Galahad, there's Turdcivil.

606
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,480

617
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:48,240
The smelly grail. That's pretty, you know, it's pretty easy for me. I'm a professional comedian.

618
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,240
The smelly grail. It's not that hard. Yeah. But I think this is going to be a new era for me.

619
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,240
Yeah.

620
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:57,240
I got to say, I'm not sure we're ever going to record with me not wearing this again.

621
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,240
Yeah. I feel like the guy who invented the atom bomb right now.

622
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:08,240
right now. Do I look like Lady Gaga? This is what I'm talking about. I just became

623
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,720
death. I need to put on... I just changed the world in an irreversible way. You Oppenheimer'd

624
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,420
my head. I'm going to put on sunglasses and I'm going to look good. Dude, if you had this

625
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:26,440
outfit and you put on sunglasses and you just went into a CVS, like 20 people would ask

626
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:30,860
you for an autograph. Yeah, they'd just think I was famous. The Bud Light hat, sunglasses

627
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,460
in that hair, people would be like swarming you.

628
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,060
Put me in a big shirt, I'm fucking Ariana Grande.

629
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,820
Big ass hoodie going over my thumbs.

630
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:38,900
Oh my God, lollipop?

631
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,740
Yeah, that's right.

632
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:42,860
Lollipop, tiny little tricycle, I'm Ariana Grande.

633
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,160
Spiral, tiny little tricycle, spiral makeup on your cheek.

634
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,540
Like Tessa hair back here.

635
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,380
Oh yeah.

636
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,700
You go like, ho, ho, ho, ho, he, he, he, he.

637
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,540
That's right.

638
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,380
That could be a really good look for you.

639
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,220
They're gonna ask me for an autograph.

640
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,860
You should play the Jigsaw puppet in the next Saw movie.

641
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,100
That would actually be huge for you.

642
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,100
Why would I-- I don't look anything like him.

643
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,620
You look exactly like him.

644
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,100
Really?

645
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:04,340
Yeah.

646
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,740
I think I have similar facial structure to Billy.

647
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:06,980
Definitely.

648
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,580
You have big red spirals on your face.

649
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,900
Oh, you put those on just now.

650
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,620
Yeah, with my lipstick, okay? It was here.

651
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,100
Oh yeah, we got the lipstick, we got the purse.

652
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,340
I got a whole makeup do-it-yourself outfit.

653
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,500
Yeah.

654
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,020
Carrie thing from Mary Kate.

655
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,300
You look like a princess.

656
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:21,860
You think so?

657
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:25,220
Would you look at me-- would you guys rescue me?

658
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:27,780
From what? That's important.

659
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,180
Bowser.

660
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,220
Bowser?

661
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:34,980
I'd complete one world but if it was a year in another castle situation I'm not

662
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:39,780
moving I'm not going to the desert maybe Lemmy. Lemmy? Yeah. What's that?

663
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:45,260
What are you saying? One of Bowser's kids. What about Bowser Jr. Lemmy one of

664
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,340
those guys I'd rescue you from them. Oh okay. I'm saying I'd fight like one boss

665
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,100
like I'm and I'm definitely not hitting the desert. Ludwig? Definitely not water

666
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:58,100
world. Yeah that's one of Bowser's kids. Why not water world? That's the best song.

667
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:02,100
Let's list them. That's what the podcast is about.

668
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:09,100
That is true. I think that I could be kind of a third Mario princess next to Daisy.

669
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,100
You'd be the fourth. Princess Luna. Princess Rozo.

670
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Princess Lunala.

671
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:20,100
She's not a princess. For you to be a princess you have to be caught by Bowser.

672
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,100
That bitch is a god. She's like a space god.

673
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,100
You could be Wario's girlfriend.

674
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,100
you mean it yeah. Thank you. Winsett's Weech.

675
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,100
(Laughter)

676
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,100
Yeah.

677
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,100
They should have Winsett's Weech. Yeah, why not?

678
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
They should have every-

679
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,100
She would look more Italian than Mario does.

680
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Okay, wait. This would actually be a great game. I'm pitching this to Nintendo right now.

681
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Yeah. Wario, like, gets a big machine and he starts a converter and he puts everybody through.

682
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:53,100
And so Mario has to change everyone back and it's like Woshi and Wonky Wong

683
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:59,080
long yeah and wowser and winces wheat and everybody turns wario style and it

684
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:04,560
could be called mario vs. wario the game because there will be a movie that

685
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,880
comes out before it and the game is a game version of the movie it's a tie-in

686
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,360
movie disappointing exactly or aragon to find out that you were

687
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,400
can you imagine how upsetting that would be to find out that you're someone's

688
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,400
Wario. You just see a better looking version of yourself, skinnier, everyone loves.

689
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
That happens to me every day.

690
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
But you don't meet fucking Matric all the time.

691
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,400
True.

692
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,400
They have to have the exact same name.

693
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,400
The thing about Wario and Mario is if it weren't for their outfits and they ran into each other,

694
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,400
they might think that they're like cousins I feel like.

695
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
True.

696
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
It's the outfits that makes them enemies.

697
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
And also the upside down.

698
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,400
Like if you walked into a CVS with your sunglasses and your Bud Light hat and you saw somebody

699
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:54,360
hat with an upside down Bud Light logo. Yeah. Named Daleb. Yeah. A Coors Light hat and a brown

700
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:00,720
wig. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Even that you would see him be like, "Whoa, that's crazy!" But like

701
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,400
an upside down version. Yeah, I guess it does have to be Bud Right. What? Because you know

702
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,400
like the Waluigi, the L goes upside down. But everything would go upside down. Fuck

703
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,740
fuck right

704
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,400
wasn't all going upside down turn into an hour

705
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,660
look at it is one of the hand right now

706
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:20,180
she flip it upside down

707
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,680
becomes an hour

708
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,780
i don't think that he comes in our thinking it becomes a i guess maybe like

709
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,560
a lower it becomes a really possible i would i never again hangman

710
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,440
up to an element of cancer

711
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,560
yeah you know heard that

712
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,560

713
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,960

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,600
Yeah, you didn't guess a Durthon. I'm also drawing the guy exactly like my dad.

716
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:52,960
It's all done in Sigillium, that fucking language Bam Margera made up like two months ago.

717
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah, actually yeah. Look at that, it's the fucking Plan B logo!

718
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,060

740
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,480
applauding is actually really weird. Why do we smack our palms together to show

747
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:39,280
Yep. Anybody else? I disagree. It's a baby entertainment. Anybody else? I disagree.

748
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,880
Anybody else? I think it's the greatest movies. Except for Half a Star out of a hundred.

749
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,680
Anybody else agree? I think they're the greatest movies. The compositions

750
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:56,120
are flat. You? And the CGI. Anybody else? If you don't like Eternals, analyze that. I like to

751
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:05,920

756
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,680
juvenile childish try it they tried to mature the formula with the end but

757
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,960
ultimately it was just so star dress the Avengers they should have called it

He is human we do need subhuman. Oh my God

He needs it. He needs a life-support suit to even be on set

764
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,660
Yeah, looks like a robot that thing probably probably fucking takes his pee out of his penis and puts it back into his mouth

Yeah, he said it's his fools him to think he's they're feeding him oxygen like he's Frank Booth and he's acting like Frank

819
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,760
That's right, Salma Hayek.

820
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:10,660
Salma Hayek, you are disrespecting Frida Kahlo by being a whorish bitch.

821
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:17,020
You need to settle down and be happy as your child.

822
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,260
Stop posting these pictures on Instagram and make me an instant dinner.

00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:42,480

862
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:48,140

863
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,260
it's like a blorbazoid, you walk it. They'd go oh, yeah. Did you have to teach them how

Meteoroid right yes yes yes we all hate that galaxy-wide we hate the Daily

869
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,700
Meteoroid that is a rag I don't know so happened yet but there is a meteoroid

870
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,420
that is supposed to hit today. I read it in the Daily Meteoroid.

871
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,100
That's really bad news. Did it say what planet?

872
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,100
Earth.

873
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,100
But I just got this hair.

874
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,100
I know.

875
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:31,600
It's like the worst news ever.

876
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:33,100
And you know what? The worst part is?

877
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:35,100
Imagine that my hair grew back.

878
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:39,100
Oh, what's the worst part? He's pointing at me when he said, "Do you know what the worst part is?" What is it?

879
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,100
Cameron's the worst part?

880
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,100
It can go through walls.

881
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:42,100
It can go through walls?

882
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,100
The Meteoroid?

883
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,100
Directly?

884
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,100
That sucks.

885
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:46,100
Directly.

886
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:48,100
Alright, but I'm saving them on the second story, right?

887
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,100
Don't tell me it's gonna be a direct hit

888
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:54,700
What okay? What if I wear?

889
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:57,940
Anti-meteorite, I think you wear a cone

890
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,820
a cone like a dog I

891
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:03,020
Can do that?

892
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:04,140
How are you?

893
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:06,820
Do a spare cone? Yeah, I mean get a dog

894
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,500
Yeah, I could go for a cone

895

This very instant. Oh, I can either be Coney Island dog or more corn dog your pick

896

00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:44,880

915
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:13,320
their hand because they're saying hello. They go like that. I would have...

916
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,680
And they have the lasso dance because that's how they abduct people. When you swing the

917
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,360
lasso around a girl that you'd love to pull. True. Just like Cotton Eye Joe. Oh my god,

918
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:25,440
they have to have Cotton Eye Joe on their planet. I fucking hope they have Cotton Eye

919
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,120
Joe, Jesus Christ. It's a whole planet of Cotton Eye Joe. They probably have technology eye

920
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,220
cotton eyed Joe

921
00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:37,660
on obtainium I Joe. They probably say they probably think I know exactly where

922
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:40,660
you came from and I know exactly where the trajectory of where you're going to

923
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,760
go. They're looking they're looking exactly where you're looking from an

924
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:48,840
observation on UPC. They're looking from an observation deck on like a

925
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,820
spaceship looking at Earth's like should we make contact yet? No, they're still

926
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:54,640
too primitive. They're still on cotton. I Joe

927
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:03,600
have three I'd Joe they probably do number five watch TV yeah a group of

928
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,360
humans watching a group of humans in a box aliens would not have TV that's a

929
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:17,160
human that's a surely human about no the we're the only people to watch TV humans

930
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:21,240
are the only people people in the galaxy watch TV I have that a good authority

931
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:24,960
from the Federation yeah are you in touch with the Federation often yep I

932
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:26,880
I knew he was a gray.

933
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,480
I'm not a gray, I'm just an excited ambassador between our two cultures.

934
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,120
Do I look like a gray in this wig?

935
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,120
You look more like a...

936
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:36,120
I knew this guy.

937
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:38,280
I knew he got probed for sure.

938
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,200
Perhaps one of the lower forms of a reptoid.

939
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,960
You really think I have a rept- I'm exhibiting reptoid stuff?

940
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,960
Well you ain't no Anunnaki.

941
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:46,960
No.

942
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:47,960
I could be Naki.

943
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,560
You, you, you know what, you're a uh, a fuckin, oh what are they called?

944
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:53,560
I'm gonna change my name to Anunnaki.

945
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:58,080
There is a type of alien that you look like, a Pleiadian I think.

946
00:52:58,080 --> 00:52:59,080
Let me pull this up.

947
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,080
You look exactly like a Pleiadian.

948
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:06,400
Next time we record with Matt, I'm going to wear this wig and not acknowledge it at all.

949
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,400
Check this out.

950
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:10,400
See if I can find him out.

951
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,400
That green guy from Star Wars.

952
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:13,760
Oh wow, yeah.

953
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:14,760
You literally are a Pleiadian.

954
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,760
Totally a Pleiadian.

955
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,480
Yeah, they're like the, yeah look.

956
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,480
Look at that.

957
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:20,480
That's you, dude.

958
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,720
It's not Jarl Poof.

959
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:22,720
You don't look like Jarl Poof right now.

960
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:29,720
Shut up. Number six, speak different languages. Dude, Sephiroth. You're a Sephiroth too.

961
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:34,720
You have Oporhynxis's hair and Sephiroth. Can you guys just stop talking about my beauty for one moment?

962
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:38,720
No, it's really hard when you're playing with your hair like that. I'm thumping.

963
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:44,720
If alien civilizations developed like ours, we'll probably have a lot more in common with them than we think.

964
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:51,720
My thumping thing. Number seven, believe in God. This is probably the most weird thing they could think.

965
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,600
aliens all have the exact same religions that we do

966
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:57,880
yeah well they only have christianity no they all have the same ones

967
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:01,040
no they're far enough in a civilization they eliminated every other

968
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,520
uh... religion no it's just the true one

969
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,320
it's exactly the same everywhere

970
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:08,080
i don't think so it's true

971
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:11,440
trust me i got i got an info pamphlet

972
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:18,080
on it when i was in the federation office do you have it with you? yeah let me pull it up

973
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:21,760
actually does have a picture does have the pimp here are read out to you

974
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,480
voted best family magic show

975
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:31,400
ron's i want to have to hold up here you have another have another one

976
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,240
have you ever fed a giraffe have you ever smelled their grassy breath

977
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,120
these are memories that will last i think that's a good sign for a template

978
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:42,600
that's better in a federation is like that's a very absent area need a

979
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:46,360
leaders yet after a period of time premium giraffe encounter our most

980
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,800
exclusive excursion only for people who really love giraffe. I think that might

981
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:54,220
is four guests maximum so that means there are four religions maximum. I think that

982
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:59,300
might be a giraffe thing. What? I think that might be it for a giraffe park. Yeah

983
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,760
for Giraffia the giraffe planet. I don't think there is a giraffe planet. I don't

984
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:07,840
think you're part of the Federation. I was shutting it off. You weren't doing

985
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:16,180
anything you're pretending number eight eat use eating use a eating utensils use

986
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:19,880
a eating utensils they're probably wondering why we look like we're not

They listen to this shit.

00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:57,420
They call it "Normal Things" and "Nice Sprites".

1013
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,420
Yeah, exactly.

1014
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,420
Normal Things and Other Normal Things.

And Other Normal Stuff.

1016
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,420
Normal Things and Nice Sprites.

1017
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,420
Skrillex is alien language for John.

1018
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,420
Yeah, so he's completely normal in space.

1019
00:57:09,420 --> 00:57:11,420
In space.

1020
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,420
That's like the alphabet to them.

1021
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,420
That's like the normalist song.

1022
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:17,420
You know that Polish joke where it's like

1023
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:22,420
the eye doctor says the it's like like it says like all the letters and it says I

1033
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,100
be our food.

1034
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:14,100
Yep, we're the mud eaters.

1035
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,100
Yep.

1036
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,500
Unless somebody has bad vision, then we're the you eaters.

1037
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:23,900
I'm sure we're going to have very successful descendants from thousands of years from now.

1038
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,900
We will not be a forgotten tribe of cavemen that died out immediately because we only

1039
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,020
ate mud and guys who thought antelope was spear.

1040
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:34,620
Yeah, listen, a bird told me mud is the best thing a person can eat, okay?

1041
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,500
So we're doing it.

1042
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:39,780
Mud is so much easier to domesticate than a deer or a dog, too.

1043
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,340
- Yeah, yeah, true. - Plus, you can turn mud.

1044
00:58:41,340 --> 00:58:42,780
- We got into the Neolithic age,

1045
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,340
like thousands and thousands of years before other people,

1046
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:48,340
'cause mud stays inside the fences easy.

1047
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:49,580
- Yeah, also, make your mud-- - You can turn mud

1048
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,980
into any animal you think of. - Make your mud work for you.

1049
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:53,260
- Yeah. - You know what I mean?

1050
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,140
If you need to put something in it, it's gonna stay.

1051
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,180
It's mud, you know?

1052
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,940
- We don't need fire, wheel.

1053
00:58:59,940 --> 00:59:00,780
Mud can do all these things. - You don't even need clothes.

1054
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:02,260
You just put mud on your damn body.

1055
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,140
- You just make a mud fire. - That's right.

1056
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:05,660
- Also, you make a mud fire, it's not very hot,

1057
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:06,860
but it works.

1058
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:08,220
You can, instead of a wheel,

1059
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,740
well, you just slide through the mud everywhere,

1060
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,740
twice as fast as a wheel.

1061
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:12,260
Yeah, of course we'll make a mud fire.

1062
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:13,260
What else are we going to burn?

1063
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:14,260
Rocks?

1064
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,260
Yeah, that's right.

1065
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,260
Those don't burn.

1066
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,260
You can't burn a rock.

1067
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,260
What are you, stupid?

1068
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,260
Of course the mud fire.

1069
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:20,260
What are you, a fucking idiot?

1070
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,340
That's what you use for fire.

1071
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:23,660
Fucking dumbass.

1072
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:26,820
Number 10, drive.

1073
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,820
They fly, though.

1074
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:28,820
Yeah, that's a good point.

1075
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,300
They might say, like, I think your spaceship's broken.

1076
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,300
Yeah.

1077
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:33,300
It's rolling on the ground.

1078
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:34,300
Your spaceship is a lowrider.

1079
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:35,300
Yeah.

1080
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,100
They might think we're all swaggy.

1081
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:38,100
They would think we're swaggy.

1082
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:40,420
Yeah, because we have a low rider spaceships. Yeah

1083
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:44,820
