1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:16,980
we made it y'all. We made it. We it's today is the halfway point, the

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,380
halfway three day one. We're hanging in the planetary system and think about

4
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,900
the week. What happens every week man hump day comes right there in the

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,220
middle. I know I know no hump day in the planetary week, none dude. It's all

6
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:36,260
You know who likes hump day? Camels. Like the commercial. Camels like cigarettes man. Alright.

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,500
They can like two things. They like the desert sand. They can like two things at once. I

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,300
guess you're right. Is it true that water, they store their water in their hump? They

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:53,700
store their water in their rings of Saturn. Today is Saturn. Today is Saturn. You had,

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,100
they store it in their rings of Saturn? I'm not thinking much today. That's okay, dude,

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:01,380
your brain off and just let this shit flow through you. That's what this is all about.

12
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,580
I need a diet coke or something. I need some kind of... I woke up too early this morning.

13
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:09,820
You're always like, "I need a caffeine drink." I need a performance enhancing...

14
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,820
I need PE drugs.

15
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,340
You know, right now you sound like basically any guy you'd find in an alley.

16
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,740
Exactly. Some scumbag.

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
A homeless guy.

18
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
A homeless guy.

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,740
A homeless.

20
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,740
A hobo.

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,380
There's a homeless guy who changed up his story around here. I've seen him, he comes

22
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,440
Is it like is it the guy who started to pretend to be mentally disabled that

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,140
we've talked about before?

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,440
Maybe, but this guy has been pretending to be Palestinian. Yeah, it's the same.

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,640
Yeah, now he added he used to be Dominican and now he says Palestinian

26
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,840
Argentinian. Yeah, Palestinian Argentinian and good rhyme. Well, that's

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,240
I think why how he came up with it, but it used to just be a guy who would walk

28
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,480
around and ask people for money and then he started doing a crazy voice for a

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:56,580
the disability that nobody's ever had and then he's now is saying that he's

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,420
order yeah

31
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:03,120
something called sponge disease and it makes me it makes me laugh weird.

32
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,380
It's kind of a dog and then he now he started saying he's Palestinian and I

33
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,580
honestly like what could this guy got hustle? It's called a genius. Yeah,

34
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:19,180
how am I going to be mad? He knows he knows what he's doing to know. He knows

35
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,760
car is walking around. He's a pro dude. Oh, he's a fucking pro. I made an amazing

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,840
discovery this week, which is I started going on the Ridgewood subreddit guys.

37
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,000
The Ridgewood subreddit is some of the most vilely racist stuff ever posted in

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,040
the universe on this. Really? Yeah. I mean, I forget how- Is it people who just

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,600
moved here who aren't so happy that maybe there was a community here beforehand?

40
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,960
Yes, pretty much, yeah. Like a Polish community, though. Well, it's a bit- For

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,760
me my favorite part of Ridgewood man, but completely one hundred percent is every

42
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,140
single Saturday night. If it is after four PM,

43
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,960
I will see

44
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,400
about one hundred Mexican guys who are all five two and they are all the

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,120
drunkest person I've ever seen in my life and they are what they are all kind

46
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,080
of free roaming on a quest. Yeah, just read going in. They're going into every

47
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,600
store on the street and all switching and coming out like a Scooby Doo thing. I

48
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,880
feel like I need to. It feels like like literally falling down. They're all

49
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,820
doing the thing where they start to walk and they're walking makes them lean

50
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,620
forward and that makes them have to run so they don't fall over. They're all

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,140
big stumble. Yeah, it's some kind of that drunk in a minute. It's some kind of

52
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,620
MMORPG and it's literally not part of every single Saturday. It's incredible.

53
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,020
It's so beautiful. They talk to each other, text above their heads and give

54
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,060
each other quest. They literally are. They're in a hub. It's so fucking

55
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,720
awesome. Yeah, dude, it's incredible. I went to town when I was here. When Kai

56
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,940
was here. I was telling him about it and then I was like and then he like came

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,580
to my apartment and he's like dude, I saw the

58
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,220
just like those guys are awesome. They have everything because they works like

59
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,660
if you the only reason to ever get that drunk is because your job is so fucking

60
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:07,540
hard and every Saturday. Yeah, you just you gotta just light it off. Yeah, light

61
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,820
it off. We're not shaming them or anything. We're saying I think it's so

62
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:16,760
I figured out yeah. I like incredible. I do I'm not being I would probably feel a

63
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,640
little bit different if they were all like seven feet tall. I would probably

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,020
feel a little bit scared if a bunch of giant guys, but because it's all like

65
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,380
they're all really small, it's cute. Very, very small. Yeah, I have seen them.

66
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,280
I have I love to see they all pee on the wheels of cars. So I picked that up from

67
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,020
them. They learn. I learned something every day from them. It's like a human

68
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,300
instinct man. Yeah, that's on the wheel. Yeah, that's being a wheel of a car. Who

69
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,720
doesn't you pick the nicest. I just love to it's seven PM, not even making any

70
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,280
attempt to hide what you're doing at all, just peeing on just beautiful. Oh yeah,

71
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,960
I like it. It's free. It's the most free thing you can do. It's freedom. It's

72
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,760
pure freedom.

73
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:57,400
Sometimes they'll be lying down on the sidewalk. I think maybe they're dead.

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,080
Yeah, that happens. Dude, the other day, the other day I was walking down the

75
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,000
street, there's a fucking asleep guy on the ground and a lady was standing over

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,840
him and I walked past and she was like, she said, "Do you know this guy?"

77
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,500
And I was like, first of all, that doesn't maybe I was wearing the wrong

78
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:16,140
kind of outfit that day, but I was like, no, I don't know this guy. I think he's

79
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:20,400
asleep. She's like, I think he's fucking dead and he had like a beer bottle next

80
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,160
to him. Yeah, and I was like, I don't think he's dead. She's like he's dead.

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,480
He she called 911 yeah, and then he got fucking arrested. Oh my God, you're so

82
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:33,720
worried about this guy that you sent him to jail. That's crazy. That's insane.

83
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,720
Yeah, someone we know in college did that. Just let the guy be asleep, bro.

84
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,240
someone we know was like hanging out and like there's somebody like nodding off

85
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,360
and like the comment or whatever and they call like if you call the cops

86
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,200
because you think the guy is dead you're allowed to poke him you just

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,200
talk to him one time you have to talk to him

88
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,520
it's not that's crazy to not even try to they're never fucking dead you always

89
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,400
have to poke them first if they were dead you'd

90
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,400
know yeah exactly you know you wouldn't and also if they were dead you would not

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,240
call the cops you would leave exactly immediately yeah yeah i don't

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,900
I don't want to do a dead guy. I would that's a former that I got a

93
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:13,040
the thing is the differences. If you're if there's if the guy's dead,

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,280
you're not helping anybody. No, he's far he's already dead man. Yeah, just

95
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,680
fucking pick him up. You bring him to the trash yourself. Yeah, exactly the

96
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,140
try to help if you want to help yeah, but I'm in the

97
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,000
if some of the sleep on the start. Oh, that's actually a good point. Actually,

98
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,200
not if they're if you know that they're dead on the street thing is poking them.

99
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,640
If somebody is asleep on the street or not responsive on the street, just start

100
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,120
putting them in the trash. If they're awake, they're going to stop, they're

101
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,980
going to get mad yeah and then you just go like sorry man. I thought you're

102
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:41,520
fucking here's here's a here's a true thing.

103
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,480
The lead singer of slipknot, Corey Taylor, a very famous story that he when

104
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,040
he was a kid, he overdosed and his friends threw him into a dumpster and

105
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,360
left him to die. So what I'm saying is you run into guys sleeping on the

106
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,320
street or maybe looks like he could be dead, can I throw him in the trash

107
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,880
like okay? We're making an area you get in trouble for touching a dead guy.

108
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,920
yeah best case scenario. He makes incredible music, incredible music,

109
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,980
incredible music, incredible music that stands the test of time. Exactly decades

110
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,440
that holds up and never ever sounds odd. Yeah yeah stuff that is now weird right

111
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:21,040
or blame. I think I need to try being a guy thrown in the trash. Yeah, I nods

112
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,320
off and I watch a I watch a video. I watch these videos today. That was this

113
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,000
guy. He's like one of those like dumpster diving YouTube channel. Yeah,

114
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,960
but it's the fakest thing I've ever seen in my entire life where he's like he's

115
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,760
like oh, let's see what's in here. Oh wow Rolex in the trash. Wow that's all

116
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:40,920
he's like finding insane. He found a full sixteen pack of Bud Light in the

117
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,760
trow damn it's just I mean this guy needs to try harder. Yeah, like nobody's

118
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,400
throwing that shit away. Nobody's believing that you know I'm not

119
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,160
believing that I don't even believe when people do when it's the videos that are

120
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,680
like my thrift store haul yeah, but it could be the way it could be the where

121
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,960
it could be stuff that is not interesting or cool or expensive. I still wouldn't

122
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,380
believe you can't even buy nice stuff every because of ebay every store. Every

123
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,320
guy who owns like a thrift store, a pawn shop looks up everything that they have

124
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,640
to see if it's really expensive. It was so sick double. Anyway, you go to a

125
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,120
thrift store, they're selling like a car heart pair of jeans for like a hundred

126
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,680
dollars. Yeah, like what the vintage car heart the hell it's like the the thing

127
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,840
yeah, it's like oh this one has like the paper tag instead of like the printed

128
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:30,400
one. And it's like, oh yeah, this is like Carhartt. You find like Levi's orange tabs anywhere,

129
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,000
that's going to run you like, I've seen them go for like $60. They're just jeans from the

130
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
70s.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,680
A DVD copy of the Lord of the Rings, The Two Towers is like $5 now. It's supposed to be

132
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,260
25 cents. What the hell happened to...

133
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,240
Thrift stores are completely bunk.

134
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,240
They fell off, man.

135
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,120
They're completely bunk because it's because of COVID. It's because COVID and then everyone

136
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,920
learned that you can start your own fucking Depop store and shit.

137
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,820
there was a speaking of I got some items. No

138
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,000
I never want to hear about your

139
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,080
and wall that I used to go to that would literally that were selling books. It

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,960
sold every book, no matter what for twenty five cents, and I felt like I was

141
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:10,240
stealing every time. It's insane, you know, and now you go and it's fucking

142
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,760
you go and it's a it's a book that nobody has ever heard of. You can't even

143
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,160
find it on Google. There's no interest for it at all. It's a sci fi book that

144
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,880
somebody wrote before sci fi was invented. It's falling apart. There are

145
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,600
hermits living inside the pages and it's seventeen dollars. I'm about to blow

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,060
your mind. If you like book deals, bro,

147
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:31,700
the library completely free free, you go free as charge. I free the way I use it.

148
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,820
How do you use it? I keep the books. Yeah, they don't they can't charge you

149
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,780
to go back and then I'd go back and try. Would you go back man to get another?

150
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,600
I remember another one taking a book from the library and it being way

151
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,500
overdue and the feeling of shame as you up to that thing with the old Harry,

152
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,560
the third Harry Potter book and you just put it on the desk. You're like you're

153
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,220
you grow you have stubble on your face, because it's been so long since you

154
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:55,100
checked it out and you're like yeah yeah. I do you just you just throw it in

155
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,740
the book drop and you leave yep, no, because then you have to pay for it man.

156
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,020
Now you throw in the book drop and don't check out another book and then they

157
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,980
try to yeah. They'll send you mail. That's fucking true, but I'm going and

158
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,420
I'm trying to a lot of mail. I'm trying to read the first eighteen pages of

159
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,420
Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy man. I got to go to the library. Yeah, I just

160
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,880
don't check the book out. Just sit there like it's a reference book, so they're

161
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,260
like you're looking through like looking through a laws. I used to be way too

162
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,980
ambitious with the books that I would get from the library as a child. I would be

163
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,900
like I was like eight years old and saw the Charlie Brown where he reads War and

164
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,820
Peace and I was like I'm gonna read that book and then I got it from the library

165
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,180
to go home. That thick.

166
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:34,140
Bunch of fucking nonsense. I used to take out this book from the library that was

167
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:39,500
like I think 1000 pages and it was the Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll.

168
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,820
It's the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock and Roll. It's like this big. That's

169
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,020
I would just read about like it was just different. It was any band that has

170
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,820
appeared in Rolling Stone. So I just read about bands in there. Damn. And then

171
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,540
that's how I found out. That's how I like found music when I was like nine years

172
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:03,220
old. That's how I found like Frank Zappa. I would just like I wonder who's in Z.

173
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,860
I wonder who starts with Z. I just check out every single book they had about

174
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,300
Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, 20 of

175
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,020
dinosaurs. I mean, I read every dinosaur book. I'm gonna be honest. Yeah, I was

176
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:17,640
just taking out graphic novels. Yeah, that's what I was going to say to like

177
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,020
the five comic books they had. Yeah, I would just, I would just run Justice

178
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,060
League, Young or Young Titan, Teen Titans and stuff. I was young. I was

179
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,900
reading Bone Man. I was not reading Bone Man. Oh, dude. Bone Man is a different

180
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,840
thing. Bone Man is not very good, but Bone was fine. I don't even know what

181
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,100
Bone was about. It was about some whiteys. It was about bones. It was about

182
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,300
bones who were in love with a woman. It was about a woman, two white bones

183
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,620
that walked around. And a dragon. It was a big bone and a little bone. Yep.

184
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,600
and they would walk around. One sounds like something I have dreamed of. One of

185
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,800
them was named bone. Yeah, the others all had bone in their name. Yeah, so it was

186
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,980
about just like basically bone and phone bone phone bone. Was that really his

187
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,640
name? Phone bone? The big guy? One of them was named phone bone. Maybe that

188
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,260
was the really

189
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,120
it could have been the phone. There was a character named the rat king. That's a

190
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,820
good name. Was he a bone or no? He was a rat. Oh, that's a monster. No, he was a

191
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,680
monster. Oh, it looked like a rat, maybe a little bit. I can't remember anything

192
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,380
that happened in those books. I can visualize them the rat monsters. I know

193
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,700
what there's a bone named phone, but I was into the alternative graphic novels

194
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,220
like that and mouse. You know, I know your ass is reading mouse

195
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,280
bro. I was reading mouse and I was like this shit can never happen again, bro.

196
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,740
I read mouse for we were doing the it was like the unit in seventh grade for

197
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:34,140
the holocaust and I read mouse the what I did a unit on the holocaust. I

198
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:37,100
definitely made fun of some kids for reading mouse. Yeah, dude, you didn't

199
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,820
like history. Yeah, I definitely I definitely looking back

200
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:48,320
opening up the preacher. You're making a mouse is gay. Yeah, you read watchman

201
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,720
so close to your face, looking at the penis x-men. I remember somebody

202
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,820
brought watchman this kid, Paul Winder, who I think grew up to be Nazi. He

203
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:04,420
brought watchman to the middle school and we were passing it around later. I

204
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:09,120
mean, like it was porn, the black. Yeah, and just looking at the cock. Yeah,

205
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,480
I drew a dick in there. And just not even, we were excited to see any kind of

206
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,160
drawn nudity. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was so exciting to us in sixth grade.

207
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,520
Which I mean, you had the computer then. But there's something about the...

208
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,600
The computer was too easy. The smell of the book. The smell of the book

209
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,040
that all the guys had used. And it's a story, it's a comic. Exactly.

210
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,320
It's... Yeah, you have... That was something as a kid. That's what makes it

211
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,960
exciting. Nudity was scary when you look it up on the computer,

212
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,360
but if it's contextualized in a movie or something, you go like,

213
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,640
"That's awesome." What I always thought about that, it's really funny that

214
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:41,380
they kind of they they show his dick like a few times, but then a bunch of the

215
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:45,640
other time they did they do the like they do full Simpsons movie, like coffee

216
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:49,160
mug yeah, it's like what just just show the show it every show. I mean that

217
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:52,400
just means the guy who was drawing it just got a little bit yeah. He drew it

218
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:52,980
once and he's like

219
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,080
why am I so good at driving

220
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,320
he based it on his own to which is the saddest part. Did you really yeah?

221
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,740
That's the reason the doctor Manhattan is blue was just so it would match the

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,160
the creators blue penis. It was so devoid of air. It kind of turned blue. Yeah,

223
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:13,560
yeah, you guys for a penis to turn blue enough of this cock talk. Let's talk

224
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,260
planets. Okay, let's talk Saturn. Let's go through the outfits. Let's start with

225
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,560
Caleb because you have an interesting outfit on. All right, I flopped you

226
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,960
flopped. I think I yeah, I think I flopped. I couldn't think of anything.

227
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,660
So I dressed up like the ring because there's a ring on Saturn multiple. I

228
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,360
I think we may be all flopped today.

229
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,660
Well, I'm dressed, I think that none of us own any Saturn clothes I'm gathering.

230
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
Yeah.

231
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,660
I just wore the Jupiter thing.

232
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,160
I could have thought we could have dressed up like cars.

233
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Oh, like a Saturn.

234
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,560
I was maybe going to, I was going to, because Saturn is kind of like brownish, beige-ish

235
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
color I feel like.

236
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,560
Yeah.

237
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,080
So I was going to maybe, if I had a shirt that was that color, I was going to wear that

238
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,940
and then put like a duct tape ring around my stomach.

239
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,460
But I didn't even have a shirt that was that color.

240
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,580
So I'm just dressed as the rings.

241
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,120
because then one picture I looked at, they were kind of blue and green.

242
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,440
Yeah. I kind of dressed like the rings, too.

243
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,660
Yeah, show us here at Walkers.

244
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,100
And you're dressed as the ring.

245
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,500
And then I went to the barber shop this morning.

246
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,960
And what? I did see this in the back of your hat band.

247
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,480
Oh, damn it.

248
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,980
I think my shit got fucked up.

249
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:19,260
I don't know.

250
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,900
It looks good.

251
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,420
My God.

252
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,800
What did you ask him for at the barber shop?

253
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,020
I asked him for the ring of Saturn.

254
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,920
And they did this?

255
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,940
And they gave me this.

256
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,960
Damn.

257
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:32,220
What is up with our barbers and being interested in planets? I know it's

258
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:36,380
really surprising. These guys are really, really like knowledgeable too, like

259
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:38,420
they knew what a ring was. They knew, I mean look at this.

260
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:45,000
I mean this shit is too fire. So for our audio listeners, Patrick has a

261
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,100
one, he's completely bald except for a ring of hair around the top of his

262
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,540
head. And I think that honestly, now that I'm seeing it on camera,

263
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,500
you'd like it. I think that this is gonna catch on as a hairstyle. It

264
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,060
it looks really good. I was so excited because when I walked in and saw you on

265
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,840
the computer, I did see through the back of your hat. I could see I knew

266
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,200
damn it. I was like I should have worn a fitted. I knew that it was. Did you

267
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,580
see the part where I cut way too close to his skin and he has no hair at all?

268
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,380
Well, at first I saw what I saw is I saw the back of his neck. He has one

269
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,940
well. Now I got to shave it all off so well and I was like

270
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,460
now I did you have a great job. You screwed up. Now I got to shave the

271
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,020
whole damn thing off. You need to you need like

272
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:30,580
one week of this. I think I look like well yeah hold up. You do have to you

273
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,540
have to hold on to this for as long as possible. This is a good once you get

274
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,860
something. I mean this is so much power there. If there's one regret I have in

275
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,100
my life, one regret, it's that I didn't keep my Navi braid for for longer than I

276
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,420
did. I kept it for only a couple of weeks because I was going home for

277
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,120
Christmas and I did not want to have to have my family. I did ask about it and

278
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,820
He's explained, well, there's basically a planet. Yeah, I know, but that's why it's a regret.

279
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,460
Oh yeah, because I wish I hadn't done. That's what regret. Oh, I guess you're right. So

280
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:05,860
it's like I did something different than what I did. Yeah. Oh, okay. I thought you were

281
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,620
just saying that you're glad at least that I had cut it off and then framed it in my

282
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:16,940
house. I knew a kid who had one of the Padawan braids in school and we had it for two years

283
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,940
straight. Whoa, I know a kid with a rat tail. Me too. He also carried a Zippo around.

284
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:26,240
Rat tail so long that it started to turn blonde at the end. Whoa, that's cute.

285
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,280
That is cool. It's kind of gross. That's like when a guy's got these long beard

286
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,780
and then at the end it turns. I think it's more like when a guy grows his

287
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:37,380
fingernails out for a hundred years. Yeah, it's more of that vibe. It feels

288
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,980
more like a Rip Van Winkle. Yeah. Did he grow hair and nails? He slept. Yeah,

289
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,040
but he was sleeping. Did he grow them in his sleep? He slept. He'd sleep all

290
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,040
day. He probably was still growing in his sleep, I guess. Yeah. I mean, I

291
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:53,760
he has a beard when he woke up. He had a beard when he woke up, but they didn't

292
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,860
even think about his hair and nails. Those also grow. Those don't stop

293
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,900
growing when you die. His hair is probably long, too. Well, he wasn't dead.

294
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,460
He's not. I know, but they definitely you're okay, but they're definitely

295
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,660
gonna still be there when you're asleep. Yeah, you're saying the hair, the hair

296
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,700
and the nails would still grow even while he was asleep. How long did he

297
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,980
sleep for? 100 years, 100, 100 years. I do think I need a that level of sleep.

298
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,100
I something pretty soon. I need to catch up. I've been in trouble. You've been in

299
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,040
trouble. I've been in trouble. I've been having scary dreams, man. Me too. Yeah,

300
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,000
scary fucking really scary. I've been having horrible waking nightmares,

301
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,840
waking as in they wake you up, not no as in I'm awake and my dream is coming into

302
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,440
reality.

303
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:44,800
That's more of a real power and a dream. Well, yeah, you have some kind of don't

304
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,840
say yeah, you admitting to have a power. You're not supposed to do that. I don't

305
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,200
you don't like it's not a power I can't control it. I woke up and I there I saw

306
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,000
1 million bugs are calling every one of my room. That's really scary man.

307
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,840
It was so fucking horrible. No crawling. Oh okay. I found some roaches in my pantry the

308
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,880
other day. They're everywhere man. It's fucked up. They're in every building in

309
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,040
this city right now. What the hell's happening with these roaches? We have

310
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:12,160
been, we have been engaged in a war citywide. I've seen them at the store.

311
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,700
store. Yeah. Well, anywhere else? My house. Okay. You seen them at the store? What store?

312
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,540
The store next to my house. So I've heard people say that they've had them. I saw one

313
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:34,240
at the restaurant. In your food? No. No? No. On the wall. And they're just, I'm just saying,

314
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,480
be careful. They are disgusting. They're out there. They are gross. They made me hate bugs.

315
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,240
I've never liked bugs. Me neither. You have been fond of bugs for some time.

316
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,040
I wouldn't even call myself fond of bugs, but I don't care. You'll let it slide.

317
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,600
I let it slide. If there's a spider, I would like to leave it in its web and

318
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,760
look at it every day. I'd like to destroy it with a salt shotgun. I love those.

319
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:59,720
I like that we've invented the salt guns were an amazing idea, and I think that

320
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,800
they should expand it to more things, a salt crossbow. Does Saturn have any salt

321
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,160
on it? We could do that. It probably has minerals involved. I think there's salt

322
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:24,640
in

323
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,000
beautiful girls of all time. A child? Is it planet report time y'all? I think it might

324
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:36,600
be planet report time. He said the child from the ring is one of the most beautiful women

325
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:44,480
he's ever seen. He likes Japanese girls. Wasn't she like 7? What? In the ring? No like 13.

326
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,400
She's been in the TV for ages. Okay. Asshole. You do you I guess. Yeah I will fucking do

327
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,100
me. I'm jumping in that well,

328
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,360
you mean crawling out

329
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,860
laying out

330
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:08,500
this green is on the tv here. I come I crawl

331
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:12,820
I'm killing you for real fear

332
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:15,520
killing you with fear,

333
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:23,380
the TV just below the surface. She's crawling, appalling.

334
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,660
Whoa! Wow! Okay, anyway.

335
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:30,500
Join us once again on a five week galactic journey through our solar

336
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,020
system.

337
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Be prepared to learn and to laugh a little too.

338
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,340
And now, the Planet Report with Cameron Fetter.

339
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,180
Oh yeah!

340
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,380
Okay, guys. Can I start doing that? What? As part of the thing. What? Doing what?

341
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,240
Oh yeah, can we add that in? We can add that in post. Yeah, I'll send you this

342
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,160
here. Send me a clean tape. Send me this. Oh yeah. Can you send me that? I'll

343
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,140
send you that. Yeah, extract that. Can you extract that? I'll extract it. Okay,

344
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:00,580
today's planet report is called

345
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,300
There's Something About Saturn, a planet report by Cameron Fetter.

346
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:13,380
Let me prop up my phone here. Okay, prop up your phone. Yeah.

347
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,540
I want to give Saturn another ring.

348
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,700
Oh, please baby.

349
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,600
Just say yes.

350
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:27,460
Saturn, I want to be with you forever.

351
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,260
Something about your body,

352
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,020
more than 750 times the size of Earth,

353
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,860
just drives me mad with desire.

354
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,260
Who wants to be Saturn?

355
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,340
- Me.

356
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,280
- We're so alike in so many ways.

357
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,460
You have 146 moons.

358
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:48,460
I have 146 moods, from happy to sad and everything in between.

359
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,940
Oh, it goes on this, right.

360
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,500
You're named after the Roman god of agriculture.

361
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,480
My middle name is named after my uncle.

362
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,200
You revolve around the sun every 29.5 Earth years.

363
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,300
And we both have days named after us.

364
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,940
You have Saturday and I have International Puppy Day,

365
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,880
March 23rd.

366
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,200
I want to give you one more ring, Saturn.

367
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,260
We could be so happy together.

368
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,060
I know this isn't your first rotation.

369
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,060
After all, you already have eight rings.

370
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,060
But things will be different with me.

371
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,620
I'll treat you right.

372
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,020
I know how to handle a planet composed primarily

373
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,860
of hydrogen and helium.

374
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,660
And I'm good with moons.

375
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,220
I grew up with a moon, so I don't mind being around them.

376
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,100
Tethys and Titan love me,

377
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,740
and I think I could be a great role model for them.

378
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,400
I don't even care that you've been visited

379
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,260
by four spacecraft before.

380
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,580
Oh, Saturn, just say yes.

381
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,020
Other people don't understand you like I do.

382
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,320
Some people see an atmosphere

383
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,380
that's negative 288.4 degrees Fahrenheit

384
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,020
and contains methane and ammonia

385
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,020
and run for the hills, not me.

386
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,860
In fact, I hear atmosphere

387
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,100
is one of the things I love about you.

388
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,900
I think it makes you unique.

389
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:58,740
Wow.

390
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,860
You're always getting so down on yourself,

391
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,260
but you've achieved so much

392
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,300
in the 4.5 billion years you've been around.

393
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,820
You were in the movie "Interstellar."

394
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,200
That's all I can think of right now,

395
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
but you know you're something special.

396
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,320
We've been the long distance for a while now.

397
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:20,800
And I mean it honestly when I say I don't mind driving the 884 million miles to dick you down.

398
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,800
But I'm ready to take it to the next level.

399
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,480
Let's move to Asheville, North Carolina and buy a house together.

400
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,480
Baby, I love you. Just say yes.

401
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,880
And that's today's Planet Report.

402
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,200
That is so beautiful. That was amazing, dude. It was a combination of so many, I mean,

403
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,800
I didn't know this. It was your taste. So it's kind of about love and about

404
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,920
knowledge. Yeah. There's a ring stuck on my fucking finger, man.

405
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,120
Well, I guess. Oh, God. I guess you have to wear it forever. Why do you want to

406
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,040
take, well, you're not supposed to take it off. Okay, you're right. Well, not

407
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,160
until one of us passes away. Yeah.

408
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,960
Passes gas. Saturn's a gas giant. True.

409
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,400
It is, yeah, Saturn is beautiful. Again, we're kind of in this zone of planets

410
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,800
where I don't know that much about them. And so this has been very, I need this planet

411
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:18,080
report. It's opening my eyes to a lot of different stuff about, I didn't know 75 or 750 times

412
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,160
the size of earth, man. BBW. Yeah, that is a BBW. Nine times the diameter. Big beautiful

413
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,960
world. Big, ooh. Yeah, wait, I just came up with that. That's better than what I thought.

414
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:33,000
And one of the biggest moons. Titan. Titan. Titan. Titan. Why is its moon so big? Because

415
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,640
it's a big planet. It can have a big moon. Because anything with a big bottom got a big

416
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,800
moon. Facts. Don't fuck us up with that man. Okay. 146 moons. I hope he gives you 146

417
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,240
moons. Don't you love when you come home and your girl moons you?

418
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,800
Just walking around with her butt cheeks out. Butt cheeks hanging out the top.

419
00:25:54,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Yep. Just full moon. Butt flop. That prank is too much. You ever been mooned by a girl?

420
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,320
Yeah. Yeah. In a pranking way? Yeah. Yeah. Put that thing away man. What are you doing?

421
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,720
What the hell? I only think this is funny on guys.

422
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,920
It's only funny on guys.

423
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
This is fucking disgusting.

424
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
Mooning?

425
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
I don't want to see all the stuff.

426
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
It's funny when it's a guy's butt.

427
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:21,440
Yeah, or if you have a fucking pink... if you have a pink... don't dog breathe about

428
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,440
the mooning girl.

429
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Don't you dare. Stop it.

430
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
But dude, I don't want to see.

431
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
No, stop man. We're not even...

432
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
Stop panting. Stop panting right now.

433
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Okay, we're changing subject completely. What movies have you guys seen as of late, I guess?

434
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,680
Here, let me tell you guys about this really humbling experience I had.

435
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,040

436

I walk in I was playing fortnight. I'll play eight hours of video games. I'll

464
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,500
walk in on a like a Saturday where I'm like, oh well, whatever it's a Saturday.

465
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,500
I can do whatever I want. I walk into the living room. My wife has the day off

466
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:44,620
to she's sitting there. She's knitted five scars. She literally looks exactly

467
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:49,300
like a granny like old grandmother, Tweety bird style granny. She's like

468
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,460
reading with one hand and doing that with the other. She has NPR playing like

469
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:57,580
what the fuck how how can you live like so much? How the hell can you live like

470
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,280
Why do women love yarn? Don't you want a Dorito, bitch? Don't you want to go to Buffalo Wild Wings

471
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:07,920
with me? What the hell are you doing? This is why I got to go there. I'm going to drive like 15

472
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:12,560
minutes out. I'm going to go to the Buffalo Wild Wings at Maspeth. Every single food that you eat

473
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:16,480
on a Saturday should be sauced. It should be tossed in a bowl with sauce. You should get the

474
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,320
sauce all over a white t-shirt. Even if it's Caesar salad. Yeah, and then you should watch

475
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,480
like... It should be the gross Caesar salad from the buffet. Every Saturday you should say,

476
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,760
I'm not really in the mood for a movie. I don't want to commit to that. Instead, I'm going to watch

477
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,000
15 episodes of a 45-minute TV show. That's what you should be spending your time. I'm going to

478
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,800
watch ridiculousness all day. Yeah, I'm going to I'm literally going to watch 12 hours of TV,

479
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:41,040
but a movie is too much. That's what it needs to be. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly that.

480
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,640
That's what the weekends are for. It's not for sitting there doing a hobby that's

481
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,360
that way. Make something literally she's making fucking spoiler for my mom. She's making Christmas

482
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,360
presents. Mom, she's making you a fucking criminal. Mom, shut off the episode right now. Mom,

483
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,960
turn it off. You're getting a fucking scar for this. Shut that, shut that. Computer off.

484
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,600
By the way, you're getting the worst one she made. You're getting the first one she made

485
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,680
because she made it and was like, I fucked this one up. I'll give it to your mom. Does

486
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,160
your mom listen to this? No. She doesn't know how to access YouTube. That's a good mom trait

487
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,420
to have that on YouTube. My mom texts me every once in a while, "Why don't you follow me

488
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:22,320
back on Instagram?" What the fuck is wrong with you? That's so mean. I don't want to

489
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,240
see your shit. Yeah, you don't want to see pictures of your brother? No dude, he's taller

490
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,240
than me. That's true. He's 12 years old, he's 6'2". You're seeing a picture of him next

491
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,720
to like a locker or something and it's like, "Man, I wish I could be that tall." Why a

492
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,040
locker? Basketball team. A locker has a certain height. He's not good at basketball, he's a

493
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:45,740
golfer. Oh yeah, he's got into golf. Okay. And he just is like zero. He's a kid. He has

494
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,200
like zero patience and he just like runs up to it. He's like, yeah, golf sucks. Hits it

495
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:55,540
so perfectly, like as hard as he can. Worst swing I've ever seen. It's so fucking, it's

496
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:59,480
fucked up, dude. Yeah. Happy Gilmore style. It's happening to me. Having a brother that

497
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,120
much younger than you, it really is fully just you're being replaced. Oh yeah. I'm being

498
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,440
replaced. He's funnier than me. He talks about fucking, he talks about his balls in a way

499
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:15,340
I could never at the dinner table and my balls are stink. They stink. Yeah, I go. That's fucking awesome, man

500
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:21,120
I said that shit when I was your age. My mom would kill me. Oh, I stopped talking about your stinky balls

501
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,680
Yeah, my sister my sister like lives with my mom so my nephews are still around like

502
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:35,520
Their grandparents so a lot of stuff is getting encouraged. That shouldn't yeah, I think I said it before but

503
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:42,300
They learned about breastfeeding. Oh, yeah, and they make each other they make fun of each other for having breastfed

504
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:49,900
They say yeah, but you sucked up mom's boobs to end arguments. They're right dude. That's crazy. That shit is a good comeback

505
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:58,460
That is just wrong man, yeah, we need to be all the it needs to be power everything should be powder

506
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,780
Oh, yeah, I think that that should not you should not be putting a baby on your stuff, man

507
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:07,940
man. Especially not fucking-- Especially mine. In my house. You're not sucking on my nipple.

508
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:12,020
No, dude. There's no milk in there. There's almost none. You're going to just get hair

509
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:16,500
in your mouth, you fucking idiot. Do you guys know about that's why Kevin Gates lost weight?

510
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,780
No. He lactated? No, he held his friend's baby and the baby tried to suck his tit and

511
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:28,580
then he lost like a hundred pounds. Damn. Yeah. That's so sick, man. That is really funny.

512
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,500
All right, I have I'd like to talk about my painting. Okay. I really would like to talk about my painting

513
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
I sent it to you Julio

514
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,580
Account like I think if you put some gel in it got to be glued

515
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,620
Yeah, you need got to be glue. No, I should have done do we still have the disposable razors here?

516
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,740
I could have oh you want to do you want to shave that I could shave it. I could shave it down like my

517
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:58,620
We need to oh

518
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:02,820
I get to play with this ring. No, you don't that's my fucking ring. Don't break. Whoa

519
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,320
I need to bring that back to my house. Well, how do you need to bring it back? That's a fucking wedding ring, man

520
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,460
This is your that's my wedding ring. This is what you engaged to your eyes. I sent it in the DM

521
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:22,020
Discord I did take this ring from from my fiance's jewelry box. She was asleep

522
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,300
story box? You are going to get in so much trouble for this. It's a piece of

523
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:33,780
plastic, man. I mean, let's be polite here. Okay. Well, apparent ring she wears.

524
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:39,460
Can't find it, but that's okay. I had to do a digital painting, guys. I'd like to

525
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,180
show this to y'all right now. Oh, there it is.

526
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:52,020
Where's the rings, man? Huh? Wait. You're right. There isn't any rings. Wait a

527
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,780
second hold on you want to know why there's no rings man why because this

528
00:33:55,780 --> 00:34:00,100
painting takes place in two thousand and twenty five when the rings

529
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:06,540
yep. What the hell I learned about that today. I heard about their disappearing

530
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,700
they're disappearing for some time. It's an eclipse of some type. What we won't

531
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,940
be able to see the rings of Saturn for a while. Holy shit. How sad is that? I

532
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:18,460
know I go out every night and I'm I see him. Here's a stupid. I am it's a part

533
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:23,500
I saw that I searched Saturn to get a reference photo. I saw the headline and

534
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,340
it was it said Saturn's rings are disappearing and I'm so stupid. I was

535
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:32,740
thinking that it had something to do with climate change. I also thought that

536
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:36,820
I also thought that I was like, wait, how does that even work? How does climate

537
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,020
change reach Saturn?

538
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:43,940
But it turns out it's actually just the sun doing something odd. Isn't it crazy

539
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,780
how many of the planets are just cold? They're all cold. I know, man, we need a

540
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,580
little more of that. Yeah, we need a little bit more of that. Do you think

541
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,720
we're going to enter a new ice age soon? Yeah, do you think we'll get back on

542
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:57,220
ice? It's a ball earth. You know they're trying to bring mammoths back. Why Joe

543
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:01,280
Rogan's buddy for meat? I know I well they brought back mammoth meat as like a

544
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,580
as like a stunt. Yeah, I did it as like a publicity thing where it was like they

545
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:09,020
like could they I think they had they can synthesize mammoth meat and they did

546
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,740
it to be like like oh doesn't this make you feel interestingly about cloning? Is

547
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,980
it this fascinating? You know that type of thing that they do sometimes not even

548
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:24,260
It's not even like there. You can get mammoth meat that is just like preserved in like a

549
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:27,180
big bunch of ice in like Alaska and stuff.

550
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,180
What?

551
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:33,140
Yeah. There's like people you find people find like almost fully preserved woolly mammoths.

552
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:34,140
What the hell?

553
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,100
Like beef jerky meat and some guy ate one.

554
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
Ew.

555
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,140
Isn't that gross? He ate like a 5,000 year old fucking meat.

556
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,140
I would not eat mammoth.

557
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,140
You've never seen the interview with that guy?

558
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,140
No, no, no.

559
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:46,940
No, no, no. He's a guy who owns like probably the most valuable like

560
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:53,040
archaeological site that exists right now in terms of like digging up cool

561
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,040
bones and stuff and he doesn't he won't let anybody go and dig on it. He just

562
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:02,440
digs it up finds mammoth tusks and then like sells them for like $20,000.

563
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:06,540
God damn. So sick. That is sick. I really I used to think that my number one

564
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,040
thing I needed in the world was for them to clone all the dinosaurs back to life.

565
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,080
No, but the five you don't hell is wrong.

566
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,000
Why you don't want to show the fucking dinosaur.

567
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,200
My God, you don't want to die.

568
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:20,040
So I mean, it's first of all, that was an I used to that started.

569
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,840
I know it was so crazy.

570
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,200
It pissed me off instantly.

571
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,600
It also pissed me off.

572
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,400
The fuck are you talking about?

573
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,160
We bring back that you want to bring back the dinosaurs.

574
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,800
Yeah, I want to bring back Hitler, too.

575
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,840
Oh, yeah. Let's fucking break.

576
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Let's go.

577
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,360
You know, they say I'm not watch the news lately.

578
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,040
They say I'm the Hitler of dinosaurs.

579
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,600
They say you're the Hitler of dinosaurs.

580
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:43,680
say it who the dinosaurs yeah obviously the American dinosaur anyway the five

581
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,760
weeks of planets has taught me that it's more important it would be better is

582
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:56,360
what what what is what you say nothing okay I was trying to make sure the joke

583
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:00,920
was airtight the joke of being Hitler of dinosaurs was airtight it's trying to

584
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:04,520
to make the acronym. Well, you didn't even use it. You didn't even use it in air.

585
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,280
H of D. What? H of D? What's that? The Hitler of Dinosaurs acronym? No, no,

586
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,880
the ADL, the American Dinosaur League. Oh, okay. Oh, yeah, okay, I'm getting it.

587
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,500
Like the Anti-Defamation League over there? Yeah. Alright, yeah. Do you want,

588
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,560
like... Look at my hair, y'all.

589
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,360
Sorry, what has the Five Weeks of Planets taught you? The Five Weeks of Planets

590
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,500
has taught me that instead of bringing all the dinosaurs back, we just should go

591
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,760
find a planet that's identical to Earth where there still are dinosaurs. Yes.

592
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,720
or it's a dinosaur. Don't have to be on or I got two words for you man and that

593
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,480
way we can see them in their natural habitat interacting with each other.

594
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,120
Good luck. I want to go to a planet that's identical to earth, but maybe the

595
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,200
radius, the diameter rather is

596
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,400
a couple inches smaller. So it's a it's completely identical to a couple inches,

597
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,160
but it's a little bit smaller. You feel a little bigger. You feel a little bit

598
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,460
here. I don't think you interesting and a plane flight will be shorter by by a

599
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:06,480
little by a small now very small by a very maybe even minute, but that adds up

600
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,400
over your lifetime. If you'd fly your entire life, I want to yeah, yeah, a

601
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,840
couple it's completely identical to earth, except it's got like got

602
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,160
restaurants called like small apple bees and small food record, but it's really

603
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,800
not that much. I mean you wouldn't even notice this because it's slightly

604
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,200
smaller because it's slightly smaller nature. I mean, you got to market that,

605
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,760
but you would be like, but check this out. Did you bring your you'd be you'd

606
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,420
land there, you go to charge your phone, the charger would not fit in your

607
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,620
charging. Oh true think about I mean we're talking about you and just we're

608
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:39,540
talking about inches smaller and the whole of the world. That's that's not

609
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,360
that much when you get to stuff that you in your daily life, a couple inches.

610
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,560
Well, I don't that's a that's a big amount for you're saying the whole like

611
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,060
everything will hire a few inches smaller. Wait everything everything

612
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:55,460
well, that's because he was saying they have small FUD records and stuff like

613
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,360
Well, but that's just what they would call it. I thought it was a marketing thing. Well,

614
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:06,360
it's so on that planet using their measurements, I would be 511. What size would your member

615
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,920
be? That's what I was thinking, too. I mean, that's kind of where I was going to be bigger

616
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:14,520
is that inches are what about our more penises get bigger, but the vaginas get a little smaller.

617
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:18,880
Well, I think they get a little bigger. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

618
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,200
we don't need that. We really don't need that ship humongous. We don't need a humongous

619
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,720
of a JJ on another planet. Do you guys believe in string theory? I believe in

620
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:35,720
G string theory. What up? Yeah, my theory is I like those. Bring those back. My

621
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,280
theory is I wanted to look like a floss. Yeah, I'm the G. I want to look like a floss.

622
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,720
String theory is just that a guy was like, I think everything is strings. He

623
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,720
was like, I think that there's a million strings. There's a million strings that

624
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,040
are rotating around. I think there's strings everywhere. Yeah, I haven't looked into it much.

625
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,280
That's pretty much what it is.

626
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,400
I would say that's the only category of 4-hour YouTube video that I've not delved into.

627
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,640
That was something I thought I could try to understand when I was in like third or fourth

628
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
grade.

629
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Yeah.

630
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,640
I was like, "Damn, string theory."

631
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Is that the one...

632
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,640
So badass.

633
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,200
Remember we were in Texas and I bought that board and it had like the...

634
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
Who designed that?

635
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,840
That was like a John.

636
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,680
He designed that board for Sci-Fi Fantasy and it's got the QR code on it and there's

637
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,200
a video that's like...

638
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,880
Yeah, it's a cemetery plot.

639
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,100
has got a QR code on it and the QR code takes you to a video that's like 10 year old boy

640
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:35,340
describes or explains string theory. That's so web 3. That was me man. That was me explaining

641
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,560
string theory at 10 years old. That video has got like 4.3 million views and it's just

642
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,120
a kid explaining or I think it's quantum physics. I don't really know what it is. It's explaining

643
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,940
all of quantum physics? Yeah I think so. I already told you guys about the kid who explains

644
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,940
God and the loser has a schizophrenic mom and on. Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. You have told me about

645
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:00,620
you did tell me that boy. Oh, my Facebook group got in trouble. Y'all what happened?

646
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:05,220
There's a police. There's no there's a problem in my Facebook. Oh, and also I got some new

647
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:10,420
text from Patrick. Wait a minute. What are we doing? Hold on. I need to. We're losing

648
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:14,860
the plot. Just reminded me to look at my phone. I just need to show you. Here's here's the

649
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:18,620
general. So, you know, Facebook groups have like a chat where it adds a general chat. Now

650
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:19,720
what's going on right now.

651
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:26,020
Oh my God, I can't show this because this is a YouTube episode. This is HD porn

652
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,320
videos from right now. It's been we've been being spammed by HD porn videos.

653
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,460
Well, I got a click on the talk in the happy birthday. Cameron might be

654
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:40,360
these are my group members wishing me happy birthday man. I you kind of

655
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,520
violated my privacy by scrolling back in my Facebook group right now.

656
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,920
it's okay. It's normal for people in a facebook group to wish the admin happy

657
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:54,140
birthday. I don't think that's it's no, then why are they doing it? Andrew and

658
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:55,800
Brenda and Anthony always happy

659
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,340
they're your closest friends now. Yeah, nice of them. It looks like Anthony

660
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,140
waited to do it till July. Twenty nine, that's twenty five days late.

661
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:08,860
Patrick has been sending me more text again the last couple of months in the

662
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,860
last time I read these. I think we just need to catch up a little bit. Okay,

663
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,640
"Bruh, what did I eat last night? My diarara smells so bad."

664
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,640
Did we say that one? Okay, well we didn't get to this one, I know.

665
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,640
This weather literally makes me want to...

666
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,640
No, we got to this one.

667
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,640
No, we didn't. There's no way.

668
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,640
Yes, yes we did. I remember.

669
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
No, you're not remembering this right.

670
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,640
Scroll down a little more, read past that one. There's probably more.

671
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,640
And Andy Kaufman invented trolling before it was even a thing.

672
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,640
What time did I send that?

673
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
That was at midnight.

674
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:43,920
Five in the morning an IPA is just pumpkin spice latte for basic white roots

675
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,760
right

676
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,760
Five in the morning and then he says

677
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,360
Yeah, and then shortly after dear guitar guys at the party. Congratulations

678
00:42:53,360 --> 00:43:01,200
Congratulations douche you can print sees kinda play the first three chords to a Dave Matthews song

679
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,400
She'll totally be impressed by your glaring originality

680
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:10,160
That one was good. I sent you my salt and pepper picture instead of these two having a

681
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,040
mid-off, you didn't respond at all. What did I say? You said the next day, "My pet

682
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:21,760
peeve is NPCs that act like the main character." Right? And then you

683
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,760
said, "I love Kate Bush and Snoopy."

684
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:37,040
And then I said, "What you do if I cash app 10 bands and tell you to drop picks in my IG?"

685
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,040
Oh yes.

686
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,040
And you said, "Boy, stop."

687
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,280
And I said, "I'm dead ass."

688
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,280
When was that?

689
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,280
And then you didn't say anything.

690
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
That was November 4th.

691
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,280
Was I in Chicago then?

692
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,280
Yes, I was.

693
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,160
Imagine how good it probably feels to have a pussy and get fucked in it really hard and

694
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
fast.

695
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
You said that.

696
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,160
No, that's you, man.

697
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,000
And then you said, "Do you like X videos or RedTube more?"

698
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
And then you said, "Do you think Jaboukie would rap on an OJ the Alien beat?"

699
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,480
That's a genuine question. I think Jaboukie would. They've been making raps. I listen

700
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
to them.

701
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,680
Oh, God. All right, speaking of.

702
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:09,680
Yeah, speaking of raps.

703
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,680
I think it's about time.

704
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,680
Yeah, hit it.

705
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,680
No fucking cap.

706
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,680
I want to hear this, man.

707
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,680
Yeah.

708
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,680
You want to hear this shit?

709
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,680
I'm really excited.

710
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,080
Well, intro. So this is obviously a galactic space rock landed on Earth with a CD in a

711
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,840
jewel case perfectly sitting in it.

712
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
Yeah.

713
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
Another one.

714
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
That's exactly what I think.

715
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
Another one.

716
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:30,480
that. Yeah, so I think we need to hear it. What's this one about?

717
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,280
And we are processing the video. That's not good. Processing the video? Check back

718
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,520
later? How's that even possible? Hit refresh. How's it still processing? Did I

719
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:50,000
accidentally export it to be three hours long? Did I? I don't know. Can we pause real

720
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:58,640
quick so I can check this. We're back. And we're back y'all. And we're back with a track

721
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:03,120
man. We're back with a track. Hit it. I'm so fucking excited to hear this y'all. Wait

722
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:14,120
did that say featuring B-Lack? What? Yup. Featuring B-Lack. Smoke rings on Saturday.

723
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:21,120
When I turned three I started smoking tree Got it from a guy and his name was weed

724
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:28,120
He was also three, made me feel like shit Every day I wish I never smoked on it

725
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:34,120
When I turned four I went to the store Saw a lemon there and I purchased four

726
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:41,120
Then I circled back and I purchased more Didn't feel like shit, I loved it

727
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,120
Ate a lemon everyday in my cockpit

728
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,120
Got a clementine and I washed it

729
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,120
When I eat fruit I go dog shit

730
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:53,120
I love fruit y'all

731
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,120
Wait who's that?

732
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,120
Ah shit, I just woke up on fuckin' Saturn

733
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Is that B-Lack?

734
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,120
I think that is B-Lack

735
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,120
Oh my god

736
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,120
Last thing I remember I was sippin' number 5

737
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,120
Woke up on another planet

738
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,120
Hella aliens outside

739
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,120
Alien rides

740
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,120
Green girls

741
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,320
Alien guys on Saturn, me and OJ splitting alien fries

742
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:17,920
Doing big things on other planets, we smoking fat sacks

743
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,320
I need big rings, like the one that's in my ass crack

744
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,520
Spit a 16, licked green, where the cash at?

745
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:27,820
OJ passed a roach, I'ma kill you if you ash that

746
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,120
At the Beverly, integrity just got the best of me

747
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,320
Don't usually smoke, but tonight I'm puffing heavily

748
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:37,620
With a bad bitch, one dollar, she showed her breast to me

749
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:48,620
*rapping*

750
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:50,120
*retching*

751
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,120
Wait, what happened to him?

752
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
Oh no.

753
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,120
What happened to him?

754
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:53,620
*rapping*

755
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,120
NOOOOOO!

756
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,120
Oh no.

757
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,120
No!

758
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,620
Cause he drank the perfume.

759
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:05,120
Oh my god, dude, he should have just smoked the Tegrity Farms weed that OJ fucking gave him, bro.

760
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,120
He was back on the fume.

761
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,120
He's bad.

762
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,220
Man, that shit is just too sad.

763
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:14,320
Yeah, a guy, a rapper dies on planet Earth.

764
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,920
This is a story as old as time.

765
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,420
Yeah, they overdose on planet Earth.

766
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:20,020
They wake up on a different planet.

767
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:22,420
They start smoking tree, which is good for you.

768
00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:25,420
It's herbal and then they go back to the fucking drug that

769
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:26,320
killed him in the first place.

770
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,620
They die again on that planet.

771
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:28,620
It's so fucked.

772
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,320
It's so funny.

773
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:29,620
I do.

774
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,720
I see this time and time again.

775
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,220
God gave you a second chance at life and you're throwing it

776
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,020
away to fucking drink perfume, man.

777
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,120
You want to drink perfume?

778
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:39,600
What the fuck is that? You want to drink perfume? You really want to drink perfume? It's not

779
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,040
good for you. It is not good. The high isn't even that good, man. The high is terrible.

780
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,240
No, what? Your breath smells better? Yeah, you drink. It smells like shit. Like, if you

781
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:52,040
drink, when you drink enough of it, the most you can hope for is you start seeing the flower,

782
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:57,720
man. Exactly. Yeah. Like, that's best case. That's like the nice guy version of the hat,

783
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:02,640
man. Yeah. For Benadryl. Well, it's because it's aromatic. Yeah, it's aromatic. It's a

784
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,480
guy. He's not a flower. He just smells like one. Oh, really? Oh, wow. He's not a flower.

785
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,620
He just smells like one. He's a normal guy who smells like a flower. Oh, okay. Does perfume

786
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:17,760
usually smell like a flower? No. What the fuck does perfume smell like? Perfume is different

787
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:22,280
kind of things. What the hell is esters? It's a chemical compound that they use in crossword

788
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:28,440
clues. Nope. It's a woman. That's if you have an H in it. What the hell? Sorry, guys. I'm

789
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,240
I'm on a different letter mode today.

790
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,800
You are on a different letter mode.

791
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,120
You're boxing the letters, man.

792
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,120
David Letter Mode.

793
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:35,120
Damn.

794
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
David Letter Mode.

795
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,120
David Letter Mode.

796
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,280
I saw him tell a joke earlier today.

797
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,280
What was it?

798
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,400
So get this, guys.

799
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
He's interviewing Mike.

800
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:44,400
Get this.

801
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,400
Drew Barrymore is stupid.

802
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,400
Well, that.

803
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,720
But he's also in an interview with Michael Jordan, the greatest basketball player of all

804
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,720
time.

805
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:56,320
And Michael Jordan has the pair of Jordans that he's not allowed to play with on court,

806
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,680
the black and red ones.

807
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:00,680
and he says, Dave Letterman says, "Why aren't you allowed to play with these?"

808
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,920
And he's holding it, and Michael Jordan says, "Because there's no white on it."

809
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,920
And Letterman goes, "Well, there's not any in the NBA either," and then throws the

810
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,920
shoe away.

811
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:10,920
That's right.

812
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:15,560
He was so mad about there being no white guys in the NBA that he threw the Michael Jordan

813
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,560
shoe.

814
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,880
Does he know that there are white guys in the NBA?

815
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:19,880
Luca Doncis.

816
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,880
Brian Scalabrine.

817
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,480
Brian Scalabrine used to be.

818
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,480
Zaza Pachulia.

819
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,880
Zaza Pachulia used to be white.

820
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,880
Yeah.

821
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,420
yeah, dude, he used to be wise to be white. We don't know what happened

822
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:33,080
turned to a different whole because I mean a joke like that. I can stomach,

823
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,560
but a factual inaccuracy is always tough on me. I mean this was this was in the

824
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:41,260
era of Larry Bird, Larry Bird, the greatest basketball player of all country

825
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,080
Reeves. Yeah,

826
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:49,960
have you ever heard the stories about Larry Bird? Yeah, where he was like he's

827
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,120
like punching people in the nuts and we just say like spitting on people like

828
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:56,940
the fucking guys wives to like fuck you be better at that yeah and he looks like

829
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,180
that yeah and he was just like the biggest shit talker of all time. He

830
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,120
was tell people like straight up, I'm going to kill you yeah and then he would

831
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,700
win did yeah. So bad power kind of dope over your world,

832
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:13,380
fucking they use pictures of Larry Bird for click bait all the time and there is

833
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:17,140
one that I saw yeah, there always is as with his face and it's like what the

834
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:21,040
fuck is wrong with him. Well, I saw one that was like Larry Bird's disgusting

835
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,500
wife

836
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:30,340
like yeah, it's crazy that he as he gets older, looks more and more like a bird.

837
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:35,180
It is crazy. He looks like a nose never stops growing, which is bad. Bad nose

838
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:37,740
news for me man. I got a big, big pointy nose

839
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:43,140
guys. I feel like we I feel like we held that face. I feel like we glossed over

840
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:47,060
that track. That track was fire. Sorry. We talked about it made me. It made me

841
00:50:47,060 --> 00:50:52,660
want to smoke up. I don't want to spark. It made me want to spark that show dude.

842
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,500
literally did you know one of the first verse made me want to roll up a blunt

843
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:00,300
fatter than a chipotle burrito road. Did you not listen to the first verse? I

844
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:03,420
honestly went right over my head. You didn't I didn't understand a word that

845
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:06,820
was being said in the first verse. It was to hip hop. It was way to rap. It's

846
00:51:06,820 --> 00:51:10,780
like when your mom says that you can't understand a rap song and yeah, Kanye

847
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:16,300
West, yeah, yeah, just makes a wild guess about who is yeah, it's the sugar

848
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:21,260
hill gang. Yeah, it was it was a mate. I will say did because obviously we

849
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:25,280
the lab don't know it was amazing to see your process as a writer. Yeah, I

850
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,620
spent two hours on the beat and about two minutes

851
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:35,960
about two minutes. Yeah, but the beat was fire. The beat was fire. I do the

852
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,820
same thing that I do. I do the same thing that I do every single time. I

853
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:44,620
find I look up the oldest song in my library and then not the oldest, but I

854
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:49,560
look up old songs in the library. I go by date and then for some reason I keep

855
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:55,100
picking Scott Walker songs and then I just pick one part of that song and

856
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:56,300
that's it. That's all you need to do.

857
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,100
Isn't Scott Walker like a governor or something?

858
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,820
Bro, Scott Walker and the Walker brothers were like the Beatles for England,

859
00:52:02,820 --> 00:52:04,020
but they were American.

860
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,700
The Beatles were English.

861
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,140
They were the American Beatles.

862
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,220
They were the American Beatles that went over there.

863
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:11,180
That's Leonard Skinner.

864
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,860
The Walker brothers went there while the Beatles went to the States.

865
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,500
Do you think they crossed by each other on the...

866
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,660
They probably flew it.

867
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:24,340
over the streams. Yeah, probably if they would. Yes, that's no, I know. I think that is. That's

868
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,660
what would happen. Yeah, yeah, they cross the streams and then we ended up with fucking

869
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:34,060
Katy Perry, man. Yeah, or Nicki Minaj, I guess the perfect combination of English and American.

870
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:38,460
That's true. Why did she start pretending to be British? She pretended to have multiple

871
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,340
personality disorder. She thinks that shit and she ripped that shit off from Tyler, the

872
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,440
creator. Yeah, yeah. She had what was it Romans revenge and she had a personality

873
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,640
named Roman who is the most evil rapper of all time.

874
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:57,560
Oh Slim Shady vibes. Yeah and then she had a different one that was like this

875
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,460
is my pop persona. I wish it was more acceptable to have a Slim Shady. Yeah

876
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,920
what is it with what is it with hip-hop and rap that makes everybody their

877
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,680
personality split? Dude it's because you fucking get in the booth you spaz out.

878
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,600
You change. You become a different person altogether. Yeah master of disguise style.

879
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:15,560
so I mean it happens. It's having all three of us at this come another

880
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,640
person, not become another. Yeah, now keep go. Let's keep going. Another

881
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,000
person do into the account, go to the accent that he does another person

882
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,600
become another person, become another person

883
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:28,000
is getting like one percent to far

884
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,200
getting in big trouble, getting in a lot of trouble. Yeah, there is something

885
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,120
about rap that just you go into that booth man and you become where

886
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,240
pistachio disguise. He would be the best rapper of all time. He oh my God, they

887
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,320
have a rap at the end yeah. They had a song who's can you look that up right

888
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:50,960
now? Who the man who sings the master of disguise at the end of that movie,

889
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,760
because there's a song at the end. That's like he's the master master of

890
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:02,400
disguise and they used to have. They used to have a rap at the end of every

891
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,400
movie that was

892
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,620
explaining the master disguise, happen credit song. Every movie used to have a

893
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,820
rap. It had a rap at the end that explained the whole thing. Deep blue sea.

894
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:19,240
Yep, this is always do will spend his family. Oh boy, the stripe pajamas,

895
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,900
M A S T E R. That's what it was

896
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,200
by Byron. We need to bring that shit back. That's our new, that's the, that's

897
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,580
the next, the next album. The next album is

898
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,220
every movie that's coming out that yeah, a credit song for yeah, that's a great

899
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:43,820
idea. The the bitch yeah, the hard heads M A S T E R. That's the name of that

900
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:46,140
song. Don't hear much from the hard heads now.

901
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:50,800
Yeah, I wanna know what what songs the hard heads have done. I think that we

902
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,320
need to make

903
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:55,240
a movie that's maybe thirty seconds long and then yeah, and then

904
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:00,260
an hour and a half credits. Yeah, just because we gotta get it. I mean you

905
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:03,980
to be inspired if you're making music. Yeah. Yeah. So we need a story first. We need to

906
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:07,620
have a little bit. I guess we could just make the song actually. Yeah, make the song and

907
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,260
then work backwards. There needs to be more storytelling songs like you did with OJ last

908
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:17,500
week. Yeah. You know, like you need to have, we need to do one that is like, but you know

909
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:24,740
what I want them to bring back man? The 70s, the 80s, the 60s. What length were these songs?

910
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:29,500
11 minutes? Boogie Me and Rhapsody, Free Bird. These are some long ass songs. Stairway to

911
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:34,060
Now that now it is the only people who do long songs or stinky homeless stoner

912
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:39,180
rockers. Exactly dude. I don't want this 60 hour song called like flirt. Yeah,

913
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,020
I listen to flirt. Well, that's pretty good.

914
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:49,620
No,

915
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:57,860
if in the new dune movie that planet where they do all the throat singing, if

916
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,860
if there were guys who got shoved in lockers on that planet,

917
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,360
they would be making that music.

918
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,360
They'd pop out making music right after that.

919
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:11,860
There's a van around here that has the Dope Smoker vinyl cover on the window.

920
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,860
It's so sick.

921
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:16,860
I think that they are part of the screen printing company.

922
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,860
I see that shit all the time.

923
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:22,860
The Dope Smoker album cover is so tight.

924
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,860
Yeah, it is sick.

925
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:25,360
I don't like that name, man.

926
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,520
if you'd like this album cover, it would remind you of maybe a caravan of a

927
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:31,700
guitar player. If you're going to make a music, already an album called the

928
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:36,100
from who man, Mr Rock and Roll, that guy doesn't fucking

929
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:41,100
guitar player by Mr. Yeah, he plays a birthday song. Yeah, I remember that

930
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:46,240
that's a good one, but I think that needs to have been the first ever rock

931
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,760
and roll album. They need to be like they get that's yeah. Let's look at the

932
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:51,860
history of rock and roll. The first rock and roll album was called the guitar

933
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,520
player by Mr. Rock and there was always a song. Everything about there was always

934
00:56:56,520 --> 00:57:01,520
a song like that, and if the let's twist by old Shelby checker, then he did let's

935
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,920
twist again, but then there was like rock around the clock. Yeah, rock and roll

936
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,080
something around the genre anymore. There's no song. There's no song that's

937
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:15,360
called like chill last beats to my mom in the crib. Yes, rapping at my house.

938
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:15,880
Yeah, yeah.

939
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:21,120
What's the new? I guess hyper pop is the new genre popping or demise it

940
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:27,600
Zit? Hyper popping my zit. Hyper oh, I thought you said hyper pop my zit. I thought you were

941
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:34,600
saying that my zit was a genre of music. No, no, no. That could be though. Yeah, zit music.

942
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,200
You never know with these kids. Have you guys heard of this? It's just that sound. You know

943
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,240
what is the worst music genre I've ever heard in my life that you showed me the other day?

944
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:50,280
Funk or fonk. You don't like fonk? No, man. This is bad music. It is not good, but the

945
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:57,160
song that it sounds like that clown song. The song that is good is meet yo maker by

946
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:01,400
Tommy Wright. No that's a good song. Can't be good man. You've never heard meet yo

947
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:08,640
maker? What is it? How does it go? I don't think I'm gonna like that shit. I don't

948
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:11,680
think I'm gonna like that shit. No you would love that song. I don't actually

949
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,800
like that song. It's actually some kind of it's actually DJ Paul. I like the

950
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:19,520
that Brazilian genre that I don't know the name of that everyone always posts a

951
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,720
a video on Twitter. I've never listened to it outside of just a embedded. How

952
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,540
does it go? It's just always it's always these it's always Brazilian women just

953
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:29,420
shaking ass crazy and the song is like

954
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:34,780
what is that? I think I've called one.

955
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:39,900
It literally sounds insane. It sounds like something is breaking in the

956
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,840
computer. It's so funny because it's all the videos are just completely women

957
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,280
twerking. Yeah, it sounds like they for they accidentally shut off something.

958
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,260
yeah, yeah, exactly they sound. It sounds like they closed the program in the

959
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,020
middle, yeah, and the vocals are always really quiet, like it's always a guy in

960
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,900
they turn a base and he's like

961
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,620
they turn the base of way to

962
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:04,700
I really have been getting into Mariachi recently. Wow Mariachi is in a bond.

963
00:59:04,700 --> 00:59:09,900
It's bond. I've been I've been poisoned against bond because they play it loudly

964
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:13,780
near my house and it's so good man. It's out. It sounds really happy and then you

965
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,700
read the lyrics and then they're in Spanish, but then you translate the

966
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:24,140
lyrics and they're like who's this guy peso pluma. Oh, he's awesome. He's good. I

967
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:29,100
like that all the lyrics are all they're like but then you read the lyrics and

968
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,100
it's like my mom died. My brother died. My entire family died. My dog died by

969
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:37,420
crash. My car. I went to jail. I fell in a canyon and I have what's the name of

970
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:42,340
that dude. There's a bond a singer. I think he was a bond. No, what is it? I

971
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:46,020
feel bonded to you guys. I don't know what it was over this planet ship. This

972
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,020
planet ship funny.

973
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,620
Julio, who's this guy, the cartel hands him a note while he's singing and they tell him

974
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,980
they're going to kill him at the end of the song.

975
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:54,980
Why would you give somebody...

976
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:56,740
What kind of fucking note is that?

977
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:57,740
Who is that?

978
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:02,340
Do you know who I'm talking about?

979
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,460
Who the fuck, why the fuck would you hand him a... just kill him.

980
01:00:05,460 --> 01:00:06,460
Donino Sanchez?

981
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:07,460
He was killed.

982
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,780
Yeah, he was perfect.

983
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,380
There's a video of him, they give him the note while he's singing and then, dude, he

984
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,940
fucking, he goes off too.

985
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:21,860
he performs it's like a performance of a lifetime. He pops off. That's him looking at a note

986
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:26,580
that says he's about to be killed just now? Yep. That's why he's like crying. That is

987
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:31,480
an awful video. This is horrible. I don't want to watch this. No, dude, he goes off.

988
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:37,220
This is going to haunt me. You know what I would do, man? Wow, that is a beautiful voice.

989
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:42,820
He had an amazing voice. They're going to kill him if he starts singing. If he starts

990
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:45,020
what yeah as he

991
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:48,200
is going on.

992
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,820
There's no singing in this

993
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:56,400
the we're going to kill you. If you sing, go to a concert,

994
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,880

995
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,140
the other guys can play their instruments, but you just can't say did

01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:40,660
It's not that serious yeah. Oh, you know what? I probably what maybe his

1004
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:44,620

1006
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:50,620
thought about it for like seven.

1007
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:58,920
I'll just fucking say I'm going to kill you. He's like he's like I should I

1008
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,380
yes

1009
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:01,320
well yeah.

1010
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:07,620
These people paid four dollars to be in this bar. I have to fucking sing yeah.

1011
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:12,500
that's crazy that the amount of time that he's yeah thinking about it. Fuck it,

1012
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,700
fuck it. I guess my life's not that good yeah yeah. I guess I'm just a famous

1013
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:18,280
singer. It's actually not that good to think about how awesome this will look

1014
01:02:18,280 --> 01:02:22,040
on Wikipedia yeah. This YouTube video about to be popping off man yeah he

1015
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:27,260
knew about YouTube yeah when they invent video essays yeah. Oh God, that is an

1016
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:33,980
awful story, but again kind of fully his fault. Yeah, wait Julio is that this is

1017
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:38,020
Is that the true correct story? They said if you sing right now, we will shoot you.

1018
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:42,020
He wasn't there, Matt. I hope so.

1019
01:02:42,020 --> 01:02:46,020
He was there. He shot him. Well, he said it. Wait, unknown assailants killed him.

1020
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:50,020
Shot by unidentified assailants, so it could have been you.

1021
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:54,020
Could have been Julio. Just go to the Wikipedia page. Just pull up the Wikipedia page.

1022
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:58,020
Wait a minute. Jalino Sanchez. Did you do this, Julio?

1023
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:02,020
I think it's possible. Now, scroll to the... just scroll to where he was killed.

1024
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:07,120
he was killed. He was attacked by Eduardo Galagos while performing at the Plaza

1025
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:10,860
Los Arcos Restaurant and Nightclub. Sanchez was shot twice near his armpit,

1026
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:14,900
striking his lung, ensuring ensuing a gunfight. Don't shoot my bro in the

1027
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,540
armpit, man. No, don't ever get shot in the armpit. That's fucking stinky. Yeah,

1028
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:21,980
it's stinky, but that's where a big artery is. You're about to unleash a

1029
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,300
stink bomb on the entire-- Can you please just go to the heading murder?

1030
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:26,840
What I want to see, I want to learn about this.

1031
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:32,140
under the Coachella incident. Whoa, he was handed a note from someone in the

1032
01:03:32,140 --> 01:03:34,480
crowd. The note is believed to have been a death threat, but has not been

1033
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:37,840
confirmed. Okay, and that shows him crumpling up the note before singing the

1034
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:41,540
song after midnight, while that he drove away from the club after midnight. So

1035
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:45,260
there's there's a problem man. You got to leave early at midnight. That's when

1036
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,940
crime comes out and they gave him a fake police ID and said we're we're we're

1037
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:52,500
coppers. Yeah, and yep

1038
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:56,180
shot in the back of the head twice. That's a bad way to go. Actually, it's

1039
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:59,860
that's the best way to go now I think about it. Yeah, but you know what it's

1040
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:03,300
probably a really bad way to go. If you got handed a note that said, yeah,

1041
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:07,180
we're going to do this. I'm going to shoot you in the back of the head twice

1042
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:09,620
if you sing. Yeah, I don't think that that's what the

1043
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:17,140
I don't think that's what the note said. Well, I believe, yeah, I believe it

1044
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:21,260
too. If you want to see me sing a Donda song or what's it called bond bonda

1045
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:27,300
song come to the yard theater and Los Angeles, California on the 17th guys.

1046
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,860
I'm going to be doing all sorts of songs, karaoke vibes at this stand up show. Me

1047
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:35,940
and my buddy Gus Fivera come through two shows. We made it y'all halfway halfway

1048
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,940

1051
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,040
Isn't it funny that the way they found out to make it not funny still sounds

1052
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:56,260
like urine? Yeah, you're in us. Yeah, sounds like p.

1053
01:04:56,260 --> 01:05:01,840
You're in us group of a bunch of scientists trying to be like how can we

1054
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:05,220
get people to stop laughing? No, you're a good way to say it now. You

1055
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:07,780
shouldn't have named it that motherfucker run well

1056
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:09,980
and tape around

1057
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:13,580
and I need it that with the you say hey guess what scientists you shouldn't

1058
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:16,380
have named it as shit motherfucker. You fucking idiot

1059
01:05:17,940 --> 01:05:20,540
- What's up, scientist? - What the fuck is up, bitch?

1060
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:22,540
- What the fuck is up, scientist motherfucker? - I love him.

1061
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:24,540
- Alright, bye my friends. - Bye bye.

1062
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:30,540
The Joy of Jupiter, a planet report.

1063
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:35,540
Jupiter is by far the largest planet in our solar system.

1064
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:38,540
That is, if you don't count planet Lizzo.

1065
01:05:38,540 --> 01:05:44,540
One year on Jupiter is the equivalent of almost 12 years on Earth

1066
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:47,540
or roughly the time it takes my girlfriend to get ready to go out.

1067
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,540
(laughs)

1068
01:05:49,540 --> 01:06:03,540
Oh damn.

1069
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,540
Holy shit.

1070
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:12,540
Okay.

1071
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:19,540
Jupiter is named after the Roman king of the gods because yeah, somehow gods weren't powerful enough. We need a god that's also a king.

1072
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:26,540
I was waiting for the clap at the end of the paragraph.

1073
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:32,540
There are 95 confirmed moons orbiting Jupiter. Don't let Buzz Aldrin find that out or he'll kill himself.

1074
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:41,540
[Laughter]

1075
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:45,540
Let's talk about Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

1076
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:48,540
And no, those aren't the names of Angelina Jolie's children.

1077
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:51,540
[laughter]

1078
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:55,540
Those are the four Galilean moons of Jupiter, more massive than the others.

1079
01:06:55,540 --> 01:06:58,540
They were discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei,

1080
01:06:58,540 --> 01:07:02,540
who takes his name from the famous dinner gibberish scene from Billy Madison.

01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,540
[laughter]

1082
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,540
Europa, the Galilean moon second closest to Jupiter,

1083
01:07:07,540 --> 01:07:10,540
may have a water ocean underneath its surface,

1084
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:14,140
which means it could conceivably be home to extraterrestrial life.

1085
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:16,540
"Wow, how exciting!" said nobody ever.

1086
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:19,540
It's often been said, and this is the conclusion.

1087
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,540
This is where I get kind of real.

1088
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:26,540
It's often been said that girls go to college to get more knowledge

1089
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:29,040
and boys go to Jupiter to get more stupider.

1090
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,540
But with modern science, we know the truth.

1091
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:35,540
It's actually girls that go to Jupiter to get more stupider

1092
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:40,040
and boys go to the planet report to get more handsome and smart.

1093
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:44,040
[Applause]
