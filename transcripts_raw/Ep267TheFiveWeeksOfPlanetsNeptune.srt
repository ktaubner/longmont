1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:20,300
move it down, then you can see it in the frame. Remind you of anything man.

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,340
It reminds me of a Neptune,

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,640
which is today's don't do that's going to fuck up a cable or something.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,720
it's supposed to be our prop for the day. Now it's gone. Now the prop for the

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,740
day. You've ruined the prop of the day. Well, it's quite close. Well, I could

7
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,780
crazily easily get that. You guys, we completely blew ourselves.

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,260
Oh, I remember that. Tobias. No, we did a video where we were all in blue face

9
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,340
paint. But we didn't say blew ourselves in that. That's straight up from Tobias.

10
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,300
Yeah. We became completely blue. We should have got the fucking face paint

11
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:59,340
dude. We saw a blue face man over there. We could do it. No, I'm not doing it. No,

12
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,660
that's a bitch to take off.

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,260
But maybe this was okay. But hold on. Okay, do it again, though. Okay,

14
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,860
and we're blue. No, we're actually we're not. If you're listening at home,

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,660
imagine us blue. Imagine we blew ourselves right there. Blue.

16
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:20,940
No, no, no, no, no, guys. How the fuck is the East Coast been man? I've been

17
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,980
gone out of you have been gone. You have been gone. I've been out.

18
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:27,460
Howdy dude. Tell me dude. I've missed so many different aspects of the East

19
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,020
Coast bro. Last night I went to Guitar Center to buy new bass strings and

20
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,420
then I saw through, I think it was the Morgan L. There was a

21
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:40,520
homeless fella sitting on the bench and I thought that he was jacking off,

22
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,240
but I guess what he was doing was under his jacket, flipping off everyone

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,740
on the bus. That's sick. On the train. That's cool. He's sitting there

24
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:54,020
lifting the jacket up doing like a little what's wrong with you. I think

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:57,140
everybody's any homeless person. I thought it was jacking off because the

26
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:01,220
hand motion, but he was just flipping little birds at everyone. It was so

27
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,680
sick. He was jacking off with the other hand. Maybe he was jacking off with the

28
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,580
other. He was jacking off to being disrespectful yeah

29
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,780
get a homeless person. I screw you. I think this is maybe the second episode

30
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,660
in a row. We started with talking about homeless. Yeah, we got to start

31
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,220
talking about it. We it makes us we're leaving Earth. No, it doesn't it doesn't

32
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:22,420
it's fine to say whatever you want about whoever you want. Yeah, do you say

33
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,760
what I change my mind all that you change? He's got has been sleepy as

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,160
fuck without you really bro. I'm honestly life has ground to a halt dude.

35
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,400
I knew that I've been doing a vegetable and fruit puzzle playing some video

36
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,660
game. You left you and I got a vegetable and fruit puzzle. I've there's so

37
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:41,500
one as today. He needs to do a vegetable and fruit so much stress in my life

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:46,420
that I got into sins right yeah. I started chewing sins. I show you

39
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,020
them. I chewed them and I swallowed all the salt. Bro, you got to drop the zins

40
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,840
and get on the different zins, the Zinfandels. The Zinfandels, I should.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,980
You have to become a connoisseur. I should. Exactly. Zinfandel, by the way,

42
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,140
very fancy wine. I

43
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,020
bought zins and not even thinking about it, picked out the citrus flavor.

44
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,540
Which reminding who you are. Reminding me of a little green fella that I need

45
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,180
to talk about immediately, because there was a problem. What was the problem?

46
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,620
So...

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,620
so

48
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,620
you reach a register. I never heard before.

49
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:24,620
Me and my friend,

50
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:27,120
okay, it's been, you know,

51
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,620
it's been rough. It's been rough. I've been dealing with a lot of stressful

52
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,620
stuff and I've been having to deal with this fucking OJ, the alien guy,

53
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,620
and so I got writer's block. I have to write all the songs for him and then

54
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,120
you've been writing the songs for I've been writing the songs and he's my God.

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,800
He is he has been rapping yeah. I'm a ghost your oh my God. I'm not you

56
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,100
probably wrote Dr. Dazzle's verse two right no, but I right that makes sense.

57
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,440
That's a different. What about be likes

58
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:02,300
I don't know, but I've been writing all of the I wrote all of OJ's. I write

59
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:06,120
them as writer. I had no idea, so I'm getting I hate writers block. I call up

60
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,920
my friend Rupert Rupert's a very talented musician and

61
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:16,960
OJ hits me back and says, "No, I don't need you and Rupert. I have already written the

62
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,480
Neptune song with DJ Gleptar."

63
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
No.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,920
So, me and Rupert, I mean Rupert flew all the way here from Los Angeles to record and then

65
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,920
--

66
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
And from Australia to Los Angeles.

67
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Yeah, and then we had to --

68
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
And from somewhere else.

69
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,920
And from his mother to the earth.

70
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,960
Yeah, we had to send him back. I'm down 3K.

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,960

72
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Studio time plus airplane.

73
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,320
Where does a store get the kids from?

74
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,620
I don't know planet baby, but so he's going through space and the baby has to

75
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,920
hold its breath. Well, that's why I work with wings and not a crawling animal

76
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,440
like a toad. You guys a toad will a toad would jump. I was thinking of a

77
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,340
horned toad, which is a lizard. We're going to get right into the I pictured

78
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,580
in my head. We're going to go right into it.

79
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,200
Just leave that alone. It's completely true, but I don't

80
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:08,160
we're going to get right into the OJ. The alias we're doing the song first.

81
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,360
We're doing the song first. Just like Mercury, we're doing the song first.

82
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,120
The song before the Planet Report? Yes. Holy shit. All right.

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,780
Because, you guys, this song has ruined my life.

84
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,900
Julio? Oh, Julio's here. I'm here. By the way. Oh, yeah, wait. Switch to your

85
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,180
camera. Yeah. Is it on? Say hello. It's off. It's off. Well, he's right there,

86
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,980
guys. He's behind the laptop. I think he put himself into the bar in there.

87
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,820
Ow.

88
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,140

134
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:42,220
So apparently the Venus diss track is because it she's his baby mama. He had

135
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:48,900
sex with Venus. Fuck Venus. Fuck Venus. We hate that shit. It's kind of making me rethink my

136
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:54,540
working relationship with OJ the alien. Venus is a bad guy. Venus is a very deadbeat

137
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:00,580
person. How did Venus... He's not even a person. How did he have a kid with a planet bro? I

138
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,020
don't even know how any of that works. Also... He's trying to have a kid with Neptune. How

139
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,980
Why does he make a planet go perpendicular? It's a round shape.

140
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,380
That's a good. Well, that's you know

141
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:12,280
you're going to you should have learned something from the Uranus planet report

142
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,120
that planet is at a right angle to the other planet. So you can consider wow

143
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,100
nothing is at any kind of angle. If it's round to the rotational axis, but

144
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,140
you actually that's all just that's all pretend right. It's does not like

145
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,600
here's the thing about space man. I've been thinking about this and I've been

146
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,100
waiting till the eighth episode to bring this up. Which way is up in fucking

147
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,260
space? Wow, then you can't in space. No one can hear you scream

148
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:39,380
That's true, that's crazy. No one can hear you cream dude. No Neptune can be

149
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,020
cream on earth either. I've got private. I've had like creamed on. I don't I don't

150
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:48,100
have a cream at all. If I cream in my bathroom alone and no one is around to

151
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,540
hear it, did I cream? No, no, I did not according not unless my wife starts

152
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:57,380
installing security cameras, threatened to my started.

153
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,060
Did you guys ever know anybody used to jack off in the toilet? You've talked

154
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,900
about this in the chat in the yeah, my friend Chad used to check off in like

155
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,860
lean over the toilet and spurt over is so crazy. He told me that he was like

156
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,060
like it was everybody did that and I was like I don't think most people do that

157
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:20,860
man's like milk in his shit like he's got an utter to be a jack off into the

158
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,620
toilet. Yeah, you did. He said yeah, oh well, I guess that's two guys. I know

159
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,980
what are the odds of the two people I've ever heard doing that are close friends

160
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:35,500
I know. Do I attract these milkers? I guess you do. You kind of have a male

161
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,920
milkers. Just something to think about. You attract male milkers.

162
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,720
What? How? So, DJ Gleptar. But I guess this is also, speaking of, this is,

163
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
we, this is, you said eighth episode. I guess we're in, are we in week four? Is

164
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,100
it week four now? I don't even know. I think we're in week four. I think it's

165
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,380
week four day one. Wait, maybe it's the seventh episode. Week four day one. No,

166
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,700
it's, it's, yeah, it's the, yeah, it's the seventh. Okay, seventh. Okay, yeah.

167
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,840
zero week for day one. Y'all I can't believe wow it feels like we've been

168
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,040
doing this for ten weeks already. I want to do the fifty two weeks of play and I

169
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,880
want to do the fifty two weeks of the year. I want to do it once a year. I

170
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,840
want to do fifty two weeks of planets and I think that we should find planets

171
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:13,640
and other solar systems. This has been the longest month of my life and take a

172
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,240
look at him. Oh this guy hates Thanksgiving morning. Yeah, I honestly

173
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,000
believe that outside of the planets. I think that the weeks the five weeks of

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,480
planets has brought misfortune upon me. Why I think that I can't I can't I just

175
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,500
there's things in my life. I feel like I feel the same way I've been sick for

176
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,520
most of trouble trouble week of pilot since I would say since about the week

177
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:38,020
before Halloween trouble has followed me, which at first every trouble starts and

178
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:41,500
it's before how we need thinking man. This is I know what this is. This is the

179
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,100
Halloween blue. Yeah, this is the trick is the how for the tree Halloween curse

180
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,140
yeah, but then the treat never comes and then you're never come and then you're

181
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,860
getting into the Thanksgiving month and you're thinking well what the hell's

182
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:56,600
what gives this must be the this is the curse of the Comanche's, but then that

183
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,720
maybe is going to stick around right. They wouldn't curse me out. They wouldn't

184
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:05,520
curse one of their own exactly good point. Yeah, if anything, I should be

185
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,320
cursing you guys. Yeah, yeah, because we've disrespected your ancestors so many

186
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,960
different times. Yeah, I don't think that's about ancestry today. I think we

187
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,240
should keep the planets because I'm too scared to think about anything

188
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,620
superstitious. Do you know who DJ Gleptar is? This guy's really a

189
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,960
DJ Gleptar fucking killed it. He bodied that shit. Yeah, DJ Gleptar did a very good job.

190
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,840
I don't know who DJ Gleptar is. So to be clear here, this is the song that was

191
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,040
made without your and your friend Rupert's involvement. Yes. This is the

192
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,080
one that you guys were going to cook something up. We were going to cook

193
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:37,720
something. We had something amazing. I think it was actually this beat. Maybe

194
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:44,280
DJ Gleptar stole it. I'm not sure. No. DJ Gleptar, say it fast. Klepto. Klepto.

195
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:51,800
Oh my God, and you read it backwards. It's rat pelg. Wow, which a d

196
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,160
j.

197
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,860
Rat pelg jd. That could be some other guy's name to that could be a

198
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,120
different guy's. So now we're looking for backwards is dork. Yeah, and wait

199
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:12,840
and alien backwards is Nila Nila. Oh, shit. Wow. We're unlocking so much

200
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,440
different stuff from reading things backwards. It's crazy. Okay, so we did

201
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,740
the song first, which is a bit unorthodox, but really I need to know what we're

202
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:23,280
even going to talk about because I've been I've been in my a man. I've been on

203
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,900
the other side of the planet, so I need the report. I'm going to be really the

204
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,780
report. I need the report because I need a baseline of information, so I can talk

205
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,700
about this shit in a way that yeah, that's fair enough. People's minds.

206
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,740
Let's go ahead and do the report. Let's hear this report. The damn thing

207
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,540
join us once again on a five week galactic journey through our solar

208
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,080
system.

209
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,100
Be prepared to learn and to laugh a little tooth

210
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,900
and now the planet report with Cameron

211
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,060
is joking around it's okay. It's a long it's a long clip, so you could you're

212
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,660
supposed to make jokes in it kind of I got a long for you

213
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:03,100
chill on him. Okay, today's today's planet report is

214
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
It's a story.

215
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
Wow.

216
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
It's a bit like a fable.

217
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Planet story.

218
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:18,100
So this is the story of Neptune, a planet report by Cameron Fetter.

219
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:25,100
Once upon a time, 30 astronomical units away from the sun, there was a blue and icy planet

220
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,140
named Neptune.

221
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,940
One orbit, Neptune woke up and felt depressed.

222
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,900
What makes me special?

223
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:43,260
Neptune. I feel so average. Don't worry Neptune, said the sun. You're very special. For example,

224
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,940
you're an ice giant. Your distance from me means that you're dark and cold, covered by frozen,

225
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:56,860
icy materials. Big whoop, replied Neptune. That doesn't make me unique. Uranus is an ice giant

226
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,780
as well. Well, maybe your surface doesn't matter. It's what you're like on the inside that counts.

227
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,820
"You have a rocky core," the sun said.

228
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:12,540
"Yeah, right. So does Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Uranus, and probably Jupiter and Saturn, too.

229
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,620
I knew I wasn't special."

230
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,540
"Oh, I know what makes you special.

231
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:21,180
You have an oval-shaped storm in your southern hemisphere called the Great Dark Spot."

232
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,900
"Uh, Jupiter much?"

233
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,740
"Hmm." The sun rubbed its chin with its hand.

234
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:35,180
"Let's see, your day is 16 hours long, but your year is 165 Earth years.

235
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:40,460
You have 14 moons, you were discovered in 1846, you have rings, is any of this helping?"

236
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:47,580
"No, it's not," yelled Neptune violently. "In fact, you're just making me feel worse.

237
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:53,180
I think I'm going to kill myself." And Neptune opened its desk drawer with its hand,

238
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,660
where it kept its revolver and used its hand to put the gun to its atmosphere.

239
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,460
"No!"

240
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,460
"I'm done doing this with you!" screamed the sun in anguish.

241
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,760
*snickering*

242
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,860
"It seems like every rotation you threaten to kill yourself.

243
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,360
You think you have it bad?

244
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,060
Look at Pluto. The poor guy isn't even a planet anymore."

245
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:15,060
"Even my suffering isn't unique," sighed Neptune.

246
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,160
"I think I get it now.

247
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,060
I was so concerned with being special,

248
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,860
but what's actually special is that I'm so similar to everyone else in my solar system.

249
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,160
It's about togetherness and family."

250
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,540
"That's right," said the Sun. "I'm glad you came around when coming around the

251
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,640
Sun. Yeah, I'm coming around me. I mean the me, the me. Let's see!" And the

252
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,900
planets all started in on their Thanksgiving dinner.

253
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,520
Moral,

254
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:50,240
the moral of the story. Okay, there is nothing interesting about Neptune.

255
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:57,620
no good facts. Nothing good. You couldn't find anything. It's the eighth planet.

256
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:02,400
They covered everything. Yeah, everything's been done. There's a blue,

257
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,940
there's a blue one. There's a nice one. There's a spot. There's nothing man.

258
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:13,860
Fucking shit planet and it sucks. God there's the Neptunes. They there

259
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,860
wouldn't there wouldn't be

260
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:20,780
without the name Neptune as a cool symbol and we wouldn't get we wouldn't

261
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,740
get the song happy by Pharrell if it weren't for the Neptune. Why are they

262
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,820
called the Neptune? I don't know, maybe because there's nothing unique about

263
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:33,140
them. No, they're like everything else. They're water based. The two guys are

264
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,340
water based? I don't know. Everyone's water based. Yeah. I guess we're all

265
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:39,900
water based. Even the biggest stretch in the world. Oh, because they were so

266
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,860
cold. But there's a... Oh, Pharrell had a company called Ice Cream. Ice Giant.

267
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:49,460
Ice Giant. Oh, speaking of... And they were ice giants, they were so cold.

268
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:53,560
they might be giant. My shirt walk us through the fit. It's a blue shirt that

269
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,460
says giant on it and a blue hat that says Mexico for my Mexican friend and

270
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,180
Mexico's on a planet. Yeah, okay, my landlord came into the apartment. I was

271
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,940
talking to him and I was said, Oh, my friend is here. He's visiting from

272
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:09,200
Mexico. My little Mexico, I said, Yeah, Mexico, Mexico, and I said, Yeah,

273
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,420
Mexico, and he said, like he's Mexican. I was like, Yeah, he's like Mexican. I

274
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,140
said, Yeah, he went. Oh, wow, not too sharp. This landlord guy. No, no, no,

275
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,860
How did you feel about that, Julio?

276
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,860
I feel special.

277
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,860
Yeah.

278
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,300
Julio, how was your -- you got in this morning at what time was it?

279
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,540
I thought I was going to land at 6 a.m., but I landed at 5, which was really fucked up

280
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:42,980
because I was Ubering to Kams, and I had to call him 20 times before his phone rang once.

281
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,620
But it was okay because my alarm was set, and I woke up at the right time anyway.

282
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,620
Yeah.

283
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,620
Nice.

284
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,740
funny screenshot now that I can post with a really funny caption when he calls

285
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:56,220
from twenty miscalls from Julio and and caption it something like when you say

286
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,040
you're fifteen years old or something like that.

287
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,820
That would be you really get

288
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,740
so give me that's not funny. That was easy money. You're a destroyed, but

289
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,940
apparently he got stopped by border patrol because they didn't like his drip.

290
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,300
They don't fuck with me. No, they don't fuck with you or not.

291
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:18,340
They look at because you look like that because I look like a boss. No, it's

292
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,380
They did not say, "I'm sorry, I have to go to another room."

293
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,880
They say, "You look like a baos. Come over here."

294
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,380
"This guy came off the plane like a baos and we detained him for 20 minutes."

295
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,380
That's what they said.

296
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,380
They did not say that shit, man.

297
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,380
They took me to a room and the next 20 people that got sent into the room

298
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,380
were all from China or Hong Kong.

299
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,380
So those are baos.

300
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:37,380
They thought he was Chino.

301
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,880
Oh, they did think he was Chino.

302
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,380
Yeah.

303
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,380
And so they sent you to the Chino room.

304
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,380
Yeah, they said, "You're too much of a baos. Come here."

305
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,380
No, they didn't say anything about you being a baos, man.

306
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,380
That's what they said.

307
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,480
They did not say what do you are you here for work? What do you do here for work?

308
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,340
You're such a bouse. I'm a bouse. I'm nothing. I'm actually an employee. I'm

309
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,360
not a bouse. You went to the VIP of customs. I don't think I exist.

310
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,420
The VIP of customs, that's crazy. Yep. I can't wait to go to another country and

311
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:08,780
get locked up forever. Yeah. Yeah. They've troubled me before. Do you guys

312
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,400
think that you would enjoy getting extradited? I don't know. Probably not.

313
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,500
or from somewhere to here. I get like where am I where am I? I just think I

314
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:21,520
do fun to be sent somewhere and do they put you on a normal plane? Do they do

315
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,840
that in real life or only in Batman? They do that in real life man, but if

316
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,280
you do you go to a class or yeah, they did Brittany Griner. I did Brittany

317
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,380
Griner. I put you in a prison shackle and then they put you on a your own

318
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,240
put a balloon on you and then they fly into the bat plane. Yeah, no, that's a

319
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,280
different that's a movie man. Bane does it doesn't never happen in a real

320
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,700
kind of pain. It happened in the second one. Huh wait what that's the on that's

321
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:47,860
why

322
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,320
and they say he's

323
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,300
the Chinese guy. Now they send them on. They say Chinese or no. They said China

324
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,740
won't extradite him one of their own. So Batman does it. So Batman comes and he

325
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,220
balloons him yeah. He sends a

326
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:09,460
please no bro. I'm back to make. I've seen that movie. I've seen the dark

327
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,220
night of couple times. Now

328
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,660
I zone out when that scene is on it's a crazy. I was boring. I still don't

329
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,900
understand what it has to do with the plot of the move. No, not I could not

330
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,740
tell you what how it relates to anything. Is it about remembering that it happens?

331
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,320
Is it

332
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,360
to

333
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,340
motivate the Joker show me more? Joe Wayne Industries, maybe show me Mo Joker.

334
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,020
Yeah, I don't care about I want to see Heath Ledger bring him back the Bruce

335
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:38,820
Wayne parts of any Batman movie do not interest me, except for the new one,

336
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,500
where it's the only interesting part of the movie. Yeah, but in the first three

337
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,080
What do you mean there's a fucking car chase? I don't give a fuck about that

338
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,480
car. The car chase was kind of okay. I like the part of Riddler was dope. The

339
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,800
parts of the new one where he's walking around and just looks fucking bummed out

340
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:00,380
and Charlie's Angels. He's got that Charlie's Angels swag and he's walking

341
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:03,140
around in his suit just like Charlie's Angels. What do you mean? Remember?

342
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,060
What's the guy with the hair from Charlie's Angels? Oh, Sam Rockwell guy.

343
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:13,520
No, the fucking Christopher, not Christopher, the guy who's weird.

344
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
Bosley?

345
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,000
No, the guy who's weird.

346
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,480
Oh, creepy thin man.

347
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,200
Yes, he's Crispin Glover.

348
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,160
When he's Crispin Glover and he's walking around and he's got his hair down and he's

349
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:27,600
like this, "This sucks, I have to fight the fight."

350
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,920
There's no better part of any movie when a guy is acting emo.

351
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,420
That's always the best part of every movie.

352
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,080
We need every movie to be like this now.

353
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,540
Manchester by the Sea?

354
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,960
I never seen that, but I've never ever seen that movie, but it does sound sad

355
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,840
to me. I've seen the clip where he tries to kill himself. I've only seen the

356
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,280
clip where he tries to kill himself. I don't know if that's what it's about.

357
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,400
What's the saddest movie you've ever fucking seen? That, though. Wait, dude,

358
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,760
Neptune is the blue. Yeah, the blue is the coldest planet. What makes you feel?

359
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,160
We need to talk about being blue. We're both having a rough month. I have

360
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,120
sickness. He's into nicotine these days, and you have a Mexican in your house.

361
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,480
I have unrevealed struggles. You have unrevealed struggles that can't even-

362
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,040
that people wouldn't even believe if you said what they were.

363
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:07,960
Unpublished. Yeah.

364
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,960
Violent struggles.

365
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,500
Yeah. Violence within me.

366
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,500
So what's the bluest movie you've ever seen?

367
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,380
Come and See. I saw Come and See

368
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,900
at my parents' house two years ago.

369
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,580
Two years ago, and I shut it off at the end.

370
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,900
And then that was when I was sober.

371
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,020
And then I saw that and I got so sad that I drank a Bud Light out of the fridge

372
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
and ended spidey.

373
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,540
That can't be fucking true.

374
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:37,200
I was a common seed drove you to drink. I was also bored. You got drove to drink

375
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,940
by a movie. I got drove to drink

376
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,540
the wag his probably some other crap going on in my life at that time as

377
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:47,620
well. Driven to drink by a movie. It should be like the the Baz Luhrmann

378
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,780
great Gatsby or something.

379
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,860
Project X

380
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:55,780
but yeah, it's an

381
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:01,560
really funny, though, about the Baz Luhrmann great Gatsby and he just gave

382
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,620
the music. Oh, shit.

383
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:09,340
A little party never hurt nobody.

384
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,020
Now there's other crap. You can't watch train spotting and be like, oh, I want to

385
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:14,860
do it. I need a white claw.

386
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,420
Fuck. That's not a sad movie, though.

387
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:20,020
Train spotting at the end.

388
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
He chooses life.

389
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,140
Isn't that one of the saddest things of all?

390
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,340
That is the saddest thing.

391
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,700
He had to choose it.

392
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,860
True. Real shit.

393
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,900
I mean, I watched I forget the name of it, but it was a Japanese movie, a Takeshi

394
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,780
Katana movie about a deaf guy who learns to surf and it was a really sad ending. It was

395
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:40,340
so sad that it made me angry. I was mad at the movie for ending that way.

396
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,940
That happens a lot to me in movies. I don't think movies should have poor endings. They

397
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:53,820
should all be smiley. Poor endings. This movie made me feel poor. Poorly bad. I can't think

398
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
of a really sad movie.

399
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:57,900
That one too. It was such a nice and loving movie.

400
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,540
Japan, bro. Surf's up.

401
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,200
It was a Japanese beach movie.

402
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
Surf's not bad.

403
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,200
About surfing, about overcoming a disability to surf.

404
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,540
How wonderful is that?

405
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,180
Which by the way, in terms of disabilities and surfing, I mean there's people who surf

406
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,180
with fucking no legs.

407
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
I'm not sure death is that crazy.

408
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,180
There's people who got eaten by a shark.

409
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,900
Well, you watch the movie, you're going to be surprised by what happens.

410
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
Is that what happens?

411
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,900
He gets eaten by a shark?

412
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:22,660
No, that would be a funny way to end sadly.

413
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,980
You could surf if you were just a head.

414
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,540
What was that movie, Soul Surfer?

415
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,540
The girl loses her arm?

416
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,660
Oh yeah, that's a real story though.

417
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,660
That's a true story.

418
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,660
yeah, it's not it's not just real. It's true wow and a lady lost her arm to a

419
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,200
shark to a shark and she was like fuck it. I'm going back. I gotta go. Are you

420
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,760
crazy? What are you stupid? She is stupid bitch. Are you crazy? Are you

421
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,420
stupid? You should be getting workman's comp from the ocean and sitting at home

422
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,020
all day stupid as getting paid in sand dollars. Well, but maybe she's looking

423
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,860
for the shark. Oh, I just realized she's looking for attention. Maybe it's that

424
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,500
oh wait. If well yeah, I wait. If I go back out and keep serving, I'll get so

425
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,900
much, but like a movie about me yeah, maybe it's actually I just realized

426
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:05,180
maybe it's surfing was her passion. I'm happy now.

427
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,940
No, can't be that

428
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:12,380
not fucking with that surfing can't be a passion. Did surfing is a way to pass

429
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,020
the time surfing is below heroin? Yeah, passion, a time yeah, passing a little

430
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,860
bit. That's how I for a time in all the time. That's how it all surfers.

431
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:25,420
They add S H to every single word. You guys didn't have many surfers up there

432
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,460
No, no, no, no.

433
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,820
There's some surfers. I mean, definitely not like a strong surf culture, but Cape Cod, I

434
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
definitely saw surfers around.

435
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,420
These are some of the smelliest people of all time.

436
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,780
They smell like salt.

437
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,780
They smell like salt.

438
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,780
Salt water.

439
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,020
Yeah. They're all, they're tan. They won't wear flip, they won't wear shoes.

440
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:44,300
They wear those ugly dune suits.

441
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,300
Yeah, wet suits.

442
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
Wet suits.

443
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,900
You guys ever worn a wet suit?

444
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,900
No.

445
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:50,220
How come you wear a wet suit to keep dry?

446
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Well, it doesn't keep you dry.

447
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
It doesn't keep you dry at all.

448
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,220
Think about that.

449
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,220
It keeps you warm.

450
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:01,120
keep dry. Why are you doing like like just 4 a.m. Rodney Dangerfield waking up

451
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,280
kind of still half asleep? Why do you wear a wet suit to keep dry?

452
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,320
To keep dry.

453
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:12,920
I get no wet. I get no wet suits. I don't know what's going on.

454
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,920
Bro. I get no wet suits.

455
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:20,420
I'm just gonna go. I get no wet. I'm gonna go home. I'm just gonna get

456
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,240
I was going to go home. I get no wet was okay for I get no wet. That was kind of

457
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,920
a woman just walked by with Mickey Mouse ears. God Mickey Santa went to Disney.

458
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,440
The Santa that I like went to Disney. He got interviewed on the spinning tea

459
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,360
cups. They asked him what's your favorite Disney can we ever talked about

460
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,280
the Santa? I know I'm going to be doing an expose on the center, but just this

461
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,240
is a preview. Maybe you mean the Santa that you like. I'm so out of the don't

462
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,080
worry about it. The Santa that you like the fuck's happening. There's a Santa

463
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:55,060
Cameron likes. What is that? There's only one Santa man. No, there's a lot of

464
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:59,740
there's a thriving. Oh wait, wait, sorry. Do you mean a Santa's helper that you

465
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,420
know? No, this is on the teacups getting interviewed and the guy says, what's

466
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,780
your favorite Disney character? And Santa goes like this. Oh,

467
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,380
Mickey Mouse

468
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,660
cop out dumb ass.

469
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:19,080
Talking about Santa biggest, the world, a winter character. Yeah, Olaf Olaf say

470
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,940
Scrooge McDuck at the end of the movie. Yeah, yeah, Jesus Christ Mickey Mouse.

471
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,040
Oh, shit, dude, a four year old kid wouldn't say Mickey Mouse. No, I saw a

472
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,580
Grinch.

473
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,900
You were a Grinch. I were a Grinch and then I saw one. I went to a street fair

474
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,900
while I was in L.A. Yeah, show you a video. I took him and talked about your

475
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,400
L.A. Trip at all. Yeah, because I was like that or I went through an entire

476
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,580
bottle of Dayquil in like four days, but I did see a Grinch and I videoed him and

477
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,700
he was actually good at it. He was pretty

478
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,940
(laughter)

479
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,600
(radio playing)

480
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,280
- You can hear him.

481
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:58,940
(radio playing)

482
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,580
- That's not Jim Carrey, who said that's Jim Carrey?

483
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:04,240
(radio playing)

484
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,500
(laughter)

485
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,980
- Oh, that's I included.

486
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,700
- It's that, oh shit, it is getting to be that time of year

487
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,980
when Grinches are just gonna be around.

488
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,700
That shit always weirds me out.

489
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,420
- He had the full makeup and everything and a pot belly.

490
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:21,300
I saw I was home for Christmas a couple of years ago. I saw a Grinch just by

491
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:24,620
the side of the road, not even hanging out in a like a mall or anything that

492
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:28,220
he was a stand. He was on a an overpass just sitting on the side. I think I

493
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,720
took a video of I don't know. I probably can't find it right now. He's just

494
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:33,140
sitting on the overpass and he wasn't even doing anything. He's full

495
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,460
Grinch down and I was rolling down the window and pointing at him. He's kind

496
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:41,460
of going. Here's what's wrong with the America and the and children and

497
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,700
society as well. Yeah, I go to this this fucking winter wonderland parade right.

498
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,140
Is that the O? One? No, it was in new hall california. My brother's open in a

499
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:53,980
pool hall up there and I went new all. It's a good spot for a new all the new

500
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,500
all. Yeah, yeah, go check it out the break room. There was

501
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,460
so it's like ten thousand people in this like little downtown area and

502
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,700
the Grinch is doing a meet and greet winter wonderland. Welcome to whoville

503
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:09,500
and there were slutty who's there. I'll say it there was a lot of who's and

504
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,580
then, as I get closer dude sponsored by a church, so I'm like what the hell is

505
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:18,380
on with these sluts. I didn't know they were allowed in church, but the line for

506
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:24,140
the Grinch around the block, literally 200 kids and their entire families around

507
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,380
the block, right? I walk a little bit further. Santa Claus, 10 people in line,

508
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:34,860
10 people in line. What's wrong with this? What's going on? What is wrong with

509
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:39,060
the Grinch can pull more people? And that's you know, that's why maybe I

510
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,660
my shows didn't sell that well. Yeah, because I'm a bit of a Santa Claus, right

511
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:47,460
and their shows didn't sell well. I mean, I thought that I would get maybe I

512
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,460
thought I was gonna have to add dozens of shows after you thought maybe they

513
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,260
were gonna, you know, we sold we sold out one and a half, but I thought that I

514
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:58,740
was gonna have to like, you know, you ask you do two shows. Yeah, I flipped

515
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,580
about. It's not cool. Well, you would have been if you wanted me to really

516
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:05,100
flip a bottle. Let's get this shit started, but if I thought that I was

517
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,060
gonna do two shows and then I was gonna be one of those people where I have to

518
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:14,500
had shows every 30 minutes basically. Six shows because demand was so high, but it didn't happen

519
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,700
because I'm guessing there was... I'm obviously the Santa Claus of stand-up comedy.

520
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
The Grinch.

521
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:20,700
But who's the Grinch?

522
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:21,700
It was Pierce.

523
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,620
Because he had a separate show that night.

524
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,540
It's completely Pierce.

525
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:29,420
That is actually true. He stands like him. I'll say he stands exactly like him.

526
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,740
Pierce is a Grinch.

527
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,420
You know, what you're saying about adding shows is when I... My strategy is when I do

528
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:41,420
my stand up tours. I usually just kind of book eight shows right in advance. I do two nights,

529
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:45,380
four shows each and I usually get five to seven people each show.

530
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,780
That's exactly what happens when I go on the road with Adam to a secondary city. We go

531
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:56,220
to Pittsburgh and they book an 800 seat venue and we sell about 80 tickets a show. Then

532
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,820
we do ten shows. It's really awesome.

533
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,820
That's what it's all about.

534
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
That's what it's all about.

535
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:05,340
Road dogging is all about.

536
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,700
We did Pittsburgh and it was like, maybe we did six shows and it was like this giant venue

537
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:15,180
and then we didn't sell that many tickets and then we saw that Matt Reif was the next

538
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,180
weekend.

539
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,180
Oh, dog.

540
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,700
He did 12 shows all sold out.

541
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,740
I was like, dude, we're fucking something up really badly.

542
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Yeah.

543
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,740
Yeah.

544
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,740
That guy's got it figured out.

545
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
It's because you went into a big venue.

546
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,700
I just saw the thing, somebody reposted a thing from a long time ago where he tried to

547
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,700
fight Brandon.

548
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
Oh, yeah.

549
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,700
I forgot about that.

550
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:37,800
forgot I didn't know that history like yeah. I know the by the way, if

551
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,660
somebody wants, if

552
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,360
somebody wants to like some promotion, wants to put this on, I will put up

553
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,440
a thousand dollars for that prize

554
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,740
for brand.

555
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:51,620
We'll do it now. Whoever loses, I win. That would be an amazing, amazing

556
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:55,780
thing. Brandon, if you're listening, you gotta, you gotta do it. You gotta do

557
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,780
have to do it. Matt, right, just slid on the disabled community. He did. You

558
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,500
can see this is insta bro. What do you say hit his insta right now? What

559
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,840
happened? What do you say?

560
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,640
What is

561
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,960
what are you doing? What are you doing? I take your clothes off. I'm ready to

562
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,360
ride for my disabled. You're ready to ride your disabled. I'm ready to ride

563
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:15,580
for

564
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,440
let's get this.

565
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:26,480
Dude, I will I will slide on your right. I will slide on anybody who fucks with

566
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,000
disabled people. I love disabled people more than I even love the abled, which

567
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:34,900
just quite a lot. What did he say he he said if anyone's ever been offended by

568
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,480
one of my jokes click here for I don't just click here to solve the problem.

569
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,540
It's some click here. I don't know. He's a hole in one a perfect joke.

570
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:49,100
It was a link to it was a link to special needs helmets

571
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:55,280
Matt right. You stupid fucking yeah,

572
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,780
It's also just like...

573
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,280
You're gonna wish you were never born, man.

574
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,100
Yeah, and you know what?

575
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:05,100
No disrespect to Brandon, but he looks like a baby 11-year-old child.

576
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,900
So as soon as Matt Rife sees me talking shit, he's not gonna ask me to fight him at a skate

577
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,900
park.

578
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
He's gonna run the other way.

579
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
He doesn't want me making his lips even bigger.

580
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
This was a couple years ago, too, when...

581
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:14,900
And he's still been hot.

582
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,900
...when Brandon was younger.

583
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,900
Yeah, exactly.

584
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,300
Brandon was younger, and he looked like the guy from Despicable Me back in the day.

585
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:24,060
I think Matt was younger than Brandon, I think.

586
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,060
I don't know.

587
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,060
Well, either way, Matt...

588
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:32,600
Wikipedia real quick. It's beyond on site for you. You want to see a white boy

589
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:36,140
really wilding it out on galaxy and say we're in the same galaxy. You're going

590
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,860
down. Yeah. And another thing man straight up. I'm gonna kill your ass.

591
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:42,560
Listen, I know you thought you were you thought you you were getting one over

592
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,260
making fun of the disabled community. You thought, oh, no one will notice if I

593
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:50,520
do this. Guess what buddy you fucked with another community at the same time

594
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,900
that you didn't even realize that is going to come down with you come down on

595
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:59,720
you with the fury of one million angry guys, which community is that community

596
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,080
of conscientious bike riders? That's right, yeah, helmets as well. That's

597
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,680
right, because the safety or the special needs website and the safety can be

598
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,440
better, because I have a bit of a well crafted. It's the craft. My head is

599
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,680
shaped like many disabled people's heads, so it fits better into the thing. It's

600
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,640
designed to be fit on your head exactly straight up and also man

601
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,300
and babies to and baby

602
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,180
and maybe you fuck with babies and fuck with

603
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,620
yeah. You can fuck with the disabled and different races all you want, but the

604
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:39,120
second you go for babies, those are our future man. Don't fuck with the babies,

605
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,120
bro. They need to grow up and change the world and that you are inhibiting that

606
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,600
you're trying to make them commit suicide before they've even learned to

607
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,720
talk man, Matt, right? Have you ever come for the safety community again?

608
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:58,560
If you ever come to the safety and protective gear community, you're going to get a reflective

609
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,080
vest to the fucking dome.

610
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,080
That's right, buddy.

611
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
I'm going to put you in a reverse life jacket.

612
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
You're walking down the sidewalk.

613
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,920
You're going to wish you were wearing a fucking helmet.

614
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,080
Walking down the sidewalk, oh, to-to-to-to-do, going to go ahead and cross the street.

615
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
Oh, what's this?

616
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,400
Who just put a blindfold on my head before I crossed the street?

617
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
That's right.

618
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Oh, helmet.

619
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,400
Helmets are stupid.

620
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
Helmets are gay.

621
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,640
Yeah, not so funny when I fucking hit you with my slingshot going top speed 25 miles

622
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,640
an hour.

623
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,640
Bang.

624
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
Yeah, Polaris slingshot.

625
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,000
not a not a

626
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:27,880
we need to scare. Honestly, this is what I thought he meant to this could be a

627
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:32,120
I knew he's talking about Polaris. I'm a lot. This is the one I'm the I don't

628
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,480
even that is so

629
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:37,760
the Polaris is so ubiquitous. I forgot that a sling shot was even used to

630
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,800
defeat the I think that any time I read that passage, which is every other day,

631
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,200
which again me versus Matt Reif bit of a David versus Goliath. Yeah thing that's

632
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,400
right, Matt Reif, you versus me. It's David versus Goliath. I'm Goliath, the

633
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,240
strong guy. I'm going to pound your ass. I haven't quite finished the story, but I know

634
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,520
the title. I'm about to go Goliath on your ass. I see the word slingshot in the story

635
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,160
and I go to the car rental place and drive around for a couple of hours so I don't get

636
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:09,160
mad. I'm here to kill a white guy. But you don't know that you have fucked with a disabled

637
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,360
guy, a guy with an undiagnosed autoimmune disorder. Hashimoto's could be. And a guy

638
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,020
guy with purple eye bags. Yeah and make him ugly to some and a guy who is in a

639
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,500
couple of special needs classes growing up. Oh wait, me too. Yeah, wait, you too.

640
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,360
Yep.

641
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,620
I had a an IEP.

642
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,540
You fucked with a mother fucker with an IEP.

643
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,380
I hate it to hurt when they put it in.

644
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,420
IEP. Matt Rife, you just fucked with a mother fucker with an IEP. Okay.

645
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:42,660
Straight up. Improvised explosive Patrick and I'm coming at you. I'm coming at

646
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,680
with a bomb vest, I'm going to blow your ass up. We need to do terrorist strike.

647
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,280
We need to do a massive strike. What the hell are we talking about? What are we

648
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,880
talking about right now? This Neptune is making us so blue that we just

649
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,280
threatened a guy. We got ice cold. We got ice cold and threatened a guy for like

650
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,000
30 minutes. He's going to be blue when they take him out of the closet at the DC improv

651
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,000
where I fucking hit his body. He's never coming out of the closet. You're right.

652
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,440
No. He's in there for life. Dude, Matt Rife, you just got cooked in 40 different ways,

653
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:27,440
is

654
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,080
forty eight and that's you met right for and also broke her fucking burp. Take

655
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,540
those skinny jeans off man.

656
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:40,560
Don't need to see those. Take those skinny jeans. I want to be working with

657
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
and show me a dig.

658
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:47,200
Tell me that butthole bro. Show me a bend over. Show me your butt and balls

659
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,200
and you may look like handsome Squidward, but you act a whole lot more like

660
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,880
normal Squidward and you blue like him like and Neptune being in L.A. Neptune's

661
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,460
with SpongeBob to King Neptune. Oh yeah. Oh, we didn't even talk about that. The

662
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:05,820
God of water, the God of water aspect of the whole thing. I just got a

663
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:09,980
petrified piece of beef off the ground. It's not beef. What is it? That's cake.

664
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,460
That's a poop. Oh, cake. Yeah, we didn't clean the table.

665
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:18,220
The tablecloth is for yeah, exactly. Yeah, bundle the whole thing up. But

666
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,460
yeah, Neptune dude, this is this is really the only thing Neptune has going

667
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,620
for it. Is that a guy was named after him? That was a bit cooler

668
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,060
And Julio told me this morning, I don't know how he knew this, we were eating

669
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,380
breakfast and he said to me while I was talking, I was like, oh, I got to write

670
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:35,820
my planner report. He said this to me, he said, did you know you need special

671
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:39,460
software to view net? I don't even know what that means. What could that mean?

672
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,940
What does that mean Julio?

673
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:47,020
I did my research. And what kind of software? That's all you're going to say?

674
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,660
I don't know. It's special software.

675
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:54,380
What? But... So think about other planets, right? You can see them like normally.

676
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,020
you can't with Neptune. Oh, it's too far away. You need a special software to

677
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:02,720
look at it. Well, how'd they know it was there until before software windows

678
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,620
invented it windows invented Neptune. Yep. So this is like that's true. You

679
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:11,500
guys remember the like last year, Samsung came in with that phone that

680
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,340
you look at the you look at the moon and it just put a picture of the moon on

681
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:20,140
top of the yes, the AI. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that was so funny. They are

682
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,460
selling that with your with your mom and dad to speaking. I think it does do

683
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,660
I think they literally have it for faces too. That is a really good thing.

684
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:39,440
Speaking of Samsung, this weekend, the skate shop that I go to just did some event with

685
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,660
Samsung Galaxy Flip for some reason. I don't know why. What do you mean for some reason?

686
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:50,860
For money. Flip. Yeah, flip. There's actually a good point right there. What the flip? Because

687
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,980
They love cursing, skaters.

688
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,300
I met, I didn't meet him at this event.

689
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,020
I saw him on the street and then shook his hand.

690
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,260
I fanned out fucking crazy.

691
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,260
About who man?

692
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,260
Let me guess.

693
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,260
Tony Hawk.

694
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:05,260
Brian Anderson.

695
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Who's that, an author?

696
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,260
He had one of the best video parts of all time.

697
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:09,620
Dude, I had the same experience with Louis Anderson.

698
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,140
Yep, fanned the fuck out.

699
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:17,740
I fanned out super hard, shook his hand in the street and then looked over and realized

700
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,580
Samsung was had a filmer there. They're filming something with them, so you're

701
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,700
in the video. There's probably a commercial of me saying you're my

702
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,440
favorite skater.

703
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,100
Nice, that's

704
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:33,740
if they fucking use that. I think about there's a guy who's there's a guy who

705
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:37,780
on my street that that does like tick tock live streams or something where he

706
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:42,180
can plays a guitar and I walk by behind him all the time and I know for a fact

707
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:45,540
one right now. I checked he gets about two viewers, but one of these days he's

708
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,060
going to pop in a massive way yeah and I'm going to be I'm going to be in all

709
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,600
these fucking videos looking at him and I'm going to be you're going to get

710
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,300
secondary fame. You're going to be known as that guy. He's going to be so famous.

711
00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:00,040
I'm going to be slovenly hoodie man in the background and people are going to

712
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,600
love it for me man. Yeah, exactly. Are you slavic? No, you want to slavic. I

713
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,320
don't know which one slavic is it's a Korean way. No, it's not Korean. No, no

714
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,500
other day. He said Korean chungus. That's not true.

715
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,840
he watched a video called Korean corn dog and he highlighted the name of the

716
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:20,680
video and said, Oh, Korean chungus, that's how you read it was Korean, said

717
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,320
Korean, and then I said, Why did you say Korean chungus? It said that on the

718
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,080
screen. I didn't say that.

719
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,160
Korean corn dog. On my screen it said that. It didn't say, I don't think it

720
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,920
said Korean chungus. It's much. I've never had one. It's much. They put

721
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,320
sugar on it. Sugar and cheese. Yeah. Is involved. And potato, sweet potato.

722
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,080
Yeah. Don't say it like that. No, you all like nine dollars for one corn

723
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:41,820
huh

724
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:48,720
it's absurd man and people in Korea. Is this breakfast, lunch and dinner every

725
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,660
single meal they eat? Yeah, I explained to my cousin or not my cousin, my

726
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:54,000
friend

727
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,120
that I think I didn't even realize I talked to him, but I eat almost at a

728
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,840
completely Korean diet. Yeah, everything I eat is Korean food at home. I eat

729
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,640
bulgogi kimchi. I eat kimchi every day, bulgogi, kimchi, rice, go to garu, go to

730
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,720
John John egg. I eat egg,

731
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,320
I don't really

732
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:27,040
egg is common in Asia, but they do it a different way. Barbeque, because you

733
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,760
can Asia. Did you know that in Asia chill chill over there? You calm down

734
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,240
I'm going to say to be quiet. We have to legally pay you more. Yeah. Did you know

735
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,980
that in Asia the chickens are so amazing that you can eat them raw and you can

736
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,240
eat the eggs raw as well really and no and it's very common chicken sashimi due

737
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,560
to you can they literally do chicken sashimi. It's yeah. It doesn't seem like

738
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,200
it would be that because of the way they treat them. Do they not have factory

739
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,560
farms? They're kinder or kinder. They use they bless the chicken before they kill.

740
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,200
Do they even kill the chicken before they eat it? They don't kill it man.

741
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,080
that's you. You can eat it. You just that's interesting. You have to take

742
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,280
them. You have to take everything. I've seen videos where they flatten

743
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,080
chickens. Yeah, Spatchcock.

744
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,640
I saw a thing the other day that was called Toad style turkey with a

745
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,520
two, with a wire, two wired squares and they go like this

746
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,240
and then it spins with a machine. Oh no, Spatchcock is where you break

747
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,440
its back and it's like elbow shoulders. You push it down like a burger.

748
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,400
Open it up? Kinda. Like it's... I'm thinking about, 'cause I'm making a

749
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,660
turkey this year.

750
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:30,280
And it's toad. Is there going to be ham?

751
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,000
Toad style is when you cut the turkey.

752
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,720
Is there going to be ham?

753
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,180
I've just gotten nervous because Julio said there wasn't going to be ham.

754
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,200
I don't know if that's true.

755
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,220
Nobody gives a fucking shit.

756
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,320
Don't ask him about that, dude.

757
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:40,840
I didn't ask him. I didn't ask him.

758
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,540
I said, I'm so excited for ham, and he went, I don't know if there's going to

759
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,280
be ham. And I was like, what are you talking about?

760
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,260
Why did you say something to ham about there not being ham? I got worried.

761
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:48,780
Julio.

762
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,320
You know I've been on a ham break.

763
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,840
You know that if I said that...

764
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:55,880
I forgot about the ham break.

765
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:59,900
guy. He knows it to he decided to make me upset. If I had told him that there

766
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,360
was not going to be ham, you know for a fact, because I knew you were so

767
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:06,260
excited about it that I would have told him don't tell camera. Yeah, so there's

768
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,000
no there's no way that you would have found out, but there will be found out

769
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,020
day of I'm going to go get the am tomorrow. I would have called you. He

770
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:17,220
would have called you tomorrow or something or the day morning of and just

771
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:20,540
like just so you know, like you're about to get a call from like your

772
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:23,820
girlfriend breaking up with you right. Yeah, like we need you know, yeah, I

773
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:28,040
call you in a second. I don't call you that on you get home. You knew any call

774
00:45:28,040 --> 00:45:32,160
for me would have freaked you out. I think about the ham situation, but no

775
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,340
did I have an amazing thing. Thank God the problem is I was going to do an

776
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,000
entire

777
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,800
Korean.

778
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:45,080
I was like I'm going to do like a themed Thanksgiving dinner this this year, but

779
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:49,160
wow, but that was just because I thought girls were coming, but no girl it's

780
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:53,820
only going to go down. It's a guy's only Thanksgiving, boys giving yeah. It was

781
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,320
it's going to be my at least my wife and her sister were going to come, but then

782
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,460
they've realized that no all the girls went out of town and now that it's just

783
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,660
going to be guys, they're just going to go hang out by themselves. So I'm not

784
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,300
going to make my bull. I was given sliders boys, guys, boys, guys, gang,

785
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,100

787
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,900

788
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,760
I was going to make a lasagna and then decided not to because I feel like you can't have

789
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,000
lasagnas aside on Thanksgiving.

790
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
We're going to start it early.

791
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,000
There's no girls getting ready.

792
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
We're going to start at 11am.

793
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Yeah.

794
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
That's kind of when Thanksgiving should start I think.

795
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,960
I've always started at like 1 I feel like.

796
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,960
12 or 1.

797
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,520
I like a Thanksgiving where you get there, you get one of those disgusting cheese balls

798
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:45,920
that's covered in nuts and then you have about 2 to 3 hours of that and talking and then

799
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,920
food.

800
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,240
Cousin walk first.

801
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Do the cousin walk.

802
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,340
which we're going to do a crazy cousin walk this year. We're going to leave the

803
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:55,780
turkey in the oven and Caleb's apartment and just go on a cousin walk for three

804
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:59,020
hours. You're going to do a buddy's walk. No, well, I cousins. We're going to

805
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:02,680
pretend to be because we if we're if a bunch of guys are at Thanksgiving

806
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:06,240
together, their cousins, they can be cousins for a day. Well, whoever's

807
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,600
making the turkeys, the onk. Yeah, so I'm

808
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:14,400
I don't want to be on because then I'm bro, but it will at least be on where

809
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,720
like you guys record me doing something and you're like, oh my God, I got a

810
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:18,740
- Unc it. - Unc it.

811
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:19,740
- Unc it. - Unc it.

812
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,740

813
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:23,740
- Yeah, something like that.

814
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,740
- Nah, I'll get up.

815
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,740
- Just a video of him just pointing a knife at you.

816
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,740
- I don't want to be unc, I want to be a cousin.

817
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:34,740
- Bro, then you shouldn't have hosted.

818
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:37,740
- My life sucks shit. - Yeah, dude.

819
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:38,740
- Everywhere I go, I'm an unc.

820
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,740
- We just think about every single thought we've had today.

821
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,740
- It's not even Thanksgiving, man. You're unc.

822
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,740
- I know, dude. I'm always the guy who's in charge of direction,

823
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,980
wasn't driving. It's everything has turned us blue today. He got he

824
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,440
graduated on blue. He's yeah on to grayness. That's because we get this

825
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,760
guys. Wow, even though Neptune is a very cold planet, I got hot wearing my

826
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:03,260
hoodie, so I had to take it off damn and I think the Matt right thing was I

827
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,620
think you look hotter with it off.

828
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:11,100
Don't say that to your uncle. I don't say that the on fucking weird. I got me

829
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:16,380
in some type of way. This we need to import some uncles and aunts for for

830
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:21,620
Thanksgiving on Thursday. Oh my God, we can go on. We should get we should get

831
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:25,780
Alan Phil yeah, Phil and Alan. I don't think Phil would want to come back with

832
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:32,020
Alan. Remember yeah, that's true. Okay, yeah, true. We can do we can do the

833
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,780
Thanksgiving focus group.

834
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,500
That would work

835
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:37,580
watch us.

836
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:40,100
We feel ourselves

837
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:45,500
do you want to make fifty dollars on Thanksgiving Day?

838
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:52,500
We'll pay you $10 to sit for five hours and watch us eat. Do you guys want to watch?

839
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:57,500
No, you can't have a plate. You're watching us talk about green bean casserole.

840
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:02,500
Oh, I have an amazing green bean casserole recipe I'm going to do with fresh green beans, guys.

841
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,500
Can you do a tease? Can you do a trailer right now?

842
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,500
Can we have a trailer of the menu?

843
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,500
Okay, guys.

844
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:08,500
Menu trailer?

845
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,600
depends on if I decide to make my bulgogi sliders, but

846
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:17,540
basically turkey, that's a lock, some kind of sage butter that I'm gonna put

847
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:21,840
underneath the skin, crisp it up, that's gonna be deliciously juicy. Do it like

848
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,460
a trailer.

849
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:25,220
This Thanksgiving,

850
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:29,260
sage butter turkey, possibly I take out the

851
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:32,980
spine and turn it into a big log of meat.

852
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:38,380
Spiral baked ham that I pre baked and I put on glaze and Cameron thinks that

853
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:42,240
I made the whole thing. I don't think you make he thinks I make

854
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:49,420
Hawaiian rolls, the ham or packages of Hawaiian rolls, green bean casserole,

855
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,180
fresh green beans and I might even fry my own onions,

856
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:56,700
chipotle mac and cheese, third year running first year, really good second

857
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:02,380
year, not that good third year. I'm going to add mustard powder wow and

858
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:10,900
some kind of drink, maybe a hard Arnold bomber, which I know a John Daly.

859
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:14,360
That's what we call that. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, okay. No, I don't

860
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,100
think no is even come. I think no is working. Yeah, that's fucked. But so

861
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,460
what do you guys that means I can bring white claws. Yeah, which counts as a

862
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,860
thing to yeah, because I was gonna I was singing that was basically my only

863
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:28,740
option. And then when I realized no was going to be there, probably making

864
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,940
mixed drinks. I was like, well, that's this is why our Thanksgiving works,

865
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,580
because

866
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:38,380
I cook all the food and everyone else brings drinks, which is usually the

867
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:42,220
bring some food. I bring last year. He brought about this many. I think I

868
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:45,660
brought way more than that, but I did bring cranberry sauce. I remember,

869
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:49,040
which is a crazy move. Why is that crazy? Because we didn't even have a

870
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:53,140
turkey cranberry sauces at Thanksgiving. That's when you eat it. I brought some

871
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:56,860
mashed potatoes that were irrelevant. Yeah. See, I might even make the mashed

872
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,580
potatoes this year. Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna, but yeah, because I want

873
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:06,580
to eat them. Well, this year I'm going to bring, I don't remember bringing a few vegetables.

874
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:12,300
You brought, you laid, you got a sheet pan and you laid one layer of vegetables. I did

875
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,980
have small ass sheet pans, but guess what? I have. And everybody had like four vegetables.

876
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,740
I have a bigger sheet pan this year. You're going to have to. Tomorrow I'm going out,

877
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:22,500
I'm buying stuff and I'm going to do all the prep work. Whatever you're, think about how

878
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:26,780
many people are coming. I think the head count is nine or eight, eight or nine. But realize

879
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,200
does it? These are all guys hungry fucking guys. Yeah, no things to make

880
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,840
two helpings at least two plates. It I know what I'm doing and no isn't coming

881
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,380
there, so you can't yeah there's not going to be one guy only serves himself

882
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:42,760
one crumb yeah exactly no. So don't save a crumb of a he's not coming. I know

883
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:47,420
here's what I'm thinking. Don't tell him he's working. I'm thinking we literally

884
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,980
assassinate him at work. Show up with a plate show up with a plate covered in

885
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,320
ten,

886
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,980
and go like dude, since you couldn't come

887
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:00,120
since he couldn't come. We could leave it in his bedroom, since he couldn't come.

888
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:03,020
We made your as a play. You can all hide in his and then we take a video of him

889
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:06,680
opening it. He's so excited. His friends did that for him, and then he opens it

890
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:10,980
and it's one make it with a week. We do a half of a green bean with all the

891
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:15,840
beans inside taken. Oh yeah, that's a good idea and maybe a strand of beef

892
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,240
yeah, like you know how slow cooked beef turns into the strand one little hair

893
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:24,300
size strand of beef. It's a good idea, some yeah and we take a bite out of all

894
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,980
too. We bite all the food. I think it's a good idea. Do you guys want to see my painting?

895
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:34,100
Yes, I do. Let's do the painting. Guys, when I was in Los Angeles, I did a full tour of

896
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:44,980
every single modern art museum. I did the LACMA. What's that? LACMA balls? No, it's

897
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:49,100
actually the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Hey, you're suffering from LACMA. Yeah,

898
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:54,100
LACMA balls in your mouth. That would be LACMA. Cameron, chill on him. That would be

899
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:59,500
be actually lack of my nuts. No, that would be the lick. You want to lock up

900
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,180
my nuts?

901
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:07,660
Chill the fuck out. Stop being a... What are you doing? He's a jock. I'll just

902
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,100
rip my painting out. You're right, you're right. He is... Say another

903
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:11,340
New Zealand word too. I'll rip it up.

904
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:14,340
You know what? You don't even wanna hear about it, whatever.

905
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:22,820
He's been on a jock kick today. The triumphant return of that song. I've

906
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:26,500
been waiting on. I realize it's been a long time. He's been a jock all day. He

907
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:30,920
needed to play a sport song. He's been a jock to Julio, but here's what I'd like

908
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,860
to say anybody. This was you ruined your own painting. So before I tell you what

909
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:39,020
just happened, because I know that you're too stupid to understand how did

910
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:44,580
me ripping my painting make you feel blue, scared blue, blue. Oh, my God, that

911
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:48,860
was the art piece, because here's what I learned. Here's what I learned in Los

912
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:54,160
Angeles. Art can be anything. It doesn't just have to be an awesome photo of you that you

913
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,720
took on Mars where you're buff, which is like that. It doesn't have to be a painting of

914
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,960
the member, Barry. It can be a full-on performance, guys. And what I just did was a performance

915
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:09,000
art. And now I will hold the pieces back together, and you can see that this was Neptune.

916
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Wow.

917
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Wow.

918
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Wow.

919
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,000
So that was pretty amazing, right?

920
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Yeah.

921
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That's incredible.

922
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
We even got the dark spot.

923
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Yeah, there's another dark spot.

924
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:22,300
Yep, pretty impressive and I and there might be it's kind of has shades of

925
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,360
Jupiter of the Jupiter paying some might say, but that was also part of the

926
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:29,620
performance trademark of your work. Exactly. So now that will be and here's

927
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:33,720
what how we'll hang it up. We'll hang it up so that the sides are like this

928
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:37,360
right. So that it's like highlight damage. I like the ripping this. Yeah,

929
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,900
the whole thing, but that's incredible. That's like the banks a Banksy. Yeah,

930
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,660
is it where the self shredding exactly, but I was the one shredding it instead

931
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:48,560
of so you were the one shredding the Banksy painting yeah do they have me

932
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,640
back there with a crank

933
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:56,160
and then I got you're in a wheel you to run yeah, whatever you do, do not burn

934
00:54:56,160 --> 00:54:58,120
this crank. Your job is to guard the

935
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:04,520
Banksy. I got you, Mr Banksy. Oh, it's kind of hot in here. This must be the

936
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:04,960
AC

937
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:12,080
yeah. That was a hard job. Yeah, didn't they just reveal Banksy's identity? Yeah,

938
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,280
his name was John Banksy. He was a peanut. Holy Shit,

939
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,440
he was not a peanut, not a peanut man. That's what I would do if I was him,

940
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:23,960
though you'd be a peanut or I would just like I'd be like here's my face reveal

941
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:28,300
and then I would just have a mask on a peanut and I would take a picture of I

942
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,180
would be another in a person on the street and be like can I take a pic of

943
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:35,800
you yeah and I would just yeah. This is me. My name is Eduardo. It's a random

944
00:55:35,820 --> 00:55:43,480
course. I sell street corn. Yeah. This is Banksy. That's the thing that's so

945
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,760
beautiful about Banksy. He could be anybody. Yeah, he could be. He could be

946
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,140
well, maybe not anybody. No, I think he has to be British. He could be a

947
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:55,540
British guy who's been, who's alive right now. Yeah. Yeah, well he could, no,

948
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,440
he doesn't have to be alive now. He could have died years ago, we don't know.

949
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,480
But he just had to have been alive at some point. Do you think he's something

950
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,680
where he'd never even existed? That's, yeah, he could have. You think it's like

951
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,860
Shakespeare, where there's multiple guys, all of the British people together are in

952
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,800
on it. Yeah, what if it was the Queen and that's why we haven't seen so holy

953
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,180
fuck the Queen was Banksy and she was protesting herself,

954
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:16,220
controlled opposition

955
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:21,220
sigh up, sigh up for a second. I was having trouble following that and I was

956
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:24,180
like when did the Queen protest Banksy? When did the Queen

957
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:30,600
when did she die this summer last year or this year? How did she die again old

958
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,700
MattyL Oldness, yeah. Old age, dude.

959
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,700
MattyL She got her shit blown up.

960
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,700
Ryan Oh, it wasn't violent? Oh, it was violent.

961
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,700
MattyL She got blown up.

962
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,700
MattyL She stepped on a landmine in her backyard.

963
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,700
Ryan Oh my god. Jesus Christ.

964
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,700
MattyL Yeah, the Queen of England stepped on a landmine from the war

965
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,700
and she didn't know and she fucking...

966
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,700
Ryan Why don't we have a queen? All we have is a freaking congestion.

967
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,700
MattyL We have a queen.

968
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:54,700
MattyL I thought we did.

969
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,700
MattyL Isn't that the first lady?

970
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,700
MattyL Isn't she technically the queen?

971
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:03,420
I thought you were going to say Beyonce or Lizzo or somebody like this.

972
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:06,140
We used to have a queen every couple of years and a new one.

973
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,340
We used to have Melania and then we had Michelle Obama.

974
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,820
Who is Joe Biden's wife?

975
00:57:10,820 --> 00:57:13,340
I don't think he has a wife.

976
00:57:13,340 --> 00:57:14,340
Dr. Jill Biden.

977
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,340
Dr. Jill.

978
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,340
Don't forget the doctor.

979
00:57:16,340 --> 00:57:17,340
You don't forget the doctor.

980
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,340
That would suck if that was your GP.

981
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,340
Her maiden name?

982
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,340
Her maiden name is not Dr. Jill.

983
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,340
It was Pepper.

984
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,340
Her name is not Jill Pepper.

985
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,340
Dr. Jill Pepper.

986
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:28,060
Her maiden name is not doctor. It was pepper. Her name is not Jill pepper

987
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,040
Jill pepper, Dr. Jill pepper. Yeah, you're fucking me. No, I'm not you

988
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:36,840
shitting on me. I wish I was joking. I really wish that I was joking her last

989
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,140
and you're not for real, though. No, I'm for real. Her last name was pepper.

990
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,540
Well, pepper corn.

991
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:50,080
Now I'm thinking it's a joke. No, it's not a joke. That's a name. It wouldn't

992
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,680
a word if it wasn't it's a name. Her name is Jillian pepper corn is a name for a

993
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:58,120
corn or a vegetable. No, what the fuck is a pepper corn? It's a dried out

994
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,680
ball. Yeah. Oh, I had another idea for a well. I can't do it because I don't

995
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,000
know where my jacket is, but the other idea for a performance art was that I

996
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,040
got a bunch of blue gum and I was going to chew a hundred pieces of it and make

997
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,120
a big ball of gum. Oh, that would be Neptune. I thought balls. Let's talk

998
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:14,600
about that.

999
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,840
Neptune is the original blue ball, Neptune and Uranus, two blue balls.

1000
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:23,920
Oh, my God, my blue balls hang over Uranus.

1001
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:29,040
How are your balls blue if they're that close to a fucking asshole? Well,

1002
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,680
because you're getting teased, you're getting edged fucking hate getting edge

1003
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,780
don't like it. Shit, bro, fucking makes me go. Just make me not already. I

1004
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:41,280
Christ honestly, though I do feel like I could if I'm being edged. I could do

1005
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:48,140
anything. Yeah, I agree. I could solve all this. Are you guys doing no nut November, guys?

1006
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:53,440
I'm working on it. I'm getting ready. I'm getting ready for it any day here now. Once

1007
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,840
it starts, I can't stop. You can't stop no nutting? I can't stop nutting. Once you start,

1008
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:06,520
you move it. How about nine nuts November? You only get nine? Nine is a good one. For

1009
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,220
for me have to be ninety nine that's ninety nine nuts of November, Ninety

1010
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:10,480
Nine

1011
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:16,140
the ninety nine. That'll be such a fire rom three times at three and some odd

1012
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:20,340
times a day. Then he falls in love. Yeah, they should make rom coms for guys that

1013
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:24,280
are mostly about fucking yeah. They did that love and marriage. Didn't they do

1014
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:26,880
that? That was forty days and forty nights. I don't know. I haven't seen

1015
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,040
any. It's a movie where a man gets assaulted and then that's how he loses

1016
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,380
the challenge. He jizzes. I guess I salted yeah. He gets us and then it's a

1017
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,180
a woman. Oh, he's challenged to do 40 days and 40 nights of sex.

1018
00:59:40,180 --> 00:59:41,920
Yeah. Assaults him to jizz.

1019
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,600
Yeah. And that's how he loses.

1020
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,520
Wait, he gets sexually.

1021
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,400
And this is a laugh or it's played as a play for laughs for the fallen.

1022
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,000
It's played for laughs. Yeah, it's crazy.

1023
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
I think it's Josh Harnett is the star.

1024
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,960
Who's that? He's a guy.

1025
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,400
He's an Oppenheimer in Sin City.

1026
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:57,560
He's like this in Oppenheimer.

1027
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,640
Oppenheimer, you can't do this anymore.

1028
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:03,880
Yeah. Oppenheimer, you crazy, bitch.

1029
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,040
what we can't like you can't know when he says that he's saying that you can't be

1030
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:12,160
a communist yeah. Oh, I forgot that he actually Oppenheimer. You have to build

1031
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:14,960
this. That's okay. I want you to do it.

1032
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:22,120
I like the movie, but it's annoying everyone's doing that every

1033
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:25,760
how many

1034
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:32,000
have you sat right there and I've sat right here. We've gone over this

1035
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:36,200
American Prometheus. You can't build a bunch of fucking crazy bombs and blow up

1036
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:39,840
a bunch of crap, man. What are you building this stuff for? Nobody's gonna buy this

1037
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,060
crap. Do you hate Japanese people? Is that why you're building that?

1038
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,320
Taking a picture of you? The children.

1039
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:49,440
There's children outside. Children outside and they're taking photos of us.

1040
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,000
They heard us talking about Oppenheimer, a bunch of movie fans. Yeah. I think

1041
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,120
that those are Oppenheimer stands out there, bro. Yeah, they're trying to tear

1042
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:03,320
on the studio. God damn bastards. All right, Oppenheimer. Oh, that movie.

1043
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,600
Yeah, that's how the movie ends. His girlfriend finds out what we're going to

1044
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:11,880
do. I think I'm going to name myself Oppenheimer. That's how it ends. I think

1045
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:15,760
I'm going to call him Oppenheimer. I think I'm going to call the bomb the

1046
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,920
Oppenheimer bomb. Wow! They looked out by calling him Oppie the whole movie.

1047
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,640
It's cool. It's a cool, apparently, that's his real life nickname. That was

1048
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,360
his nickname. Yeah, Oppie. I wouldn't say Oppenheimer all the time like that.

1049
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:31,720
what oh yeah, I wouldn't say Oppenheimer up and I'm a up up up up up up up up up

1052
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:45,240
