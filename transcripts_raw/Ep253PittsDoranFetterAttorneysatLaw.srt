1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
Okay, all right, do we still do a clap or you're just don't know we don't do

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,400
it.

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,040
He comes back and now we have to explain that to explain how really

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,400
everything is now on the shit yeah, that's all we talked about where you're

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,600
going. Oh yeah, we cry, you're right and cried and complained, okay, because you

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,040
were gone and we didn't have anybody to do stuff like turn all these little

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:25,920
knobs yeah. Well, you don't touch the knobs yeah, that's the first that's your

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,840
his mistake. Well, here's my first thing that is my problem. The faders the

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,400
first thing is touching all the I didn't you I was rotating these cables. I was

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,200
trying to they don't want to give rotating them yeah. I was trying to

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
rotate me to change the volume like switch them. Oh, like this yeah, but I

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,840
didn't work at all. They don't know you rotate these ones yeah, that does

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,840
something yeah.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,860
there's tell there's not enough dials on this soundboard. There's a lot of

15
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,580
bunch of virtual ones. See it, say look, look at this. I thought that was a

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:07,100
need his tech wizardry back because I wanted to install doom on this the whole

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:11,880
damn time yeah yeah. Well, I think we could do maternal. You can honestly

18
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,560
install doom anything on anything day, but can it run any crisis on yes? Wow,

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,080
you can install crisis on doom these days for it. Fuck me yeah. Could you

20
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,160
build a minecraft computer. Did you guys ever watch these videos? Yeah, they build

21
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,880
the computer. They build stuff in minecraft out of some kind of stone. I'm

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,760
not sure what colour it was, but they built some kind of, well,

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:37,560
named after the CEO of I don't think it was red, Sumner Redstone. But whatever

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,600
this stone is they use, they made a Pokemon game and they made a Tetris in

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,040
Pokemon Red. Yep, was the first Pokemon game for this, because of the stone.

26
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,160
Can we stop fucking arguing? You've been here five minutes, we're already

27
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,300
I'm not starting any arguments. I'm so excited. I'm so, so happy to have you

28
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,040
back. I'm happy to be back. Can I tell you I'm so happy to be back in the

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,860
United States?

30
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,880
Yeah.

31
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,400
I really, can I say something completely honestly from the bottom of my heart? I

32
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,020
want you to. Every time I go, 'cause I went to Mexico this year. Yes. I loved,

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,000
I loved, I've been really, I have never been this worldly before. This is the

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,320
year of my being worldly. You're travelling for us. I went to Mexico, okay,

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,240
and I thought this is incredible. This is the best country I've ever been in in my

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,860
life. This is I'm having a beautiful time. I'm seeing beautiful things. I'm

37
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,880
meeting beautiful people and friendly people who aren't beautiful

38
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,680
and that's okay. And I'm thinking and it's okay to not be beautiful. Well, if

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,580
you're very friendly, it's okay to not be beautiful. If you're not friendly

40
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,480
though and you're ugly, I can smack you. Yeah, man, legally, it's easy. I can do

41
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,020
smack the shit, but I'm thinking maybe the US, maybe you know, maybe all my

42
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:51,180
life, maybe the US just as it sucks. Maybe it's if it's not as good as

43
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,820
Mexico. Yeah, maybe I maybe I'm mistaken. I go to Ireland.

44
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,100
The US is a million times better than I of

45
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:04,920
thank you. It's horrible. Yes, can I can I tell you a fun fact what about

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,100
here's something you might not know about about Irish people that I learn

47
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,260
from our tour guide. Okay, so apparently one of the most unique things about

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,440
Irish people is a social custom. They have only in Ireland. Apparently these

49
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,300
people they drink socially wow that's what they told and it's actually

50
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:28,100
customary for when an Irishman goes to a pub. He'll actually sometimes buy a

51
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:32,140
round of drinks for his friends and this is a social custom in Ireland. Oh,

52
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,900
that kind of defines their culture. That actually would be nice to do here to

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,120
drink socially. I know it's a shame that only Ireland does that yeah, but I mean

54
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,500
yeah, that's it's just kind of a custom. They built their and also here's

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,180
another fact I learned not from the torque well indirect. The tour guide

56
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,480
didn't tell me this, but I learned indirectly through the tour guides

57
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,520
actions, which is that Irish people every day for lunch. They eat

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,440
Thanksgiving dinner.

59
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,920
Really, you just learn this from a

60
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,160
they have they have a race. They have restaurants that are like chipotle, but

61
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,560
for Thanksgiving Turkey, you great, you pick Turkey or ham and then you pick

62
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,680
mashed potatoes or roast potatoes. You are you have that they have the

63
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,860
knees shield and they go through the metal cafeteria. Okay, and it's the

64
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,960
worst food you've ever eaten in your life. I imagine it's really bad, but

65
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,700
sometimes they call it carvery. Sometimes I kind of want oh yeah, but

66
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,280
that's, but that's, but that's what I'm saying that's there, but so yeah, of

67
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,440
course, sometimes you kind of want that right yeah, but which also you also you

68
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,500
want you want the mashed potatoes. You want the meat. You don't want the

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,520
boiled carrots and the boil cabbage. That shit is fucking disgusting nasty

70
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,300
thing. I want to taste like literally nothing, but here's yeah. Sometimes you

71
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,360
want that. Of course, sometimes you want that. That's why we have thanksgiving.

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,440
we get it once a year, maybe twice a year. If you have a special family,

73
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,560
whole month of

74
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,100
but these people, they have a restaurant. Every restaurant does this every

75
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:48,680
this is their

76
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,600
that's what they do. That is their hot dogs. They said that's yeah, they're

77
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,080
instead of being like I'm going to go get sweet green at lunch. They're like

78
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,420
I'm going to go get Thanksgiving dinner, so I have a question. They go to the

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,180
carvery in the in betweeners in the first episode. That's not Ireland. You

80
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:09,040
can't slap me. That's really it's not okay to do that. Sorry that I know I

81
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,780
how strong I am. Whoa, you are the ultimate slapper. That's the first time

82
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,140
I ever slapped you. You slap me all day. What are you talking about?

83
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:18,400
What are you talking about? That's the first time I've ever slapped you. You slap

84
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,480
all the time, but I don't complain because you're weak. Yes.

85
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,260
Tell me. Yes. Were the people in Ireland- You'd better- You slapped me again.

86
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:32,920
That coffee's going. Were they as big and as fat as you could possibly imagine?

87
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,120
Yeah, here's another Ireland fact. How do you get fat eating that shit? That's

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,200
what I'm saying. Here's another Ireland fact. You think- What do you mean? Okay,

89
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,400
America's America's the how do you get fatty big thanksgiving every day?

90
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,320
Makes no sense. I'm drinking Guinness

91
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,600
every night. This is a low calorie beer Guinness at lunch. Is it really yeah?

92
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
It's only four percent alcohol, low alcohol percentage, low alcohol

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,880
percentage. Isn't that funny you all? They that's the other thing that you're

94
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,760
like yeah, we drink like eight Guinness is a night. Yeah, like it's actually two

95
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,600
percent alcohol. Yeah, I think it's nine. That's a rattler. It's twelve hours.

96
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Poor is like barely a hundred calories. They're pussies, but yeah, so

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
people in America are fat, you'll hear that from the news and the media and you

98
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,900
walk around. Maybe you'll see some chubby people, but I would say maybe the top

99
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,980
three fattest people I've ever seen in my life were all in the past week in

100
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,520
Ireland.

101
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,040
I knew it to most of them are not most of them are not that fat, but you'll

102
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,340
some you'll see you'll see some big ones. You'll see some crazy looking old

103
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:32,000
people. Do they have the vest on? Do they have a stop watch? They have full

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,640
full protruding yeah, the big fucking beer beer gut from all the over their

105
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,360
that bats could live under.

106
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
- Yes.

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,120
- Could go up and make a

108
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,960
- A pensioner's nest.

109
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,780
- A very nice nest.

110
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,620
- It's called a pensioner's gut.

111
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,080
- It hangs out so far forward.

112
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,200
- It's called a pensioner's gut?

113
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,040
- Yeah.

114
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,860
- Really?

115
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,700
- Uh-huh.

116
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,540
- What is a pensioner's gut?

117
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,360
- A pensioner is an old person

118
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,200
who's on retirement.

119
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,040
- Somebody who's on, yeah,

120
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,700
they get social security.

121
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,540
- Uh-huh.

122
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,480
And I made up pensioner's gut.

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,320
I think that maybe--

124
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,720
- That's a good thing.

125
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,920
- How seniors can maintain a healthy gut.

126
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,200
Yeah, see they all look like this over there.

127
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,360
- That's what I would be doing

128
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,640
if I was walking around with Thanksgiving

129
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,280
in my belly every day. That would be I mean no wonder they've never made

130
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,080
anything interesting in terms of no art. They also have the most musing history

131
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,740
of all time yeah. You go to these amazing you go to these amazing historical

132
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,220
castles yeah, which first of all they're there's castles, so the castles are so

133
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,880
cool because it's their ancient castles from the year nine hundred or whatever

134
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,080
before they even knew they were irish. You see these incredible well also most

135
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,360
of them were not built by irish people. They're built by the vikings who are

136
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,800
debating so exactly. I even do the cool thing in their

137
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,040
person is in charge of all the people who are coming and dominating them and

138
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,680
ruining their lives forever. Yeah,

139
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,760
you go there and it's the the most incredible thing you've ever seen in

140
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:46,200
your life. We went to this old, like crumbling, like Abbey. That was like

141
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,680
these ruins in the middle of a field. It literally looked like Lord of the

142
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,560
Rings, and I was talking to the tour guide, who was this old guy who had

143
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,960
lived in that town like his entire life. I was just talking to him about about

144
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,360
it and I was like yeah. This is so beautiful, like the sky is so blue and

145
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,800
these ruins are incredible and he's like yeah. I don't know you kind of take it

146
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,760
for granted. It sucks

147
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,200
I can imagine well, but yeah, I'm living there living in the coolest place of all

148
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,480
time did I mean we wake up every day. We see the statue of liberty in the Empire

149
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,180
State Building right outside our window and we I mean I'm not every American

150
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,400
thing is bullshit, though we don't have castles Hearst Castle. Where's that? We

151
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,000
don't have as much California. That's also most of the castles in Ireland

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,160
California Castle. I one of its got it's made out of like fucking it's made

153
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,200
-Hurst Castle is the guy, William Randolph Hurst that -Oh yeah, is this the one that the

154
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:40,200
house is all traps and trap doors and stuff? Or no, no, no, no, that's the Winchester mansion.

155
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,200
-That's a hotel. -The Winchester, the one where the person who made the rifles, so they

156
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,200
have all the doors that goes to nowhere. -Well, that's a lady who, she was a widow.

157
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,200
-Haunted by the ghosts of all the people that she was a widow. -Yeah, she was a widow.

158
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,360
it's a lady who she was she was haunted by the ghosts of all the people that

159
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:59,320
were killed by the Winchester rifle. And she was building a big house to escape

160
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,040
them. That's a different story. That's cool. The Hearst Castle is basically

161
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,880
this guy who's really, really rich. William Randolph Hearst. Yeah, he built

162
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,300
a... He's the one that Citizen Kane's based on? Yeah, he built a giant house

163
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,900
that was made... It's made out of... Xanadu. Yeah, it's made out of random

164
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,940
shit from other... He has a

165
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,120
tenth century, like like a church, yeah, like walls and so that's the thing

166
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,240
about a lot of the castles to that we visited, like a lot of the cool ones

167
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,320
are the ones that are completely fallen apart and are like authentic or

168
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,720
whatever, because most of the castles you'll go in and it's like this huge,

169
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,840
like a table, it's it's it's huge and it's got like the fucking it's all

170
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,360
built up and it's giant. You go up spiral staircases and stuff and you'll

171
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,720
the tour guide will be like yeah. So this castle was originally built in the

172
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,220
year seven hundred A. D. And the only thing remaining from that time is this

173
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,700
wall right here and the rest of it we all built ten years ago.

174
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,900
Yes, I know this. I hate that saying. We restored it. They do that in Boston,

175
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,700
too. I remember going to the Paul Revere house and they were like, "This

176
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:02,140
is not even Paul Revere's house, by the way. This is what it would have

177
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,400
looked like if he had a craftsman style." Is that the one in downtown?

178
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,280
No, it's in the north end. No, no. I'm thinking of... I remember going to

179
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,900
Paul Revere's house as a kid. Yeah, didn't somebody who fucking... Being

180
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:17,180
like, "This is Gary." It's sucked. It's $20 to walk... And it's a house

181
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,020
from from the

182
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:24,220
seventeen hundred, so it's one room. What kid in Boston also get learns about

183
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,800
Paul Revere every year from kindergarten to eighth grade is like fuck. I want to

184
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,260
see his house. I need to see that I want to see his horse. I'm so I'm so the

185
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,980
get a talk about it. The house, the house doesn't come into the story at

186
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,800
all. You get your burnout dude, complete revere burn. Yeah, I like his beach

187
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,940
actually hate his beach. I

188
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:50,140
he's got a bad word. It's like Revere Beach Hampton Beach. No Hampton Beach is

189
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,180
over. It is way better. There's no one there for a reason. That's true. All

190
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,980
there's like Kelly's yeah, they have a cat. That's it. That's the only

191
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,540
fucking good. Yeah, Hampton Beach is fire and Kelly's is not even good. No,

192
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:04,300
but it's the only it's the only food they have like a boardwalk with one

193
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,060
restaurant, the worst beach ever Kelly's is I mean it's though, but it's not good.

194
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,820
Don't say it. It's it's don't say it. Here's another thing about Irish history.

195
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:16,060
every single castle you go to. If it as a tower, it was built by an alcoholic.

196
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,940
If it as a tower, they'll tell you every single time that tour guide will tell

197
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,220
you. So this tower was built in this year and then three hundred years later

198
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,140
lightning struck it and blew up the top of it. Every single tower they they

199
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,900
tell you that lightning knocked off the top of the tower. I went to one yeah,

200
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,620
but they said that lightning that lightning blew up half of the town

201
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,700
because it struck the room where they kept all the gun

202
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,820
Ireland really it truly is a land cursed by God that God does not want to

203
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:46,640
know and try to wipe it off. I mean yeah, they all that's that they don't

204
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,140
even get like they don't get lightning there. It's not hot enough. Normally

205
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,020
it's so rare that every time that lightning is struck, it's destroyed.

206
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:57,580
So I think a monument to human greatness

207
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:01,720
yeah Ireland, they're God's strongest people because he's constantly

208
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,840
torturing them. That's why they're all Catholic as somebody who's sixty

209
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,980
percent Irish man. I can say that that's I do not claim a zero. I was

210
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,660
interesting going and listen. I know I'm I'm the only one here who has to I

211
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,860
have to I'm not even defending myself because it's two against one. I know

212
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,580
I'm wearing right now. I know I'm talking a lot of shit and I'm wearing a

213
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,460
shirt that says Ireland on it, but

214
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:24,820
it's a nice shirt, but one of the shirt it was a hundred dollars. I'm lying.

215
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,340
That's not true at all. You got you got no less than that was in the tourist

216
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:33,380
store. Yeah, well, I bought it because it was like a normal clothing. You think I

217
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,680
thought they wove it. I saw they sold this at Eddie Murphy Clothing. Yeah,

218
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,180
you think I went to a weaver and an old Irish guy pulled out his loom and made

219
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,660
I thought that this was maybe the football team. I one of I one of my

220
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:49,180
greatest pleasures is to go that I've learned about this year is to go to a

221
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,300
country and to buy a piece of clothing that says the name of the country. Yeah,

222
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,780
it's good. I have to be doing that for the rest of my life. People do that in

223
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,980
America who live in America. Yeah, people buy shirts that say Montana on them. I

224
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:02,420
see a shirt. Why the hell are you doing that? New York at least forty times a

225
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:06,060
walking down the street. Dude showing up in like a shirt that says like Brooklyn

226
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,740
with the Statue of Liberty on it and say he's not even in Brooklyn. Yeah, where

227
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:15,220
did you get to? Where did you find this shirt? I really don't understand man. They have a shit ton of those.

228
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:20,100
They buy it in a different city. That's a New York tourist. They get it

229
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,260
somewhere on the West Coast. I have to take this phone call it is regarding my

230
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:28,260
boot on my car. Oh yeah. You guys continue. Do we just pause it? Alright.

231
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,460
right, okay, he's he got the boot on his car because he's a delinquent who

232
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:37,300
doesn't pay his bills, yeah, or tickets rather, and he has six children that he

233
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,500
doesn't feed. He's and so for somebody for somebody who's only 60% Irish, yeah,

234
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,740
he's acting like a real, real, here's another, here's another, I just

235
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:50,700
remembered another thing that made me mad in Ireland. You're, you're, you like

236
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,180
you went there and I had a wonderful time, I've always wanted to go and you

237
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,140
come back and all you do is complain. Listen, let me, let me tell you

238
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,580
something you are such a you would love you would love Dublin. I know that you

239
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,900
would you would fuck with Dublin. I probably like all of it no because the

240
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,620
rest of Ireland is is it's a country that is a museum yeah yeah there's no

241
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,580
it's nothing interesting. It's all you know. I hate museum exactly it's all

242
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,420
towns that are that are one street

243
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:20,260
and then and then everything else is a poor castle. The pubs are not fun,

244
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,100
except for where there's a lot of people yeah because it's all towns. It's all

245
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,100
it's oh yeah, and there's only like a few people in there. You're stuck

246
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:31,100
talking to some guys like oh, I used to be a good country and then these

247
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,680
fucking people move you would you would like Dublin, but I don't think that you

248
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,060
would fuck because you also don't like nature and you don't respect God. I

249
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,900
would like the beautiful country of Ireland because it's where now you

250
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,720
would you would be disappointed because you thought you had to like it because

251
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,580
of what you saw, but anyway, I guess something that maybe I don't know

252
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,620
something else that I tour guide said that well. First of all, he was talking

253
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,620
he was talking about he was talking about be going to cork. He's talking about

254
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,860
it's where that's where my my lineage that's where mine is to yeah, but again,

255
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:03,900
it's we're cousins. We're probably it's it's just nature man yeah.

256
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,460
I mean I don't know I didn't go to the all I went to was Dublin, then a bunch

257
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,580
of castles, so I guess I'm not the expert on it, but I think I think I've

258
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,460
got a pretty good idea of what goes down there.

259
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,900
Where was what was your tour guide saying so he basically so first of all

260
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,380
he said, but toward this tour where I was with my fiance's family, everyone from

261
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,660
the south, he said completely unprovoked. He was just like we were talking about

262
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,260
how bis they called biscuits, cookies or cookies, biscuits or whatever, and he

263
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,020
was like he just completely out of the was like yeah, and I think biscuits and

264
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,660
gravy are disgusting. I think that's the grossest food ever

265
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,140
the fuck

266
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:43,300
which is making me laugh so hard, not because of thinking that, but just

267
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,980
because of saying that to a group of

268
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:53,340
eight people for no reason, no reason completely. He was also and so he said

269
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,420
that, but right before that what he had said and and nobody said anything mean

270
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,560
to him about this, which I wanted to kill him after he said this. Yeah, he

271
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:05,560
said he said one of the Irish delicacies, one of our best delicacies that you guys

272
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,680
have to try is we take two slices of bread. We put butter on them and then we

273
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,560
put crisps in between them and it's called a crisp sandwich and it's the

274
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,600
thing I've ever tasted. I thought that was a, oh never mind, chip buddy is fries.

275
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,600
Chip buddy is fries. Yeah. And he said that was one of the delicacies.

276
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,600
This is the worst country on earth. And then he said biscuits and gravy are disgusting.

277
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,600
This is the worst country on earth. These people need to die. This is so, so bad.

278
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,600
This is getting worse. You always take it way too far. This is getting worse every year. I can't believe we let,

279
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,600
the UN needs to send, we need to send people in all black outfits

280
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,600
to destroy this country. They went and they wore all black outfits and

281
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,040
try to destroy England. I wish that the trouble, I hope the troubles come back 50 times worse.

282
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,680
People's heads are exploding in the middle of the day. This is a bad, bad place. You're

283
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,000
only saying this because there's a boot on your car and you're angry. I just found out

284
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:01,440
it's going to, they, I hate money. No, you like money. I like money. I'm mad about this

285
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,600
fucking boot. The boot on my car. You're coming in here with a sour attitude. I'm sorry. You

286
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,480
you come in here. You have to come in here. Once the episode start,

287
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,900
nothing bad is ever have to you have to think

288
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,560
about nothing.

289
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,600
You can't you have to be completely that cost me a thousand bucks, plus a

290
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,880
hundred bucks a day until because my my fucking license all right to be a

291
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
hundred percent clear. We don't need to talk about this on the show. I just

292
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,440
want to say it's a hundred percent my fault right yeah. I don't my car, my

293
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,560
card, the tags are expired. My insurance is out. I'm everything is I think this

294
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,060
this has been this has been looming over me for a long time. Cast my mind

295
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,580
backwards through time. I think I can walk through maybe fifty memories of you

296
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,500
bragging about not paying a parking ticket over the past few years. You

297
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,780
moving parking tickets from switching your license plate, having your license

298
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,940
plate stolen and saying that now you could get a new license plate and none

299
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,860
of the old tickets attached. I thought that we could claim that the person who

300
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:02,620
stole my license plate got all those tickets, but

301
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,920
that would have been us reporting the license plate stolen two years after

302
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,520
they stole it because they had two years of tickets anyway. Yeah, I owe a

303
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,980
thousand dollars and then a hundred bucks a day and that's a good get.

304
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,640
We're going to get a we're going to get a bump here. We're just going to get a

305
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,660
bump on the page. We need some please go to the the patron. I need it so so I

306
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,400
wish I could see the I don't since I have no clock of timing. It's a we

307
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,660
started at twelve ten. Okay, anyway, anyway, what do you say? He said eighteen

308
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:37,420
eighteen eighteen. I would like to say I've been I've been wanting to travel

309
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,020
because I've been interested in some history recently, and I've been watching

310
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,700
this this guy voices of the past on YouTube. Have you ever seen this guy? No,

311
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:49,100
he does. He reads like first hand accounts of like like primary sources

312
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:54,340
from when like the first embassies from one country to another in like the the

313
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,060
sixteen hundred and stuff, and I watched the one that was the same or the first

314
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:04,100
the time that the samurai, the Japanese, their embassy to Mexico. Wow and the

315
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,060
first sounds pretty cool. The first words written by a Mexican about the

316
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:15,460
Japanese embassy that comes into Mexico City is they have long hair. They kind

317
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,380
of look like girls. That was the

318
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:23,260
historical record that they have. It was very, very you got to be careful

319
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,700
watching those those history videos on YouTube. I'm addicted to them. I can't

320
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,160
careful on like specific ones, though, because I tried to look up the

321
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,800
difference between like a Cajun and a Creole, and it was a whole race science

322
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,760
video. They

323
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:39,560
history. I was like I was just trying to figure out what that what that was

324
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:42,700
because it was sometimes they do in seasoning. Sometimes it's real. You can

325
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,080
really easily stray into some bad history stuff without realizing it. If

326
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,020
you're if you're not, you have to be so hyper vigilant. I was I was going to

327
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,820
make sure that this and this is the most dangerous one, so I had my guard

328
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,300
property league, good or bad,

329
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,860
no even more honestly, even more dangerous than that is if you are

330
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:03,800
watching videos on youtube about Viking history yeah. Oh yeah, to be so care

331
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,620
about you, you click on one recommended video and you're you're gone, you're

332
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,100
done for because they know exactly how to they know how to say it so that

333
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,640
somebody who doesn't know it's a pipeline. Yeah, there's a the Viking

334
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,740
history stuff is really interesting how they were like the that's like the

335
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,880
people who are the the fucking royal family, the what are they called the

336
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,640
Winds, Windsor's, the Windsor's is that Windsor's is yeah. They claim that

337
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,140
they're like related to the first king of England, but there was like fifteen

338
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,880
kings in the middle that were just Viking guys who just killed enough people

339
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,680
that they there was nobody left to be can Vikings are crazy. You know, like a

340
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,240
bunch of the like Norse mythology stuff has been completely corrupted by or not

341
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,240
corrupted, but like all because of Christian mission missionaries, all

342
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,560
they're like legends that weren't written down, got lost because they got

343
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,380
switched out with like Christian stuff where they were trying to like it's

344
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:57,180
very crazy. There's a there's a and that's another topic. We have to be

345
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,240
really careful when you watch

346
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,220
but you got a religion. You got to make sure you're going to make sure that the

347
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,640
person who uploads the video that their like profile picture is not like a night

348
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,460
from the crusades or or like you or a statue of it's a statue. Don't click on

349
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:16,120
it. If they you have to have a fat white guy, this one's counterintuitive, but if

350
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:19,920
person feels a need to put a disclaimer at the beginning about what they're

351
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,120
talking about. Yeah, that's the danger. That's bad. Yeah, should be pretty.

352
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,800
You always gotta have, you always gotta have a fat white guy with a little

353
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,360
goatee or something, maybe a ponytail. Sometimes you can trust them. They need

354
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,600
to look, yeah, they need to look like, they need to look like a teacher. Yeah,

355
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,840
exactly. Yeah. But that's a slippery slope too. If they're in good shape, no,

356
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,720
no, no, no, no. You see a buff guy talking about Vikings, that is the most,

357
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:45,160
that guy has done a hate crime. I do not wanna see any of that shit, man.

358
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,260
do not show me that that's going to ruin all my I'm not going to get

359
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,260
recommended any more gambling videos. It's all just going to be this shit.

360
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,300
It's going to be like why do Filipino people ruin property values exactly

361
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,800
it'll be on a history,

362
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,340
yeah,

363
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,040
yeah,

364
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,140
like Jason history yeah and it's just like these fucking Filipinos moved in

365
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,340
not a good idea.

366
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:09,820
Another pool halls everywhere. I saw one that was

367
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,260
the voices of the past thing where he was a Chinese guy who went to where to

368
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:21,340
where Vikings from Norway, Viking, Scandinavia, he goes to Scandinavia,

369
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,300
Scandinavia, right?

370
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,940
I've realized 90 of these videos. He's like first contact videos are just these

371
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:32,140
people being like I went to this other country. They are disgusting.

372
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,940
Like this entire bit. He was like he was like it's the they're the most

373
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,780
disgusting people. He said they're barely even human. He said that every

374
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:44,960
morning, a bucket is passed around the entire village and every every man

375
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,380
washes his hair, washes his face, blows his boogers into it and spits in it and

376
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:54,260
then it goes to the next guy like it's a fucking like pirate movie yeah and

377
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:58,400
that's what they did every day. What's true? It's disgusting. The Viking I'll

378
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,960
say it do the Viking said almost no sense of hygiene. The Vikings were kind

379
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:07,140
of gross. They were just people and now you get like like and it's so funny

380
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,540
sorry, like the people like like the buff races, dudes are like well,

381
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,100
Vikings only ate like salted meat and shit and it's like yeah. They were also

382
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:19,140
fucking stupid. They're also the stupidest people in the world. All they

383
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,500
knew how to do is like rape and pillage. He said they were so yeah. They were

384
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,780
seven feet tall. They may have been stupid, but the the some some other Irish

385
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,820
history stuff is the like cities on the coast who would always get raided by the

386
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,180
the Saxons, the Vikings. They it's something that's so funny to me is that

387
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,900
they would get rated like like every year. They would get rated the same time

388
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,960
of year by the by the Vikings, but always would just know all these people

389
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,900
are pussies and we can beat them in a fight. So it would just come back every

390
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,460
year and fuck everything up and then leave and the town would just be like

391
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,940
oh great and build everything back and get more treasure and stuff. It

392
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:54,780
actually is

393
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,740
somebody is definitely again. Somebody's playing civ five yeah, that's the only

394
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,600
ex. It's so fucking. Oh, absolutely no, they didn't or it like maybe we should

395
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:10,220
move a little move some move towards the center of this. The I also saw a video

396
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,580
sorry I'm obsessed with these videos. I recommend anybody watches a video. I

397
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:18,420
wish this is what the episode was about me too, but this guy it was the Japanese

398
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:22,220
the first time the Spanish visited the Japanese and again the Japanese guys

399
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,700
like they are not even human. Their noses are four feet long

400
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,020
and then he said he tells the story about it was kind of cool. He tells like

401
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:31,760
their story of

402
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,460
he says like they have this religion where their Buddha is a baby. It's so

403
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,100
stupid,

404
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,220
but there's all these like paintings of like

405
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:45,640
Jesus as a Japanese guy. I'd never seen that before. It was really cool. Those

406
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,640
are sick and he's got like a halo around his head. They have

407
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,300
Mother Mary as a Japanese lady. That's pretty. Yeah, they drew the devil. It's

408
00:24:54,300 --> 00:25:00,000
so amazing. Two cultures come together. I honestly love cultural confluence.

409
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,020
this has got to be one of my favorite things in the world. I mean, could you

410
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,460
imagine? I've been trying to spread I'm just Americanism. I've been trying to

411
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:11,780
spread my own culture. Yeah, they have that everywhere. I mean you can get like

412
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,020
a Korean style burger, Spanish style burger, exactly, and I'm trying to

413
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:19,860
further that yeah. We need to show wings. I do think here's another fucked up.

414
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:26,300
We've done burgers. Another thing. Tell me I went to a pub for lunch. I ordered.

415
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,780
I said I'll have the burger. They said chicken or beef.

416
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:36,580
they do that in Australia. They call in Australia. They call they do it

417
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,340
everywhere else, except here. They do it in Canada. They do it in Mexico.

418
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:45,220
That is just is that horrible? They call that like a physical reaction, a

419
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,940
fried chicken sandwich, which is a different thing, which is a different

420
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:51,880
thing. It's not a in Australia and like every other European country. They

421
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,500
call it a chicken burger. It's messed up. I know I'm saying I experienced it

422
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,780
firsthand. I know in a scenario where it should be cut should have been cut and

423
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,780
you got it and it should be cut in half. Yeah, it was a big knife in the middle

424
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,880
exactly. Give me that it would have been a ten foot tall burger pub cheese

425
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,940
dripping down the side.

426
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:14,500
I'm also done with smash burgers and I'd like the burgers to be five feet tall

427
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,740
again. Yeah, Robin contact me

428
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:21,740
that's your problem. You did order a burger in a non American. Did you get

429
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:25,380
fish and chips? I got fish and chips. Where they I it's the only thing you can

430
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:30,020
get anywhere. You can you choose between a burger fish and chips or shepherds pie

431
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,380
or

432
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:35,340
or cottage. I got a Scottish. You have blood sausage. No, I've had blood

433
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,420
sausage before, though I had it when I was in Scotland. I got there blood in my

434
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,060
sausage. It's not bad. It doesn't taste like anything. None of their food tastes.

435
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,340
It's all brown and black items that don't taste like like every other

436
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,660
fucking country. You get a spice bag. What's that? It's like they throw pretty

437
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,580
much all the shit bag. They put everything in a bag and then throw a

438
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,620
bunch of spices in and it comes with curry sauce. Well, and by the way,

439
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:01,920
this is the brownest food in the world. This curry sauce is not curry. The only

440
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:07,260
green, the only green thing they eat is pea puree. Yeah, man, mushy peas, yeah,

441
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,500
and because and I know I said they ate boiled cabbage earlier, but that it's

442
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,740
not even green. No, it becomes completely white. It's

443
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,460
translucent. It's literally all brown food. They're on a brown food diet. Did

444
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:26,320
you feel like it was almost walking around? This is kind of political. Did you feel like

445
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,460
Ireland was kind of Trump vibes? Let me think for a second. No, kind of lots of whiteys.

446
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,980
Well, there's a lot of whiteys, but they're all like there were a lot of whiteys. They're

447
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:42,660
militantly woke. Were they woke or were they crackers? I saw a group of military men training

448
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:47,340
and running around with plastic guns. See, that's wokeism. Yeah, get a metal gun. That's

449
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:51,180
is the woke army yeah a micro plastic gun. Is that what it was she's a micro

450
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:56,540
plastic in your body to make you lgbt yeah yeah, go figure and that's why

451
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:59,540
they signed with palestine. Ireland does they do

452
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,420
but they're, but they're very heavy, but they'll let you know that they do in

453
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,820
the first in the first hour

454
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:10,820
is that really why they think they're doing the same thing. They're they

455
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,060
literally are the tour guide with the first day we met him. I was talking. I

456
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,300
I don't even remember how like yeah, no no reason to bring it up. It's like and

457
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:20,800
yeah, that's why we like so with Palestine, because I guess like we were

458
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,920
used to being the underdog. Wow, well yeah, they get fucked by the British for

459
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,720
years. They don't get they let themselves get by the British is there in

460
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,100
Britain. They are they are northern Ireland. They are British do they have a

461
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,120
different accent? That's the only fucking different. We're not getting into

462
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,380
this. Let's get into the only difference. I'm you know how I know my

463
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,160
DNA test says sixty percent Irish and British. You are not the hello.

464
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:48,760
hello. She said hello. You said hello. He's saying we need to start the okay

465
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,300
here. Yeah, thank God. Thank God. Thank God. We did because I was about to I've

466
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,760
been I've been holding my tongue this whole episode. No, no, no, no, let me

467
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,500
intro this here. Please do so.

468
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,300
What's the name of the person?

469
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:06,760
Sorry, do you remember the name? Oh, let me pull it up, but anyway, I guess I'll

470
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:10,640
just I'll come right out and say it. We started a law firm. We did fetter and

471
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,400
Doran and pits

472
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:22,300
FTP, FDP, Fuck the Police. No, it's PDF. PDF is way better. That's really good.

473
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:27,340
It's darn better. But we start, you know, a lot of these, a lot of these, isn't it alphabetical

474
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,740
when they do that? It's none of your business. It's an order of whatever letters are coolest.

475
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:37,860
Exactly. Okay. It's, you know, it's a lot of these lawyers that work nowadays, you see

476
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,460
they wear suits. They're prim, they're proper, they're annoying.

477
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,760
As long as I got my suit and tie. And they're old ass. I'm a legal in the court tonight.

478
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,660
Old heads. I think that the legal profession needs a little injection of

479
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,180
young blood. Where's the young blood? Right into the core of it. Where's the

480
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:56,020
zoom? Where's the elder zoomers? The elder zoomers. The elder zoomers.

481
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:59,260
The elder zoomers lawyers. Where are the elder zoomers who know actually. Who do Riz La.

482
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,340
Who know, because here's the thing. Exactly, Riz La, that's what I'm saying.

483
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,740
Lawyers, these are lawyers from the past. If you ever created a meme that

484
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,380
that was your IP, your intellectual property.

485
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,280
See, he doesn't know. He's got some lawyering to do.

486
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,300
If you confess to a crime in a meme,

487
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,820
the old guys, they're not even going to know.

488
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,840
They don't even know. What's that?

489
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:23,860
What's that? Maymay?

490
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,880
What's that?

491
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,400
They're going to say something like "Maymay."

492
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,420
And then now all of a sudden, I'm catching an assault and battery charge.

493
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,940
You got caught on a Maymay?

494
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,160
Yep, and now I'm catching an assault and battery charge

495
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,180
because it's pronounced "meem."

496
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,360
you know. These are old men who say J instead of gift

497
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,680
it a big show. You in his telephone. What are you talking about? Yep? What

498
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,560
do you mean a picture with a telephone? I'm reaching over the stand. I'm

499
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:55,440
strangling this guy. I'm trying to kill him with the plaintiff. Yeah, he's like

500
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,000
a sexual assault. What's that?

501
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,280
We didn't have that when I was working exactly. This is why we need and this is

502
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,880
what we do when we have our first when we have our first meetings with the

503
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,280
amendments. The Constitution doesn't have any amendments. Well, it has four

504
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,160
that's what he might say

505
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:14,620
and then we so that's what we do in our meetings with new potential clients, as

506
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:18,300
we say, and and they this is how they understand. We say old lawyers be like

507
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:22,380
this yeah, and then you do that and that's the commercial yeah and it's like

508
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,440
trying to attract a different. So anyway, yeah, we're going to get a

509
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,780
give. We're going to give out some legal advice today, legal advice. You can

510
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:32,460
take this seriously. You can take this is completely hold us accountable for

511
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,780
I pass the bar and this was sent to us by Bailey. I don't know if you want me to

512
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,840
say your last name, so I won't. We're going to say your email address right

513
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,300
now. Thank you, Bailey, for sending us this website. It's a good website

514
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:50,220
where it's called Avvo and it's people post their it's basically if you've

515
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:54,580
listened to our doctor episodes, it's practo, but for the legal profession,

516
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,880
essentially. The name the name derives from

517
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:03,360
I have a like I have a legal question. I go quest. I have a legal question word

518
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,400
for lawyers, avocado, damn in other languages, what language every other

519
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:13,440
language it's avocado. Yeah, really, I've got oh well yeah, but it's the same

520
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,000
it. They're same in French. It's avocado and that literally means both lawyer and

521
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,200
avocado and I assume it's in Latin and Spanish and all that shit too because

522
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,960
they're green on the inside. Yep, yeah, because they're not even they got a

523
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,840
they got a pit at their center. I believe that's a cold heartless pit. I'm like

524
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,420
but so we're going to give some legal advice on these legal questions that

525
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,840
people have, so i'll go ahead and start it off here,

526
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,460
because the people who are some questions that people that are usually

527
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,740
older lawyers, yeah, who don't none of their get it. They don't answer

528
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,700
anything correctly.

529
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:44,720
Can I make a real crusty crab restaurant? I want to open a restaurant

530
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,180
from a tv show. Specifically, I want to open a crusty crab from sponge bob. Is

531
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,800
this possible? What problems would I run into with copyright issues? Who would I

532
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,240
have to talk to in order to make this restaurant possible?

533
00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:01,440
us from a little perspective does we'll fucking will find it all. I don't think

534
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,120
you can get in trouble for this because Stephen Hillenburg is dead, has passed

535
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,880
away. So what I mean who's going to see you right now, Patrick star show, then

536
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,140
you can make a crusty crab exactly. I don't understand why again. Again, both

537
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,740
of these would go against his wishes, but what's he going to do? He can't you

538
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,620
know he's going to roll over in his grave. People always say that oh, this

539
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:24,540
guy's rolling over his grave. That wouldn't scare me at all. I wouldn't be

540
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:27,940
able to see it as great under the ground. So far down suck my dick. I

541
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:31,280
don't care if he's rolling over I'm up here yeah as long as you're not rolling

542
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,500
over into my bedroom really fast or down a hallway. I say yes suck my dick.

543
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,080
If you can reach it, oh and I start dancing with my dick out on his grave

544
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:42,620
bag, but then that's yeah. How do you then it's yow ming yeah under their

545
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,920
seven foot wingspan? I really liked it this one. I just like this one says I

546
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,600
want to open a restaurant from a TV show. Specifically, I want to open a

547
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,460
he had the he one of the question of a little TV show first yeah yeah, and then

548
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,500
he thought of the one. I mean these old lawyers don't know sponge, but they

549
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,460
don't know sponge bob at all

550
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:02,460
okay. This isn't working now great.

551
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,300
That's fine or like a job, jubio okay, it's working. Is it legal for your

552
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,500
doctor to request to watch you? I saw this one during my GI exam today. The

553
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,220
doctor suggested that he watched me go so he could see where I was having

554
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,380
problems. I said okay, even though it seemed strange, it made me uncomfortable.

555
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:21,340
is this legal? I like this because this is a this is not legal. No, no, no,

556
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:24,840
this is legal, because this is this could lead to an entirely different type

557
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,820
of medicine, which is that it's not what you eat. It's not the poop itself. It's

558
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:33,300
your way, the way you have poor technique that gives you diarrhea. Yeah,

559
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,580
it's normal shit until it gets to your asshole and then you bend your knees

560
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:40,120
wrong and it's water. Yeah, I can I can see that I could definitely see that

561
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:43,420
being definitely. I just put a camera in a bathroom. You said okay, so it's

562
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:46,120
legal yeah, that's also true yeah. You have no case.

563
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,000
Is it illegal to hire a hypnosis to control an ex husband? I found out my

564
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,480
ex wife tried to hire a person to hypnotize me into signing passports for

565
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:59,820
my children, so she could leave the country with that that's legal. Okay, I

566
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:06,040
will that's legal, because what you do under hypnosis is we're still it's very

567
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:10,220
weird. I did not include any of these in my slide shows because it goes against

568
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:16,100
my feminist agenda, but there is a lot like a lot of questions on this thing

569
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,500
that are like I lied to get my husband in jail and now I regret it.

570
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,580
Who should I tell

571
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:27,980
it's like there's like I like ten or fifteen different questions. They were

572
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:32,940
like I lied and told my told one was like I stabbed myself and blamed it on

573
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:37,500
my husband. Now he's in jail. What do I do? Oh my God, it's pretty awesome.

574
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,760
this is such a good website. I really as I recommend anybody check it out. I had

575
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,480
a landscaper buried a poop in my backyard during the job they did here.

576
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,220
What can I do had a landscape company coming to work in my backyard? They

577
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,260
finished yesterday. I went out there today, saw that my dog was digging up

578
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,380
some things. I looked at it and it smell it and it smells like human number two

579
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:01,960
human number two is dug about a foot down and realized that one of the

580
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,180
workers and deficated in my backyard and buried it call the company. They talk

581
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,420
one of the guy he admitted to

582
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:14,260
they do not resolve this human number two, whose is Austin powers come on. How

583
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,780
do they want this to be resolved? What do you mean if they don't resolve the

584
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,340
right there? The guy is all get his poop. They buried the poop. That's a

585
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:25,260
resolution. The the someone's looking in here and I don't know why they can

586
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:29,500
leave us alone. Does it look like a mailman? It looks like a child. It

587
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:34,100
looks like a person well and they waved and smiled and then left. Okay, maybe we

588
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:34,860
do them.

589
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:39,380
The what the sequence of events here. I don't believe at all your dog was

590
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,580
digging at something you looked at it smelled and looked like human poop. So

591
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,900
you dug a foot down into the ground until you found more you know what you

592
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,660
were expecting to find a person down there pooping up

593
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:54,660
and you need. Can you I would how would you be able to it's already it's shit

594
00:36:54,660 --> 00:37:00,880
foot down yeah that's crazy a foot down to find more to find more poop, but the

595
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,220
guy, I guess, admitted to do

596
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,900
right yeah. Who knows

597
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,900
I know this may sound silly, but I'm just wondering is it illegal if a

598
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,340
medium or psychic puts a spell on someone? I know this may sound silly,

599
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,220
but I'm just wondering is it illegal if a medium or psychic puts a spell on

600
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,660
someone? If I went to a psychic and she did this for me against someone, would

601
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:23,580
I or could I be in any legal trouble? Thank you, yes, this is different from

602
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:29,300
hypnosis. I would say because this is true and hypnosis is weird. Hypnosis is

603
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:33,040
weird. No one works on drunk people and yeah, but if you're

604
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,480
like

605
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,280
a spell,

606
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,720
I feel like there's no probably legal definition of a spell. So I think you

607
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,720
can get a very legal definition of spells. I don't think so. Yeah, I don't

608
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:47,240
think that a spell is any magic action. I don't think a spell is any magic

609
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,580
action that pertains to... Any magic words that have been said that pertain

610
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:55,440
to or involve magic, which thereby lead to a magical action occurring or being

611
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,900
incurred upon a piece of property or which, which ascertains property, which

612
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:04,500
at the time of casting the spell were unspelled previous to the spells casting.

613
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,540
See this is why he knows the bar better than this is on you. I mean, I only got

614
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,300
the precedence. I got a twenty on my bar exam yeah.

615
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,140
I got a thousand yeah and it's out of ten thousand yeah, but I still let me

616
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,060
pass yeah, but yeah, they let you pass because you're sleeping with the

617
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,260
teacher. I was sleeping with the judge

618
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:24,760
that

619
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,460
I'm this is

620
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,280
I'm

621
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,400
also this is this is the number one question. This is the question they

622
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,760
have the most of on this is the only one of it. I put in this was making me

623
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,940
laugh out loud so hard in my house. I'm going to be have trouble getting

624
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:42,480
through it.

625
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,700
Okay, here we go.

626
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:52,020
I'm twenty three. I called a fifteen year old sexy just to be silly in the

627
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,060
context of the conversation.

628
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,980
did I break the law in Ohio.

629
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:02,600
This was a message over a messaging program, no pictures, no sexy talking.

630
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,000
It was literally just that one phrase and it got me thinking it got me

631
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,640
thinking. I called a fifteen year old sexy just to be simply

632
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,420
just to be simply ninety percent of the

633
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,480
I was in a silly goofy mood. Every single question on here is I'm twenty. My

634
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,080
girlfriend is thirteen. Is this legal if I only kiss her yeah and all the all

635
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,300
the lawyers respond and they said yes, this is perfectly legal as long as you

636
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:37,080
ask your parents permission. Oh God, I called a fifteen year old sexy just to

637
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,520
be said,

638
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:44,760
how silly would that be if I called her sexy as a as a lawyer. Yeah, what do

639
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,920
you what do you what's your take on this?

640
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,240
I don't know. I think you're going to jail for life, but I think in Ohio this is a

641
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,380
death penalty. Most crimes, most crimes you can usually get away with with the

642
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,000
silly defense. You are going to Ohio. This is beyond the Ohio. Yeah, in Ohio.

643
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,320
This is not happening. The legal system in Ohio be like. Most normal legal system in

644
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:09,240
Ohio. Yep. Wow. This is. See that stuff that lawyers of our generation wouldn't get.

645
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,200
Yeah, they wouldn't get that. But this you're going to, you're going to be fed

646
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,640
nylon chili until you poop out all of your internal organs. Yeah, how's that

647
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,400
for silly buddy? Yeah, yeah, it's going to be you can get silly with your

648
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,300
license plates. You're doing custom ones and say stuff like come and shit.

649
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,200
I have I have patronized a fried chicken restaurant for quite a while and about

650
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,000
two months ago. I had diarrhea right after the meal. I left my experience in

651
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,300
their website one week later. The manager called me denying anything wrong

652
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,340
in their restaurant and I still went their location for the fried chickens

653
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,300
thinking. Maybe I ate something bad in the previous day, but I had other small

654
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,140
diarrheas a few times after eating the chickens a few days ago. I had some

655
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:52,340
serious diarrhea right after finishing the fried chickens. I suspected maybe

656
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,620
they put something to make the chickens tender and tasty that something could

657
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:59,220
make my intestines suffered and having diarrhea that something could harm my

658
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,700
health. I just wonder how I can prove my diarrhea caused by the fried chickens

659
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,620
and that's something and hoping they can improve their chickens. Thanks. I want

660
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:10,620
you know people out yeah. What did you what did you look up to find this

661
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:14,540
diarrhea or yeah diarrhea? Okay, I got another diarrhea.

662
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,740
All right, let's let's go to it. Let's see it. I don't know if it's next,

663
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,020
because these are these are maybe the same legal. I don't think it's an

664
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,980
actions here. Oh yeah,

665
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,140
this was my favorite.

666
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,140
So I really want to hear you guys thoughts on this one. Can you use

667
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:36,140
telekinesis to clear away a storm? I would like to know if you could use

668
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,580
telekinesis to clear away a rain cloud. So okay, no, you can not know you can

669
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,020
not if it's over your neighbor's property. There's a couple of if it's

670
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,060
over your own property, but if you put it on your neighbor's lawn, exactly

671
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,700
problem, I would say up or down. Yeah, there's two. This is going to be

672
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,940
homeless. This is going to be an issue in a in a civil case. You could have a

673
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,380
civil case brought against you, because like you said, this could belong to

674
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:59,860
your neighbor, depending on how much sky area they have in their

675
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:04,200
as their property line, how high up their property line goes yeah right, but

676
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:08,060
also this could be a federal case. You are in if you're going to airspace,

677
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:12,660
you are interfering with the EPA's weather control devices. They have

678
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,140
exactly they have set all across this nation, right? So if they want to put

679
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:20,540
this could even bring out of toxic acid rain above your house, you don't have

680
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:24,460
any legal recourse for that. You especially can't use I mean offensive

681
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:27,740
telekinesis one hundred percent and speaking of weather control. I mean this

682
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,100
could even escalate the issue beyond the federal level. You could be even in the

683
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:35,060
everyone you could get in trouble with Israel. Exactly Oh yeah, you're going to

684
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,840
get in big trouble with them, but maybe again you're going to be forced to eat.

685
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,860
I mean, I'll all Chile you're going to be forced to eat taboo into maybe this

686
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,360
doesn't become a legal issue at all. Maybe you you know you're tampering with

687
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:50,900
rain clouds and and and you know you catch the eye of a foreign country that

688
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,640
maybe has a strong interest in weather control. You're going to be dealing with

689
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,200
a lot more than a rain cloud. I'm going to say yeah, yeah, yeah, dealing with

690
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:01,320
you might want to deal with this in an extra judicial manner and if you

691
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:06,460
have telekinesis, how about you do your country a favor and enlist yeah?

692
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:09,740
What the fuck you doing controlling the rain? How about making the world a

693
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,860
better place by making flowers get taller or become a magician and make the

694
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,480
world a better place by making people smile entertainment yeah, make birthday

695
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,860
parties a little bit. I love magic. I am looking for a lawyer with the guts to

696
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,780
stand up to Facebook. I'm right here, but I have received multiple bands for

697
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,600
jokes and memes ironically taken off of other Facebook pages, predating the

698
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:33,100
current presidency is from twenty eighteen. What is regarding immigration?

699
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,540
The other refugees they keep removing them, followed by bands for so called

700
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:40,920
hate speech. I have screenshots of the posts as well as original picked. I pick

701
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,960
I tried to post screenshot plainly show Facebook accusing me of hate speech with

702
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,940
the original post. Far as I knew, the US Supreme Court has already ruled that

703
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,720
under the First Amendment, all speech is protected, even if it offends. Please

704
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,000
help. I will help you. I think we are the lawyers who will stand up to

705
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,920
Facebook. We don't agree with you, but Facebook took away

706
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,400
flair and they took away the wall. They took away a lot of pokes.

707
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:10,760
They took away pokes. We want that shit back. Yeah. We have the... Make

708
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:13,840
Messenger back into the main Facebook app. I agree. And that's what we're

709
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,640
gonna have on hats and there could be red hats that say that. Make Messenger

710
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,480
back into the original Facebook app. Thank you. Yep, and take out the bots

711
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,920

712
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,840
too skinny. You're looking like a twig. I just watched the social network.

713
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,400

716
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,800
I love you. And you were good in Zombieland. I was just about to say

717
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,640
that. Yeah. You were amazing in Zombieland. You were amazing in Zombieland.

718
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,640
But I didn't like you so much in Adventureland, because

719
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:52,300
I wanted to be in love with the girl in that movie. Yeah, it's kind of cringe

720
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:57,820
and you made me jealous, but you're the worst lex luther. Oh, don't even get me

721
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:00,060

727
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,820
knowledge, and this is listed under civil rights. I think it is. This is a

728
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,540
civil right, technically poison, although the replies under this were

729
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,540
all like. What do you mean? Yeah, how would you do this? What are you talking

00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,720
I'll get home. I'll get off a flight. She'll be like Hey, I just made this

00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,120
exactly

737
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:56,580
exactly on our line to your son's line to her son against all moms yeah,

738
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,680
yeah,

739
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,280
law firm versus mom's I'm down. I'm fucking down to pdf. I have I have a

740
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:09,620
my client has a large list of grievances that go all the way back to two thousand

741
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:13,960
and two yeah. This is a what we he's been building a case for near eighteen

742
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:17,800
years right yeah and you are losing your house man.

743
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:22,240
Can I file a lawsuit in what type against a recognized comedian for

744
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,760
verbally abusing my seven year old while left under his care? I saw my son

745
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,900
today for my weekend visit today. Immediately I noticed his puffy eyes. I

746
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,900
asked him what's the matter. He replied that he was left with Mike Cano

747
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:36,060
comedian public performer recently, while his mother worked on a Saturday.

748
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,560
He said he took him out my son to eat. Mike arrived to his home and demanded

749
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,040
my son to carry his two liter out of Mike's vehicle. My son tried and said it

750
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,880
was too heavy to him. He said Mike called him a damn bonehead and other

751
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,280
names. He was not allowed to say dictionary definition bonehead bonehead

752
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:53,960
bonehead now an informal, a stupid person for not being able to cater to

753
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,360
him. He accused him of acting out to his mother. When she arrived, he told me

754
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,720
he never wants to see Mike again. He is afraid of him. He said, while they

755
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,920
were alone, he was very demanding on him. Mike Kano is a comedian Ontario at

756
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:09,000
Gold Star. He claims he is family oriented, verbally insulting. My son is

757
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:13,740
no laughing matter. How can I proceed to have this verbal abused stopped this

758
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,560
rose? Okay, okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but this is pissing me off so much. The

759
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,640
war against comedians stops today. Yes, first, Will Smith viciously attacks

760
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:31,000
nearly kills Eddie Murphy on the stage of the Oscars right and now this guy is

761
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,480
being

762
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:38,200
accused of child abuse because he says bonehead dude come to the comedy seller

770
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,940
which I'm now I'm remembering it wasn't Eddie Murphy got slapped. It was Matt

771
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:15,420
right. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I've completely fucked that up. Matt Will

772
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:16,540
Smith slapped Matt right.

773
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:22,060
That right was on stage at the Oscars. He pointed at Will Smith and said, damn

774
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:25,540
you here with a black. Yeah, I'm really sorry. That was me. That was me being

775
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:29,820
racially insensitive. It was Matt right anyway. If Matt right gets you in his

776
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,380
laser sights, dude, you're done. Yeah, bro, your kid's gonna fucking kill

777
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:38,220
himself yeah right. If Matt right, tell your kid to bring a soda to the car

778
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,340
did.

779
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:44,460
What are we doing here man? The war on comedian stops today and in me as a

780
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:48,180
lawyer, I'll defend comedians pro bono and they'll probably say something about

781
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:52,400
that sounds like boner. I did I found one on here that I didn't put in that

782
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,300
was that was how can I find a pro boner lawyer? You know who put that in their

783
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:03,360
slide yeah, we'll save it. We'll save it all right. We'll save it for Pats. Can I

784
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:06,840
sir dentist for inappropriate behavior. My wife was told inappropriate sexual

785
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:09,180
yes. No, you can't know you can't there's a

786
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:14,020
yeah they have a oh yeah well dentists are like funny doctors yeah. I got a

787
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:19,000
headache from playing GTA five. Can I sue rock star games? Yes, yes, and we'll

788
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,700
do it for you. If I were to make a sex robot costume for Halloween with a

789
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:26,220
screwdriver penis and appear in public, do I break indecency laws? The

790
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,420
screwdriver has a small vibration motor attached. There are small square buttons

791
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:32,980
where the nipples are that activate annoying lights and sounds beeping sex

792
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:36,200
robot is stenciled on the back. It is quite obviously a joke and is not

793
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:41,040
realistic in any way. You will be sued for copyright infringement from whitest

794
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:45,660
kids. Yes, it's over for you. Is it illegal to practice voodoo in the state

795
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,160
of New York? This female is a legally practicing voodoo on me and in turn is

796
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:52,580
making me very ill with her actions. Is there legal action I can take against

797
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,900
her to make this stop? Because when I have asked her to stop, she is simply

798
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,740
refusing and her lawyers plural are not helpful at all. She reports she is a

799
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,720
witch and this is what she does, but her actions are causing harm and sickness

800
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:06,060
and are based in evil behavior. It is illegal and we will protect you, but

801
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:07,140
evil is not illegal.

802
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:11,860
Evil is not illegal voodoo. We so leave out the base and evil behaviors part

803
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:16,840
evil behaviors are based evil, but certain vectors of evil is in voodoo or

804
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:20,100
not. Yeah, they're not okay. Do I have a case? No hello. I used to be

805
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:22,980
employed with a company about seven years and endured a lot of bullying and

806
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:26,320
harassment. I was called Patrick from the cartoon Spongebob and McGill of the

807
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,580
gorilla. I worked in two different locations and both supervisors called me

808
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,860
those names and when they spoke about me, they would refer to me as McGill of the

809
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,240
gorilla. I told them to stop and they said as long as I work there, that would

810
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,240
be my name. That will be her full name is Patrick McGill. Yeah, you don't have a

811
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:40,980
can you have no

812
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:45,380
as long as you work here. McGill of the gorilla will be your name. Also,

813
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:50,080
Patrick from the cartoon sponge Bob, you must have a very long name. If there's

814
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:55,400
a shortened nickname yeah, God, it's so funny to get completely owned by her

815
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,160
boss, ask them to stop calling you McGill of the gorilla and say as long as

816
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,360
as I work here, that will be your name as long as I work here. That will be your

817
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,560
name. Yeah, that's all my my slides. All right

818
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,700
now we're going to go to we're going to go to my slides here, going to look

819
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,540
through some of these things that I found. So we were talking earlier, you

820
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,440
know all these old lawyers, you know we're we're the we're the new we're the

821
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:19,860
new jacks. We're freshman class to twenty twenty three. Yeah, okay, lawyer

822
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:20,460
magazine,

823
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:26,240
freshman, the lawyer, the opening statement, the filibuster, that's what

824
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:29,960
we're going to be doing yeah yeah we're going up against people like Andrew

825
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,000
Tate and Chris Griffin. We're going to be going up against them. We're going

826
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,720
to be going up against Peter Griffin. We're going to go against gay glaze,

827
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,120
you know all these people,

828
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:42,520
and this is the first thing I found, which is a does a comedian violate any

829
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:46,520
copyright laws by doing celebrity voice impressions? I do voice impressions in

830
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:51,200
my children's birthday party magic act. I don't want to break any copyright

831
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,960
laws. Can I talk like Kermit the Frog without getting sued? No, no, the voice

832
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,040
the main thing about Kermit the Frog. You can't wear a hat with the M on it or you

833
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:05,160
get sued by Mario's company, which is called Nintendo. If you use Kermit's

834
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,920
voice, which is basically his Mario hat, you will be sued by the Henson

835
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,560
Foundation. Sorry to say. Also, wait, was that from 2010? Yeah. That's the oldest

836
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,400
question on this website. Everything I found was from like 2019. I found some

837
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:21,280
older ones. Really? I couldn't find shit like that. Can I break my lease after a

838
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,440
week from a severe roast infestation? Hey, did Matt Reif move in your damn

839
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:25,940
about

840
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,260
can I break my lease due to a roast investation?

841
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:41,080
Yes, he did. Yes, he did imagine Matt right standing on oh my God, standing

842
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,040

847
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,340
the best Matt Rife clips are the ones where he's not he's doing crowd work,

848
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:08,300
but he's not roasting anyone. He's not really commenting. I just going like oh

856
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:33,440

You all

00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,120
birthday. Oh shit. He

861
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,860
posted this clip where he's in Honolulu and everyone keeps giving him a lay and

862
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:56,060
that's the whole clip. That is actually feel fucking blessed as fuck for wearing

863
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,720
this net yeah and then he's doing the crowd work and then a woman in the

864
00:53:58,720 --> 00:53:59,140
crickets

865
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,800
you wait.

866
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,220
What the hell she said

867
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,420
wait

868
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,300
yeah,

869
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,460
what else you say

870
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:12,300
I came to Honolulu. I thought the whole crowd was going to be waves and shit,

871
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:15,900
but it's actually fucking it's actually people and shit way, but you're

872
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,640
I thought you were a volcano. Why is he wearing blue like a wave? I thought it

873
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,640
was all going to be waves and sharks and shit. I was low key scared as a

874
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,160
mother. I thought this mother you're man. This volcanoes here with a black

875
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,200
chick. Damn yeah, shout out volcanoes. I never seen a volcano with a black

876
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:34,940
chick before that's fire for you, bro. I bet I bet I bet you hate hanging out

877
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:41,300
with his in laws, though, huh? Yeah, two volcanoes. What the fuck can I is it

878
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:45,040
legal in the state of Michigan to pay a woman to fart for you just have a fart

879
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,520
reddish and would like to find a woman to do this for me, but I want to do it. I

880
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,340
want it to be legal. I would say that this in the

881
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,140
independent contract

882
00:54:53,140 --> 00:55:01,700
yes is ten ninety nine for farting this. I mean not even filling out a W nine on

883
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:06,940
a guy and then the the like the memo just says like blast yeah. I mean, I

884
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,600
guess the question here is not corporate. This isn't it seems like it's

885
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,400
not about legality. This he won't he's maybe a it wants it to be tax. He wants

886
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:17,600
to be taxed on this guy's yeah. I mean the government's always going to want to

887
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:21,000
take extra money. Oh, if you want to do above board work, because I could buy

888
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,080
that plastic cup from you right now. I don't need to fill out. I'll sell it to

889
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,200
you. Okay, how much two bucks

890
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:31,000
while you're doing that? I'll go to the next slide, which is what's to stop me

891
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,440
from making an energy drink and calling it bottle of jizz. I know, I know, but

892
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,920
you're doing that's a really dumb name for an energy drink, but we have one

893
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:43,080
called pussy and I know for a fact a large group of people would buy it and

894
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:48,120
drink it. It'd be a normal energy drink with the consistency of him a bottle of

895
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:53,320
jizz on a normal energy drink, but as the consistency of jizz is make it taste

896
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:57,880
like mango, though, because mangoes are delicious. It'd have all the basic

897
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:01,800
ingredients as monster energy, but healthier and different enough that they

898
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:05,360
can't claim. I rip them off. My question is are there any actual laws and

899
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,520
stipulations anywhere in the USA besides California that would stop me from

900
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:11,800
making such a drink and selling it a gas station, California, they're going to

901
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:16,440
by law and they hate is well. You know who else hates is these old lawyers.

902
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,980
Your drink is not a bottle of is the mark is therefore misdescriptive. Of

903
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:24,640
course, it is questionable whether there is any market for an actual bottle of

904
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:28,640
okay. This is not a monster. Yeah, a bag of Cheetos. Those aren't actually

905
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,960
Cheetos. No, they're just little snacks. Yeah. Do you think the animals a Cheeto?

906
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,600
Yes, no, it is a Cheeto. Let's move. Let's just let's not get into a Dorito.

907
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:41,080
It's just a chip. Let's not get into this. You're going to get he's going to

908
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:45,180
not going to understand sorry. I'm gone. He got a on the bar. Sorry, I'm worried

909
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,280
about my wheel.

910
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:51,600
Can a bail bonds man call me and threaten me and call me nasty booger?

911
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:56,800
So this bonds lady has been texting me calling me nasty names and threatening

912
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,800
me saying that she is going to send the cops to my house and tell me that I'm

913
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,660
going to jail.

914
00:57:00,660 --> 00:57:01,960
Booker

915
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:07,080
that's fucking you first of all booger names again, not allowed. This is the

916
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:10,100
depending on where you are in the world. Yeah, it's going to be really,

917
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,200
really bad or more kind of fun misdemeanor charges. Yeah,

918
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,440
somebody just has to blow my school world of a huge booker in place on my

919
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,480
back. How would you label this crime against me? Is it a battery assault with

920
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:26,300
a booger? Yes, I was assaulted with a booger and what could I do to legally

921
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,100
punish the transgressor in this in this situation? This is not a joke. This is

922
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:33,860
absolutely serious with the police care and punish the train, the transgressor

923
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:38,060
or am I supposed to accept assaults with boogers against me? Unfortunately, yes,

924
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,920
you are you're if it was at school, you're going to yeah, because you can

925
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,040
here's, but here's the thing you're going to be called booger boy for the

926
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:46,340
rest of your life, though there's precedent for this.

927
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:50,900
This person who did this is detestable. This is a detestable and he can he has

928
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,960
to register as a detestable person. Tell everybody, excuse me, so you know I

929
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,480
moved in next door. I'm the test of when they go to a new school. I just want

930
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:02,760
to let everyone know my fun fact is I'm a detestable. I'm a detestable person.

931
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,440
I've put boogers on people before. Boogers on a kid with a rollie backpack.

932
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:09,760
I'm a nasty, nasty, detestable booger boy. Hello, my character trait is

933
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,160
detestable. Yeah, exactly.

934
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:15,560
How can I legally get my neighbors to turn their damn rap crap down?

935
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,180
I live in a very small valley and our newest neighbors think they can blast

936
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:22,520
their rap crap as loud as they want and want everyone in the valley to hear

937
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:25,600
it. What can be done to make it stop? This is sadly nothing. Unfortunately,

938
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,200
there was a Supreme Court decision about six years ago when sicko mode came

939
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,100
now they there was a Supreme Court decision. Apparently in now this new

940
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:40,280
America, Joe Biden's America, you can play rap music as loud as you want in any

941
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,620
valley, do and especially in the valley. It doesn't matter what kind of

942
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:47,520
neighbourhood you live in. It can be flat, it can be a valley, you live on a

943
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,720
mountain, you can play your music as loud as you want, and this is a big loss for

944
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:56,120
patriots. I would say that if the if the if the the framers were here, they would

945
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,240
not be accepting this. No, no, you know, if they were still alive, this is not

946
00:58:59,260 --> 00:59:03,160
what they wanted and if Antonin Scalia was still alive, he'd be would have

947
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:06,260
been there was another. There's another there's another ruling pretty soon

948
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:08,420
after that, just because I know people are going to be curious about the

949
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,120
corner cases where if you're blasting Lincoln Park, you have to turn it down

950
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:15,460
for the Chester parts and turn it really loud for the Mike Shinoda. Exactly,

951
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:21,360
and by the way, I went to a pub in California recently that was owned by

952
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:27,320
one of the ex members of Fort Minor. Wow, I met him. Did you meet him? Yeah,

953
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:33,060
which one it's you didn't even say that I with like with I don't know them by

954
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,820
their I don't know his name by their name. I don't know his name, but he

955
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:40,340
I had some chicken wings and they were really, really bad yeah. Wow well, but

956
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:43,220
he's friends with my brother now. So that's pretty awesome. Maybe we can get

957
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:46,140
on a track with him. I would love to get on it. I mean I would love to collab

958
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,880
with him, but the whole song is about how his wings are bad and he doesn't

959
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:49,880
is pretty cool, though

960
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:56,720
and then then his verse is just a downtown new hall California. Check that

961
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:56,940
out.

962
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:02,040
some gay ass crap happened. I was cited for underage drinking and urinating in

963
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,000
public, went to the bar and nature called cop wasn't thrilled and wrote me a

964
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:08,540
ticket. How can I fight this? You can't you know, so I would say that you could

965
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:12,920
get off easily here on what is called the cool defense, because the fact that

966
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:15,840
you're keeping it up through this whole thing is one. It's very cool to underage

967
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,360
drink. It's very cool to your public, but the fact that we have evidence of you

968
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,020
being cool online in the in the aftermath, saying some gay ass crap

969
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:26,560
happened, he's not worried about this. Another nature called exactly Ace

970
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,780
Ventura stuff. That's another another possible defense you could look into

971
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,020
that would be the defense I would choose if you chose me for your case is the

972
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,900
why were you looking there? Defence? Yeah, I'm underage. Are you gay? You're

973
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:41,020
against the wall. What are you looking at? Why are you trying to kidnap my P?

974
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,420
Yeah, that's what I would say. That's what I would tell them. I would say,

975
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:49,900
what do you do? Wait, you have you have gloves. Are you Michael Jackson? He will

976
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,820
that, but also are you trying to use that glove to scoop up my piece? You can

977
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:56,540
go home and jerk off to it later because you are what I just said. Yeah, yeah,

978
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:00,860
and now the cops in jail. Will you go faster so I can get to mine? I want to

979
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:05,580
sue fortnight. How? Yes, W fortnight ban me. I want back on fortnight, ban me. I

980
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:08,620
want back on, but they won't let me. I spent like two thousand dollars on that

981
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:13,080
game. So can I sue them? How can I find a pro boner lawyer for a sexual

982
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:16,780
harassment case? Buddy? I think all of them are going to be. I think that's

983
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,860
got to be some kind of joke. It was a joke one and there was a description

984
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:23,500
that he cropped out that I didn't read that. I just saw that, but look at this

985
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,540
I

986
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:30,560
opted out, though pro bono, but if my wife and I same sex have a baby through

987
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:31,780
a boner, I saw this one to

988
01:01:31,780 --> 01:01:34,440
my immigration paperwork, yes,

989
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:37,520
farting trying to get our kids back from

990
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,400
our suing DHR for desiccation of character and discrimination

991
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,720
for

992
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:49,420
this is the last one. Can you adopt a mentally retarded adult without

993
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,260
permission

994
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,220
ever. This shit is so crazy. I'm gonna say, I think there was a whole thing.

995
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:01,840
No, I don't think you can. No, you cannot. I think that probably is not

996
01:02:01,840 --> 01:02:04,920
gonna work out for you. There was a whole description of this where it was

997
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,320
very, very, very, like they were like,

998
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:13,420
"The lawyer now controls my mother's estate," or something. So it's a weird,

999
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:15,880
it's a very weird legal thing. A back story I don't wanna hear. The back

1000
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:20,620
story is not great, but that phrase right there is fucking crazy. Okay,

1001
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:24,680
here's mine. Could this in any way get me in trouble? A girl was giving me a

1002
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:28,300
hand job. She initiated it and it was very much consensual. Sorry for the

1003
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,760
lewd detail, but during it I asked her if I could ejaculate on her breasts and

1004
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,260
she said, No, you can't come on me later in the hand job. I came and while I

1005
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:38,520
got seam on on her hand because she was giving me a hand job, it was not a

1006
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,740
problem. She did not seem to mind it at all and I just started overthinking it

1007
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:44,720
later. After we were done, I asked her if everything we did was okay and she

1008
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,420
said yeah. I had fun. I had no intent of coming on her when she said, No, you

1009
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,240
can't come on me. I thought it meant I can't purposely try to come on her body.

1010
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,280
I thought I did not think it would include her hand, which was giving me the

1011
01:02:56,280 --> 01:02:59,380
hand job. I thought that was quite obvious. I don't know if this is a silly

1012
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:02,840
question. I tend to overthink and over analyze everything. Any insight would be

1013
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,840
very much appreciated. Thank you. You are going to jail compared to

1014
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:11,220
years. I'll show you my reaction as a as a new young lawyer. Okay, it's all good

1015
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:16,320
bro. Here's an older guy's reaction. You are on a public forum communicating with

1016
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:19,300
professionals. The subject of your question is not offensive, but the

1017
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,760
manner in which it was described is very offensive. There are three forms of

1018
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,740
communication that every person needs to learn. One, the way you talk with your

1019
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,400
buddies over a few beers. Clearly, you've got that down. Whoa. Two, the way you

1020
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:32,040
communicate with teachers, co-workers, and people in authority. It is more

1021
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:35,160
formal, but some slang is okay. If you respect your girlfriend, then she calls

1022
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:38,640
it, falls into this category. Three, more importantly, is the way you communicate

1023
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,160
at a funeral to a judge in court, police officer, or to professionals on a public

1024
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,880
forum. If you are sorry for the lewd detail, you should have spent a few

1025
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:48,380
and that's thinking about how you were going to communicate the facts in an

1026
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:52,600
appropriate manner. You need to read the room before you speak to him. Wow,

1027
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:53,020
that's a

1028
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:58,100
this is from Patrick Steinfeld, who's a wrongful death attorney in San

1029
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:03,940
Francisco, because he's all how is how fucking crazy is it to be to be a

1030
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,620
lawyer? You're working as a lawyer and you're like well, it's time to log on

1031
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,940
to avo dot com and scroll through the sex crime section. Two hundred words

1032
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:12,660
about this guy who's accidentally

1033
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:18,660
I was accused of peeping and I was charged with class C misdemeanor with

1034
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:22,700
fines. I have court soon. Should I pay the fines? This is great, okay, I was

1035
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:27,020
looking for an associate in a woman dress room where I work at and saw a

1036
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:31,720
roach and I jumped on a stall to escape it and a woman from the other stall saw

1037
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,740
my hair and said I was peeping. She was a crying and I said I didn't mean it.

1038
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:38,780
Now I have fine. I didn't mean what should I do? Should I tell the judge

1039
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:42,620
what happened or pay the fines again for me? I'm saying oh dude a roach. I'm

1040
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:47,880
scared as fuck as but this older lawyer says saw a roach and jumped on a stall

1041
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,960
to escape it. Seriously, you should find a local criminal defense attorney. I've

1042
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:55,800
seen this guy a lot. This guy's all over this woman in yeah.

1043
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:00,880
Will I be arrested? I was in a private room at strip club and I touch her

1044
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:04,480
private part. She didn't say anything and no one come to room and said

1045
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,800
anything. It was quick quick touch. Will I be arrested for this? Yes, you will be

1046
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:11,940
suggested you are going to jail. You are going to jail.

1047
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:16,560
Does being charged with a video of bestiality mean that such person would

1048
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:21,080
no longer be allowed to have pets a video of bestiality on someone's camera

1049
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,680
roll, not of which person being charged a random person on the internet, but it

1050
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:28,520
was in this person's camera roll. Could this charge if found guilty make it so

1051
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:31,760
this person would no longer be allowed pets for a certain amount of time. Why

1052
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,280
are you putting this in your camera roll bookmarks bar exactly

1053
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,360
put it in a folder in a folder on your bookmark homework yeah right put this in

1054
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,000
an encrypted folder. I

1055
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,660
that says you can't be trafficking with you can't you can't handle this kind of

1056
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,800
weight. I'll say that no put it put it in a zip file called boring PDF yeah

1057
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,360
that'll get you getting away with. Why is it in your camera? Why would you ever

1058
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,840
need it on your phone at any point, whether you have internet or not? I

1059
01:05:57,840 --> 01:06:01,040
think that I need this in case I'm on a plane and this guy's in Seattle. I think

1060
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:01,680
they may be

1061
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:06,560
Seattle. Yeah, this is Seattle. You mean the birthplace of Mr. Hands? Yeah, this

1062
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:09,560
is completely yeah. I didn't know this was Seattle. This guy is not in trouble

1063
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:12,960
at all. Yeah, they're going to give you extra pets. Is it illegal to like a boy

1064
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:17,560
who 18 and you're 14? They're a YouTuber who 18 and I like them and my friend

1065
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:21,960
14. Would it be illegal for them to date? Yes, yes. So this is at first, but the

1066
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:25,160
YouTuber would not think it's illegal. First. I like this question because at

1067
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:30,360
first I thought there was a four a 14 year old asking if they could or if they

1068
01:06:30,360 --> 01:06:33,760
they're allowed to date this youtuber. I realize now they're trying to explain

1069
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:37,120
they're trying to set up they no no they're not they're a youtuber who

1070
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:40,840
eighteen and I like them and my friend fourteen. Would it be illegal for them

1071
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:44,480
to date? They want to know that it's illegal, so they can say I have to date

1072
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,960
they the year because you're only fourteen yeah wow yeah

1073
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:50,000
and this guy says

1074
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:55,840
and this this I liked I included this. This lawyers answer came with all these

1075
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,240

01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,200
anybody to crime. Yeah, yeah.

1084
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,460
If you get attacked by teen girls, can you legally defend against them? Asked

1085
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:35,700
in Dallas, Texas. During a talent contest, a riot broke out. I am a male

1086
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:39,960
staff member. I am considerably weaker than averages. At some point, a pair

1087
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:45,160
of teen girls who were rather large attacked me. They were whopping my skull,

1088
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,760
face, and upper body. So when they chipped some of my teeth, I lashed out

1089
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:52,960
landing blows after several minutes. The other staff separated us, but I ended up

1090
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:56,460
being checked by the paramedics. They chipped a few of my teeth, blacked both

1091
01:07:56,460 --> 01:08:00,880
my eyes and broke my nose, but I was written a fine for assault, but I won

1092
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,860
against it. They were not punished. They had many bruisers, but nothing serious,

1093
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:08,980
so technically who broke the law, them or me. Well, you won the case. I just

1094
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:12,440
love him telling his whole story. They be like so technically he's not trying

1095
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,880
to sue them. He just said technically who broke the law, me or them yeah

1096
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:21,600
this guy got go want by two rather large teenage girls. Is it a hate crime to

1097
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,640
call your roommate a F A G in Texas room is terrible? I called him F A G. He had

1098
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,660
the cops come. They said it would be a hate crime. If I did it again and left,

1099
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:32,520
he is not

1100
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:37,860
he is not yet

1101
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,260
and he called the cause

1102
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:45,420
that's actually that's you know what if he's trying to get the other guy to

1103
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:49,320
Eve yeah kind of the perfect petty thing to do pretty good yeah.

1104
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:52,780
Can I be convicted of murder? Yes, I let

1105
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:58,680
crazy. I let two of my friends use my apartment. I come home with blood

1106
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:03,220
everywhere and two dead bodies. My friends are dead and my blood may be in

1107
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:03,400
the

1108
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:06,400
but I really don't know what

1109
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:15,300
yeah. I mean I get to be fair. My blood might be in my apartment right now, but

1110
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:19,380
my all over my blood into my underwear and it got kicked under my bed. My

1111
01:09:19,380 --> 01:09:22,600
blood, maybe in my apartment, my blood might be in there. I let two of my

1112
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,980
friends use my apartment

1113
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:28,120
and I come home with blood everywhere. Two dead bodies. My friends are dead.

1114
01:09:28,120 --> 01:09:31,920
My blood might be there, but I don't really know what happened. I don't know

1115
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:34,960
if they might and he got this advice. You must not say these things on this

1116
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,700
site. Just promptly get a lawyer. It's actually pretty good. He's got an

1117
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:42,540
avowed rating of ten. Yeah, I know this guy's a killer. Very health hand more

1118
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,860
very, very helping hand. Can I sue a TV show for using a picture of me without

1119
01:09:45,860 --> 01:09:49,660
my permission? I got this guy's in a bad situation. Yeah, I got a call from my

1120
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:52,720
brother one evening saying that I was on an episode of forensic files as a

1121
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:57,300
suspect for a rape and murder that happened in ninety five and another one

1122
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:01,060
that happened later on and a picture of me was on the screen. However, I was

1123
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:04,500
never questioned. The picture of me was from me complying with an investigation

1124
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,100
in my area willingly and was taken out in front of a pizza joint. It wasn't

1125
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:12,460
doing a mug shot. What can I do about this? It's representing me as a

1126
01:10:12,460 --> 01:10:16,340
criminal and I have no criminal record. I'm a law abiding a citizen. That's

1127
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,540
insane. Can you imagine? Holy Can you imagine your girlfriend is in your

1128
01:10:20,540 --> 01:10:23,280
you're you're playing you're playing fortnight or whatever your girlfriend's

1129
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,900
a living room watching unsolved mysteries? Yeah, like hey, you need to

1130
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:30,880
come in here yeah. What the fuck did you just do? I get it's paused and it's a

1131
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,220
picture of suspect for a rape and murder that happened in ninety five and another

1132
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:40,920
you eat a later on yeah. Look at this criminal. This is from his remuneration.

1133
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:45,880
That's so funny that you would hold a never to I guess they wouldn't tell you

1134
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:49,780
yeah. I guess not that they're doing that yeah. The fact that it's not a mug

1135
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,320
shot is so fine. I

1136
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,280
they just asked yeah hey yeah he thought he was going on the wall for

1137
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:59,760
being the thousandth. The customer you ate the most pizza here to yeah, we

1138
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,700
probably yeah they went up to him. We're like. Do you know anything about this?

1139
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:06,280
he's like no. I don't know. I just work here yeah, yeah, God damn it. This is

1140
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:09,900
the number one suspect. How can I sue if I had a bug in my drink from a

1141
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,700
restaurant? How can I sue if I had a bug in my drink and then this is the last

1142
01:11:13,700 --> 01:11:18,500
one? I think can I sue a day care for a roach being in my child's ear? The day

1143
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:22,100
care has a big infestation of roaches. They're addressing. I took my child out

1144
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:25,620
of the facility a month ago. My child was seen at urgent care. The doctor said

1145
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:28,660
it had been in there for some time because it was dead and causing her a

1146
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:32,680
fever. I have proof of the roaches inside the facility, along with cold food

1147
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:36,100
served to children and videos of how one teacher talked to my child and no

1148
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,860
action has been taken, and that's why my child is no longer. I can I can accept

1149
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:44,300
the roaches in the place, you know, it's a day care, cold food, no way

1150
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,820
discussed something. If my kid goes to day care, he gets a hot PBJ that's been

1151
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:51,980
left in a car, something that something that I found out about one of the I

1152
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:55,140
didn't put any of these in there. A million of these ones that apparently is

1153
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:58,220
a real medical thing, but there's a bunch of questions that are can I sue the

1154
01:11:58,260 --> 01:12:03,580
hospital. My newborn baby ate poop. I almost put that one in there's twenty of

1155
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:08,060
them yeah. It's apparently I found a there was one that I didn't put in that

1156
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:11,460
everyone's like no. You can't babies do that babies do that. There was do that.

1157
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:13,060
There's one I didn't put in

1158
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:18,660
that was what happens if my baby eats poop during delivery yeah. That's all

1159
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:22,220
stuff like that. Sorry yeah, that's on you. You're the one who pooped exactly

1160
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,940
while pushing the baby out. Well, it's the baby's own poop that it's eating.

1161
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:28,780
All right, I have to go give the state. So what day is the shareholder?

Get us to 10K, we're almost there.

1172
01:12:56,360 --> 01:12:57,200
- We're almost there.

1173
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:58,200
- We are almost there.

1174
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,280
I think that right now we are at 99.99.

1175
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,680
- And let's try and get me to six foot six.

1176
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:06,360
- Let's get Cameron tall, y'all.

1177
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,080
- All right.

1178
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:10,160
(static)

1179
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:12,880
The hypothetical is this.

1180
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,800
Would you rather be a hand or a foot,

1181
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,720
but you don't get to pick whose hand or foot you are.

1182
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,920
So you don't get to be like Dua Lipa's foot.

1183
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,320
You have to say, "I'm going to be a hand or I'm going to be a foot."

1184
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,400
I just... I just made up a name. Is that a person?

1185
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:29,900
Yeah.

1186
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:31,920
Well, I don't fucking know.

1187
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:36,400
From what I know, from what I... I don't know much about her,

1188
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:41,600
I think that she is maybe like the Prime Minister of Albania.

1189
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:43,560
Let's see. Who's this?

1190
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:45,400
Dua Lipa's feet.

1191
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:48,000
Okay, back to my question.

1192
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,800
Would you rather be a foot or a hand?

1193
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,600
No choice on who's hand or foot.

1194
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:56,520
Probably a hand because it you know you I mean I could pick up pencils

1195
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:02,200
Okay, I could get here. Here's a lot left in them. Here's the thing okay, huh?

1196
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:04,120
you

1197
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:08,360
Don't have any country you are just sitting there. You just everything is basically your face

1198
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:13,520
So I'm wearing everything just like shoved into your face like I'm a vegetable you are not in control

1199
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:19,640
Yeah, so it's like like I'm completely awake. Yes, but you're a sentient hand

1200
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:24,100
Yeah, attach to a person and the person controls my every move so you're good

1201
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:28,840
So if your hand you already chose hands, so you're locked in yeah, but feet you're a wiping ass and buddy

1202
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:34,100
I've wiped my asshole before and I've missed either toilet papers in the wrong place poop on my finger

1203
01:14:34,100 --> 01:14:38,580
Mm-hmm. I've picked up every disgusting fucking thing in the world. Yeah, that's true

1204
01:14:38,580 --> 01:14:44,500
I've touched the tongues of tons of animals and zoos that have been eating disgusting slop

1205
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:47,300
Yeah, right. I jacked my off. I

1206
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:48,880
I jack my off.

1207
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:52,180
Every other day I jack my off.

1208
01:14:52,180 --> 01:14:52,780
Yeah.

1209
01:14:52,780 --> 01:14:54,280
I touch my bees.

1210
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,680
I touch them.

1211
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:59,080
I touch my bees and I jack my off.

1212
01:14:59,080 --> 01:15:00,980
Every other day at least.

1213
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:02,880
I sit on the couch, right?

1214
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,980
I sit on the couch.

1215
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:04,980
I rewatch Girls.

1216
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:05,780
I hold my bees.

1217
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:10,080
You just front, front of the pants.

1218
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,580
I grab them from the back.

1219
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:11,980
Yeah.

1220
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:12,780
I go around.

1221
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,480
So here's a problem.

1222
01:15:13,480 --> 01:15:15,280
If you're my hand, I go through.

1223
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,180
You're not just touching.

1224
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:19,100
and you're touching the, the, the T as well as the B's.

1225
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,900
- I credit card through my cheeks.

1226
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:22,860
- Uh-huh.

1227
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:24,500
- Above my T.

1228
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:25,340
- Uh-huh.

1229
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:27,180
- Grab the B, grab the B's.

1230
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,100
- No P.

1231
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,980
- No P, can't even reach the P.

1232
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,140
(screeching)
