00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,660
- Podcasts for the mindless.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,240
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,060
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,880
(laughing)

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,720
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,040
- Ah, that's the intro.

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,460
Ah, me screaming.

9
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,700
- That was some Twilight Zone shit right there.

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,540
That was so scary.

11
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:21,960
I hope I wake up from this nightmare

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,100
where Dustin Diamond has died.

13
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,100
- I heard they're making a new Twilight Zone

14
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,400
where the guy looks on the Zoom call

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,760
and they see and he sees there's a gremlin that joined the zoom call

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,360
he looks at the zoom call and Dustin Diamond is back

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,800
yeah oh my god Dustin Diamond is digging around in his computer and ripping out

18
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:40,960
parts and his computer is

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,360
Dustin Diamond

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,440
none of his co-workers believe him

21
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,640
Dustin Dimebag Darrell

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,120
Dustin Dimebag Darrell

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,280
oh my god

24
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,200
two guys that are dead

25
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,120
that's so sad to think about

26
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,240
yeah

27
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:01,000
I would love to, did you guys watch the updated Twilight Zone one with Jordan and Phil?

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,920
No I didn't watch it, I heard it wasn't good.

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,440
Kumail Nanjiani's in it.

30
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,840
I thought you were gonna say, have you watched the Timebag Darrell assassination video?

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,280
[laughter]

32
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,840
I genuinely thought you were gonna ask me that.

33
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,960
I haven't seen it.

34
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,920
Me neither.

35
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,560
Dude I could never watch that, it would break my heart.

36
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,960
Assassination, that's a strong word.

37
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,680
He got assassinated.

38
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,040
It was an assassination.

39
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,040
He was assassinated.

40
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,400
assassination yeah the assassination of Dimebag Darrell by the Coworkers

41
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,720
on stage well I guess I need to see the the I don't think there's footage of it

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,600
assassinate well I just googled assassination for some reason instead of

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:47,640
Dimebag Darrell. Oh like the first picture is Dimebag. I think he was assassinated yeah he was

44
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,120
assassinated. That just brings to mind like Kill Bill style like Kung Fu Death

45
00:01:52,120 --> 00:02:02,320
yeah when you hear somebody like a political figures a samurai that's like

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,320
agent 47 like who killed this guy who agent 47 did I make arrows and killed

47
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:23,520
it no see was it was a deranged welcome 47 that's still he has the Confederate

48
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,560
flag on his guitar he gets kicked out of the show where you live yeah

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,560
You're too corporate to be here for Dimebag Daryl, dude.

50
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,060
Did you, I talked about it before and it's, and you guys have no idea what I'm talking about,

51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,060
but the 8-bit guy is his second cousin.

52
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,560
Yeah, I don't know. Again, nobody knows.

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,560
That's for the fans. That's something I'm saying for the fans, not for you.

54
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
You know what you should say for the fans? A fucking joke.

55
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,060
Oh, I didn't know Dimebag Daryl and Vinnie Paul were brothers.

56
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,560
Vinnie Paz?

57
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,180
All fat like white guys with fucked up mudslide faces are all related. That's true. Yeah

58
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:09,520
Dude, they're the Pantera brothers. They should have called that band the Pantera brothers. Yeah, that's their last name

59
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,320
That'll be a way cooler band. Yeah, Pantera's Pantera even mean the terrible music

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,680
What are you talking about man? Pantera is not good. Y'all are old

61
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,720
Pantera I mean okay Pantera is cool as hell. Walk is a great song. Yeah Walk fucking

62
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,040
Cowboys from Hell is a good song. I think they're they're a great hit. They have some good

63
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,640
ass songs. I miss the pants era. Yeah where Joey Pants where uh. Who's Joey Pants?

87
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,680
went to a Steely Dan show in October there was a dude fucking

88
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,720
rolling a dude who looked like Michael McDonald in the front row going fucking

89
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:05,000
clone yeah he's standing there he keeps taking like they you weren't allowed to

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,560
use your phone because it's fucking dude it's all fucking boomers I don't know

91
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,360
what like it's lame to say boomer but like it was all boomers there and they

92
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,840
were like oh stay off your phone experience the show or whatever that's

93
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,680
this guy is in the front row pulling his phone out pointing at the band he's

94
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,760
doing the fucking he was doing the rope thing like he was doing the lasso to the

95
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,920
Danettes it fucking it rocked. Also you fucking, if you listen to Steely Dan you're old you're

96
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,920
gonna sit down with a with a little thingy of whiskey you know? Right.

97
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,880
You're gonna sip some scotch dude. Drink scotch whiskey all night long.

98
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,880
I've heard two Steely Dan songs.

99
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,880
That's more than enough to tell that you would drink whiskey while listening to it.

100
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
It's not, no, not for me, no.

101
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,680
It feels--

102
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,960
- Because you're stupid and your brain doesn't work.

103
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,800
- That's fine.

104
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,400
The oldest guy I ever saw at a concert

105
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,240
was at a Snoop Dogg concert.

106
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,520
It was like a 90 year old man

107
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,520
in the front row with his girlfriend.

108
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,560
And I have a video of him and he started during

109
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,960
Drop It Like It's Hot, he started like

110
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,240
doing like a, making circles with his fists.

111
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,160
But it looked like he was like, he like could barely move.

112
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,280
- Yeah, that's awesome.

113
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,840
yeah he was the man dude yeah yeah I just want to be that kind of music

114
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,520
enjoyer where I'm even late in my life. When you're like 90 years old. Like imagine Snoop Dogg came out when you're 60.

115
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,040
And you're really fucking into that. And 30 years later you're still doing it.

116
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:41,440
Showing up to a Trippie Redd concert in 60 years. Yeah exactly. You know what'd be weird though is like a

117
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,800
60 year old now being into 100 gecs. That wouldn't be weird.

118
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
Sounds like a dialysis machine.

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I feel so clean like my dialysis machine.

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,800
Yeah, I don't know.

121
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I feel like that makes sense.

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
Just, you know, computer noises.

123
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
Yeah.

124
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
Yeah, might be scary.

125
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You'd have to be an old man who was really into soldering to get to 100 kits.

126
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
Yeah.

127
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
Yeah.

128
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:16,080
I feel like that is something that like, that might be the limit for like even somebody like

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,200
my parents age where you show them that and they're like I don't even know what

130
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,640
yeah I can't process yeah it sounds like a like a white noise machine yeah sounds

131
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,900
like my computer crashing in 1998 I think the speaker I think my Alexa is broken

132
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:35,520
yeah what's going on I can't wait until the next wave of music that's impossible

133
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,240
for us to understand because like I think a hundred gecs for a lot of people

134
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,600
our age is kind of already pushing it which is crazy like you know what I mean

135
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,520
like yeah fucking well that's early 20s and already people will be like I can't

136
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,280
even what is this but like so I want the next thing that's like just so far

137
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,960
beyond that you know it'll be it'll be you know those websites where you play

138
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,680
different tones that only people of certain ages can hear

139
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:09,840
but it'll be they'll do it so that if you're older than like 22 you physically

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,600
cannot yeah yeah I'll be like listen to this I don't hear anything well you

141
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,680
fucking yeah yeah that's the thing I think like the generation before us like

142
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,280
probably 2004 and up they all grew up listening to like chipmunked versions of

143
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:33,120
fucking like yeah that's true of regular songs that like 100 gecs just makes so

144
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,840
much sense yeah yeah nightcore zombie yeah oh yeah I'm wearing a heater

145
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:45,240
we're in boxers right now instead of briefs and my ball my ball is poking out

146
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,000
I can feel it I can feel it through my jeans like I can feel my ball is like

147
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,840
getting pinched out of the leg opening what are you doing what are you looking

148
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,400
I'm looking at my balls.

149
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:07,760
I'm free-balling in a pair of cut-off sweatshorts that have a rip that goes all the way from

150
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,800
the inseam on the leg to the other inseam on the other leg.

151
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
So it's just like a kill.

152
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,040
Oh, are they split in the middle?

153
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,040
Like your balls?

154
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:21,240
Yeah, so my balls and my penis are both making an appearance.

155
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,320
It's doing that to me, but it's only pushing them to my right side of my leg.

156
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,320
not doing anything to you you are in control of both your body and the clothes

157
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,720
just yeah I wanted to have my balls out cuz it's a little bit hot in my

You claim you're a mummy right now, I guess

163
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:08,200
Why did you get Patrick really until wearing like a Victorian dresses where you have to put on like three corsets under it?

164
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,040
I get under dress and a dress and an overdress and a petticoat. He should get back into wearing dresses. Yeah

165
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,040
You used to be a girl like two or three years ago. No, I did it or something like that

166
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,200
No, we're dresses. Don't start a rumor. It's not a room. I'm right. What's up?

167
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,680
Remember Pat used to wear dresses. I did

168
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,640
Pat you can't hear that. He was whispering. I heard it

169
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:39,760
He put his hand over his mouth to block I talked in a tone that was too too low for you to hear. Mm-hmm

170
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,540
Yeah, hey, yeah, you see yours can only hear really high-pitched noises and not low

171
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,960
- I hope his voice is, 'cause he's a baby.

172
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,060
- Why aren't you-- - What?

173
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,900
- Now you do sound like a normal dude.

174
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,240
- Hey, yeah, man.

175
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,380
- This is fucking offensive, dude.

176
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,960
- Hey, Patrick, why are you talking in your normal voice?

177
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
- Yeah.

178
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,760
- I don't know.

179
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,440
- You sound like my friend's deaf Spanish teacher.

180
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,780
(laughing)

181
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:05,340
I don't like that.

182
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,740
- Your 14-year-old friend?

183
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,580
- Yeah.

184
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,500
- Why did that, why was there so much like,

185
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,720
that resonated, yeah.

186
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,720
I echoed a bunch.

187
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
That's when you just like stepped on a reverb pedal when you said that.

188
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Did it do it again?

189
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
No, it didn't do it again.

190
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,520
I think it was the springs on your mic arm.

191
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,720
I'm gonna get more into effects.

192
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Yeah.

193
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,160
Oh, I would love to.

194
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,120
I'm leaning towards effects right now.

195
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Yeah.

196
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
We should get more effects on this show.

197
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,720
Okay.

198
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
I don't think so.

199
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Okay.

200
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,720
Why not, Kim?

201
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,720
Did that do an effect?

202
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
Oh, okay.

203
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:47,880

Damn, it's like a--

237
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,140

They're always mad at their mare.

241
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,280
Their fricking Rahm Emanuel, Lori Layfoot, doesn't matter.

346
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,380
brothers scary yin-yang yeah more like the ah hurdy brothers they're talking

347
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,920

349
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,580
your brother fucked them and they go "aww hurdy"

350
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,580
okay?

351
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:36,580
they wouldn't say that

352
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,580
they would say that

353
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,580
they say weird stuff all the time

354
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,580
they say a bunch of weird shit

355
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,580
that's how it works being a twin

356
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,580
I have friends who are twins

357
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,580
one of my friends who is a twin

358
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,580
yeah I can say that about the property brothers

359
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,580
because I have friends who are twins

360
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
I do! Twins like to fuck each other

361
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,580
I have a twin friend

362
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,100
I have a twin friend, he says it's okay if I say that the property is brother's fucking

363
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,100
son.

364
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,100
No, my twin friend said it's okay.

365
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:11,460
In my experience, twins, one twin always loves to call their brother because they got put

366
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,500
in rehab by the city of Detroit.

367
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:22,000
I had a friend in college who was an identical twin and he was like doing great, like my

368
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,220
friend was doing great, he's a very smart guy, and then three times, three different

369
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,020
times that I was hanging out with him he would get a call either from the police

370
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,660
or from his brother letting him know that his brother was

371
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:38,780
in rehab for heroin in Detroit. Dude it must be so hard. Does that happen to every twin?

372
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:44,340
It must be so hard to be a twin. It must be hard to be a twin and like just have to

373
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,700
resist the temptation every single day of your life to become the evil twin.

374
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,020
Well yeah because I think as soon as one pulls ahead just a little bit like as

375
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:56,140
soon as the first one to get like a star in kindergarten on there like next to

376
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,820
name yeah that's gonna the other one is just immediately gonna turn evil it's

377
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:06,100
true yeah and start which is evil it's evil to be addicted to drugs it's

378
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,020
evil to have addictions exactly I agree yeah I'm expunging the evil from me yeah

379
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,180
that's why that's why this is the sober man episode mm-hmm yeah are you

380
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,260
throwing caffeine - are you one of those guys I'm not gonna quit caffeine no I

381
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,980
I mean nicotine is already hard enough to quit. It's easy. Yeah? Yeah. You just stop.

382
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:29,740
Just suck and stop dude. It's easier to quit. It's so much easier to quit

383
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,180
cigarettes than vape. It's literally all you have to do is you sit down and that's

384
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,740
it. That's all you have to do. Because the thing is with quitting cigarettes is that

385
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,140
you can just start vaping. With vaping you can't be like alright I'm quitting

386
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:44,260
vaping I will replace him with cigarettes. I'm gonna yeah I'm gonna

387
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,620
right I'm gonna lick empty Juul pods that's what I'm replacing it with. I'm

388
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,780
I'm gonna be I'm gonna get a bottom yeah I was thinking of getting the lodges is

389
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,140
I'm gonna get a lozenge I was thinking I'm gonna get the long jizzes yeah I'm

390
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:04,980
gonna get a nicotine eye patch yeah yeah

391
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:10,660
that's a good one. You take it off at the end of the day and your eyes just yellow.

392
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:16,420
It just looks like you have big eyes. You just have a snake eye.

393
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,580
Be cool dude. You have one Sith eye, one regular eye.

394
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,460
I think it would work. Yeah that's the evil coming out of me. It's coming out of

395
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:28,340
me through my eyes. Yeah it's all, I'm gonna get all the evil

396
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:31,140
concentrated in my right eye and then I'm gonna have it removed.

397
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:39,460
yeah that's why the Sith get yellow eyes mm-hmm cuz they smoking fucking you get

398
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,420

it actually made him shut up yeah I feel like getting told to shut up or anything

456
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,820
especially when someone is bothering you like your enemy. Burger also didn't work

457
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:56,100
that idiot kept talking. I wish it was more acceptable to have an

458
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:00,340
enemy as an adult. I use this all the time when that bitch won't stop talking

459
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:06,880
a sheet just I think it's good for people to have a nemesis I think it's great to

460
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,920
have an enemy like if you're a kid and you say like this person's my enemy yeah

461
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,800
and then people are like oh yeah that's normal but if you're 20 22 years old 20

462
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,360
22 years old you say to somebody you're my enemy you're gonna get sent to jail

463
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,360
mm-hmm you don't get sent to jail for having an enemy you go to jail for

464
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:28,480
having an enemy if you're an adult the last kid no that's don't act on your

465
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,360
enemy urge well telling them that they're your enemy is is acting on it I don't

466
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,440

00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,420
sound exactly the same as bloober here's the top comment on this one is no way no

504
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,620
one should stick their head in a toilet stool which they won't tell them to go

505
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:04,340
catch a butterfly and fly with it trigger trash kid says dog poop would be

506
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:13,420
worse than a toilet yeah well what's dog poop is one is one poop of people poop a

507
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,180
thousand times in the toilet yeah I don't the toilet gets that in over and

508
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,300
over and over and over but those are all little teensy weensy parts of other

509
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:26,660
different poops so they might they're not exactly all the worst one is it all the

510
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,380
parts that were bad enough to stay in the toilet no no getting flushed down

511
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:34,980
it's like panning for no no no it's like panning for gold exactly so the gold

512
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:38,980
there the gold stays the most the most disgusting hold on those valuable

513
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:42,100
parts of the pool no one gave me an answer to leave you don't even answer

514
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:49,780
sports what is dog poop worse than human poop um no i would rather eat dog poop

515
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:55,900
than human poop really i guess it depends on what the dog has been eating yeah and

516
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:01,860
the person too i feel like on average dogs are you dogs dogs will just walk

517
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,820
around the house and just lick the entire floor clean dogs will eat out of

518
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,940
the trash yeah if they're not but what people people will eat out of mcdonald's

519
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:15,620
which hey true don't you fucking dare no but I feel like okay would you rather

520
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:20,580
eat horse poop or human poop? Because horse poop is like just hay basically.

521
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,660
okay well I don't want to come out so big. And then that guy in Philadelphia ate it.

522
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,220
I'd rather eat something that used to be a sandwich than something that used to

523
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:36,740
be hay. Okay. There's still parts of the hay in the poop. That's what I'm fine with.

524
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,380
Like I would eat the poop of a guy who only eats horse poop. Would you rather eat hay or a

525
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:53,020
sandwich um hey no a sandwich but like imagine a guy who okay it's corn rather

526
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:57,260
would you rather eat would you rather eat the poop of a horse that only eats

527
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:03,580
sandwiches or a guy that only eats hey a horse it'll need sandwiches so you just

528
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:09,740
like horse poop no I just think that it would be a better good you said you

529
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,980
would eat the horse poop because it had hay in it. I think human poop is designed to repulse

530
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:19,020
humans. Horse poop is inspiring. It's designed to entice them. Yeah. Horse poop is inspiring?

531
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,940
I get inspired when I see horse poop. Also, somehow there's like horse shit all over my

532
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,260
block constantly. Oh, it's because of the horse cops. There's no horses in fucking,

533
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:33,100
there's no horse cops in Ridgewood, dude. Yeah, there are. There's not. I've seen one.

534
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,940
You're lying. There is not. How do you know it's horse poop? I saw one in Buddy the Elf.

535
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:42,980
biggest poop I've ever seen could be just a guy I saw one in how high - well then

536
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,100
maybe I want to eat homeless guy poop the homeless guy with the biggest ass of all

537
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:49,920
time oh I forget I did forget about Donnie dump trucks the homeless yeah the

538
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,860

539
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,860

540
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:10,080

541
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:17,840
Winstar on it. You saw a poop car. I saw a brown Winstar. But no, I mean nobody really

542
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:22,160
answered my question I feel like. I'm sick and tired of your words so just shut up.

543
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,120
Oh. That's like out of nowhere almost. Yeah where did that come from? Came from number

544
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,680
before on the freaking list that's oh what I forgot we're you I thought I was

545
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,360
so enamored by poop the list of horse poop types different kinds of poop you

546
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:46,400
could eat yeah yeah baby poop or adult poop I feel like baby poop you can

547
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,240
convince yourself it was like baby poop the thing is baby poop babies have just

548
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,080
been eating like what but then would you go to jail if you're like a baby you

549
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:59,080
would go to jail immediately if you ate a baby poop. Would you okay is it like the

550
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:05,780
first baby poop the green one? It's a baby poop. One baby's poop. Yeah I it's

551
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:10,160
just like it's like first. Okay so it's okay milk. Oh no no I would never eat I

552
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,040
would never eat a baby's poop. I would much rather eat an adult's poop than a

553
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,400
baby's poop I think. Is a baby's poop is like yeah that's like the disgusting

554
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,800
level above diarrhea. A baby made out of candy. Yeah, would you eat that one's poop?

555
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,280
Is the poop made out of candy? What's the adult made out of? Candy.

556
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,360
Would you eat a poop made out of candy entirely

557
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,720
and it came out of a candy boy?

558
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Would you eat that? Would I eat a poop from a candy boy?

559
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:48,280
But, candy man's poop is all black licorice.

560
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,120
I would eat the black licorice.

561
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,120
Would you rather eat...

562
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Four a million dollars.

563
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,200
Would you rather eat four a million dollars?

564
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Yes.

565
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Would you rather eat a...

566
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,840
I don't think I would do it.

567
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,360
A hamburger where the patty is poop or a hamburger where the buns are poop?

568
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,360
Can I have poop in all three?

569
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
It's the same amount.

570
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
I'd rather have just like a...

571
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,360
I don't want to...

572
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Yeah, I don't want to pollute it with anything.

573
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:14,440
I want to convince myself it's just something that I have to eat and it's not like...

574
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,720
You know, because I'm a picky eater.

575
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,280
I'll take the buns off and just eat the burger.

576
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,280
I'll eat a hamburger where the bun is poop as long as the buns are lettuce.

577
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,280
Yes, yeah, because I'm low carb right now.

578
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Yeah. I'm doing keto. I can't eat the buns.

579
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,280
I'm doing Aikido. I can't eat this.

580
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280

587
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,280
do you have to pay their bills now if you give somebody cancer you have to pay

588
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,860
their medical bills yes damn I would love that's Patrick's law what about a

00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:07,640
corn dog would the corner of the dog would be poop which is the dog be poop

590
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,680
yeah okay you the thing that you taste the most in a corn dog is the corny part

591
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:23,820
yeah honestly I'll pay for that like a Korean style corn dog I don't what's a

592
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:28,680
Korean style guys poop that's the difference well then I know there's a

593
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:36,800
different one Korean corn dog Korean corn dog Korean corn dogs are made out of

594
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,960
of it's a hot dog or cheese stick and it's dumped it's made out of rice flour

595
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:54,840
and I think it has a cheese that's really neat that just wanted to show us that he

596
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,560
knew that there was a corn dog that was no no no no no no Pat just wanted to

597
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:04,200
show you Google something yeah she likes to show at least once every episode

598
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,040
French right it's got Fred it's called the ganja dog I was from Monty Gangnam

599
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,840

600
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:20,500
it's it's poop wrapped in french fries or would you rather so poop wrapped in

601
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,560
french fries corn dog would you rather eat a corn dog or a plate of french

602
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,840
fries

603
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:35,840
french fries poop I'm guessing poop comes with a bigger reward than I'm all about

604
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,200
the reward even if nobody told me I'm gonna I'm gonna eat it and just be like

605
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,400
I will either get my reward here on earth or in heaven from yeah this is this is

606
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,840
exactly like why I would pick Jay Z I would pick dinner with Jay Z rather than

607
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,280
a million dollars cuz he's gonna poop on a plate

608
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,680
Would you rather eat poop with Jay-Z or 1 million dollars?

609
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:03,280
A poop dinner with Jay-Z or 50k, what do you say?

610
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,480
I'll take a poop dinner because I can stick him there for a while.

611
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,280
It's going to take us a while to move through some poop.

612
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,480
I mean he's going to want to watch.

613
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,280
He's going to want to sit there and see me eat the whole thing.

614
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,280
If he's not, every second he spends not talking to me, he legally has to be eating poop.

615
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,280
Exactly.

616
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,080
And I've got a camcorder and a connection to the internet.

617
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:24,080
Yeah, so I fall asleep like it's a lecture and just record it and watch it all later.

618
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:29,600
Yeah, and then I can upload the video to YouTube and only take it down if he gives me two million

619
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,600
dollars.

620
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600

00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,840
- Bye for now means I'm going on vacation for a while.

688
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,580
No phone calls, no text messages, just me and the wind.

689
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,060
My life has begun now.

690
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,140
(laughing)

691
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,460
- Just me and the wind.

692
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,380
- Yeah man, just me and the wind.

693
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:38,200
- Yeah.

694
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,060
No one around to say blooper to me.

695
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:42,900
- Mm-mm.

696
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,220
- No one around to tell me to charge my sharshy sharsh.

697
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:47,980
- Charge my farts and scars.

698
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:53,900
And then you're chilling at the hotel pool, you see a car pull in, who jumps out the back?

699
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:58,380
But Jay-Z and a big plate of poop appear to interrupt your vacation.

700
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:59,380
And he kills you.

701
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:05,100
I thought I told you I wanted the money, get the fuck out of here.

702
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,100
Jay-Z keeps following me.

703
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:10,540
He's trying to treat me to a poop dinner.

704
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:14,380
Would you eat Jay-Z's poop for one million dollars?

705
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,500
Or would you read a book and eat...

706
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:21,380
Would you read a book and you open the book up and hollow it out as a piece of poop that

707
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,940
you have to eat for two million?

708
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:28,500
Would you rather eat a poop book or read a fart book?

709
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:34,380
Would you rather eat a chocolate book or throw up and eat the throw up?

710
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:35,380
DVD or a Blu-ray?

711
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:36,380
Wait, HD DVD?

712
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,640
(laughing)

713
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:39,480
- Wait, HD DVD?

714
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,000
- Would you rather feast on a frozen fart

715
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,000
or prowl on a pretty poop?

716
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,340
- Yeah, that's a tough one.

717
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:49,740
- I'd feast on a frozen fart.

718
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,980
- Would you rather--

719
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,780
- Or dine on a dark diarrhea.

720
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,620
(laughing)

721
00:46:56,620 --> 00:46:58,420
- I was thinking the other day about,

722
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,300
like if I was into shit, it would be such a problem

723
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,260
because it was like, you know, people are into shit,

724
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:10,660
They want like a normal like poop swirl on them or they want to see their poop swirl on somebody.

725
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,660
It's just people that like soft stuff.

726
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:17,060
And I would just like, I would just like, like buckshot shotgun blast diarrhea on whoever

727
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:20,300
I was fucking every time that I wanted to come.

728
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:21,300
You have like a...

729
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,300
I'm like, I'm like physically incapable of having that fetish.

730
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:26,500
You have like a Gatling gun crank on the side of your ass.

731
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:30,160
Yeah but it's just like, it's like if you pop the top off of someone mixing paint at

732
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,160
Home Depot.

733
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,160
Yeah.

734
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,160
And that's like...

735
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,300
when the lid comes off the blender when you're making a smoothie. Yeah, it's like dude, it's

736
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:42,700
impossible for me to. Just like Barret from Final Fantasy 7 just with poop in his

737
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:54,200
gun. Exactly dude. You have a poop connected. A blender bus. Yeah. Got a blender butt. Yeah. Alright. You look

738
00:47:54,200 --> 00:48:01,680
beautiful with your mouth closed. Thank you. Keep it closed. You look beautiful with your mouth closed.

739
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,120
- Oh, watch this. - Your mouth is sharp.

740
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,360
- Nobody can see you except us.

741
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,320
- What are you doing?

742
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:10,820
- And it's not, nope, it's not that small.

743
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,080
You're not even making that small of a mouth.

744
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,900
- What about this one?

745
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,360
- Okay, for the listeners, - Pretty small, right?

746
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,080
- Cam and Pat are making their mouths small.

747
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:24,380
- Whose mouth is smaller?

748
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,640
Caleb, answer.

749
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,680
- Between you and Pat, Pat.

750
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:32,520
Pat has less lip going on here.

751
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:35,040
But I think he has the advantage of more facial hair

752
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:35,880
on the bottom.

753
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,680
- How about now? - It covers his lip a little.

754
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:43,400
Hey, you know right now I just wanna put a fork in it.

755
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:45,640
(laughing)

756
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,120
- I wanna put a fork in my mouth too.

757
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,200
- Yeah, full of that fucking spaghetti.

758
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,120
- Yeah. - That's right, there we go.

759
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,880
- See, that's a good comeback to the shut up comeback.

760
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,000
- Yeah. - What, spaghetti?

761
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
(laughter)

762
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Hey man, shut up. Hey, spaghetti!

763
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Yeah, I don't know.

764
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I want to shut up too. I need a plate of spaghetti.

765
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Yeah, that would work.

766
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
Someone says,

767
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
"That was a really bad one and mad my friend

768
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000

00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:44,140

906
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:30,940
- You meant it like the Michael Richards way, right?

907
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:31,780
- No.

908
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:34,020
(laughing)

909
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,740
Come on Pat, what's wrong with you dude?

910
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:39,740
- That's not true. - Oh, this chups you.

911
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:42,000
(laughing)

912
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:48,020
- Did you see that somebody downloaded an old Morrowind mod

913
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:51,020
and it had the Michael Richards, it's called Morrowind 2,

914
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:52,980
and it just has Michael Richards doing that,

915
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:56,680
but it replaces all of the stuff with elf slurs.

916
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,860
- Yeah, that's so funny. - You're gonna find that.

917
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:02,060
- Yeah, a bit of-- - Hey, la la la la la.

918
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:03,980
- La la la la la.

919
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:12,600
Close your speaking hole. Shut your face grandma. This one's good. Do you know my friend Chad?

920
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:19,660

923
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,440
- "What Charlie Brown, a DJ, Do" is an awesome EDM song

924
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,580
that I first heard a part of when I watched

925
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,720
a daily CNN 10 episode played at school.

926
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:38,860
It played at the end.

927
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:41,100
I watched the episode again and asked Siri for the song,

928
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,480
which is how I know the name of it.

929
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,280
It has no lyrics, but the title is enough.

930
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,280
Not to mention, the song is awesome.

931
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:48,720
- Shut up with all the dustbin stuff.

932
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,560
- Yeah, your dustbin is full enough.

933
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,220
- Your dustbin is full enough, you turd.

934
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,340
And then number 53, erg,

935
00:59:53,340 --> 00:59:55,340
when are you going to shut that dustbin?

936
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:56,180
It stinks.

937
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,360
- It must be British slang.

938
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,360
- Number 51, me, me, me.

939
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,800
(laughing)

940
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:03,960
- Nee nee nee.

941
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,080
