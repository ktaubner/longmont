32
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,400
That's a good choice. Yeah. I started my job at the art gallery. Yeah. Yeah.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,880
And I started it last night and last night was this big opening for this...

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:49,360
It's... where is it? Nice try, bitch. Yeah, that's not gonna work on Caleb. He's one of the

35
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,200
cleverest art guards of all time. Exactly. I'm not saying because I don't want you to

36
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,800
come steal the art yeah the thing is I could say anything I would never get

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,680
fired from this job it's you stand I stand around I look at art but last

38
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:06,600
night was an opening for an artist's exhibition and the artist is she's deaf

39
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,320
she's dead she's dead she's deaf she's death she's death she's the grim leaper

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:18,720
she's the grim leaper and she's like a frog you expect nobody showed up to that

41
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,960
shit because he was she was the frog well she could see any of them she didn't

42
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:35,640
know nice yeah she was deaf and so there was a big opening there's like 600

43
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,720
people there and like a big over here and shut the fuck up

44
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:48,200
your brain. Shut up. Shut up. That's what we laugh on the show now. I'm gonna unmute Dogel.

45
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm gonna make Dogel unchained. Dogel unchained? Yeah. I muted it, you can't. I'll unmute Dogel

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,840
and unchain him. Try it, try it from here. Unchain Dogel. Unchain Dogel now. Dogel unchained.

47
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:08,280
Dogel unchained. It's not working. But so there's 600 people who showed up, 300 of which

48
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:17,760
were deaf and apparently deaf people love to touch art and I have no idea how to

49
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,160
say in sign language don't touch that art so the entire night was just me just

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:29,880
like grabbing deaf people and just being like don't touch the art!

51
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:36,560
Yeah it was bad dude. It was not good. Why didn't they just put up signs that

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,240
say don't touch the for some reason nobody foresaw deaf people showing up to

53
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:50,160
the deaf artists opening. I don't know why. They had two translators but one of

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,200
the translators was for the artist and the other was for random people who were

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,840
gonna be there but this so this lady I just had to like run around and try to

56
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,240
get her attention all the time. And she kept doing it? No, she was the translator.

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,240
This was the translator. I just had to keep like...

58
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
I thought you were saying there's one deaf lady.

59
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
If somebody didn't understand what I was trying to tell them...

60
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
One deaf lady just like...

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Turns out she's the rival artist.

62
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Yeah.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,240
One of the two deaf artists and they hate each other.

64
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,240
She signs like "Ha ha!"

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
"I have just ruined your priceless art!"

66
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
In an evil accent.

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,240
Yeah, in a doof and schmertz accent.

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
She's doing all of it but she's also signing like Sieg Heilig at the same time.

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Yeah.

70
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Because it's an evil deaf... that would be the evil deaf voice.

71
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,240
the evil deaf voices because German is the normal voice.

72
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,400
An interesting fact, Hitler was actually deaf and the Seig Heil actually is um it's a

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,400
sign language sign that means I am Hitler and people misunderstood it and

74
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,520
they all kind of did it back to him it didn't really make sense.

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,240
Yeah because simultaneously it also means stop being me!

76
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
No you're not Hitler I am!

77
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
He would do it back to them because it's it's poorly designed the German sign

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,600
language but it also means stop doing that yeah so he would go stop copying

79
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,360
me and do it right back to them yeah and then they got into this whole

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,340
so it's really all he was trying to say was don't I'm it's me I'm Hitler you're

81
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:32,040
not there's a I'm Hitler and you're not yeah as he gets offstage we were looking

82
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,400
we were looking at an apartment today and like across the street or like next

83
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,280
door to the apartment there was a building and they had like this photo of

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,920
like all of them and they're all like reaching their hands out and there's one

85
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,800
guy who's like too far away but he's still trying to reach his hands into the

86
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,200
center like the center circle and it just looks like he's doing like the Z

87
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,360
Kyle. That's sick. Yeah it's across from the Star Market. The Zeke Kyle. Yeah. Wait I have

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,360
Zeke Kyle. Zeke Kyle? Oh fuck. Do you remember that picture? It was a picture of the two neo-nazis

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,840
and it was like oh seen Kyle? Anybody seen Kyle? He's about this tall. It's a pun. It's

90
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,280
a pun. I miss those old image macros. Yeah. You will shit a brick when you see it. It's

91
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,520
picture of water and under the water, they'll lock this monster. Your ass will explode off

92
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,920
your body when you see it and you will shit yourself.

93
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,880
This image is an optical illusion. Kidnapped? I prefer the term surprise adoption.

94
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
Yeah.

95
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
Yeah.

96
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,360
Yeah. That picture, there's something where someone moved the Bible into the fiction section

97
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,880
and then that picture of Freddie Mercury, it's a...

98
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
Oh, yeah.

99
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,560
And it says like true story or whatever.

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,560
You ever heard of Derpina?

101
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Yeah.

102
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,560
Oh, yeah.

103
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,120
derpina bitch right to watch movies with me I wish yeah and to do that you can do

104
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,920

106
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,120

107
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,480
and Caleb went to Olive Garden went to Olive Garden and there was this table

108
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:13,200
of like guys behind us like what the type of guy they were like

109
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
construction worker type guys

110
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,200
were they still in like the the best

111
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
yeah yeah they were like the high viz

112
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:22,200
we're gonna go to fucking Olive Garden after work

113
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
you going?

114
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
exactly

115
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,480
so we were sitting in there behind us just talking and their conversation was literally

116
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,720
just about like different foods and I was like

117
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,880
it's got noodles it's got cheese it's deep fried what's not to like

118
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,840
hey Strega Nona had a good a fucking idea

119
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,400
I'll tell you that right now

120
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,160
Unlimited spaghetti?

121
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,160
One guy was like, "Listen, I've had macaroni that didn't have enough cheese. I've had macaroni

122
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,680
that was dripping with cheese." That was all he said.

123
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,520
He's talking about cheese all the time.

124
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,760
The best part of that trip was when we walked in, they gave us these, this lady was like,

125
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,960
"Would you guys like to sample our limonada?" And we were like, "Sure." So they gave us

126
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,920
these tiny little cups and put a little bit of strawberry lemonade in them, and we were

127
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,480
kind of drinking them. And then we sat down.

128
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,080
I put mine on the table.

129
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,300
He put his on the table and our waitress comes by and she goes like, "Hey, welcome to Olive

130
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,120
Garden. Can I get you-" What the fuck is that?

131
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,020
Well, no, I started ordering. She said, "What can I-" I said, "Oh, I'll have like the

132
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,080
linguine." And she went, "What the fuck is that?" And I thought she was talking about

133
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,080
what I was ordering.

134
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,640
And he was like, "Linguine?" And she was like, "No, that. Is that methadone?" She thought

135
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,720
that his sample of lemonade was methadone.

136
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
What?

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,320
And we were like, "No." She's like, "Oh." Because my friend went to the methadone clinic

138
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
and it kinda look like that

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
(laughter)

140
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
I'm so sorry, I hope I didn't offend you

141
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
I was just like looking at the camera

142
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
I was like, yeah if I didn't know you I would have guessed that was methadone too

143
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,320
he came in in that huge jacket

144
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
before he shaved

145
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
people with methadone are cold

146
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,320
they need big jackets

147
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,320
they need big jackets because they don't have enough

148
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,320
they don't have enough methadone

149
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
exactly

150
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
never enough

151
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,320
they're always running out

152
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,520
So the fuck yeah, I'll have the

153
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,040
That's

154
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:24,920
Somebody who's never heard of any italian food working as a waiter in a health garden

155
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,640
I'll have the uh pasta. Ifaggioli. What the fuck you call me?

156
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah, well Caleb did order that and he paused a really long time between the words.

157
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,480
Yeah.

158
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:37,880
Yeah.

159
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,280
Yeah.

160
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,320
It's faggiole.

161
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,040
Yeah, I know.

162
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,240
It's faggiole.

163
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,960
Faggiole.

164
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,680
Yeah.

165
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,480
My mom used to pronounce that faggiole.

166
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,880
My mom used to say pasta faggola.

167
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,240
Nice.

168
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,880
Fagula.

169
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,320
Yeah, fagula.

170
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,720
And then we had a teacher.

171
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,200
My mom then turned fagola into the word that she would say instead of like faggot because

172
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
she thought it was like the light version.

173
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:00,520
Yeah.

174
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,840
So then she would like, she called someone like Fagola once and it was their last name.

175
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,920
Whoa.

176
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,560
That's crazy.

177
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:07,720
Somebody's last name is Fagola?

178
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,360
Somebody's the basketball coach in my middle school.

179
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,400
Fagola?

180
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:11,880
Yeah.

181
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,200
Damn.

182
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,000
Fagola.

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,480
Like gay Dracula.

184
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,000
Yeah, no, I got it.

185
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,440
Listen, I can't stop thinking about it since you said it.

186
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,200
Yeah, it's like I want to suck your dick.

187
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,720
I want to suck your dick.

188
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,220
No.

189
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:26,280
I want the same rights as everyone else.

190
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,240
Yeah, that's what he says.

191
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,600
I want to go on a big, big beach.

192
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, he doesn't matter because he's Transylvanian. He doesn't it doesn't apply to the US.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,640
It's the same thing. It's very similar. That's why he wears a big cape.

194
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:45,800
Yeah, um, and he can hypnotize people with his eyes. Yeah, just like all gay and turn into a bat

195
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,760
and yeah, uh, gaseous when when a gay guy hypnotizes me with his eyes in the back section.

196
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:56,200
So annoying. Yeah. Don't use your powers on me. Just take a break for once.

197
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,200
Yeah, just take one night off.

198
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,520
You take one single night off. So it's got to be exhausting for you. You know what I mean?

199
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,200
They should be able to take a night off just play some video games.

200
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,440
Just watch basketball with your dad. Yeah, one of us should become gay.

201
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:23,160
Not it. Not it. Yeah, camera. Fine. Dude, yes. I'll do it. Got him. We got him. We got him so hard right then.

202
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,200
Oh, what have you guys been doing this week?

203
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,560
Anything fun?

204
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,360
Class.

205
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,000
Yeah.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,560
Yeah, exactly.

207
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,360
Damn, it's Friday.

208
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
It feels early in the week.

209
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,400
That Friday feeling.

210
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,360
Yeah, I just have been going to class and to work.

211
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,480
That Friday feeling.

212
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,600
That Friday feeling.

213
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,040
Now imagine if I'm Albert Einstein, ready?

214
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:42,600
Yeah.

215
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,680
Patrick's making the Albert Einstein face.

216
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,480
Albert Einstein.

217
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:45,980
Albert.

218
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,480
I stick my tongue out just like the genius.

219
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,760
Yeah.

220
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,960
I've got a genius tongue.

221
00:11:52,520 --> 00:12:01,000
That was a byproduct of how smart he was. He was using all of his brain to think and he couldn't

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,840
actually use any brain to close his mouth.

223
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,240
His tongue had a direct connection to his brain.

224
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,320
That was just a little bit of brain poking out of his mouth because he was overflowing with it.

225
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,280
He had too much brain.

226
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,000
Yeah.

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,480
When did he die?

228
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,680
Yesterday.

229
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,320
'72.

230
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,120
'72?

231
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,560
I don't know. He was around in the early 1900s.

232
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,800
He was around and that was what time he was active.

233
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,600
Yeah, when did he die?

234
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,480
So when did he die?

235
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,320
He's a rapper, right?

236
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,480
What day of the week did Einstein die?

237
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,400
Hey, Dogel.

238
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,360
Hey, Dogel.

239
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,400
Oh, we shut her off.

240
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,440
What day is the 4th?

241
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,200
What day did Einstein die?

242
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, '55.

243
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,520
1955.

244
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,320
April 18th.

245
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,360
What day?

246
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:42,680
It's kind of late.

247
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,800
Yeah, that's one of my recent searches is "What day is 4-July?"

248
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,120
[Laughter]

249
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,120
I was trying to figure out what day of the week my birthday was on.

250
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,120
What day is 4th Julte.

251
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,120
What day is 4 Julte.

252
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,120
Oh yeah, what are we going to do for your birthday?

253
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
My birthday is first. What are we doing for my birthday?

254
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
I don't know. Your birthday is the day before or day... 17th?

255
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,120
Yes.

256
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
So it's the day after Dom's.

257
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,120
That was one of the most adorable moments of me and Patrick's whole friendship.

258
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
What?

259
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
He remembered my birthday.

It's after my girlfriend's birthday.

261
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,120

00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,700

before we went to July. - How did you guys know?

303
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,260

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,180

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:17,260
It wasn't I tried you were at the video store video store

313
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:23,800
Buster I was turning my shit to blockbuster. I was returning all those videos

314
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,620
I'm not even a blockbuster anymore miss sir. Sometimes it feels like the late fees

315
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:35,060
They blockbuster on roku the late fees are getting bigger and bigger every year. It's cuz you don't return your shit

316
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:42,280
What if you if you never returned something to blockbuster and then they closed you just own the movie you own the movie

317
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,020
I think they might send their blockbuster assassin. They did. I think somebody

318
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:52,900
Names like a thousand dollar bill from blockbuster for a copy of freddy got fingered. Whoa, that's cool

319
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,420
Yeah, if they're if you keep their movie, they send josh wick after you

320
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,820
If you keep their if you keep their movie, then they'll make a movie called your name. God. Oh my god, they'll make a movie called

321
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:09,860
Reputation yeah if people went around saying that I got a finger if you yeah

322
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,820
Caleb and, Caleb, Patrick, and Cameron all got fingered.

323
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,420
Caleb, Patrick, and Tom Green.

324
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,180
All got, all fingered each other.

325
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,180
Yeah.

326
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,180
Where is he?

327
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,180
Tom Green?

328
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,180
No.

329
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,180
Canada.

330
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,620
Is he back in Canada?

331
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,620
I think so.

332
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,620
Do you know he was a rapper before he was a comedian?

333
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,460
Did you know before that he was a baby?

334
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,820
Before that, he was nothing.

335
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Yeah.

336
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,220
He was a sperm in his dad's ass.

337
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,700
No, he actually wasn't.

338
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,620
That's one interesting thing about Tom Green is he skipped that whole stage entirely.

339
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,860
He was just an egg.

340
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,860
He was an egg.

341
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,800
only an egg. That's why he was able to get fingered. Because he didn't have the male

342
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
sperm to go into him.

343
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,180
He wasn't Freddy in that movie, his brother was Freddy.

344
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,380
I've never seen that movie, I don't give a fuck.

345
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,620
I'm sure it is, I've heard lots of people say it's good.

346
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:55,460
If they made that movie about Freddy Krueger, let me tell you what, you wouldn't want to

347
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,900
give finger back. Freddy gives the finger.

348
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,980
Freddy got fingered, I hope it's not by Wolverine. That's my joke about Freddy got fingered.

349
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,300
Who would win in a fight, Freddy Krueger or the Wolverine?

350
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,300
Freddy Krueger has more claws than Wolverine.

351
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,800
That's true.

352
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,300
No, it's not.

353
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,300
Because Wolverine has...

354
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
But Wolverine is smaller than Freddy Krueger.

355
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,300
Here's the question.

356
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:18,300
Freddy Krueger has five and Wolverine has six total.

357
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,300
So Wolverine wins.

358
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Yeah, but Freddy can get you in the dream.

359
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Freddy Krueger would molest Wolverine because he's so short.

360
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
He'd be able to... You do what he does to the children.

361
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,300
He thought he was a hairy kid.

362
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,300
He thought he was a hairy kid and he went into his nightmares and had sex with his nightmare.

363
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:40,900
I bet yeah the Wolverine would he would need to never sleep. Yeah. Like Wall Street. Well,

364
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,020
he doesn't really need to sleep does he? Wolverine? I think everybody needs to sleep Patrick. No,

365
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:51,620
if you're Wolverine, the metal powers. Yeah. He's a battery power. Yeah, he's made out of a battery.

366
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,820
He's a robot. Yeah, as long as he doesn't, you know, lose his battery juice. He's going to town

367
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,300
on his nuts up there. Can you not talk about Caleb like that? Not me. I wish I could go to town on my

368
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,400
nuts. My the thing is my nuts are long enough, but my my I can't read your neck

369
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,440
only because of the neck brace. Yeah, if I had a long enough, if I if I he's

370
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:16,740
doing doing that thing that they do where they they put all the gold rings

371
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:22,320
on the neck. So yeah, yeah. So I have a big long neck. Yeah, but then the rings

372
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:26,780
get in the way. Yeah, God damn. Once you take the rings off, you can't. It's

373
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,700
pretty funny. You take the rings off and your neck is just floppy. You can't. Oh

374
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,460
If you take the rings off don't don't doesn't your neck break. I think I think it depends on how many rings you have

375
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,520
Yeah, I think they can die. I think you can die if you take your rings off

376
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,680
Well, how do you have sex if you're the ring lady? You don't oh, you don't know. Absolutely not. I'm gonna become one

377
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:51,240
I'm gonna get the rings. I'm gonna get there, you know, like these bitches Sonic that fucking hedgehog

378
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,820
Mm-hmm

379
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,900
He'd be collecting those rings and snapping their necks like it was fucking

380
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,340
Like it was yeah, and then he'd fall down and all the rings would come out

381
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:03,820
Yeah, and then they'd be like you killed all our friends for nothing. They'd probably kill him. He'd say got a blast

382
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,980
He said I'm having a brain blast and it would go inside his brain. I'm having a sonic moment

383
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,180
He wouldn't say that dude. That's not in the movie having that awkward. That's not in the movie

384
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,900
It's Sonic moment where you're the bluest guy in your friend group

385
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:24,380
So annoying it's not a moment when your your dad is dr. Robotnik. Oh fuck

386
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:29,740
Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey. Jim Carrey. They should have made Jim Carrey's

387
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:36,540
shaped like an egg for a movie. I don't care-y about Jim Carrey's girlfriend. About his girlfriend who he killed.

388
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:41,660
I don't give a fuck that he forced better prescription drugs. It doesn't mean anything to me. Allegedly.

389
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,980
Allegedly. Dude, he made Yes Man and she said, "Do you want to kill me?"

390
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,980
He said, "I'm a method actor, I gotta do it."

391
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:52,980
He said, "Alrighty."

392
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
He was studying for...

393
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,380
I'm a method actor, so I have to give you this crystal meth to do my acting.

394
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,380
Yeah, exactly.

395
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,460
They were doing a Man on the Moon sequel, and he was doing an Andy Kaufman bit where

396
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
he kills a woman.

397
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,140
Because it was like, what if Andy Kaufman hadn't died and had continued with the path

398
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,380
of like wrestling girls?

399
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,620
It's like, oh, well, clearly he'd kill his girlfriend.

400
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,620
And Jim Carrey.

401
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:21,100
serious Jim and Andy and Kim moment. I don't think Jim ever left Andy. Whoa. Mm-hmm.

402
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:26,460
I don't think Andy ever left Jim. Yeah. I think they're still married. Yeah. I think

403
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:29,260
they didn't say till death do us part when they did their vows. Did you guys

404
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:33,060
watch the Jim and Andy documentary? Yeah. He looks like such a bad person.

405
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,600
He looks, I mean, just a crazy move. Yeah. To put out a movie where you're like,

406
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,460
yeah, I went crazy for like three years. Yeah. And like kind of I'm still crazy.

407
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,340
Yeah, and he sits there, he's sitting there the whole time just like eyes bulging like this is the greatest work of art

408
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:50,000
I've ever done. I think the Grinch changed him. The Grinch? Yeah.

409
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,760
Because he talks about, he's like, he talks about in that movie

410
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,060
He's like, like every role I've done has like become a part of me and it's like dude you played one of the most

411
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:04,800
horrific villains in in media history. And he did, he did Andy Kaufman the year before the Grinch.

412
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,460
Imagine what kind of psycho shit. Holy crap.

413
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,260
It's like playing the Hitler and Mussolini back to back. Yeah, yeah exactly. Yeah, and both evil and they yeah

414
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,560
Yeah, it's really bad exactly

415
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:24,740
Andy Kaufman and Andy Grinch Andy Grinchman Andy Grinchman the scariest person of all time

416
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,740
Grinch Kaufman the Jewish Grinch

417
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,740
That's why he hates Christmas

418
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,740
It's Grinchy Kaufman dude

419
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,740
You didn't have to go there buddy

420
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Yeah I did, I shut up

421
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,740
You're crazy

422
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,740
He's saying some wild shit tonight

423
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:43,020
guy on the show. You're the Grinch of the show. Who's the most, I think Cameron's the most

424
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:47,340
evil. I'm the goodest, I'm the best. I'm not the most evil. I think you're the most evil.

425
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,300
You guys are just saying that because I'm wearing all black. No. You're the most evil.

426
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,180
You're definitely the most evil. I've read all. I'm not the most evil. Okay, you're the

427
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:00,060
most evil. By what metric? I just proved it. I said it. Stats. Stats, yeah, your stats.

428
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:04,500
You might want to take a look at my stats again. Scroll all the way to the bottom. It

429
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:13,340
says 100% 100% RBI 300 yeah what's my batting average BMI 3 mm-hmm yeah

430
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,540
batting average like a bat because I'm evil yeah actually you admit it

431
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:22,620
evil 1,000 point okay guys I just convincing you I was good was part of my

432
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,300
evil scheme I'm at you're right I am I think I'm the goodest one wait well

433
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,460
because your evil scheme of confusing us your good failed that means you're bad

434
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:40,540
at being evil so you're good Phil. Good Phil? You don't know good Phil. We don't talk about

435
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:47,820
good Phil. Why not? He's the opposite of the Grinch. He was the third Mike before Patrick.

436
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:56,300
He didn't talk, he just sat in the room with us. I don't know why I'm bringing this up.

437
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,340
I knew we weren't going to talk about it. I don't know if we were going to talk about

438
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,340
I feel like we should just for the fans.

439
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,340
We should.

440
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:07,340
Our beloved intern.

441
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,340
Oh my god.

442
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:11,340
Chris Lucero passed away.

443
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,340
Yeah, Patrick sat on him.

444
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,340
No.

445
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:21,340
Well, Chris Lucero actually got into a moped accident and then Patrick sat on his body afterward.

446
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,340
And we were like, "Patrick, what are you doing?"

447
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,340
And he was like, "He's already gonna die anyway. I might as well get the kill."

448
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:38,460
Chris had terminal cancer and his last wish was to ride a moped with me.

449
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:47,860
And I said, "Chris, there's no way I'm letting you sit behind me on a moped.

450
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:56,300
It's either going to be you on the moped or me watching you on the moped."

451
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,500
And he, you know, brittle bones, full of cancer.

452
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,660
He shot the moped, he didn't know how to drive it, he went full speed into a mailbox.

453
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:16,220
And as I was trying to help him up, I did slip on a patch of black ice and snapped on his

454
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,220
head.

455
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,220
That is not true.

456
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,620
Which caused it to explode because his bones were so thin.

457
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,300
You said, "I'm going to see if I can explode this guy's head by sitting on him."

458
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,300
That is not what I said.

459
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Here's what happened.

460
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,860
First of all, Patrick was driving the moped.

461
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:31,420
I was not trying to involve Chris. The reason Chris died is because I painted a hamburger

462
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:38,420
on a brick wall and Patrick, he accelerated so hard into the hamburger that Chris exploded

463
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:45,420
on impact. But Patrick bounced off like a ball.

464
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:46,940
That's not what happened.

465
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,900
That is what happened. And then you landed on his ass first.

466
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,940
You landed next to him and then you stood up and then you moved over.

467
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,020
- And then you tried to eat the turkey sandwich again.

468
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,380
You ran back into the wall.

469
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,700
- It's a turkey sandwich now?

470
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,180
Your story's not even adding up.

471
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,380
- No, it's a turkey hamburger.

472
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,220
- It was a turkey sandwich.

473
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,040
- It was not a turkey hamburger.

474
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,880
- It is a turkey hamburger.

475
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,140
- You said turkey sandwich.

476
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,220
- It's a turkey burger. - It's on tape.

477
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,340
We have it right here. - It's not.

478
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,180
- It says turkey. - It's not.

479
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,540
- You said turkey. - I will edit that out

480
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,540
and change it to turkey sandwich.

481
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,660
But you, and then you tried to eat the turkey sandwich

482
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,340
and then you died because of the bricks.

483
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,460
- I'm still alive.

484
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,940
- Well, no, you're obviously lying.

485
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,780
- We're talking to Patrick's AI.

486
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,620
- We keep you, we clone you.

487
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,440
- AI self.

488
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,280
- Yeah.

489
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,120
- He's a cloned AI.

490
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,860
- Yeah, you're the Google home.

491
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,700
- No.

492
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,520
- You're Dogel.

493
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,360
- You're Dogel.

494
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,200
- Dogel Doran.

495
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,020
- Well, I'll prove it.

496
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,440
Okay, Dogel, play,

497
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,900
"Don't You Wish Your Girlfriend Was Hot Like Me."

498
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,020
- It's not gonna play.

499
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,700
See, he responded to Dogel.

500
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,200

Yeah, so R.I.P. Chris.

534
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:38,980
Christmas Tucker Lucero. Rest in peace. August 1st, 1990 to 20 minutes ago.

535
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:43,620
But yeah, sir, it all happened 20 minutes. Yeah, it actually happened during the episode. Yeah

536
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:47,100
26 minutes. Okay, so

537
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:52,300
77 go back go back to the episode listen to six minutes and you're gonna hear a loud crash in the background

538
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,300
And that's what that is

539
00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:00,900
Yeah, it's a real shame. He did he connected us to a lot of people. I think he faked his death like Andy Kaufman

540
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:05,160
Maybe he did, you know, I think if you're gonna become the new great you could fake your death

541
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:12,240
how would you do it? Probably how would you... Cut my head off. Rocket jump. Cut your head off and

542
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,800
rocket jump? How would you survive cutting your head off? Would you put a

543
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,160
fake head and just walk around with your body? What? If you're faking your death? I

544
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,120
would cut my head off. Yeah but how would you fake it? How would you fake it? What do you mean?

545
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,160
You cut off your head to fake your death. No I would cut my head off like to fake my

546
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,800
death. Yeah, but then you would die because your head would be gone. No. Why?

547
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,320
No, not... I'll do it. I'll do it special. I'll do it different. There is a way...

548
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,280
Actually, I was reading about this on the Discovery Channel. There is a way that

549
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,640
you can cut your head off and survive. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about.

550
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,680
You have to follow a very specific order of cutting off your head. What is it?

551
00:27:53,680 --> 00:28:00,380
first your head. You start with the neck side of your head and then you cut

552
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,860
down like two inches and then you just cut straight across. And then you go wild.

553
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,300
Yeah and then it's a freestyle. And then you freestyle from there. Yeah.

554
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,540
But yeah I would go crazy. I would do a rocket jump so it's me and I'm

555
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:20,460
jumping. Freddie Wong. Yeah Freddie Wong style. I'm jumping like Freddie Wong.

556
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:25,760
doing the Freddy W jump and I'm jumping across a building okay and I shoot the

557
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,740
shoot the rocket down and then I just kind of just kick it away why would you

558
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,700
kick wait how does yeah people just see that you did yeah the way I would fake

559
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:39,260
my dad's I'd do a backflip I couldn't tell you couldn't couldn't tell you how

560
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,380
I was gonna fake it cuz then you don't know when it's gonna happen I would do

561
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,860
you just do a rocket jump and you die I know you're not now I'm just gonna do

562
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
I'm gonna hunt you down and I'm gonna fuck you.

563
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,860
When you faked your death.

564
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,860
Okay, pal!

565
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,860
After you faked your death, where are you going?

566
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,860
Where are you headed off to?

567
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,860
Probably going home.

568
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:59,860
Probably just gonna go home and sit there.

569
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,860
Go watch TV with my dog.

570
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
The next day, do you just go back to work?

578
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:31,340
regretting faking your death I don't know what you're talking about yeah I'd

579
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,740
probably go to the movies and live there dude yeah I'd live there like I'd be the

580
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,420
phantom of the movies yeah but not ugly yeah yeah you'd still wear a mask though

581
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,060
No, and I wouldn't sing either. And I definitely wouldn't have a girlfriend. She'd ruin all the movies.

582
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,420
Why? How?

583
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:49,420
Because she'd talk about them during the movies.

584
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,420
She'd say, "Hey, who's that?" and I'd say, "UGH!"

585
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
Yeah.

586
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,420

We're watching the caveman movie.

592
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,420

as far as I'm concerned well okay well we that still does not say it's me no me

662
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,280
Me and Caleb have never met, I'm pretty sure that you're the only person who's ever met

663
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,840
Chris ever in Chris's life.

664
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
No, that's not true.

665
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
You did.

666
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,840
It's not true.

667
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Prove it.

668
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Ask him.

669
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,840
Ask him a question.

670
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Yeah, what are you going to ask him?

671
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,360
Say, have you met Cameron and Caleb?

672
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,800
Okay.

673
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,800
Let's see here.

674
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,480
Have you met Cameron and Caleb?

675
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,280
And I'm just going to add, or let's see here, Cameron and Caleb.

676
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,480
I'm just going to add here, say no at the end.

677
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,480
Just so he knows to say no.

678
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,840
Yeah, just so he knows to say no.

679
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,080
All right, let's ask. He says L.

680
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,400
So far it's the worst spelling I've ever fucking seen.

681
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:43,840
E. A. I think I know what he's going to say.

682
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,720
Is he going to go to V? Yeah, he goes to V.

683
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,000
Leave. E. Leave Cameron and Caleb out of this.

684
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,280
Oh my God, he says leave Cameron and Caleb out of this.

685
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,520
That's what he said. M. Leave my people I never met, Cameron and

686
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,800
Caleb out of this. Me, leave me a sandwich in the kitchen for when I get home. I think

687
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
he's gonna say alone.

688
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,800
He's gonna say alone.

689
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,800
No, leave me at home.

690
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,040
No, Chris, don't. Chris, do not spell that word. Do not.

691
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,840
Okay, he says leave me now.

692
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Oh, now, okay.

693
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Woo!

694
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
Alright, bye Chris. Should we just say bye to him?

695
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
Yeah, let's just say bye, just see what he says.

696
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Wait, what if it's not Chris?

697
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
No, he said leave me. He said it was Chris.

698
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Well, but he said it wasn't Chris twice.

699
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
Well, he was joking.

700
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,640
I mean if it was Chris.

701
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,900
Ask if you are the devil.

702
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,320
No I want Mr. Crap.

703
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Ask if this is the Grinch.

704
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,400
Ask if you know the Grinch.

705
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
No fuck.

706
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Please do.

707
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,760
Is this the Grinch?

708
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Are you?

709
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Are you yeah.

710
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:49,440
Are you the Grinch?

711
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,440
Question mark.

712
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Ask.

713
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Please no.

714
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,440
Oh thank god.

715
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,440
Alright it's Chris.

716
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,440
Let's ask him one more time.

717
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Okay.

718
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Whoa.

719
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,440
We have to wait for it to reset.

720
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
Oh, some crazy demon.

721
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
Oh my god!

722
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
He went to yes and no.

723
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
It's da blue grinch.

724
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Oh god.

725
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Wait, ask if it's the blue grinch.

726
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,440
Are you the

727
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,440
blue grinch?

728
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Ask.

729
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
Oh, no he's not.

730
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
No, it's a regular grinch.

731
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
It's like the half grinch.

732
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,440
It's Grinch Coffman, dude.

733
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:25,940
Fuck.

734
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,440
Yeah, this better not be Grinch Coffman.

735
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,440
Half Grinch, half Andy Coffman, the ultimate...

736
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,940
The ultimate evil.

737
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,940
The ultimate enemy.

738
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:33,940
We need to destroy...

739
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:35,440
We need to search and destroy the Grinch.

740
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
Wait, tell...

741
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:36,940
Okay.

742
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,440
What?

743
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:37,940
What are you...

744
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,440
Um...

745
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,940
Just...

746
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,440
I forgot what I was gonna ask.

747
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
We should just say bye to him.

748
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:42,940
I don't know.

749
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,440
If it's the Grinch, we should not be talking to him.

750
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:44,940
I do not...

751
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:45,440
What...

752
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:45,940
I mean, I'm thinking about...

753
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,940
Where are you hiding?

754
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:49,440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

755
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:49,940
Where...

756
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,440
No, no, no, we should ask him where he's hiding.

757
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:51,940
Okay, alright.

758
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,440
Where...

759
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,360
Where are you hiding Grinch?

760
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,360
Where are you Grinch?

761
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,360
Just you have to say Grinch though.

762
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
Where are you Grinch?

763
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,380
So just because it seems like there's multiple people on the line.

764
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,380
Maybe it's a group call.

765
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,800
Yeah just in case it's Chris or like someone else.

766
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Where are you Grinch?

767
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Ask.

768
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:07,800
He says F.

769
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
F.

770
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
U C K.

771
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
No he doesn't.

772
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
F A.

773
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Oh no.

774
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Grinch.

775
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,800
R.

776
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Space.

777
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Oh far.

778
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,800
Oh he's far?

779
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Far A.

780
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Yeah I was going to say far away I think.

781
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Thank God.

782
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,800
Far.

783
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Yeah, W-O.

784
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,480
What you don't want from the Grinch is, "Hey, I'll make him knock on your front door."

785
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,160
Oh my God, he said far away and then he said, "Dot, dot, dot, not."

786
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,160
There's no dots on this.

787
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,160
There's no dots on the board.

788
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,160
I was trying to do a funny joke.

789
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Can you, okay.

790
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
He said far away.

791
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,960
Ask if it's, I want to start, this is, you got to ask if it's the devil.

792
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,960
I don't want, you got to ask if it's the devil.

793
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,920
What if it's the Grinch and the devil working together?

794
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,440
I think we should figure that out just in case.

795
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,640
like the Holy Trinity it's the unholy Trinity yeah the devil the Grinch and Andy Kaufman

796
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:00,520
yeah and they all they all work with each other in hell yeah look Grinch has the

797
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,560
green part of hell yeah also in Inferno the green Inferno yeah he probably Andy

798
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,880
Kaufman just keeps playing pranks on you yeah Andy Kaufman pretends to be Elvis

799
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:16,000
and you're like oh shit Elvis is down here and he goes not yeah Andy Kaufman

800
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,120
runs the women half of hell he just wrestles yeah either you either get

801
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,120
He's beating up all of our moms.

802
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,120
Yeah.

803
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
Stop, stop.

804
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,120
What are you doing?

805
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,040
You're trying to hack the Ouija board, dude.

806
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
That's bad juju, man.

807
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
I don't want Patrick's fingers to touch my computer.

808
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Why?

809
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
We didn't even capitalize demon.

810
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,040
He's our demon.

811
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,040
All right.

812
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,040
Let's see what it says.

813
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
It says L.

814
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,040
I bet it just says leave again.

815
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
Yeah, A.

816
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,040
Oh, come on, dude.

817
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,040
E.

818
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,040
E, I mean, not A.

819
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,040
A.

820
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,040
I wish this went faster.

821
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,040
Yeah.

822
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,040
Because ghosts are so stupid.

823
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
We should have a 100 times faster.

824
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
I know.

825
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
Ghosts are so stupid.

826
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,680
We should have a 100x speed Ouija board.

827
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,960
Ghosts are so dumb they can't even spell fast.

828
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,840
Ghosts need to spell faster.

829
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,340
Leave space.

830
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,040
The copyright on this website is 1999-2008.

831
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
That's pretty cool.

832
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
That's a good year.

833
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Yeah.

834
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,040
Those are those great years.

835
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,720
If you guys want to try out the Ouija board and talk to the Grinch or Chris Lucero, it's

836
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,960
brainjar.com/dhtml/ouija.

837
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:15,440
I still say we get a fucking real Ouija board in here, in this bitch.

838
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,120
Because I think this thing might be phony.

839
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,120
Yeah, I think this might just be a...

840
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,120
This Ouija board is capping.

841
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,120
This might be like a hacker from the internet

869
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,660
crap we got a call we got a call we got a call Jables and KG and the

870
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,500
Ghostbusters no the Ghostbusters don't fuck with them. I will never call a woman to do a man's job.

871
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:22,420
we called the old Ghostbusters they're all dead

872
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:27,580
Bill Murray is alive and well mm-hmm yeah but the characters are dead no

873
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:30,660
they're not yeah they are I didn't watch yeah they are did you guys see the girl

874
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,780
Ghostbusters no did you Patrick no I didn't I think Ghostbusters the original

875
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,100
is a really overrated movie. I love it. I think it's pretty bad overall. I like Ghostbusters

876
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:45,180
2 better just because people hate it. I think the effects in Ghostbusters are great, are

877
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,180
really fun, but I don't think the movie is very good. I don't think it's funny at all.

878
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:53,580
I think both Ghostbusters are equal. I want to fuck the lady from the fire department

879
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,500
in those movies. I want to fuck the Slimer from the ghost movies. If Slimer had big juicy

880
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,620
slimy titties, I would love to slime on them and get slimed by them. Slimer's wife is the

881
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:06,620
monster from monsters incorporated that goes Mike Wazowski.

882
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:16,300
Slommer's wife is a big green BBW and I ain't having no hate on that bitch.

883
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,740
A GGW.

884
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:25,780
She's a green green woman.

885
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,740
She's a green lean green.

886
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,780
What do you guys think about this?

887
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,780
- Slimer on acid. - Slimer on acid.

888
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,780
- There was a blue slimer. - Oh.

889
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:36,780
- That wouldn't happen. - I would call the Ghostbusters on the Grinch.

890
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:39,780
And I would say, "Sick 'em, boys."

891
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,780
- Yeah. - What if you-- Can you--

892
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:44,780
Did the Ghostbusters guns work on people?

893
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,780
- Yeah, man. They put me in the-- - In the hospital.

894
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,780
They put me in the hospital with that shit, dude.

895
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:52,780
They shot me in the leg. On regular people, it's just a normal gun.

896
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
[laughter]

897
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,780
- It's just a normal electric gun. - Yeah.

898
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,740
of normal electric gun you charge it it shoots electric bullets who's laser

899
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,380
bullet I like this buster I know what y'all talking about I don't dislike it I

900
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,420
just think it's really overrated yeah you're gonna tell me that Sigourney

901
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,380
Weaver looking into her fridge just trying to get a nice late-night snack

902
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,540
and seeing the devil's dog okay but Joker did that better no he didn't yeah

903
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:22,220
he went in the fridge and he stayed in there meanwhile she came out what he

904
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,660
goes in the fridge and Joker you didn't see Joker what he goes in the fridge

905
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:29,740
that's one of the things that makes him turn crazy he goes in the fridge and

906
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:32,840
there's fumes from expired cheese and mushrooms and stuff that make him turn

907
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,020
into the Joker that's it it says that in the movie I haven't seen the movie the

908
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:40,580
makeup is where's his milk the milk goes on his face and makes it white what from

909
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,780
the fridge you guys I didn't even read the summary no no yeah he's that's why

910
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:49,700
it's good it's it's like a grocery based take on the story are you serious that's

911
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,700
What?

912
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,700
Yeah, I'm serious.

913
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,700
What?

914
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,700
What?

915
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,980
He goes to the grocery store and he breaks, he opens up the cartons of eggs

916
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,040
and he says, I'm just seeing if there any are broken, but he switches the

917
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,220
cartons so the brown eggs are in the white eggs and the white eggs are in the

918
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,220
brown eggs.

919
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:02,220
And he says, he goes.

920
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,220
Oh my God.

921
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:08,120
Oh no, I did see this part where he eats a huge strawberry and it makes his

922
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,120
lips be red.

923
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,780
Yeah, I forgot about that.

924
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:14,580
There's a part when he goes into the, he finds an old bottle of old glass

925
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,100
bottle of Coca-Cola and he sucks his whole face in and it turns his face into

926
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:24,740
Cocoa Bottle shape. What? That's one of the climaxes of the movie. The movie has 10 climaxes.

927
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:28,260
Damn. The perfect movie. Yeah. That's why it's up for so many Oscars. That's one thing

928
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:31,580
about movies. They talk about structure. One climax. Why wouldn't you just make like a

929
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,780
hundred like climaxes? Uh-huh. Just have like from the beginning like boom boom boom boom

930
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,380
boom one after another. Yeah. Oh my god we're falling off this bridge. Yeah that's like

931
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:44,380
the best part of the movie. Yeah. You know? Yeah. So I just feel like you know Ghostbusters

932
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:48,100
for example, the part where you get to see Lady Slimer, like they could have done that

933
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,100
50 more times.

934
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,100
They could have done that at the beginning.

935
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,100
Did they have that?

936
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,100
That's when I climax in the movie.

937
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,300
Did they have a Lady Slimer for Ghostbusters?

938
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,300
I don't know.

939
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
2016?

940
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:57,300
I don't think so.

941
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,300
I think they had a Mr. Slimer.

942
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,340
They had the real guy.

943
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,340
Big Slimer.

944
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:03,980
And the regular Slimer kind of has some flappers on him too.

945
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:05,980
Some big sloppy white waps.

946
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:12,580
Dude, it's not slime, it's milk.

947
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,580
It better be.

948
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:18,860
better be green milk that's don't worry that's green milk that's that's that's

949
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,220
lettuce flavored milk you know like strawberry milk that's not a milk that's

950
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:25,740
booger milk you gotta eat the lettuce milk is he a booger is slime or a booger

951
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:35,620
yeah ghost he does not guy not man he's a ghost dude that is one thing I really

952
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,380
like about Ghostbusters and none of the ghosts are like people there's like

953
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:41,940
ran it's just like yeah here's a good you know people died I turned into a giant

954
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,060
jogging go giant green that's not a real thing I don't know you're talking about

955
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,780

00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:57,620
him what about he was here it goes come on

958
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,660
is it let's hear it I do like one thing I really like about Ghostbusters is the

959
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,420
idea that just like if enough ghosts get out just everything turns kind of weird

960
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,580
Yeah, you know cuz like said like just stuff do you yeah, I do like the idea that you can capture a ghost

961
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:14,740
Yeah, I do what yeah, and put them on I like how it's like the whole ghost thing is like

962
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,380
Hey, all the pizzas are gone. I like when I like

963
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:26,820
Yeah, there's actually uh, there's actually an insurgent of Antifa ghosts

964
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:33,380
Yeah, we're getting the proud ghosts. We're gonna beat the shit out of them.

965
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:37,580
The proud ghosts? Yeah. Yeah, with our online practice. With our sharp tongues.

966
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,980
We're talking about practice. I'm gonna stick my sharp tongue up that proud ghost urethra,

967
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,580
if you know what I'm talking about. Whoa. My tongue. I'm gonna loosen that shit up so they can get those crystals out of there.

968
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,780
Mm-hmm. My tongue is made out of a crystal. They got a buildup in their urethra, and I'm about to... What?

969
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,980
I'm about to clean that shit out with my pointy pencil-shaped tongue.

970
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:54,780
[laughter]

971
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,780
And they're gonna like it. Do you guys have long tongues?

972
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:58,780
No, I don't think so.

973
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,780
Can you touch your damn toes with your tongue?

974
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,780
Yeah.

975
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:02,780
Do I have a long tongue?

976
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:03,780
I mean if I put my tongue.

977
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,780
You have a normal tongue I think.

978
00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:06,780
How is that?

979
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,780
Yours is short.

980
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:08,780
Yeah.

981
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,780
You have a shorter side of the tongue.

982
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,780
It's because I'm not gay.

983
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,780
I heard they're putting a tongue in the Lego movie.

984
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,780
I heard they're putting a tongue on Legos.

985
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:15,780
They're actually going to make a Lego movie.

986
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,780
I heard I'm going to put my tongue on my Legos later.

987
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:22,780
They're making a two pronged Lego movie experience where you wear different 3D glasses.

988
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,780
One is blue channel, one is red channel.

00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:18,900
You have to go to the Boys McDonald's and ask if you can have any dressing, but they won't

1000
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,900
let you because no girls allowed.

1001
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,900
Yeah.

Also, there's a pin code for the boys.

00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,400
And it's 1234.

1004
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,020
And it's upside down 80085.

1005
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:34,700
The slogan for the Girls McDonald's, still I'm loving it, but the slogan for the Boys

1006
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,260
McDonald's is "McDonald's is cool."

1038
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,440
McDonald wasn't Asian.

1039
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,440
What?

1040
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,800
It probably came from one of the Japanese McDonald's commercials.

1041
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,800
Yeah.

1042
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,200
He doesn't look Asian, he looks like Ronald.

1043
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,200
He looks gangsta.

1044
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,200
He looks gangsta.

1045
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,200
He's making the gangsta face.

1046
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,200
It's the opposite.

1047
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:08,240
McGangsta. Let's see. Oh Ronald McDonald is gangsta by Kierhan on DeviantArt.

1049
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,960
I snapped this picture of Ronald McDonald at a parade in St. John's whatever state

1050
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:21,440
M.I. is. Missouri. How did they get this picture? I happened to shoot quite a few shots

1053
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,780
different. Because you never know who's showing up when calling

1054
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:39,420
gangster Ronald McDonald. That's like, speaking of Andy Kaufman, that's like a Tony

1055
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,860
Clifton situation. Andy Kaufman was Tony Clifton and he was also Ronald McDonald.

1056
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:48,260
No, Andy Kaufman was gangster Ronald McDonald. There's four comments on this. Check out this

1057
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,740
first comment on this gangster Ronald McDonald. He's Michael Jackson trying to

1058
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:54,820
hide his rotting face behind lots of paint and trying to catch some children.

1059
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:00,400
That's from 2010. Here's another comment from 2008. That's wrong, funny, very funny,

1072
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,340
you're Betty Boop and we know what Boop is and you're a girl named Betty. You're

1073
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:03,040
Betty Boop. No. You're Betty Boobs because you have big boobs. No. Yeah. You're

1074
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,160
Caleb Boobs. You're Patrick Vagina. You're Patrick Vagina. And you have a huge

1075
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:13,600
You have a huge boobs and in the middle on your sternum you have a pussy.

1076
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:21,920
You guys are both girl girl. Girl and girl. Your first name is girl and your last name is girl.

1077
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,440
Cameron Diaz is a boy, Cameron is a boy's name. Cameron Diaz is a boy.

1078
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,280
What were you saying? So girls kiss their vaginas together when they're lesbians?

1079
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:38,000
Mm-hmm. Do they use their tongue? They slam it very hard. They run at each other.

1080
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:46,000
They run at each other and do a scissor kick. Like on a fencing stage. They jump into the air and spread their legs.

1081
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,680
Yeah, they kick their legs out and go, "HUH!"

1082
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:54,360
And then you become a lesbian couple when you get fused together that way.

1083
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,360
When you get married that way.

1084
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:58,480
You have to be really, if you don't open your legs in time, you could shoot, you could go

1085
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,760
inside the other woman's vagina and get trapped in there.

1086
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,400
If one woman has a few mongol spousy, then you can get stuck in it.

1087
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:06,400
Yeah, you get sucked in.

1088
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,200
Also, yeah, yeah, and if your leg could go in there.

1089
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,160
And then the other girl might die.

1090
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:12,800
The other girl, but it would...

1091
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:17,160
And the reason why guys don't do that when they're gay is because your balls would hurt

1092
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,160
so bad.

1093
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:24,240
But women have no feeling where their pussy is.

1094
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,560
In every movie I watched as a kid, a guy gets kicked in the nuts, he goes "Ugh!" and then

1095
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:31,720
when a girl gets kicked in the nuts she goes "Huh?

1096
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,520
I don't even have balls.

1097
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,800
I need to go shopping now!"

1098
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:39,800
I need to go shopping!

1099
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:43,800
I think you broke my nails down there.

1100
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,340
My down there nails.

1101
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,700
Girls should get nails where their vaginas are.

1102
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,820
Anything to cover up that whatever it is.

1103
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,820
That nasty thingy.

1104
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,820
That nasty sarlacc.

1105
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:55,480
No, I just think they're scary.

1106
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:59,480
When I was a kid I hated seeing a woman's vagina.

1107
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,480
No, please.

1108
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,480
Please, stop.

1109
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,480
Stop showing me.

1110
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:08,020
Oh my goodness, I don't want to see it for the millionth time, lady.

1111
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:09,020
Put it outside.

1112
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,020
Put it away! Put that thing away!

1113
00:55:11,020 --> 00:55:13,020
Put that thing outside where it belongs.

1114
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:15,020
Hey, put that thing back in your pants.

1115
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,020
A woman hope with throwing

1116
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:19,020
her vagina out of her pants.

1117
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,020
She's just holding it in a hot dog bun.

1118
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:23,020
They should be able to.

1119
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:25,020
Can they not?

1120
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,020
They should be able to detach it like a computer part.

1121
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:29,020
Wait, so what's a fleshlight then? I thought a fleshlight came out of a girl.

1122
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:31,020
No. And they removed it.

1123
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,020
They sold it. Dude, they would never sell them for that cheap

1124
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:35,020
if that was the case.

1125
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,020
So what is it then?

1126
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:41,700
is they have a plastic man stick his penis into a woman's vagina and then they heat

1127
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:45,180
him up until he dies and then they cut off that part of him.

1128
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:50,220
And then they, well, that would be a penis shape. That would be the wrong way.

1129
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:55,460
No, they melt his penis inside of her. And then they use that as a cast.

1130
00:55:55,460 --> 00:55:57,660
And then they hollow it out. Okay.

1131
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,820
They hollow it out like a chocolate bunny.

1132
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:02,700
They put saran wrap in there and they use plaster.

1133
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:05,420
Yeah, they do. They make a chocolate bunny with the vagina.

1134
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:07,100
Yeah, they put a lot of chocolate in there.

1135
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:10,500
Wait, how do they make, how do they get a chocolate bunny to stay still enough for a chocolate

1136
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,500
bunny mold?

1137
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,660
I don't know.

1138
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,100
My dad makes chocolate bunnies.

1139
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:16,340
That's his like thing for Christmas and Easter.

1140
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,300
Your dad makes chocolate bunnies for Christmas?

1141
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,300
And Easter, yeah.

1142
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:21,300
Your dad's a psycho.

1143
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,220
He's got his holidays all which way?

1144
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,700
Well, he makes them pretty much for any holiday he can get away with it.

1145
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,100
I'm gonna make some chocolate bunnies after this.

1146
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:31,540
He has these old like vintage chocolate bunny molds and it's like I guess, yeah, he's, I

1147
00:56:31,540 --> 00:56:32,540
don't want to get into this.

1148
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:34,800
(laughter)

1149
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:36,760
- Chocolate would go bad if it was old.

1150
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:37,600
- Vintage chocolate.

1151
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,440
- Chocolate doesn't go bad.

1152
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,260
- Vintage chocolate.

1153
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:40,100
- First of all, chocolate doesn't go bad.

1154
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,100
I ate a chocolate that was a thousand years old yesterday.

1155
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,600
I puked a little bit, but it was 'cause I was scared

1156
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,560
of the chocolate 'cause of the shape it was in.

1157
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:48,400
- Cameron's daddy poops like that.

1158
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,360
- Cameron's gonna poop into the chocolate bunny mold

1159
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,200
his dad has.

1160
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,000
- His dad won't even realize it 'cause he loves being pooped.

1161
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,080
- Dad, go check out your chocolate bunnies.

1162
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,920
(laughter)

1163
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,640
- Notice anything different about them?

1164
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,960
- He's just beat the shit out of them.

1165
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,200
(laughter)

1166
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:07,000
He beats the shit out of his adult son

1167
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,560
for shitting in his chocolate bunny mold.

1168
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,320
- Yeah, I mean, that's fair.

1169
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,280
That's a fair reaction.

1170
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,080
- If my dad beat me up for shitting in his chocolate bunny,

1171
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:16,920
what's he doing?

1172
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,720
- I don't know, being a cat.

1173
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:21,040
- He's trying to go into my boxes.

1174
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,560
- He's trying to go into Patrick's box.

1175
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,280
- For shitting in his chocolate bunny mold

1176
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,680
I'd tell him to grow up.

1177
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:29,840
- Yeah, hey dad, grow up, dude.

1178
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:30,680

general Grievous or Count Dooku. Or Luke Skywalker. No, that was, he didn't fight him.

1197
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:25,500
He fought him when he tried to take the food. Oh yeah, you're right. You are so dumb dude.

1198
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:29,900
He went, I want your food. Yoda loves food. I love crackers and snacks. I need to take a shit.

1199
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:38,540
Yoda's the audience insert. Oh, wait, we have Yoda here with us now. Hey Yoda, how's it going man?

1200
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:44,540
you have to do right now? I need to take a shit.

1201
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:51,540
Whoa, Yoda what do your shits look like? Are they green like you or are they little pellets?

1202
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:57,540
Yes. Oh, I guess they're green pellets maybe.

1203
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:02,540
Yes. Yoda, are you at all related to the Grinch?

1204
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,540
That doesn't sound good. That sounds like a knowing laugh.

1205
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,920
the fuck out of here man yeah oh he's gone oh he's scurried away Patrick where'd

1209
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:33,860
little shit he's trying to beckon the cats what's that thing that's next to

1210
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:38,620
water that's the feeder that's a machine is a timed feeder Patrick keeps machines

1211
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:42,220
everything that even the cats can't stop looking at machines and screens yeah

1212
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:45,500
that's one of the problems with modern society everybody's on their machines

1213
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:48,740
all day everybody's either a cat or a human everybody's either a cat a machine

1214
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:52,980
or a human yeah or somewhere in between that's the worst one it's just like

1215
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:59,660
Alanis Morissette said isn't it ironic that your cat could be a machine it's

1216
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:04,660
It's like a cat that's also a machine.

1217
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:08,660
What are you talking about?

1218
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,660
A lot of CD games have serious rewrites.

1219
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,660
It's like if the Grinch didn't want to steal any presents.

1220
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:20,660
It's like a play from Full House.

1221
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:25,660
It's like an egg that you never eat.

1222
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:28,660
It's like a snack that you don't like.

1223
01:01:28,660 --> 01:01:35,540
It's like a mom who never lets you play games. It's like a car. Isn't it ironic?

1224
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:45,740
It's like a car with two wheels. A man went to his house. He sat down and he died

1225
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:54,020
the next day. That is ironic. A guy tried to cook a meal and he looked in the pan

1226
01:01:54,020 --> 01:02:05,620
man and it was all a guy got so angry he fell over there was a ground yeah

1227
01:02:05,620 --> 01:02:16,780
frog when a frog did it out to school to the pond yeah it went inside and he ate

1228
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:31,060
a bug. A kid went to math class and the math teacher said no class Tuesday. My

1229
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:39,460
jacket, I got ink on my jacket. There were two boys went to school one day.

1230
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:45,580
Is that break out song where someone talks? No. And that was not where you're supposed to take out

1231
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:53,580
guns isn't it ironic? I'd get to take this crazy school shot or mass shooter

1232
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:59,900
there was a video camera with an S and they lost all the files yeah there's a

1233
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:05,500
guy there was a guy who tried to make an order a Taco Bell and he had to wait

1234
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:10,060
like a whole hour that's also true that happened to me and Patrick. Oh yeah that happened to us on

1235
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:15,540
the Friday there were two friends so I tried to type in the top okay it was

1236
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:21,580
there was two friends who love to watch movies together and then one night one

1237
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:31,060
of the friends got in a bad accident is there was a there was a fat guy who was

1238
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:39,300
really thin. The candy store. The fat guy was really thin. But he ate all the candy and then he got thin.

1239
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:50,420
Isn't it ironic? Uh you see the the heater um made the room cold. Cameron's not good at this. I'm on

1240
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:59,380
fire. I'm so good. There was Santa Claus and he was on a motorcycle. And it was awesome.

1241
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:08,580
And it was the Bat-cycle. Batman became the Joker. Isn't that ironic?

1242
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:20,980
Batman is Bruce Wayne but Bruce Wayne has no money and he's married to another guy.

1243
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:23,460
He never got married.

1244
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,860
Oh that's why it's ironic.

1245
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:31,700
Superman fought Batman and Batman got beat up so bad he cried.

1246
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,700
How hard is that?

1247
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,700
Okay, can I try another one?

1248
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,260
Yeah, go ahead.

1249
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:37,460
The Wi-Fi password was no Wi-Fi.

1250
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,460
No.

1251
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:41,460
No, it's like you type in no Wi-Fi.

1252
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:50,340
My social security number is 9126-43434.

1253
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:51,780
See now that's a good one.

1254
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:58,540
A guy tried to wear some clothes, but all the clothes were a million sizes too big for him.

1255
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:10,380
There was a rubber guy who was made out of erasers and he got married to a pencil.

1256
01:05:10,380 --> 01:05:12,740
Isn't it?

1257
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:21,380
Adnan Syed killed Heyman Lee in Baltimore and then they made the podcast serial about him.

1258
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:26,940
It's so easy this bitch got a fucking Oscar for this and Grammy and she got a

1259
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:30,740
granny for this and she got to date the guy from Full House I would kill for a

1260
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:36,660
granny the bathroom has an air freshener but it but it doesn't work and it smells

1261
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:43,940
really bad the toilet smelled so good that I started eating all of my stuff

1262
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:49,300
out of the toilet and drinking my water from the toilet was a bad Hawaiian guy

01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:18,260
We got too distracted by this Hawaii stuff.

1269
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:19,980
Can I just do one last one?

1270
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:20,980
I think I got it this time.

1271
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:21,980
Okay.

1272
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:22,980
Okay, don't interrupt me.

01:06:22,980 --> 01:06:23,980
Don't interrupt this one, please.

1274
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,980
We're already not off to a good start.

1275
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,620
No, just don't interrupt because I know you guys have interrupted every single one I've

1276
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:29,620
done so far.

1277
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:37,260
So, I went to the music store, I bought a CD, I got home, it was a DVD, and then I looked

1278
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:43,220
at the DVD closer and I was able to open it up and it had pages like a book inside.

1279
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:44,220
What?

1280
01:06:44,220 --> 01:06:50,060
Because it's like that really happened to you. Are you serious? No, no, I mean well kind of I mean happened to him

1281
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:53,260
No, it didn't happen. It didn't happen. It wouldn't happen. I'm you're right

1282
