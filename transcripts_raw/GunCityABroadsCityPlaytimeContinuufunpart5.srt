00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Last time on...

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Gun City, Abroad City, Playtime Continue Fun.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Seems Patrick Yoda ended up in a jam.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
He read the minds of the mindless mocs, keep calm and chive on,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
but found himself hung high by his own hubris.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Smashing an arcade machine with the hopes of repairing it.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
He was chased out of Gaddy Up by burly bar bouncers

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
who bemused tossed him right back in.

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,680
Before Yoda could start licking his wounds, Ms. Janet Blowjob sauntered into the saloon

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,240
with legs up to here.

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,520
Some say she took a shine to the puny pet, who managed to score both her digits and some

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,080
very, very nice uppies.

14
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,480
Meanwhile, Blowtoss and Rey were...

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,200
sticking their things in a dead snake that attacked them.

16
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Yep, we both did it.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Well, really it was just Blowtoss.

18
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
I didn't wait.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,200
I didn't wait.

20
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,200
No, no, no.

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,200
The narrator just said we both did it.

22
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:21,080
is

23
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,780
Its hulls are made of some kind of supernatural material.

24
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,280
This would be in line with a lot of other stories.

25
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,760
Um, oh this was, nevermind I gotta keep going.

26
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,000
Now they have to go see Ebenezer Keech, a scientist on the ship who once worked for Papi Chuko's

27
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,160
Techno Slime with Tool Lateralis, and now heads up the R&D division on Pleasure Palace.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,200
Doing a jerk off motion.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
As the sec-

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,400
Juvia's jerking off while he's producing this episode.

31
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
I saw it on his video screen.

32
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,400
He's jacking his shit.

33
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
He literally just jerked off in his hoodie.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,400
Stop!

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Stop it right now.

36
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Sit down.

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Sit down.

38
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,400
Don't stand up when you jerk off at your computer.

39
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
He's got the deep fakes.

40
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:08,400
He's got those deep fakes of us on his screen.

41
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
I would believe that.

42
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,600
When Blotas and Ray arrived at the command center to find Ebenezer Kish, they were greeted

43
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,280
by Gumby Superior, the man shepherding Pleasure Palace, and a war hero who fought in the Vampire

44
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,280
Wars.

45
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:29,040
And what he said was curious, saying that playtime might not even be real and is instead

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,480
a convenient scapegoat, both for the Empire and for the Undercity to avoid addressing

47
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,160
the real problems found in huge-ass facts criminal enterprise, and that the detective's

48
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,200
beloved son, New Sullivan, was actually kidnapped so that the detectives would be drawn into

49
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:47,740
an unsolvable case and then murdered.

50
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,320
And apparently he's sort of intimating that he may want to destroy the Undercity.

51
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:58,600
Anyway, Patrick Yoda, meanwhile, was on the other line, because he's just always on the

52
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,120
phone with them in every scene.

53
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,760
Yeah, I don't like that.

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,240
Sharing all the hot gas to Gumby, from Gumby to Baby Gag.

55
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
And that's short for Gossamer.

56
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,240
The material.

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:16,160
material. Yes, and he's now armed with some serious info to improve his station in the

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:22,680
Huge Ass Facts organization. Meanwhile, it's been about three hours since Playtime's last

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,200
murder. So, he's killed two members of the Royal Guard today, right? He slit the throat,

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,200
almost killing our friend, he's a very close friend of mine, whose name I always remember.

61
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,480
- O'Neal. - O'Neal, right.

62
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,580
O'Neal, who also was not a part of a childless couple.

63
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:47,200
And so now it's sort of approaching evening.

64
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,720
So a couple things I wanna make sure

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,440
before we keep going and finishing off with the speech

66
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,940
with Gumby Superior was giving you guys.

67
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,720
Blotas, you got a 20 on your insight roll.

68
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,440
And so to round off on what you had learned

69
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,720
that I kind of mentioned in the recap

70
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,640
is that Gumby definitely believes all the shit he's saying

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,320
about how the empire is wasting your time on this case

72
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,160
and that the actual issue is Hugh Jass Facts crime syndicate.

73
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,080
He believes that, you can kind of tell.

74
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,680
And that he's probably a fan of the empire

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,760
but has no great admiration for it.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:24,120
He's obviously using it as a stepping stone

77
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,760
for his own designs.

78
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,880
And then the main thing that rang true

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,880
was that when he said the name of Hugh Jass Facts,

80
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
he shuddered and like, there was like a real fear

81
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,000
his voice and that's really what the 20 by the way nets you, is that little detail

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,040
I'll give you that little hint. So yeah you guys are sort of finishing up he was

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,320
kind of rounding off in the speech Patrick Yoda we'll go to you and baby

84
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:56,440
Gad who just heard the the potentially pseudo genocidal plans of Gumby Superior

85
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:03,960
but um so Gummy Superior starts to say to you guys so all I ask before you go on

86
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,000
your merry way. Face me like a man! Alright I will. Turn around. Shit. Yep that's not what I meant.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,080
Yep I meant fall over. Get somebody please. You are such a dickass. Lift me up. There we go.

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,320
Just keep going. You have to wait for me to. No he's got to be upright. The toys aren't real.

89
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:26,200
All I gotta ask is that you keep in mind there's a larger issue here and that

90
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,320
this playtime thing is a distraction and if you want your boy back he'll best off

91
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:38,120
be helping me root the crime out of the undercity but I've taken up enough of

92
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,400
your time you've heard me say my piece what do you wait what do you I don't do

93
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:48,120
you know where our boy is do you know where Sullivan is I wish I did but

94
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,080
you're saying that you know how to get him back so I feel like you're hiding

95
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,920
something almost I'm not hiding you're not hiding look at me in the eyes you're

96
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:04,000
not hiding anything I'm in this regard no what do you mean in this regard I have

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,560
my own another we have to have my own private life yeah tell me about it tell

99
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,520

100
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,240
regard in a completely different regard let's switch can we switch regards wait

101
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,320
he is gay in a different regard my god wait I'm curious I'm curious did you

102
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,840
count the high rolls is making gay or the low roll well that's a statement

103
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,120
mm-hmm that's a real statement because it would be better if he was gay yeah

104
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,000
it is well we're talking about a different regard but in a completely

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,960
different regard. Look, why don't you guys, look here, one of my assistants will

106
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,960
give you both key cards so you can access the guts of the ship and you can, we'll

107
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,360
have a lieutenant waiting down for you, they can bring you to Dr. Keisha's lab.

108
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,440
All right, we're gonna send you on your way. You've heard my piece, I hope you

109
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,480
consider it and you consider reporting to me a little bit more often than you do

110
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,800
Belinda. He doesn't know but you guys literally just tormented her the last

111
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:23,080
time. Okay yeah I think we could probably treat you a little better than you treat them anymore.

112
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:29,160
In one regard. Okay he really stuck on that word. It's funny. Yeah was it funny?

113
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,400
Come be superior more like come in your posterior.

114
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,640
All right you guys gotta get out of here.

115
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,400
- Yep, okay, cool.

116
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,280
Yeah, he gives you key cards,

117
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,500
or his assistant comes up and gives you guys key cards,

118
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,680
and leads you to the elevator

119
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,800
that's gonna bring you into the guts.

120
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,000
Before we do that, though, let's go back.

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
So just swap the set around a little bit.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,200
Let's go back to, oh, nope,

123
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,560
you just knocked everything across.

124
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,480
We'll go back, anyway.

125
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:10,720
So Patrick Yoda, you're in one of the slum

131
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,000
he put him up to see that the best i can figure

132
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,920
by far is this what you know

133
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,080
- Yeah, he's gotta be kinda front and center,

134
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,220
it's kinda his show.

135
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:45,080
So yeah, and yeah, you hang up on the phone

136
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,680
and baby Gadd is just like, holy shit, this is big,

137
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,720
this is big, this could be good,

138
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,880
this could be good for all of us.

139
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,920
If we bring this information to Huge Ass Facts,

140
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,120
this is-- - Were you recording

141
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,960
the phone call?

142
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,600
- No, it was your phone, were you recording the phone call?

143
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,440
- No.

144
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,920
Whatever, look, they'll bully- we could probably do a playback, alright?

145
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,920
It's- it's- this is a big-

146
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,920
Do they record all phone calls?

147
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,060
Uh, well, it depends on your carrier. Who's your carrier?

148
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,440
Record a phone?

149
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,440
They probably record that call then.

150
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,760
[laughter]

151
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
Okay!

152
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,760
Look, look, look.

153
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,180
- It didn't, didn't, what's her name?

154
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,180
Janet Blowjob, she came up to you, right?

155
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,120
You got a number, right?

156
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,700
- Handan Blowjob?

157
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,760
- No, Janet Blowjob.

158
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,760
You can't really make that more dirty.

159
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,440
- You can change the name to Handan Blowjob.

160
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
- What's a handan, no, why don't you walk me through

161
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,520
what a Handan Blowjob is?

162
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,920
- What about Mandan Blowjob, and she's Jamaican?

163
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,640
- Why does that make it dirty?

164
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,760
- Doesn't make it dirty, it's just dirty.

165
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,600
- That makes it gay.

166
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,320
- That's dirtier than a normal blowjob.

167
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,520
- You are in the room!

168
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,560
- If a Jamaican does a blowjob.

169
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,640
- No, mandem, like how they...

170
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,520
- But there's a blowjob, so there's already one man.

171
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,400
- No, I'm making it gay now.

172
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,120
It was dirty when it was mandem.

173
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
- And that's dirtier.

174
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,000
- Are dirty.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,240
I'm just writing this down for your character

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,480
so I know what you think of Jamaicans for future.

177
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,320
- All right, continue.

178
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,480
- Have you heard that Skepta song?

179
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,320
- Probably.

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,480
- It's to the tune of "Transformers."

181
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,160
- I'm skeptical of your social justice.

182
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,040
He says mandem in disguise.

183
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,440
And it's a transphobic social justice.

184
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,200
That's fair.

185
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,640
So he says, Baby God says, why don't you contact her?

186
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,140
OK?

187
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:39,000
Patrick got an important text.

188
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,840
No, you don't have to read out what it says.

189
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,880
Just keep going.

190
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,680
What does it say?

191
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,800
I think I should read this.

192
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,300
Come on.

193
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,320
I think I should read this.

194
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,280
I think maybe I should put it up on the screen.

195
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,520
This is what the fans want.

196
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,560
- Oh wow, Pokemon deep fake porn hot anal sex twist stream.

197
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,440
Come on.

198
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,000
- Come on, I didn't, I sent that earlier,

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,840
I just went through it.

200
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,320
- Where'd you even find that?

201
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,160
- Why'd you read that?

202
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,980
That's for you.

203
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,820
- Where'd you even find shit?

204
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,240
- I don't know, dude.

205
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,200
- I'll just send it to you.

206
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,400
- I was just on Pornhub

207
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,600
and I just clicked one of those fucking ads.

208
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,440
(laughing)

209
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,480
- This is gonna come out in like eight weeks from now.

210
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,760
(laughing)

211
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,120
- That is a funny show.

212
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:16,960
- But anyway.

213
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
So yeah, I mean, he's asking you to call her.

214
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,720
He can, I mean, he'll go on like,

215
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,540
I can take you to the lair.

216
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,380
Look, if I have you--

217
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,200
- You want me to call her?

218
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,240
- If I have you vouching--

219
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,920
- I'm nervous to call her.

220
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,760
- What?

221
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,420
- She was so tall.

222
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,400
- Yeah, she is really tall.

223
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,880
- She was so tall, she gave me uppies.

224
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,720
- Yeah.

225
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,440
- Why would you be nervous to come in?

226
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,960
- You're not in the room.

227
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,160
You can't be talking.

228
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,240
- Well, if you're just gonna say bullshit.

229
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,080
- I'm not saying bullshit.

230
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,040
- Oh, he's just making conversation.

231
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:46,880
He's doing his character.

232
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,920
- All right, whatever.

233
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,520

I can hold your hand, make you feel a little less scared

249
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:19,760
So you're saying I gotta feel gay to talk to women?

250
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:20,760
I'm saying that that-

251
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
In all the man's hands?

252
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,680
I'm trying to problem solve here.

253
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,440
Look I wasn't even listening to that phone call.

Okay, well I was listening.

272
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,640
I'm sort of low on the totem pole.

273
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,560
- I don't know you.

274
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,840
- Okay, sure, but we got some news about

275
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,960
potentially something kind of big.

276
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,640
- Oh.

277
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,840

- Do what?

00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,080
- I just ripped off the leg of this character.

280
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,400
Please don't do that.

281
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,920
- Ripped a fucking headless dog's leg off, Jesus Christ.

Do you think I do a good girl voice?

286
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,560
I think so.

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,060
Thanks.

Me.

291
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Okay, your girl voice is amazing, Ms. Blowjob.

292
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:21,060
So anyway, I got some news that I really think you should hear about.

293
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,060
I have it recorded on the phone.

294
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,060
Here, I could send it to you through a private channel,

295
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,060
and then I would really like to meet with you at the headquarters.

296
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,060
I'm too busy.

297
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:35,060
Okay.

298
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,560
I'm too busy doing my makeup today.

299
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,420
- Okay, do you mind, hold on, wait.

300
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,260
There's a (imitates phone ringing)

301
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,700
There's another call coming in.

302
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,580
(imitates phone ringing)

303
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,700
Hi, it's me, the character.

304
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,300
Yeah, I would love to hear about this from you.

305
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,140
- What?

306
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,780
- Wait, am I, did you kill me?

307
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,300
Am I not in the scene anymore?

308
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,140
- Yeah, sorta.

309
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,580
- Oh, okay.

310
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,440
- I would love to hear about this.

311
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,760
Send me over the thing.

312
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,060
And he sends the thing over.

313
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,900
- We should've just done one-sided phone call.

314
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,860
- Janet, Blowtop, and Babygad have the same voice.

315
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,860
Oh, what's that Mrs. Blowjob?

316
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,860
You volunteered to do the voice!

317
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Well you said you weren't doing both sides.

318
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,860
Somebody had to step up.

319
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,860
No, she sorta talks like this.

320
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,860
He sorta talks like this.

321
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,860
No, you sound like that.

322
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,860
What the fuck did you just fuckin' say to me?

323
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,860
That's not what I meant.

324
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,860
That's not what I meant.

325
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,860
I sound like this, man.

326
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,860
No I do not!

327
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,860
Shut up.

335
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
I'll go.

343
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:34,260
bottom tip of the Pleasure Palace. So if you guys remember from the map, it's sort

344
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,460
of a, you know, it's part of that bottom part of the sort of curve thing. You can

345
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,180
look on the screen, you can see like the the ship and shit, but um, the space

346
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:47,540
station I should say. It's about a hundred yards from the like outrageous

347
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,880
bay window that overlooks the universe. The lair itself though is below the

348
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,740
ground of the undercity, burrowing its way through the guts and can't be reached

349
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,100
without taking a circular lift marked by a garish chrome finish you can pick out

350
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:04,220
from across the way. But not before you'd see a military column of Don't Wake Daddies

351
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,180
and gently humming surveillance bots patrolling the area in something maybe more bizarre than

352
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:15,520
an underground lair in space. Overhanging the lair is a 15-story cascading grape cluster

353
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,900
of organic alien material that glows at an uneven pulse. The whole thing is easily 200

354
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:25,660
feet around, with the bottom-most grapes only about 15 feet above the area around the elevator.

355
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:32,660
So imagine a cluster of grapes and then some 15 feet between that and the ground.

356
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,660
They got homers.

357
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,660
Homers.

358
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
Grapes.

359
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
Homers.

360
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
Homers.

361
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,660
We're homers.

362
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,660
You need to put the Homer Brothers in.

363
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
I will.

364
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,660
We're the Homer Brothers.

365
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,660
We're two homers.

366
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,660
Us.

367
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Us.

368
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,660
Us.

369
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Us.

370
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,660
Us.

371
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:54,760
(laughing)

372
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,000
- That's very good actually, I'll back pocket it.

373
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,760
Each mammoth sized grape is made of a mix of pale yellow

374
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,920
and ochre with dark brown veins cresting through.

375
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:04,760
- Shrek vibes.

376
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,580
- Ochre.

377
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,420
- Ochre.

378
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,480
- Like a brownish orange.

379
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,320
- Like a gang.

380
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,840
- Man, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

381
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,680
- Like a Shrek.

382
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,520
- Like a Shrekish greenish color.

383
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,320
- Well it's really a clay but it's also a color.

384
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,800
- Ochre.

385
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,760
- Ochre.

386
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,560
- Lifeless, pumping nothing, flaky and decrepit,

387
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,920
something glossy or viscous is inside of these things,

388
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,560
but on top of this giant cluster--

389
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,240
- It's jizz.

390
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,880
- Is a shaggy mound of bruised gray fur

391
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,160
that covers one of the topmost grapes.

392
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,720
- Yeah, jizz.

393
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,280
- It's not jizz.

394
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,200
Behind the cluster, barely visible against the dark sky

395
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,120
beyond the bay window,

396
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:42,320
appears to be a thruster of a lost ship.

397
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,200
So it's this giant grape cluster--

398
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,120
- With a thruster.

399
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,360
- With a thruster.

400
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,400
- And it's going fester and fester.

401
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,240
- Yeah.

402
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,920
(laughing)

403
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,040
But it looks nothing like any craft you've seen.

404
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,600
- And you said it was yellowish, like mustard.

405
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,940
- Yeah, the grapes are.

406
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,080
But the ship is near-- - Like Smucker's grapes.

407
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,720
- Like Vantablack.

408
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,800
But it's also, you can make out pock marks.

409
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,680
It's like a cyst-ridden foil, it almost looks like.

410
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,160
It's like very strange, like organic and metal

411
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,060
kind of combined. - Kind of like custard.

412
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,240
- Like a custard, organic and metal.

413
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
My first thought goes to custard.

414
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,360
The whole site together looks like a blown up,

415
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,720
exaggerated version of some of the alien structures you've seen. Structures? Yeah,

416
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,360
it's a bustard structure. It's a bustard structure made of grape clusters that

417
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:35,120
who lack that luster. Yeah. Can it cut the mustard? It can, but not quite like the

418
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:43,240
band Guster. You mean Duster? No. I mean there's a band called Guster and a band

419
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,240
called Duster? Why haven't they played it together?

420
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,240
- To Guster. - To Guster.

421
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,240
- Why haven't they gone on a world tour to Guster?

422
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,240
- Anyway, it looks like the Elliot structures you've seen throughout the

423
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,240
Downer District and Undercity, but kind of blown up in different parts of that map.

424
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,240
- Ruptured. - Ruptured, yeah.

425
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,240
As you reach the lift, which shuttles you downward

426
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,240
through the guts, gunmetal walls flank

427
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,240
your descent along with two-- - Do we go to the guts first?

428
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,040
No, they're going through the oh, okay. That was good. I

429
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:25,840
Was really good as far as those go you got me back. Yeah, I was getting pretty fucking frustrated, but that would go

430
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:33,380
Along with two surveillance bots that followed your descent you could tell

431
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,780
The lift reaches destination as a showy yellow door comes in the frame with Paisley like

432
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:46,460
Embossments lined with like a viridian neon so it's just kind of like like really kind of an abrupt stop

433
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,780
I'm not a screen abrupt er no must hurt that was a

434
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:56,240
This was a teaser for the garishness to come as the almost lurid lights of the huge-ass lobby

435
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,560
Reflect against the plain marble flooring so it's like super harsh lighting

436
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:07,780
Reflecting against his flooring this lobby looks super like pristine for some reason looks like the pyramid from Blade Runner 2049

437
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,920
I haven't seen 2049. It looks kind of like a

438
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:18,280
This Jared Leto is in I don't know anything about what Jared little dozen is off time, but it looks like a movie

439
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,280
He's a rapist. Oh, okay. I think he's a

440
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:22,960
blind

441
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,080
Wait is he blind he's got weird eyes is that why?

442
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,560
He doesn't know the age of women when he goes to them. Yeah, yeah, he says let me see the ID

443
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:48,040
Pretending he's seeing the look at all the graphics

444
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,240
They handed him a Lowe's foods card. He's like, "Oh, you sure are 14. Let's go."

445
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:08,140
But yeah, so the sterile, super expensive chrome furniture and siding along with the floor

446
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:14,700
to mirror ceilings all around. The lobby in front of you with its ridiculous furniture

447
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:21,940
makes about 30 feet from yourself and a reception desk behind which sits three beautiful V-folk.

448
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,140
of them spots you as you take your first few steps and suddenly materializes

449
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,020
materializes to your right so you walk out of this elevator that's kind of in

450
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,820
the central area right all around you in the lobby and then suddenly a V-Folk

451
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,740
from the lobby you see them in the distance and then they just blink and

452
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:48,680
they're right next to you. Welcome to the lair of facts! Oh I'm sorry sir I'm sorry I've been

453
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,680
I've been taking behavior medication that makes me act crazy.

454
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,680
Yeah, he's very sorry.

455
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,680
What?

456
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,680
I've been taking behavior medication...

457
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,680
I've been taking behavior medication that makes me act crazy.

458
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,680
...that makes me act crazy.

459
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,680
If you're here to make a query, we'll have you...

460
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,680
We'll have a chaperone bring you to the query booth on...

461
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Sorry, I got the voices mixed up.

462
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,680
Query booth at your house.

463
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:20,920
road. Bring you to a query booth on floor B6. If you need consultant services, you'll

464
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,880
find those on floors B2 through 5. I want to see the big man! Oh yeah, sorry, sorry. My

465
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:33,400
friend here, we're kind of past all that. We're here, Ms. Blowjob invited us, the Queen

466
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:42,320
of Facts herself. Don't worry, they're with me. Oh no, what am I doing? No, I'm kidding.

467
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,820
Sort of out of the, you see someone else

468
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,080
from behind the desk come around, another V-Folk,

469
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,320
and they're sort of this stylish fop of a man.

470
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,520
They look like a bow-legged pixie stick.

471
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,320
And they come up to you and they go,

472
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,840
"Oh, I'm so sorry.

473
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,760
"My name is Kenan Thompson, I'm--"

474
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,000
(laughing)

475
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,660
How did I get 'em?

476
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,900
(laughing)

477
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,380
- So what, it's a white guy named Kenan Thompson.

478
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,620
- I'm personal assistant to Ms. Blowjob.

479
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,980
(laughing)

480
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,580
- Kenan Thompson, personal assistant to Ms. Blowjob.

481
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:34,260
- I'll be taking care of them now.

482
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,460
You can go back to your desk, Cynthia.

483
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:40,380
And you see this man says to you guys,

484
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,620
here, let me bring you two back to the elevator.

485
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
We'll be right to Ms. Blowjob.

486
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,540
You can skip all this queries and factoids

487
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,160
and all that stuff.

488
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,360
And he brings you guys to the elevator.

489
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,900
And we're gonna cut from that elevator.

490
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,940
- What about a robot named Dell Mitchell?

491
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,780
- I'll write that down.

492
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,180
To a different elevator.

493
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,220
- He loves the orange box.

494
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,380
- 'Cause look who's on.

495
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:06,040
Look who's, come on, man.

496
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,240
- We're also going down an elevator now.

497
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,240
- Wee!

498
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,320
- You guys entered a large circular loft.

499
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,160
- Wee!

500
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:20,840
- Also, the doors close behind you like the aperture.

501
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,980
- I just built the elevator,

502
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,960
can we spend a little time more in here?

503
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,920
- Come on, just let us get one minute in here.

504
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,760
- Okay, sure.

505
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,960
- Blowtos, I think we're trapped in the elevator.

506
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,680
We have to hit the alert button.

507
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:33,360
(imitates alarm)

508
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,600
- Hello?

509
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,400
- Oh, it's a girl.

510
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,400
hello bloat

511
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,400
elevator is empty we are the

512
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
we are the

513
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,400
controllers of the elevator

514
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
it's not stuck at all

515
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,400
and we need to patch it into a

516
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
male human

517
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
um hey

518
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
bro you should have heard this bitch

519
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,400
we were just having phone sex with

520
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
one second ago she was so hot

521
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,400
she thought we were

522
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,400
elevators she seriously thought we were fucking

523
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
elevators she fucking probably

524
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Nodded in her chair

525
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,600
She was so fucking horny for us

526
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:17,620
Ball of goop on her floor dribbler fucking threw up you for you your access cards will grant you

527
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,620
Access fuck my pro my writing for this AI is so bad

528
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:27,420
Like AI to me okay switch back to the girl then

529
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,200
Your access has been granted to go to DJ. You granted us ass sex

530
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:37,200
- Oh, well we are not elevators.

531
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,040
- No.

532
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,880
- We are two very young men.

533
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,700
- The elevator glides.

534
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,400
- Very horny teenagers.

535
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,440
- We are potent.

536
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,920
- The elevator glides smoothly down.

537
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,760
- Glide.

538
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,600
- Glide.

539
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,040
- Oh yeah, I'm fucking gonna go.

540
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,560
- Your stomach barely drops as you pass through

541
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,880
about half a mile of space station.

542
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,700
- Wait, blowtoes, I am a computer.

543
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,560
Oh fuck.

544
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,600
- You hear the slightest creak

545
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,720
as you approach the bottom,

546
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,280
but the landing is mostly immaculate.

547
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,680
The doors open. - One, two, three, jump!

548
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,280
- I jump, I try and just crash the elevator.

549
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,240
- Roll athletic, roll athletic check.

550
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,480
- That's a natural.

551
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,320
- Oh my God.

552
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,240
- Your jump is, what do you, your jump is perfect.

553
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,980
- I'm trying not to knock the elevator off the cable.

554
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:22,820
(laughing)

555
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:25,400
- Oh, for real man?

556
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,240
Dude, I, no, I gotta--

557
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,080
- That's what I said before I rolled it, I have to stick to it.

558
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,240
- Do I have to roll?

559
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
You could roll to try to stop him I guess.

560
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,040
Nah, I rolled a... I guess like putt.

561
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Tackle him?

562
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,240
Yeah, I mean I guess I'll... Alright, hold on, I'm rolling.

563
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,240
Holy shit!

564
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Oh my god!

565
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,240
What the fuck?

566
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,240
Wait, wait, camera here.

567
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
What the fuck?

568
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,240
Wait, oh my god, what do we do, bro?

569
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,240
I've never seen two nat 20s like dueling nat 20s.

570
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,240
I mean...

571
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,240
I guess it's sudden death.

572
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,240
Yeah, usually it's a reroll, but...

573
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
But I feel like it would be much more...

574
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,400
- You just don't want the elevator to fall.

575
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,240
- I mean, I feel like--

576
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,040
- That's a you, just a plain favorites.

577
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,840
- No, I would feel like it'd be much more interesting if--

578
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,120
God, what do you do?

579
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,680
Do you break it and then do you hold it up with your mind?

580
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,880
- I was gonna just try to shove my,

581
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,680
just distract him, like shove my face into his nuts.

582
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,200
- Okay, so in that case, what you should do is roll like--

583
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,120
- So wait, I jump up in the air and you stick your face

584
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:22,960
up in my nuts?

585
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,800
- Yeah, that's what I was saying.

586
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,320
Like, that's my quick thinking.

587
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,880
- Because I go, okay, so first of all, he jumps up.

588
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,680
- Hold on, you're not even processing

589
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,720
the elevator's about to fall,

590
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,800
you're just like, oh, he's in the air,

591
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,400
I want to smell his nuts.

592
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,960
- No, no, he goes up and I go RDJ Sherlock,

593
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,720
and I'm seeing every version of the situation.

594
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,080
And I realize that the only way that I'm gonna survive this

595
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,000
is if I stick my fucking face directly

596
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,760
into his stinky Grinch nuts.

597
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,720
- Okay.

598
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,560
- Yeah, I mean, I think--

599
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,400
- Who nuts?

600
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,080
- I think, let's do another roll again,

601
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,280
'cause like he did, that was like perfect.

602
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,040
- Let's just, we'll be rolling just to see if,

603
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,560
how this resolves. - You wanna switch dice?

604
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,400
- Let's do it.

605
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,360
- You're trying to get your head in his nuts,

606
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,840
you're still trying to jump down.

607
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,800
- Okay, let's roll over here.

608
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,220
- 15. - 15, damn.

609
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,760
- 11.

610
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,840
- But add your, what are you doing though?

611
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
- Oh, is it athletics? - Sucking his balls.

612
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,860
- It's your athletics or acrobatics for you?

613
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,000
- For me? - Mm-hmm, for you.

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
- My athletics is six.

615
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
- My athletics is seven.

616
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,240
- All right, he still wins.

617
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,200
- So you almost break the elevator,

618
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:29,720
and then your face is just buried in his nuts.

619
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,560
- Okay.

620
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,000
- And so it stops his momentum,

621
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,040
and then the door opens to like a hallway.

622
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,480
There's like people in there.

623
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,160
- I spit him like 30 feet out of the elevator.

624
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,440
- No, you didn't beat me by that much.

625
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,640
- I fucking owned him.

626
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,920
- It was very close.

627
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,840
That was about to be--

628
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,440
- This is what you do.

629
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,320
- We would have skipped some stuff.

630
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,080
- That's a trouble pick. - In a second there.

631
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,400
Which would have been kinda cool.

632
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,800
That would have been kinda cool.

633
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,840
Aren't you glad we spent a little time in the elevator?

634
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,040
- Yes, I'm glad now.

635
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,200
- But now we're out of it.

636
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,040
- It's true.

637
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:04,500
- I'm getting a call from Bicurious, Ohio.

638
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,160
- Okay.

639
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,360
- They've been calling, it says Bucyrus.

640
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,800
But I've gotten a call from there in the past four minutes.

641
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,480
- The door is open and you're greeted to first

642
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,640
a half-wide metal hallway of dark blues and grays.

643
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,840
The walls lined with dashboards presenting critical data

644
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,680
and some counter space with terminals

645
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
manned by crew members.

646
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,960
Some working away, others chatting amongst themselves,

647
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,640
looking towards the dashboards.

648
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,080
So it's a sort of like little dark blue hallway.

649
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,180
And then at the very end of that,

650
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,280
you see those crude fluorescents of a commercial building

651
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,820
that you're used to seeing with a large entryway.

652
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:43,280
- There's a dog man.

653
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,280
- This guy's here.

654
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,560
- They put patches in the fucking game.

655
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,400
- Nope, that's not me.

656
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,440
- That looks just like you.

657
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,280
- Don't do that.

658
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,440
- I'm not a dog man.

659
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,700
(laughing)

660
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,780
- It looks just like you.

661
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:59,400
- Look at the tail, look at it touch his tail.

662
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,200
- No, don't show your ass on screen.

663
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,560
Come on, you fucking disgusting.

664
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,940
- I'm sorry.

665
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,780
- All right.

666
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,600
- Did you just take off something?

667
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,200
- Yeah, I see your butthole on the thing.

668
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,900
- All right, anyway, so there's no, you know,

669
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,800
and you guys walk down this hallway,

670
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,300
I don't know if you do or if you guys

671
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,180
Also like fuck around down this hallway.

672
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,820
- No, we pretty much walk down this hallway.

673
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,660
- You can fuck around.

674
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,900
- I try and jump and crash the hallway, just joking.

675
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,740
- Okay.

676
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:25,580
- I just try the entire hallway.

677
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,220
- That was funny though.

678
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,500
And you're opened up to a full on operation center.

679
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,900
There's no vanity tech here like in the command center.

680
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,760
Everything is serving a purpose.

681
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,820
Light grays, the dominant color.

682
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,160
The room is wide and not that long.

683
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,580
Not huge, but big enough that workers can muscle through,

684
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,620
carrying large pieces of equipment

685
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,940
and fasten them to some machinery.

686
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,660
You see this from a top, a wide staircase,

687
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,740
leading from where you entered.

688
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,700
There's the initial landing after the first flight

689
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,380
that holds two offices on either side.

690
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:57,900
So imagine like a staircase, little landing, two offices,

691
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,160
and then another staircase, another flight.

692
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:06,700
Those offices have two plexiglass offices

693
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,540
on either side, right?

694
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:10,460
And one sits a couple of lab workers and a crew member

695
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,460
manipulating a holographic model, delegating tasks.

696
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
And the other office has just a sole technician

697
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,580
working at his terminal.

698
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:20,500
And then that other landing, so you hit that landing,

699
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
and then there's the other landing

700
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:25,180
where you'll see the lieutenant awaiting you,

701
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,460
Lieutenant Michael Quinn,

702
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:31,660
who comes up the stairs quickly to greet you both.

703
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,220
Commander Superior, let's get Michael Quinn.

704
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,060
- He's already on.

705
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,820
- Fair enough.

706
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,060
(laughing)

707
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,300
(laughing)

708
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:51,500
- How'd you get him to stand on his hind legs?

709
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:54,380
Hey, Patches, that's how you stand in real life.

710
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,340
All right.

711
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,180
- Hold on.

712
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,260
- So, Michael Quinn, go ahead.

713
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,420
- Sorry, I'm just getting another guy.

714
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,540
- All right, you need this guy and this guy, okay.

715
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:11,780
Commander Superior told me you'd be coming this way.

716
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,600
I'll bring you right to Dr. Ebenezer.

717
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,580
We've stressed the urgency of the situation,

718
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,180
so he will make time for you both.

719
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,660
Right this way.

720
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:19,900
And you walk through the station,

721
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,740
you see crew members toiling away with a hurried energy,

722
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,100
but there's nothing frantic about it.

723
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,540
You get the sense that this place is always like this.

724
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:30,720
Never a dull moment, keeping the pleasure palace afloat.

725
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,300
- I accidentally tripped somebody.

726
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,140
- You do?

727
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,460
- Come on, what is it, Ed?

728
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,300
- It was on purpose.

729
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,120
- Okay.

730
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,960
- You can do it.

731
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
- Okay, don't give me that look.

732
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,560
you know me i like a little old a couple you really do we're so fucking in love

733
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,240
let me tax it and i'm gonna actually trip somebody is okay with you that to go

734
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,620
through every time actually trip somebody in your lab i don't know what

735
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,880
you're right in used to write i'm sorry

736
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,480
i'm really just because we

737
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,380
no no there's been a lot of we don't even have to finish talking

738
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,280
yet because i think it's so sorry and you're so correct

739
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:05,280
you look at it and i get this is a very description have the episode by promise

740
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,520
it's building things up

741
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,000
and tearing them down

742
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,660
Seven okay, you do not trip that whoever that

743
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:15,320
Yeah, right

744
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,120
Stick your foot out

745
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:26,780
Like you just see like the it's like you the camera goes down you just see your foot and your other foot going over it

746
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:28,780
And it just doesn't make any sense

747
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,120
So just to give you guys a little bit more background the guts of the station this contains and

748
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,040
Pat you're kind of in the guts also now through the layer guts - we're in them guts at the same time

749
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,860
Yeah, I would not do that with you guys know the station's plumbing. It's where the prisoners only do it three ways in

750
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,320
electricity general piping they do

751
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,040
Movement of goods gas we got a run

752
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,200
Is that what you're saying?

753
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,760
whole matter of functionality

754
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,360
It allows a ship to run

755
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:02,620
Or a station to run and provide the whole city in the amusement park with whatever it really needs on the power basis, right?

756
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,800
There are two entrances to the guts you guys are in one of them you are in the other one

757
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:14,540
It's sort of a not sanctioned and ship entrance. There's another entrance in the downer district. This is like the under city entrance

758
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,540
It's kind of a makeshift one

759
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:23,180
And each containing full management teams of the ship operations headed by an elite member of Leo's guard along with the station engineer

760
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:29,560
The crew for each team is usually a combination of leprechaun trip ship crew member and then depending on the size of the team there

761
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,400
maybe middle managers, filled out again by crew members.

762
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,620
What did he write?

763
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,460
He wrote something.

764
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,080
- I'm just imagining some stuff.

765
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,640
- Are you making fun of the teacher again?

766
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,060
- No, he wrote Caleb Doran, Caleb Michael Doran,

767
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,640
Patrick Edward Fitz.

768
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,900
(laughing)

769
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,680
- I'm just imagining stuff.

770
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,400
(laughing)

771
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,120
I'm just imagining, I'm just letting my imagination go free.

772
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,120
I feel like that's in the spirit of Dungeons and Dragons.

773
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
It definitely is.

774
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,240
Patrick Caleb Fetter.

775
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:10,120
What if we all combined our names and we all had the same name?

776
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,160
Caleb.

777
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,320
So most of the operations are not handled in the command center.

778
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,160
Or even the station operations corridor.

779
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,160
It's managed here, in places like this, and further in.

780
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,060
There are three Tesseract cores situated at the two ends.

781
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,360
Wait, so I'm like on the opposite wall of them right now?

782
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,460
You're basically on the opposite side of the whole ship.

783
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,560
How? Oh, the opposite side of the ship.

784
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,760
Yeah. Never mind. I thought we were in the same room.

785
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,060
You're on like the opposite side.

786
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,260
The three Tesseract cores are each inaccessible except for all those with maximum security access.

787
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,160
You guys can't get to the cores.

788
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:50,760
The cores are responsible for powering the majority of the functions of the ship

789
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,460
and share between them enough redundancies that if two go down,

790
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,360
and one will be enough to keep everything running

791
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,800
if at a lower capacity.

792
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,500
The entrance of the guts,

793
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
you can see the core below you, actually.

794
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,300
You're kind of walking on this kind of glass.

795
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,400
- That's kind of cool.

796
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,980
- It has its own force field around it from there, too.

797
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,340
- Aquafina fetter, Hart.

798
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:14,100
Come on, bro.

799
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,380
Can we just stop bright and stuff?

800
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,520
- But yeah, so you also notice that most of the higher ups

801
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,940
and non-leprechauns are wearing

802
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,460
distinctive face masks down here.

803
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,900
You're not noticing that, Pat.

804
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:27,220
You, where you are in the lair,

805
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,220
actually has a decent air quality.

806
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,060
Where you guys are--

807
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,780
- I'm just doing this.

808
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,120
- You guys have actually bad air quality.

809
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,580
The electric--

810
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,140
- Uh-oh, that means something's gonna go through the vents.

811
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,780
- The electrolytic cycles are not enough

812
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,740
to keep the station full of oxygen,

813
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:47,540
especially with the more advanced kinds

814
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:49,620
of luxurious terraforming that goes on

815
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,100
in the Royal District and New Gunn City.

816
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,660
So technoslime, as it often does,

817
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,820
gets involved and supplements, right?

818
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,660
It sort of supercharges the oxygen

819
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:01,340
generated from electrolysis, electrolysis rather,

820
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,260
and causes the usual effects of technoslime

821
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:07,660
with addiction, occasional mutations, psychosis, et cetera.

822
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,820
So people who have gas masks who work in the guts,

823
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,540
if they're of a high enough station,

824
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,860
and other people have to kind of fend off

825
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:18,140
a potential mutation and addiction issues

826
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,480
that come with just basically a flawed process

827
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,780
of regenerating the energy.

828
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,580
And this is partially because they're making sure

829
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,900
all the tourist areas and residential areas of the ship

830
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,300
and Royal District has the purest, best possible air.

831
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,920
- Wait, you're telling me that this polished surface

832
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,340
might not be quite what it seems on the underbelly.

833
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:41,180
- You know what?

834
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,820
I don't know if you've ever heard of noir, but oh yeah.

835
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,660
- I hate that.

836
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,500
- Isn't that crazy though?

837
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,280
Fucking disturbing, but yeah, I was reflective of reality

838
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:54,700
It's actually all I mean things are fine, so it's oh yeah wait. It's all made up

839
00:38:54,700 --> 00:39:03,660
But yeah, so that's the guts situation we'll bring you guys to Ebenezer Keish in a second

840
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,820
Let's go back to you because you're gonna meet your person now. See this one. This is very like yes really

841
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,820
It's just like Quentin Tarantino

842
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,140
Mini Mouse Fetter

843
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,340
- All right, put that on camera.

844
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,260
- Look at my drawing.

845
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,500
(laughing)

846
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:24,020
- That's me at my wedding in the future.

847
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,140
(laughing)

848
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,140
- Does that, you think that looks like Hitler?

849
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,580
Wait here, I'll show everybody.

850
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,860
I didn't, by the way, I did not put a heart over Hitler,

851
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,580
I just drew a little stick figurine.

852
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,860
- You drew a heart next to Hitler.

853
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,220
- No, that one says, "Caleb was Patrick,"

854
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,340
and then that says, "All my new future names."

855
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,840
- Come on man, don't put Hitler on the Patch's cam.

856
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,820
- I'm seeing double.

857
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:51,020
- No. - No kidding.

858
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,380
- So you guys are, so you mean one.

859
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,760
- If I was really me, I'd say I'm seeing one and a half.

860
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,360
'Cause Patch is a half height.

861
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,020
- Hitler's tall. - Hitler's a lot taller.

862
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
- Did you just say he's half the man Hitler was?

863
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:04,660
(laughing)

864
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,940
Come on man.

865
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,640
- So you Patrick, you're going down the elevator

866
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,840
with Kenan Thompson and Baby Gadd.

867
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,720
And when he goes inside that elevator,

868
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,920
he traces his index finger along the sort of matte paneling.

869
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,440
You hear gear turning on the outside of the elevator.

870
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,840
And with some certainty,

871
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,560
you can feel yourself move sideways.

872
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,400
- Whoa. - Even though that was

873
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,600
surrounding the lobby.

874
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,440
- Like the Luxor.

875
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,560
- Charlie Chocolate Factory vibes.

876
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,600
- And then sideways, and then down for a little bit,

877
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,520
and then sideways again.

878
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,960
That garish yellow door opens,

879
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,240
and this time to a marvelous bedchamber,

880
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,820
resplendent with treats and toffees and...

881
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,120
- Treats and bed?

882
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:45,960
- So, and...

883
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,600
- I try to dive into the treats like Scrooge McDuck.

884
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,920
- You succeed, you jump into a table

885
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,960
that was holding some treats on it.

886
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,800
(laughing)

887
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:58,120
You just, the door opens and you just break a table.

888
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,280
Do you hold your breath?

889
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,540
- No.

890
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,360
- Where is it?

891
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,840
- I breathe so hard. - Where's Kenan?

892
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,840
- Which one was Kenan? - I don't remember who it was.

893
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,360
I don't think you gave him a person.

894
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,360
I don't think I did either go ahead and pick

895
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,400
This is Keenan, that's Keenan Thompson

896
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:25,000
This is my I mean this is a very wordy episode

897
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:34,760
You guys have to entertain yourself somehow the tongue out that she does oh I see always think she has three lips

898
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:46,160
She does do that a lot. So yeah, you, you, and it opens up. That's Kena Thompson right there.

899
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,200
That's what Pat just said. And you see little mini robots assistants dusting and brushing

900
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,440
and performing constant miniature. Nanobots? Basically, but they're kind of more like mini

901
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:01,080
robots. Nanobots are like mini robots. Yeah, they're smaller than this. Miniobots, little

902
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:03,920
- Those are little Mexican boy robots.

903
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,760
- I don't know what that is.

904
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,600
- Little Mexican boy robots.

905
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,440
- Yeah, they're all Mexican robots.

906
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,020
- And they wear glasses and they have a hood on.

907
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,760
- Nobody can see Jubio.

908
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,620
- Nobody can see Jubio.

909
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:19,400
- And so, yeah, 'cause he's so little.

910
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,240
And so you're--

911
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,840
- They're called Jubitos.

912
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:25,000
- It might now-- - Jubio robots.

913
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,420
- Maybe I will call them that.

914
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,960
But along with assorted robots,

915
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:33,600
- The Jubidos are performing constant,

916
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,100
miniature, hygienic and organizational tasks.

917
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,320
Moving little things on the desk

918
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,160
and Nick backs around dusting on things.

919
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,980
- Oh my god, now we can voice the characters.

920
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:42,720
- And finally, sitting in a large armchair

921
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,960
is Ms. Janet Blowjob.

922
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,000
Expectant, but casually--

923
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,600
- She's expecting?

924
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,440
- No, expectant.

925
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:52,920
- Why did you FaceTime me then?

926
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,400
(laughing)

927
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:56,640
You're directing this.

928
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,960
- What does, you said she's expecting.

929
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,000
- Expectant. - No, expectant.

930
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,520
- I think you know he said expectant.

931
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,360
- Oh, hell no.

932
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,760
- No, she's pulling her pussy out.

933
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,120
- Okay, yeah, I got you.

934
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,760
She is not pregnant and she can't--

935
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,600
- Stop!

936
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,640
(laughing)

937
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,040
- That's not the right way.

938
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,400
- I just covered my eyes instinctually.

939
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,600
(laughing)

940
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,080
- So I don't wanna-- - Showed her fucking hoo-ha.

941
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,680
- I don't know who she is, I don't wanna--

942
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,080
- We're gonna face her towards me.

943
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:23,920
- Yeah. - Okay.

944
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,760
- Hello.

945
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,020
(laughing)

946
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,160
Hello Yoda, baby Gadd, it's good to see you both.

947
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,660
(gagging)

948
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:35,500
Oh.

949
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,760
- I hit my head when I jumped into the table

950
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,180
and it gave me a concussion.

951
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,300
- Oh yeah, let's get you to lie down.

952
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,960
And yeah, she puts you on her bed,

953
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,600
she gives you uppies and places you on the bed

954
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,320
and tucks you in a little bit.

955
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,960
Says how you feeling, you feeling okay?

956
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,060
You had a long day?

957
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,040
Hmm?

958
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,320
You have a long day or no?

959
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Let's get on with this.

960
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,920
So what do you have to tell me?

961
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,840
I don't remember. I think you remember a little bit.

962
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:11,000
Oh yeah, I hit the play button on my phone.

963
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,680
Yeah, cool. And so you hear Gumby Superior

964
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:20,640
saying to the effect of, "I maybe want to destroy the Undercity, I maybe

965
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,480
trying to go to war with you, Jasfax."

966
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,440
(laughing)

967
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,960
And don't tear the hair off, head off the woman.

968
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,800
- Woman.

969
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,640
- Whatever.

970
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,400
- And she goes, "This is interesting."

971
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,320
And you see baby guy go, "See, look, look,

972
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,880
"they're always going after us."

973
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,240
You know, that's what I always been, she's sort of like--

974
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,600
- My phone can do other stuff too.

975
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,960
- And she kinda shushes him.

976
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,160
What does your phone do?

977
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,640
- Brick breaker.

978
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:48,480
- Let me see.

979
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,380
- Do you sell Flappy Bird on there?

980
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:52,280
- I have Flappy Bird too.

981
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:59,320
That must be worth a roll a persuasion check this is very good seduction technique

982
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,660
19 nope

983
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:13,640
She like it from this angle it looks like I don't think you have

984
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:19,820
Flappy bird maybe you have raised though, but the thing you pointed to is a 16 - Riz

985
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,620
- That is, that's a 300 year old term at this point.

986
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,260
- So is basically every word.

987
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,300
I just wanna put that out there.

988
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,780
- No, don't put that out there.

989
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,220
This is my fault then in that case.

990
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:30,740
- I like to put that in there.

991
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:31,580
- Come on, man.

992
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,060
- Please leave her alone.

993
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:34,500
- Why is your tongue blue?

994
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,340
- Why is your tongue blue?

995
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,180
- Nerds.

996
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:37,000
- Oh, yeah.

997
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,840
- Nerds.

998
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,680
- We had nerds earlier.

999
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,500
- Nerds.

1000
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,340
(laughing)

1001
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,180
- Nerds party.

1002
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:42,880
(laughing)

1003
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,880
- She says, this is, I mean, besides your phone is weird,

1004
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,380
but this could very well be used to our advantage.

1005
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,980
Of course, there'd be something in it for both of you.

1006
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:56,220
- I have the settings app.

1007
00:45:56,220 --> 00:46:02,440
- For Gadd, we can make you into a factoid immediately.

1008
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,460
No question.

1009
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,500
Plus you'd certainly have the most esteemed favor,

1010
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,700
Mr. Fax, for you and your friends, Mr. Yoda.

1011
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,460
How would you feel,

1012
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,700
well, unless you want to become a part of our organization,

1013
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,020
which I don't think you do,

1014
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,220
I can only guarantee perhaps some financial gain

1015
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,260
via tokens. - Oh, I'm looking

1016
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:22,500
for my nephew.

1017
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,740
- You're looking for your nephew?

1018
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:27,220
- Yeah. - Oh.

1019
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:29,220
Who's your nephew? - Sullivan.

1020
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,260
- Sullivan. - He's like a penguin.

1021
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,720
- What happened to your nephew?

1022
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:35,760
- Some shit.

1023
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,860
We turned the light off, or the light turned off,

1024
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,020
and then-- - Oh, was he the one

1025
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:43,020
kidnapped by Playtime? - Yeah.

1026
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,380
- I heard about a child-- - Do you know

1027
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:46,260
- I don't know anything about him.

1028
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,100
- I don't know anything about him.

1029
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,700
- Can you tell me the answers to every question I have?

1030
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:52,260
- I can give you answers that I know,

1031
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,540
but I can't give you, you know, answers.

1032
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,460
- Okay.

1033
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:56,980
- Okay? Is that all right with you?

1034
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:57,820
- All right.

1035
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,940
(laughing)

1036
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:00,900
- You seem upset.

1037
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:05,060
- Kinda wanted to find my nephew,

1038
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,980
I guess I'll do this other bullshit.

1039
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:10,000
- Well, look, I don't know anything about your nephew,

1040
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:10,840
but I imagine--

1041
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:12,180
- He was handsome.

1042
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,780
- I'm sure he's very handsome, but Mr.--

1043
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:20,140
He used to say oh yeah. He would go oh yeah. Okay that sounds fun. He played the

1044
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:29,500
trombone and band in school. Did he? He was in a school many times. And then you said in the college. Did he play trombone in college?

1045
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:40,900
In a ska band. He was a trombone ska player. Okay. Yep. That's perfect for him. I'm sure he was great. He was not good.

1046
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,900
Very expensive instrument.

1047
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,900
All personality.

1048
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,340
Same price as getting into hockey.

1049
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,980
He would call home and ask for us to buy him ties.

1050
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:47,980
Checkered ties.

1051
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:48,980
Checkered ties, yeah.

1052
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:49,980
Yeah.

1053
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,980
Really?

1054
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:51,980
That cost stack up after a while.

1055
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:56,380
He would play the impression that I get, but he would try to play the lyrics.

1056
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,380
He would try to play the vocals.

1057
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,220
He was like, "Oh, he's doing the vocal line with the song."

1058
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,220
Yeah, yeah.

1059
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:03,100
That's pretty, that's not a great instinct.

1060
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:04,100
He would say some shit.

1061
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,860
He would be like, "Yeah, I really like Bomb the Music Industry, but actually the band they

1062
00:48:07,860 --> 00:48:10,580
were in before, Arrogant Sons of Bitches, was way better."

1063
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,420
- There's no way he would say that.

1064
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:12,340
- I would be like, what are you talking about?

1065
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,380
He said that sentence like one--

1066
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,420
- Really? - Yeah.

1067
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:16,340
- He only ever said, oh yeah and okay.

1068
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:17,180
- To you, yeah.

1069
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:18,740
- Yeah, to you.

1070
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,140
- 'Cause he has the motherly thing.

1071
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,180
- He's a mom.

1072
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,060
- We talk about Scott a lot.

1073
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,580
- I just didn't know nothing about Scott.

1074
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,500
(laughing)

1075
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,340
- Scott.

1076
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:33,600
- Mr. Facts might be able to share with you

1077
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:37,540
if you want to assist us in this potential war

1078
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,220
with one of his most special facts.

1079
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:44,020
The facts that only Mr. Hugo, Hugh Jazz Facts knows.

1080
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,300
- Okay, can I record it on my phone

1081
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,140
so that I can remember it later?

1082
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:48,980
- No, no.

1083
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:49,800
- 'Cause what if I forget it?

1084
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:50,780
I feel like that's pretty important

1085
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,220
for me to remember all of it.

1086
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:53,500
- He never gives anybody--

1087
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,220
- I have adult ADHD.

1088
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:58,540
And I need to record every lecture that I get.

1089
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,540
- Very seriously in the future.

1090
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,340
- I need to record every lecture that I get on my phone

1091
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,460
so that I remember it later.

1092
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:05,380
- Okay, well--

1093
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,100
- 'Cause if you say something like,

1094
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,500
like, I don't know, like,

1095
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,500
Okay, huge-ass facts. What's a fact I know?

1096
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,100
The Super Nintendo was originally

1097
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:21,980
Going to have a DVD drive. Was it really? And then it became that that thing became the PlayStation

1098
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,780
Really?

1099
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,980
That's a fact I know. I don't think that's true. See, I don't remember what the beginning of this conversation was about

1100
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:34,580
I gotta record the whole thing. Well lucky lucky for you. This is all recorded. Well lucky for you

1101
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:36,580
I've been recording the whole time

1102
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,460
No, I had your phone. There's no way you were required. I thought I could trick you

1103
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:50,260
Look what I'm saying is we can compensate you financially much more quickly than you would even expect and

1104
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:57,540
Give you some information that very few people have that could maybe help you on your search for your nephew

1105
00:49:57,540 --> 00:49:59,540
Well, why don't you just say that?

1106
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:06,580
Why did you distract me? You would distract yourself all the time constantly. This is me talking about

1107
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:08,840
(laughing)

1108
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,260
- So, why don't you rest here for the night?

1109
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,580
We have guest beds.

1110
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,260
- Or do you have a big hotel I could go to?

1111
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,180
- I mean, we have guest rooms here, they'll be in this--

1112
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:25,100
- Do they have video games?

1113
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,620
- They do have video games, yes.

1114
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,620
- Then I will go to the guest room.

1115
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,660
- Okay, cool.

1116
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:32,380
We need a guest room, 'cause we are, it is nighttime,

1117
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,640
and you'll meet with Mr. Hugeassfacts in the morning.

1118
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,440
You two are back to where you are.

1119
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:42,160
You're being brought to you know who.

1120
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,600
- Get this hoe out of my face.

1121
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,140
- A combination of people.

1122
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:51,480
- We're being brought to them?

1123
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,340
Okay, Roblox Joe.

1124
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:57,080
- Joe?

1125
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:58,420
- Jane Ice Cream.

1126
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:02,120
- Jane Ice Cream, is that her name?

1127
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:02,960
- I don't know.

1128
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,200
- Jane Ice Cream is gonna be Ebeneezer Scrooge.

1129
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,040
- Okay.

1130
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:06,860
- Ebenezer.

1131
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,180
- Ebenezer Kish, you mean.

1132
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,720
- Sorry, Ebenezer Kish, yes.

1133
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:12,940
And that is going to be Ebenezer Kish's assistant.

1134
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:15,400
- Why do they do this when we walk in?

1135
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,240
- What?

1136
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,880
- Why are they doing this when we walk in?

1137
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,460
(laughing)

1138
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:21,240
What the hell are they doing with each other

1139
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:22,080
when we walk in?

1140
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,780
- Praying to Mecca.

1141
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,200
- They're facing an opposite direction.

1142
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,440
- Mecca's right between them.

1143
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,280
- Oh yeah.

1144
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,240
- You see the assistant, the assistant is a

1145
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:35,160
red haired young man who's clacking away on a keyboard.

1146
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,160
He sees you guys walk in he goes

1147
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:45,000
Mr. Kish, Mr. Kish and like like goes over to you goes over to mr. Keating. Wow. Wow. What are you on?

1148
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,720
We have the visitors here and mr. Kish comes over. Dr. Kish really Toby Kish

1149
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,760
And he says he says, uh, oh

1150
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,840
You must be the ones who brought me the snake

1151
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,480
Yeah

1152
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:08,040
Well, I I thank you for it's a very interesting finding and here come come come into my lab

1153
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:13,600
We'll just you clean the snake before you did any tests on it. Did you did they clean it in between when did you guys do?

1154
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:15,600
a taste test

1155
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,460
Do we do we clean the snake we clean the snake ready?

1156
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:23,480
Yes, we did. We clean the snake. I actually in the snake with what?

1157
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,440
What I'm with without cleaning tools

1158
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:33,420
Okay, all right. Just make it sure I don't want any of my spunk lying around creating a baby with one of you ugly mugs

1159
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:38,760
I'm pretty I am pretty paranoid about some ho bottling my fucking

1160
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,160
Get out of the toilet and trying to turn up trying to turn me into a money machine bitch. You ain't getting my money

1161
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,840
That's why when I jack off at a public toilet

1162
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:51,560
I put it out of order sign on the door when I'm done and after I'm done with the condom I poop in it

1163
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:55,920
Uh-huh, I assure you we we you're gonna have if we're gonna have a baby together. It's gonna be fucked

1164
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:03,180
Definitely took your spunk out and sent it off into space space. Oh, that's where all the bitches are

1165
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:13,140
What's after it was processed and reprocessed not just raw processed it's a raw spunk the raw spunk

1166
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,440
You're gonna give my bro a baby mama

1167
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:23,620
Dr. Keesh Huxtable.

1168
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:25,620
Dr. Keesh Huxtable.

1169
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,620
Okay, sorry.

1170
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:29,620
So you cleaned the jizz out of it.

1171
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:33,620
And now, Dr. Keesh goes over and starts, um, um,

1172
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,620
looks at the snake and says,

1173
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,620
"Now I see why

1174
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:43,620
people would think this is, um,

1175
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:45,620
who is this? I can see why this would

1176
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,620
escape the notice of the blue gopher.

1177
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,620
He's a talented

1178
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:53,620
I'm not a phenomenologist and forensics expert,

1179
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:56,920
but this is just multi-processed techno-slime, really,

1180
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,920
the synthetic material here.

1181
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,120
This kind of thing, Lateralis and I would make

1182
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,260
when designing armor for--

1183
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:04,120
- This thing's made out of techno-slime?

1184
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:06,920
- Well, at least the mouth and the--

1185
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:07,920
- The goodies.

1186
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,920
- Yes, I mean, that's from what I can observe here.

1187
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,120
The pleasure receptors are just,

1188
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,420
I mean, there might be something else there

1189
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:15,720
besides techno-slime, but--

1190
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,920
- It's run-of-the-mill?

1191
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,920
- I mean, my estimation, yes.

1192
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,760
It's a mid

1193
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:23,160
Well, not me. Do you mean okay?

1194
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,920
It's made

1195
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,840
Likely an anomaly right it's it's it's a chemical reaction as far as the snake is concerned

1196
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:34,960
perhaps a snake folk

1197
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,160
Worker had an unhappy accident. He folked a snake happy accident someone could have much of an accident

1198
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:47,240
I doubt somebody engineered this thing deliberately. There's there's lots of power being generated in the guts these types of things

1199
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:53,180
Happen, I just wouldn't pay it any more mind is oh he didn't pay it nothing

1200
00:54:53,180 --> 00:55:05,080
I'll make sure that we're more mindful of this in the guts, but um, and you guys need a spunk shredder. I'm serious

1201
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:07,340
No, we like I know that one of your

1202
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,640
trifling yep lab assistants

1203
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,200
shove that upper

1204
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,400
Yep, well I will worry about that and you you won't have to but you know

1205
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,200
This is just really an anomaly and we're going to look into it

1206
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,080

00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:31,600
Pay him no mind, he just had a psychotic break.

1220
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,600
Because of how... He needs to be, we need to run some tests on him.

1230
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,600

1231
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:57,600
he was completely useless

1232
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,600

1233
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,600

1234
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,600

1237
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:23,000

1238
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,080
something is up I don't know if Ebeneezer wants to hide something and

1239
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:33,080
He's afraid of the work he's been doing, but it's way too weird.

1240
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,580
I'll turn a blind eye.

1241
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,580
How about you just come show us?

1242
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,580
Okay.

1243
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,580
I will.

1244
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,580
Okay, I'm going to try to pick you up.

1245
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,580
What is that?

1246
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:44,580
Sixteen.

1247
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:45,580
Sixteen.

1248
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:46,580
He's going to roll to resist.

1249
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:47,580
I have a d20.

1250
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:48,580
Yeah.

1251
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,580
I don't have one.

1252
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,580
You have one, but you put it behind your computer.

1253
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,580
I did.

1254
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,580
Well, he got an 18.

1255
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,580
Damn.

1256
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:56,580
What's your strength?

1257
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:00,160
- My strength is three. - He's three.

1258
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:01,500
- No, he's still-- - That's a 19.

1259
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:03,900
- Yeah, so he's-- - No, that was the other time.

1260
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,980
- He still has more. - Okay.

1261
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,540
All right, so he can just come with us then.

1262
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,660
Don't worry about picking up.

1263
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,500
- So he leads you to, further along towards the back,

1264
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:15,060
you see like, Ebenezer Kiesha's kind of like,

1265
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,460
he's focused on his work, he's not even noticing you guys

1266
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,060
at this point, you're walking by.

1267
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,580
Quinn is kind of watching a little bit more suspiciously

1268
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,220
after you guys picked up the scientist.

1269
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:30,220
and he leads you to a panel and he presses on the key code

1270
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:34,060
and he goes, "Okay, let's go in here."

1271
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,620
And he starts moving you further into the guts,

1272
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:40,860
sort of ushering you guys along.

1273
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,160
Don't make it, but they're gonna hear you, man.

1274
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,340
And, nice.

1275
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,200
- Nerd, said roll it dice. - Nice.

1276
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,100
And roll perception. - Exquisite.

1277
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,340
- Me too. - Both of us?

1278
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,540
- Both of you guys. - Both of us?

1279
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:01,240
both of all of us. 19. Okay. Dude, my rolls are insane today. 18. Oh my god, we're

1280
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:08,280
fucking on fire. Okay. You both hear the assistant start to step out of the

1281
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:14,720
doorway. Like he's locking us in there? I don't know. Okay, honestly. Bang! Bang, bang,

1282
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:20,200
bang, bang, bang! No, no, I mean, personally, I don't give a fuck. So I will keep you.

1283
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,720
- Well, okay, wait, no, now you see me, what's the movie?

1284
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:25,920
- With the magicians?

1285
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:26,760
- The cards?

1286
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:27,580
- Yeah, now you see me.

1287
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,640
- Now you see me too.

1288
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,080
I'm throwing, I have a card.

1289
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,200
(laughing)

1290
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,600
- Hey man, I was wondering where this was going.

1291
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,520
- And I throw it behind me,

1292
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:39,220
and I throw it into the part where the door goes in.

1293
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:41,000
So we can't close.

1294
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,840
- You do not have a card.

1295
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,600
- I have paper, though, or something.

1296
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:48,160
I have enough things in my inventory that I can have a card.

1297
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,480
- You could throw--

1298
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,480

1299
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,080

1328
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,300
presses a button, the door shuts,

1329
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:20,700
turns into a chute, and you hear,

1330
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:22,920
(imitates door opening)

1331
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:23,760
- Oh my god.

1332
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,540
- And then, so it turns into a chute,

1333
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,040
but we just stay floating.

1334
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:31,080
- And you slide down. - Oh shit.

1335
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:33,600
- Star Wars vibes. - Bloody hell.

1336
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:34,680
- So you're going, they're going to--

1337
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:36,520
(screaming)

1338
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,960
You're going into Playtime's rank rocket.

1339
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:40,300
We went back up.

1340
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:48,040
And then you land on a pile of discarded toys and creatures.

1341
01:01:48,040 --> 01:01:52,320
- Wait, wait, that laugh was Playtime's laugh.

1342
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:53,840
I just got that.

1343
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,280
So that means that that motherfucker was Playtime.

1344
01:01:56,280 --> 01:02:00,540
Or somebody was, somebody is him.

1345
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,380
Somebody's him.

1346
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,280
- Somebody is him. - Somebody is him.

1347
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:04,440
- I still think it's somebody.

1348
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,600
- So we're on a thing of--

1349
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,040
Okay, wait, can I roll an investigation?

1350
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:09,040
- So I'll tell you where you are.

1351
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,100
You're on this ground floor where there's like,

1352
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,180
It's like a, you see a bit of light

1353
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,020
kind of coming up from the chute.

1354
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,380
- Yeah, he just said you landed on a pile of discarded toys.

1355
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:19,460
- Of discarded toys, but not just discarded toys.

1356
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:21,260
- You're in his rancor pit.

1357
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,100
- Kinda. - Sorry, sorry,

1358
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:22,920
are you in the pit?

1359
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:23,760
Because I don't think you are.

1360
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:28,060
- There's discarded toys, there's bits of...

1361
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,520
- Detritus.

1362
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,620
- Don't you, don't you tell it to me.

1363
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:36,060
- Bits of like discarded...

1364
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,160
- Debris.

1365
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,540
- Animal parts.

1366
01:02:38,540 --> 01:02:39,380
- Animal?

1367
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:40,980
- Creatures parts.

1368
01:02:40,980 --> 01:02:43,640
we take creatures sentient

1369
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:46,820
creatures from the future creatures

1370
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,540
and will partake in the creek

1371
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,040
for the only way to get out of the house

1372
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:53,980
it's a good idea to put the credit

1373
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:54,940
the

1374
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,820
crazy

1383
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:15,860
Okay, so there's animal parts and creature parts.

1384
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:17,200
(laughing)

1385
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,320
And they've been discarded.

1386
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,120
- When you say parts, do you mean heads and tails?

1387
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,560
- Yeah. - Oh.

1388
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:24,240
- And flesh. - Like hunters,

1389
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,760
like does it look like they used all parts,

1390
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,840
not all parts of the animal?

1391
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,720
- It looks like-- - Awful OFF.

1392
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,680
- So some of them, yeah, some of them are

1393
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:40,680
partially grafted. So it looked similar to the snake or the moth.

1394
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:46,680
Oh, okay. Like they were trying... Oh, well he was saying that he made the snake, basically.

1395
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:48,680
He was denying it.

1396
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,680
Yeah. I'm kind of thinking it's the assistant and not...

1397
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,680
Yeah. Or maybe they're in cahoots already.

1398
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:58,680
Can I do an investigation on the toys to see if they have any of my son's blood on them?

1399
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,680
Yeah, definitely.

1400
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,680
Or any of my spots on them.

01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,680
You know your son's blood I

1407
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,800
Plastic and a bit of iron like blood
