00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,420
- I did get peer pressured by Caleb

175
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,140
to drink another thing of cold brew.

176
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,980
- If you--

177
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,820
(laughing)

178
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,640
- Before we recorded.

179
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,480
- Well you never said it was another.

180
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,620
You just said, "A cold brew."

181
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,380
And I said, "Hey, you know what, sure."

182
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,220
Couldn't hurt.

183
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,040
- It's true.

184
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,500
- Sure it's good to have a little juice in the tank.

185
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,580
Yeah. Nothing wrong with that.

186
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,380
Oh, fuck. I just drank a 50 million gallon Red Bull.

187
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,540
I'm ready to record my job. Yeah, all I need is delicious water to keep

188
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:40,140
me going, to give me the energy I need. I drank too much earlier today and now that

189
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,980
I've had this, I'm like, I can't even sit still.

190
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:47,180
Yeah, you can do jumping jacks during the episode if you need to.

191
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
Yeah? That's fine, yeah.

192
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,100
I don't mind. I don't have my fingerboards here. I would

193
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,260
have started... Thank Christ, dude.

194
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,980
I would have started skating. Have you guys ever known anybody who just

195
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
can't drink normal water.

196
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,220
My brother's ex-girlfriend just like would not drink normal water.

197
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,740
She said that it had a bad taste.

198
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
That's I mean that really...

199
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
That's bold.

200
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,500
That's bold to challenge God like that.

201
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,540
I think that like because I quit smoking weed my brain has been going into overdrive to

202
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,900
give me the most like lame thoughts possible to make up for it.

203
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,740
But I was just thinking about that like yo like the world we live in right now is low-key

204
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,300
like a cyberpunk dystopia.

205
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,860
But like people who won't drink normal water that's absolutely something you would fucking

206
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,780
read in yeah and like a silent punk book or so it's like the most stupid it's like

207
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:34,820
you know it has to be flavored like a made-up watermelon or else I won't drink it.

208
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:39,700
This girl she would like it wasn't that she wouldn't drink it is that she could

209
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,420
not drink it she would like want to vomit if she had a sip of water that

210
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,100
didn't have Mio in it. That's literally that's just that's insane. Dude in the next

211
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:52,100
in the in the next Bible that's gonna be like the sin that made God fucking wipe the earth clean.

212
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:59,300
like Sodom and Gomorrah. That's like insane. Like I can only drink Sprite and beer or Mio.

213
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,580
We're living in Sodom and Gomorrah. Yeah you are. Your house. It's mostly Sodom. I'm gonna

214
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:16,020
Sodom you tomorrow. That's right. Pull up. I'm gonna pull you down. Pull your shit down.

215
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,180

216
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,620

220
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:47,380

223
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,320
I just sometimes I'll fucking pick a booger and I'm like you know what it's my own house I'll put it

224
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,340
wherever I want the person moving into your house loves eating boogers. Oh if booger bill moves in.

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,860

228
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:36,140
the oven in here here's a question is your boogers ever smelled have your

229
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,020
boogers has your boogers ever smelled?

230
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,020
You put one finger up to like a cartoon professor when you asked that?

231
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,420
But I pose this question to you.

232
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,420
Has your boogers ever smelled?

233
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,420
Has your boogers ever smelled?

234
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
Hmm?

235
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
What say you?

236
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,420
I meant to say this in a normal, smart-sounding way.

237
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Yeah, and you said, "Has your boogers ever smelled?"

238
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:03,420
Like a cabbage, a fucking garbage pail kid in a lab coat asking you that.

239
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,420
How's your boogers ever smell?

240
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,100
Um, but have you ever been like like I I think

241
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,580
Covid definitely made me realize this

242
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:18,780
But like wearing like a mask and then you're like sweating and then you put the mask back on and then just like there's a smell

243
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,780
In your nose, but you don't know what it is

244
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:25,100
That's your breath. No, then you blow your nose you blow your nose and then the smell goes away

245
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:31,260
I don't think my boogers have ever smelled. I don't think stinky boogers my if any if if something

246
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Well, I mean boogers could smell.

247
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
Well, I mean, yeah, but here's the thing about boogers.

248
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,400
I don't think that they could because they're in your nose all the time.

249
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,900
It's like, it's like you don't really taste air that much.

250
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Yeah, but maybe they smell and we don't know.

251
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,900
No, but they pick up maybe things that you smell.

252
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,900
So if you're sitting around fucking huffing pasta carbonara all day,

253
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
you might have some tasty boogers.

254
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,900
But if you're sitting with a mask on your damn face,

255
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,900
this is why I don't wear one,

256
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,900
with a mask on your damn face just fucking breathing breakfast breath

257
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,900
into your damn booger ball,

258
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,500
I mean, you know, I just went for the other B word there, you know, it's kind of a stretch.

259
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
It happens.

260
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,700
But the boogers are gonna smell like fucking dog shit.

261
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Yeah.

262
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,700
I don't know.

263
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
If you want a delicious...

264
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,300
Maybe it's a different smell.

265
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Maybe it's a different smell that I was smelling, but it's like...

266
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,300
Maybe it's their mask.

267
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,740
If you want delicious boogers, you gotta smell something good.

268
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,740
I don't know.

269
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
I don't know.

270
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:25,060
Maybe it's like nose sweat that I'm smelling.

271
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
Could be.

272
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
You think nose sweat?

273
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
Here, I will say this.

274
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:33,500
about once a month. I get a sweaty nose. I get a very sweaty nose. I've seen your sweaty

275
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:39,420
nose. I can vouch for that. His nose gets damn sweaty. Oh dude, trust me. Trust me,

276
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,420
my nose is like a fucking swamp. That's why you have such a thin, fit nose. Do I have

277
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:51,660
a thin... I've never really like analyzed my face. Alright, let's do it. I need a protractor.

278
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,960
Yep

279
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,340
It's there's certainly angles going on here. Yeah, and I don't know

280
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:02,120
angles different round parts shapes hairs are above the eyes

281
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:09,240
Several teeth did several holes in the in different points on the my my eyebrows are very big

282
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,080
I will say I do have big eyebrows. I got some fucking Peter Gallagher shit going on. Yep. I think that's his name

283
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:25,260
Once a month my nose will start exuding a stench that smells like a tire.

284
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
I was just talking about this.

285
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
Wait, really?

286
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
That's what I was trying to describe.

287
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,260
That's what I was trying to fucking describe.

288
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:39,260
No, no, no, this is not a nose sweat. My nose will not sweat. It just smells insane.

289
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,260
You're the one who just said your nose couldn't smell.

290
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,260
The outside of my nose starts smelling like...

291
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,260
How do you know it's the outside of your nose?

292
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Because Jana has smelled the inside of my nose

293
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,260
and the outside of my nose

294
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
and it's the outside of my nose that smells like that.

295
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
Maybe I'm thinking it's boogers

296
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,260
but it's this outside nose thing that you're talking about.

297
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,260
What is going on with us dude?

298
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,260
Because it happens, it doesn't happen often.

299
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,260
But it's like a, it's an industrial smell.

300
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
Yeah.

301
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,260
It is not.

302
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
Yeah, you guys just live in New York.

303
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,260
It does not, no I've had it for years.

304
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Yeah, me too.

305
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,140
I was in Boston and like Manchester and fucking wherever.

306
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:20,300
Do you guys mean just randomly smelling like burning plastic or rubber sometimes?

307
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,220
No, no, it's not that I smell it.

308
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,340
It comes off your nose.

309
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:28,060
Like people around me will smell my fucking weird tires nose.

310
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:32,300
Send us a message request and tell us it's like some condition that-

311
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,740
I need a scientist in my life.

312
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,260
Yeah, every so bad.

313
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,580
Even the stupidest scientists would know about this one.

314
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,340
I need Walter White in my life, dude.

315
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,740
He's a genius scientist.

316
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:41,980
Yeah.

317
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,580
Me and Anna went to the Berkshires over the weekend and on the car ride there,

318
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:51,660
there's a long car ride, we were listening to this true crime podcast that she likes.

319
00:16:51,660 --> 00:17:00,140
It's about this crazy scam where basically this scammer tricks these low-level Hollywood

320
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:04,700
employees into flying to Indonesia for a fake movie shoot, basically.

321
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,740
Oh, I heard about that!

322
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:11,420
Yeah, it's really crazy. But they interview a bunch of the people who got scammed and they're

323
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,780
all like, "Yeah, like when I was in Indonesia, like there was this driver driving me around and I was

324
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,540
so fucking scared. I thought I was gonna die. Like I couldn't get out of there fast enough."

325
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,180
And then they interviewed this one Polish woman who's currently in, they like call her and she's

326
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:31,740
like in out on the scam like right then. And they tell her the scam, she's like, "This is actually

327
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:38,060
really crazy for me to find out. This is really weird that this is like a scam for me. Like I

328
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:46,500
I don't really know what's going on and they find out that it's her second time going to

329
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Indonesia.

330
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
What?

331
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,500
What did they?

332
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,420
She flew to Indonesia and then went back and then came back again.

333
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,020
What did they make them do in Indonesia?

334
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,020
It's this whole thing.

335
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:00,580
They like drive them around and like have them take pictures.

336
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,100
It's just like, it's like this, the person is getting like some weird sexual pleasure

337
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,320
out of it and then they'd like money that like they pay the driver to it's very

You're absolutely right.

352
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,260
It smells like brimstone.

353
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,980

354
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:08,980

366
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
Oh, God.

367
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,540

368
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,540

Fucking bitch!

370
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
That's so funny.

371
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,540
It's so scary.

372
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Yeah.

373
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,300
scary yeah yeah like I started like six years ago and I just remembered it the

374
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,480
other day when he leans back and screams and then when he like sits back up like

375
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,700
there's just like murder and oh yeah it looks like a fucking lizard like he was

376
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:45,220
just thinking of somebody he hated a primal instinct to kill like that's all

377
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,260
you can see in his face yeah big boy he lost all that weight used to be like a

378
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,700
cheery Al Roker type for rap and then all of a sudden he lost all this weight

379
00:19:53,700 --> 00:20:00,100
Oh, so it's like psycho, bro. It's like it's like a situation where he was once fat and they called him big boy

380
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,500
Well, yeah that imagine. Yeah, so like Al Roker same so imagine

381
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:10,620
Forever no, but what if your what if your name was fat Patrick, right?

382
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,340
I'm glad you guys never kept calling me Patrick or anything like that. Yeah, it was too easy, dude

383
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:21,860
I don't go for the easy shit, you know, yeah, you got to go for something complex like like a splat trick. Yeah

384
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,540
Splattrick has been, I've been called Splattrick by a couple people.

385
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,540
Slurple.

386
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,540
Slurple.

387
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,940
The slurpler.

388
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
That's another good one.

389
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,420
Due to your slurpling nature.

390
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,740
The weirdo Patrick, the weirdo idiot.

391
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Yeah.

392
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
He's one that caught on.

393
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,740
Stupid ass.

394
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Fucking F-A-G-I-T.

395
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,420
I got called once.

396
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:41,780
That's fucked up.

397
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,780
That's not a nickname either.

398
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:43,780
Yeah, it's not a nickname.

399
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,780
I hope you know that.

400
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,860
I hope you know they weren't trying to be friendly, Patrick.

401
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,220
They weren't?

402
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,220
No.

403
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,220
Oh.

404
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,860
We need to get you some classes.

405
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:52,860
Yeah?

406
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,860
Yeah, we need you to learn how to-

407
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,860
I have glasses right here.

408
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,860
No, some classes.

409
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,860
Oh, classes?

410
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,260
We need you to learn to defend yourself online.

411
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
Yeah?

412
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,860
We're putting you in a community- we're putting you in a Miller-Mont Technical.

413
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,860
Okay.

414
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
Yep.

415
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
We're sending you to-

416
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,500
I'm gonna learn how to make friends with the guys in my DMs calling me bad names.

417
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:14,940
We're gonna send you to Full Sail University on a $1 scholarship and it's gonna change your

418
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,940
life.

419
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:24,780
You're going to learn how to be a video game developer/homeless guy at Full Sail University.

420
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,780
On my dime, by the way.

421
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,780
You know what?

422
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,780
Did I tell you this already that I almost applied there when I was like 16?

423
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
I think so.

424
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,540
I think we definitely talked about this.

425
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,540
Yeah, I almost went to Full Sail.

426
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,540
Full Sail is so fun.

427
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,020
I almost went to Full Sail for video production.

428
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,900
It's definitely one of the most evil scams.

429
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,540
Yeah, I didn't know that until like, I don't know, I was like 16 or 17 and I was like, I

430
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,980
like there's no way I'm gonna get into a good college with these grades.

431
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,220
That's on par with their like ad campaign where they just like show video games like just to

432
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:57,820
prey on like and like you know kids who live in their parents basements like high schoolers

433
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:02,060
live in their like it's like on par with like the commercials you see on TV where it's like

434
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,860
a predatory like loan company and like the ad is like a 23 year old guy in his mom's basement

435
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,220
and he takes the loan and like turns into a CEO it's like that's just not fair you can't.

436
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:17,060
I feel like you show up for Full Sail University with like a backpack and notebooks and shit

437
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:23,380
and they're like alright first day you're pressing license plates for Arizona.

438
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,940
It's kind of a Mr. Miyagi thing.

439
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,260
We'll work up to the video game design.

440
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,180
Oh man dude.

441
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,180
Evil.

442
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:36,820
Yeah I'm looking at my DM requests.

443
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,300
There's been some pretty funny.

444
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,780
It's funny ass ish.

445
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,780
Funny ass ish that people have been calling me.

446
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,660
You know I love funny ass bullshit.

447
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,780
Can you just fucking spill the beans here?

448
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,260
What are they saying?

449
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,260
Patrick Fridge.

450
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,620
I saw that.

451
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:54,980
Patrick Fridge.

452
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,180
That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

453
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:00,700
Because your name has nothing to do with fridges.

454
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,860
People love to send just funny ass shit.

455
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,300
Oh yeah.

456
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:12,100
When you leave your DMs open, you get a lot of funny, funny DMs from people who will love

457
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,020
you and have your best interest at heart.

458
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:17,580
You will not believe the memes that some of these people find.

459
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,340
How did you find a picture of Nancy Pelosi with giant tits?

460
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,440
I just don't understand.

461
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,120
You are crazy.

462
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
That is just it.

463
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
You're silly.

464
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Send that to someone.

465
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
Especially having a...

466
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,580
You remember like a year ago or something like that?

467
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:37,620
I posted something about a, like it was a stupid like making fun of what those like, oh, if

468
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,820
you idolize, I said like, if you idolize Bart Simpson, you completely misunderstood the

469
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,480
point of the show.

470
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,460
And I got, that was the most anybody has ever been mad at me online.

471
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,380
That's why it's so psychotic that you always think somebody's gonna get mad at you because

472
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,500
you say Moana is a bad movie or something.

473
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,500
Yeah.

474
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,380
Is because that is the thing that people actually get mad at you for.

475
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,380
Oh, dude.

476
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:09,020
Yeah, this guy was like in my DMs telling me to like kill myself, FAGIT, all this other

477
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,020
stuff.

478
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,140
Yeah, I got into like a fight with him.

479
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,540
Like I'll say this, more death threats would be good.

480
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,940
Yeah, more death threats.

481
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,220
I think it keeps life interesting if you think that somebody's gonna kill you.

482
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:28,940
A guy sent me a complete manifesto one time and I, in a video on Google Drive Doc and

483
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,620
I still don't know what was up with that.

484
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,900
If you reach out to me in any way, I'll report your account.

485
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,420
I'll find something you said.

486
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,580
I'm going to get you off the internet.

487
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,580
I'm going to ruin your life.

488
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,580

507
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,260
Even when he tries to work on silence he still keeps going

508
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,260
*makes weird noises*

509
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,260
You're like the chamber.

510
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,260
No, you're more like the chamber.

511
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,260
Yeah, I'm kind of a strong silent type. *makes weird noises*

512
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,260
Wait, wait, guys, try to relate to the dark crystal.

513
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,260
There's veins popping out on Caleb's bald head

514
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,260
because he can't talk because he's trying to be cool

515
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,260
and he's just walking around the target just going

516
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,260
*makes weird noises*

517
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:22,260
Cookies! Cookies on sale!

518
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:30,660
You be the cashier at Qdoba and I'll be me trying to be strong and silent and I'm trying to order.

00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660

Okay, I will take your credit card and I will go home with it.

522
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,060

523
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,540
Oh, I'm entering your credit card into my Amazon account right now.

524
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,180
Excuse me sir, can you hurry up?

525
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,260
Also your pants are down, I can see your ass.

526
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,260
I'm trying to get a burrito.

527
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,260
There's poop running down your leg, sir.

528
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,260
Sir, you're gonna have to go into the bathroom.

529
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,260
By the way, that's gonna cost you.

530
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,260
What's the code?

531
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,260
I lost the voice I was doing.

532
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Sir, you're gonna have to go in the bathroom.

533
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,260
Don't worry, no code to get in.

534
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,260
Okay.

535
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:10,260
Go on in.

536
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,260
Can I get my Pepsi soda?

537
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:14,260
We don't have Pepsi products at Qdoba.

538
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
Do you have a Coke?

539
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,260
We have a Coke Freestyle machine.

540
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
I can't understand you.

541
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,260
I can't understand you, sir.

542
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
Did you say...

543
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
I'm a strong silent type.

544
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:28,260
Did you say "buy Human Giant on DVD on Amazon for free"?

545
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:33,260
Okay, and then another guy walks up and taps you, Caleb, on the shoulder.

546
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,260
Excuse me, are you Agent 47 the hitman?

547
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,260
Maybe.

548
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,260
Your cover has just been blown, sir.

549
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,260
Yeah, you just failed the mission.

550
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,260
I said maybe.

551
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,260
I said maybe.

552
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,260
You're not supposed to speak if you're Agent 47.

553
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,260
Are you saying Mr. Bean?

554
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,260
Yeah.

555
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,260
*laughter*

556
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,260
'Cause he's a strong silent type, too.

557
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,260
*laughter*

558
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:55,260
That's all you have to do.

559
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
It's that easy, dude.

560
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,260
Immediately, I'd be like the head of the Hitman guild.

561
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,260
Yeah?

562
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,260
The assassin.

563
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,260
If you're becoming head of the Hitman guild, I'm head of the Inventors guild now.

564
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,260
Imagine-

565
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
You just left the Inventors guild. You can't be in two guilds at once.

566
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
Imagine Mr. Bean is a Hitman, though.

567
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,260
Yeah.

568
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,260
*muffled voice*

569
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,260
Can I use your bathroom?

570
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:22,940
He talks like that right Mr. Bean he does talk like that, but he doesn't say that in words.

571
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,940
Hello, I am Mr. Bean.

572
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,120
Yeah, can I use your a rest room? You're sounding like Mr. Frijole.

573
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,700
Mr. Frijole, is that some made-up guy?

574
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,580
Senior Frijole?

575
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,100
No. Is that the voice you're doing? Yeah. Yeah, I'm doing Senior Frijole. Yeah. Yeah, it is fun.

576
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,700
Do you think they call him that and like in other countries when they localize it? He's still Mr. Bean?

577
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,780
Maybe. Wait, that's actually... I can guarantee in Mexico he's not called

578
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:52,780
"Senor Frijole." Probably "Senor Bean." I was gonna say that's ridiculous, but they

579
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:56,620
they do shit like that all the time when they localize. So one second. Yeah, "Bob Esponja."

580
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:03,980
"Bob Esponja." Yeah. Localized. How do... Do you think it's just Mr. because it might just be

581
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:07,900
Mr. because it's a name. Yeah, I feel, you know, I feel like they just call him his name. All right,

582
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:14,460
I'm looking up, I'm looking up Mr. Bean worldwide. Just Mr. Worldwide. People get the idea.

583
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,500
I don't know what to search to find the answer to this.

584
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,380
Mr. Search, Senor Frijoles, see if it comes up.

585
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:25,100
Well, I don't want to know if it's Senor Frijoles, I just want to know what they call them.

586
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,300
So Senor Frijoles is a website.

587
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,820
It's a Mexican restaurant in Key Largo.

588
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:33,180
Mr. Bean's Restaurant?

589
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,380
Is it like a...

590
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,500
I would hate to eat there.

591
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,740
It's like a Margaritaville situation?

592
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,020
No, it has nothing to do with...

593
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:42,300
Dude, they got a pic, go to images, check out their logo.

594
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,060

Oh, it's too easy, dude.

613
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:33,860
All right, so today's list is the top 10 best things to eat with milk.

614
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,940
From the top 10s by user Fox Rocks.

615
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,340
Milk goes great with lots of food.

616
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,340
What's the best?

617
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:47,220
We were at some like, a friend's birthday the other day, we were at like some like fucking

618
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:54,900
hippie Bushwick bar and our friend wanted the Mets game on and I asked the bartender,

619
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,500
I was like, "Hey, can you put the Mets game on?

620
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,500
It's channel 36."

621
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:01,420
turned it on and just every TV in the bar turned to Fox News.

622
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
Yeah.

623
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,100
And we were just watching the Lauren Ingram Show.

624
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,820
Yeah.

625
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,820
Number one, cookies.

626
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
Cookies.

627
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:11,820
Cookies.

628
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,820
Cookies.

629
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:13,820
Cookies.

630
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,820
Come with me.

631
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Yeah.

632
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:21,060
You know, I mean, there's no argument here, but I mean, there is, I think there's a little,

633
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:24,580
I guess it can be disputed between number one and number two here.

634
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:26,540
Are you guys milk drinkers?

635
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,740
Before we move on to that, no I hate milk too.

636
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,020
I switched out with milk.

637
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,500
I would never drink, oh yeah I drink almond milk now,

638
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:36,480
but I wouldn't drink, I mean I would have milk and cereal

639
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,620
or like with stuff.

640
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,340
I would never just drink straight milk.

641
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,960
I drink milk after cookies have been dipped in it.

642
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,020
I think drinking, you know and it's interesting

643
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,300
'cause before I've said I think drinking a whole glass

644
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,820
of milk is psycho behavior just to drink milk on its own

645
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,620
and you know Patrick made a lot of fun of me

646
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,180
for saying that so it's kind of interesting

647
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,700
that he's turned now and seen my way of life.

648
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:01,300
Dude, I just know I know and there's actually video evidence of that too. You know, it was on stream

649
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:07,020
Well, I think it's fine to drink a glass of milk, but like oh now you can't even stick to his guns

650
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,900
Let me like Hillary Clinton. Let me let me clarify because

651
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,780
Ten minutes to fit to think of like how you want to try and weasel your way out of this one. I know

652
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:21,660
Shut up, shut up, let me let me fucking okay

653
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:30,100
I'm waiting. It's fine to drink a glass of milk, but the process in which that you get the milk is very weird

654
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,100
Go to the store. So now I can understand.

655
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:38,060
Yeah, like who would be the first guy who saw a cow and was like I'm gonna drink whatever comes out of milk, right?

656
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,460
Yeah, I've actually been thinking about this. Who's the first guy who saw a bug?

657
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,460
I'm saying I'm starting to see...

658
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,460
Who's the first guy who saw like chewing gum?

659
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,460
It's like I'm gonna chew this but not eat it.

660
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,460
I'm gonna chew on this gum.

661
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:51,460
Cameron, I'm trying to...

662
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,660
I'm trying to gum for nothing right now. I think I'm gonna use it to chew. I'm trying

663
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,260
to fix our friendship. Who's the first guy who saw a lollipop with no stick and was like

664
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,340
I wish I could eat this with a stick in it. Yeah, I'm trying to fix our friendship Cameron.

665
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:07,940
And I'm trying to work on some killer open mic material. So can you give some space dude?

666
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,220
Okay. My grandfather when him and my grandma would come over for dinner when I was growing

667
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:17,100
up my mom would make like salad or pasta or some shit and every single time my grandpa

668
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:21,840
would bring he would just walk in with a gallon of milk and a pre-made hamburger

669
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:30,620
patty every like a couple weeks and they'd come for dinner

670
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,300
that's such a sick move just like don't have no idea what's being served and

671
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:40,580
you're just you know what you want mm-hmm I just want to there's just two

672
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:44,540
comments on the cookies one what did Cameron say about I got distracted I

673
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,540
I don't remember.

674
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,540
What did I say?

675
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:50,220
You said something about me weaseling my way out of something about milk.

676
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,220
Are you serious?

677
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,220
You forgot that?

678
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,400
Yeah, I just did.

679
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,400
You forgot that you guys had a-

680
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,400
It's okay, we're not talking about that anyway.

681
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,400
You know what?

682
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,940
It's fine, buddy.

683
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,740
You can just do your own thing.

684
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,460
I don't want anyone to be mad at me about this milk thing.

685
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,100
I don't think anyone's going to be mad at you about milk.

686
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,380
Who's going to be mad at you?

687
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,380
I don't know.

688
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,380
About the milk thing.

689
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Cameron?

690
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,380
I'm not mad at you.

691
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:12,380
Have you guys ever had raw milk?

692
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,380
I'm furious.

693
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,380
No.

694
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,220
- What the fuck is that dude?

695
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,060
That shit's crazy.

696
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,880
- I know, it's nuts.

697
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,180
It's so funny that people,

698
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,700
people break the law,

699
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:24,720
like they go to insane lengths to sell that shit.

700
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,200
- That shit, I've had a sip of it before.

701
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,960
It's like the difference between smoking weed and eating it.

702
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:32,000
- Yeah, what if I could drink milk,

703
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,860
but I could also have whatever pus comes out of the pimples

704
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,920
that's inside of a cow's tit too?

705
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,940
- See, that's why I switched to oat milk.

706
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,220
- Oat milk, yeah, it's better too.

707
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,940
It's like if they made like,

708
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,220
like flushing the toilet,

709
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,960
not flushing the toilet illegal

710
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,700
and people were like looking for toilets

711
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,300
filled with shit in them to use.

712
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,140
- Exactly.

713
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,960
- They were like, I have to,

714
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,820
I will risk going to jail

715
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,660
so that I can just fucking piss on shit.

716
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:57,500
- You can go to jail for drinking raw milk?

717
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
- Probably not. - Yeah, it's illegal.

718
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,780
No, no, you can't.

719
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,940
It's illegal to sell raw milk. - I don't think you can go

720
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,900
to jail.

721
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,340
- Yeah, you fucking, it's illegal to sell raw milk.

722
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,900
You'd probably get fined, okay, but you--

723
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,940
- But you get fined enough times you go to jail.

724
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,100
- That's true, all of a sudden, dude,

725
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,240
You're part of the, you're having to choose a race.

726
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,360
It's cause of the like, CDC doesn't let you sell it or something.

727
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,480
CDC doesn't let you do a lot of stuff.

728
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,480
It's true.

729
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
Baskin Robbins, no mask.

730
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,040
Can you eat your own cum?

731
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,040
Is that illegal?

732
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,380
It's illegal.

733
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,380
Not illegal yet, should be.

734
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,640
Does that break like an incest law?

735
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Yes.

736
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,080
You can't cum in your own mouth?

737
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,760
You can't drink your dad's cum.

738
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,480
What's happening in this damn world?

739
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,320
Can't fucking drink your dad's cum or your own cum.

740
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,560
- He's pastored at first, that's all.

741
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,400
- True.

742
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,240
- You know what?

743
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,060
- If you homogenize your cum, it's probably fine.

744
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,260
- Yeah, I mean, Louis Pasteur was a crook.

745
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,800
- Great trumpet player though.

746
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:50,640
- Yeah.

747
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,480
- Yeah.

748
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,200
- No, that was Dizzy Gillespie.

749
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:57,440
- Dizzy Lesby?

750
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,280
- Dizzy Gillespie.

751
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,040
- Now you're speaking my language.

752
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,740
- Dizzy Gillespie was, he had like,

753
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,460
I've talked about Dizzy Gillespie to you guys

754
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,040
before, his like big pouches,

755
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,420
where he would like blow into the trumpet

756
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,260
and his whole face would expand.

757
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,700
- Oh yeah, dude, that guy rules.

758
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,540
- Yeah.

759
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,020
- That guy's a fucking beast.

760
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,980
- Dude, his episode of the Muppets, great.

761
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,820
Great episode.

762
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,340
- Someone says, "Without cookies,

763
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,420
"milk tastes like nothing."

764
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,620
You need to go to the hospital.

765
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,460
- Yeah, that's--

766
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,820
- You think milk tastes like nothing?

767
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,260
- Okay, 2% milk doesn't taste like anything.

768
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,180
- What?

769
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,020
- Yeah.

770
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,140
- What the fuck are you talking,

771
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,420
milk is like such a distinctive taste.

772
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,100
- 2% milk tastes like water.

773
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,620
- Okay, you have diabetes.

774
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:40,700
something and i don't have that you have diabetes and i'm gonna chop your leg off

775
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,380
because if you think milk tastes like nothing you're psyched up whole milk i

776
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,840
don't think i don't think milk tastes like nothing but i also don't drink

777
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,960
plain milk so i'm not going to do it is spicy

778
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,580
i'll let my friends fight slain it's by a it has a lot of these places in the

779
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,620
civil it's

780
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:00,020
it's a little man is that there's a white color that makes it so spicy it's

781
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:03,060
really a white like a white like a ghost milk

782
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:10,700
Ghosts like a ghost pepper. Yeah, if you ever have had pepperidge farms bread can get very spicy too, especially the potato bread

783
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:16,220
Yeah, nothing is spicier than a potato. God. I ever had I have to lick the ground after I eat that shit

784
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:19,740
It's like eating it. It's like eating a fire. You ever had the hostess bread

785
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:26,940
No, is it that chocolate bread? No. No, it's like garden hostess like whole wheat bread

786
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,860
They sell it at like like 7-eleven whole wheat. Well, it's gotta be good for you, dude. It smells rancid

787
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:39,860
We got serious fucking summer nose vibes. It's like the fucking...

788
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:50,860
like... it's bread, right? Bread's like two, three ingredients, but hostess bread, the ingredient list is like a fucking paragraph.

789
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,860
I gotta give it to you, you're amazing at explaining this. It's like I'm watching How It's Made right now.

790
00:38:55,860 --> 00:39:01,860
This is incredible. It's basically really fucked up the way they make this bread. There's way too many ingredients.

791
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:05,860
The amount of preservatives in Hostess bread is insane.

792
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:16,860
I mean, honestly, like, Survival of the Fittest style, if you see bread that has the Hostess logo on it, and you're like, "I'm going to buy this bread," you deserve to have pickled insides.

793
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,860
Yeah, I agree.

794
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:21,860
Sometimes, you need bread, and it's the only bread that they have.

795
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,860
What fucking store has only Hostess bread? Are you going to like a candy store or something?

796
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,860
7-Eleven and the convenience store that was near my old apartment.

797
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,900
Then go to a different one.

798
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,300
I didn't want to walk all the way to another store.

799
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,300
If you choose to eat Hostess bread.

800
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:40,620
Again, if you can't walk long enough to get normal bread and you're eating the Hostess

801
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:44,460
bread, you're double dipping in fucking carcinogens there.

802
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,060
You deserve to have your body be your own personal sarcophagus.

803
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,180
You're going to be buried.

804
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
My body's a damn temple.

805
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,780
Yeah, the freaking temple of doom.

806
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,140
I mean, what's up with that movie, Indiana Jones?

807
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,580
Kids eating eyeball soup.

808
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,980
number two is oreos. I didn't even read the comments I wanted to read. Too bad.

809
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:07,780
Let's pretend they're about oreos. I remember when I was in primary school and

810
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,500
when they served cookies and milk for dessert at lunch and they asked you if

811
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,660
you wanted milk with your cookie I would always refuse because for some reason I

812
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,980
don't like drinking milk out of a cup. My friend however is the complete opposite.

813
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:22,300
He loves drinking milk. Don't drink milk out of a cup. And then here's his

814
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:27,620
friend if you scroll down. Biscuits and milk is the best combination. The

815
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,980
The sweetness of the biscuits and the faint taste of milk, which makes the biscuits/cookies

816
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,340
linger in your mouth a little longer.

817
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,940
Ah, Moans, it's the best.

818
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:42,180
That is a very proper Top 10s user.

819
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,180
Vile.

820
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,180
Horrible.

821
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,180
Yeah.

822
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,220
I mean, vile, first of all, it's not a biscuit, dude.

823
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,220
A biscuit?

824
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,060
To have the audacity to call it a biscuit and then say biscuit/cookie after that, it's

825
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,060
like, no, you've made your bed.

826
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,340
Yeah, what's the difference between a biscuit and a cookie over there?

827
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:03,420
A biscuit is made by the poorest, fattest woman in the universe and she serves it to you at

828
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,540
a barbecue place.

829
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:09,980
And a cookie is a very awful word for a type of person over there.

830
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,980
Yeah.

831
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,980
What?

832
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,500
You know what they call, you know how we call cigarettes cigarettes and they call it something

833
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
else?

834
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
That's like how cookies are here.

835
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,500
That's why they say biscuits.

836
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Ah.

837
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,500
Yeah.

838
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Yeah.

839
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,500
Didn't know that.

840
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,500
Yeah.

841
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Yeah, it's true.

842
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,540
So you might think twice before you say cookie from now on.

843
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Uh huh.

844
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,540
Mm hmm.

845
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,700
Uh, number two, Oreos.

846
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,700
That's a cookie.

847
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,700
Oh shit!

848
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:39,020
Who were you saying that to?

849
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,060
Here's what you went for is that's a cookie.

850
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,060
That is a cookie.

851
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,660
Ugh, I had too much fucking caffeine, dude.

852
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,140
It's having an opposite effect now.

853
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,980
Two caffeinated drinks cancel each other out.

854
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,620
I have plenty of caffeine all the time and I don't find myself calling people British slurs. So yeah

855
00:41:56,620 --> 00:42:00,660
I don't even remember what this episode is about. What are we talking about? It's about you're lying

856
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,060
That's the most you can scroll up on the web, but you're acting

857
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:10,940
This is like when this is like when a kid drinks a Capri Sun for the first time and like runs in circles around the house

858
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,500
It's like this feels like it gives me superpowers. Mm-hmm

859
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,300
You've never had sugar before. Yeah, you are on it's like you're it's like a sugar

860
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,860
it's like when you eat a brownie and you're like i'm having a total sugar

861
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:23,660
rush right now and you find out they're sugar-free brownies all along

862
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,700

You're eating Popeye's biscuit with no Bev?

880
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:57,740
Yes, I would, what's, what's, what?

881
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,740
It's so dry!

882
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:03,740
You just sit in the bathtub all day dunking biscuits and Oreos into the water?

883
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,740
I sit in the gravy bath, yeah.

884
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,740
And just fucking, you are crazy.

885
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,980
Oreos are not that dry compared to other cookies.

886
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:10,980
They have like-

887
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,980
Oreos are pretty dry.

888
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:12,980
No.

889
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:13,980
I'll tell you what's dry.

890
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,980
A damn goddamn Belvita, dude.

891
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,980
No, no, no, no.

892
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,980
Not compared to like fucking like Chips Ahoy.

893
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,820
Like any other, any other like snack cookie is way drier than an Oreo.

894
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,820
All cookies are pretty dry.

895
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:27,420
That's because Oreos are some of the least dry cookies.

896
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:29,780
Oreos are pretty dry.

897
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:30,780
No.

898
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:31,780
Yes.

899
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:32,780
No.

900
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,780
You're stupid.

901
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,780
I'm not stupid about this.

902
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,780
You're very stupid.

903
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:36,780
You need your mouth water checked up on.

904
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,180
I have a lot of saliva.

905
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,020
Thank you very much.

906
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,980
- You need to get a tiny mechanic under that tongue.

907
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:42,580
- Come on over.

908
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:43,940
- I'm not a tiny mechanic.

909
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:44,780
- Yes you are.

910
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:45,740
- We're the same size.

911
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,380
- Okay.

912
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:49,520
- All right, I'm over.

913
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,060
I'll be over right after this with my little--

914
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:53,900
- Little wrench.

915
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,180
- With the tech deck that I use to go under tongues.

916
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:57,140
- Yeah. (laughs)

917
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:58,700
- And check it out.

918
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:00,460
- Number three, cereal.

919
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,540
Milk enhances the taste or cereals

920
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,340
while cereals make the milk taste better.

921
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,220
You can't go wrong.

922
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,500
While with cake and cookies, milk can seriously,

923
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,260
like spelled like cereal,

924
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,980
destroy the taste of the cookie.

925
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,340
Fun fact, the original name of cereals was Cereal

926
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,660
and is a Latin corruption, which means unreal

927
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,180
because Paul the first considered cereals

928
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:22,380
to be the unreal gift from God.

929
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,180
The fun fact here is however,

930
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:27,240
that my story is a bowl of bull.

931
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,080
- Whoa.

932
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:28,920
- Are you serious?

933
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,180
You're gonna tell us all this and then just lie?

934
00:45:31,180 --> 00:45:32,260
- Did you guys fall for it?

935
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:33,580
- Yeah, we'll fall for it.

936
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,860
- Here's a great comment, "Love my milk."

937
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:38,180
- Love my milk.

938
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,620
- Love, I just, you know what?

939
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,260
It doesn't matter what the item is, I love my damn milk.

940
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,340
- Aw, love my milk.

941
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,260
- You can't eat cereal without milk,

942
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:49,200
and then it says, "I sometimes eat cereal without milk."

943
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,780
- Dude, when I buy a house, I'm putting up

944
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:52,460
one of those live, laugh, love type signs

945
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:53,820
that says, "Love my milk."

946
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,640
- Yeah.

947
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,540
- Like those letters you put above the stairs.

948
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,460
- I welcome that.

949
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,300
- Yeah.

950
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,180
- Love my milk.

951
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:00,780
In this house, we love my milk.

952
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:02,300
- I'll have another one on the other wall that says,

953
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,540
"I hate milk, so I will not eat or drink anything

954
00:46:04,540 --> 00:46:09,340
with milk inside it's rubbish. I hate milk I'm the evil guy who lives in this house

955
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:14,420
who hates milk. The M in both of those could be an udder. That's clever that's

956
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:19,820
good. It couldn't be an udder. It's like an outside tiny udder. Yeah you've never seen an udder

957
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,700
then. I've seen an udder. Udders are like they're like they're like spider eyes there's like

958
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,740
millions of things coming off of those. There's not a million udders. Well you just put the things coming off of them.

959
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,400
the M is like the shape of the utter and then yeah look at look up cartoon cow

960
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:43,580
look up em look up letter M as utter cartoon cow okay looks up M utter and

961
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:51,340
I'm looking here all right tough mudder it's a obstacle race nice I was that one

962
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,860
of those ones where you like fucking climb through shit yeah and then so they

963
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:57,720
take photos of you in the middle and they're like this guy's basically a

964
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:02,120
marine because he did a mud run yeah or like what's that one where they throw

965
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:07,200
fucking colors on you the color run what are these people doing dude how hard is

966
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:11,440
it on a normal mile well you got to throw obstacles I mean I guess the

967
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,440
obstacles make it fun but like you have to run from is it like the is it like

968
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:20,440
the zone in fortnight where you have to run from the colors as they chase you I

969
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,760
that's it yeah I think they I think they spray them I think there's parts you run

970
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:28,200
through where they're spraying them. So does that mean that you win or you lose?

971
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,480
No, you're supposed to like it. Why would you like being blue? Because it proves that you ran the

972
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,060
run. I don't know. Just walking into the cashier, the 7-eleven after, just being

973
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:43,280
like, "I bet you can guess where I came from!" It's the same thing as like, well, it's

974
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,640
like, you know, being on like a bar crawl or something. Yeah. And you're wearing

975
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,520

980
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,920
Santa con is not cool it is cool dude said one of the few Christian holidays

00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,880
live laugh love stuff and how there's like one good one and one evil one.

983
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,380
Yeah.

984
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:27,000
Do you ever think about how if you had like a live laugh love sign if you look at it in the mirror

985
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,480
it says evil evil.

986
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,000
It's true.

987
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,920
That is so true dude.

988
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,480
Damn.

989
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,840
I didn't even think of that dude.

990
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,560
It's so cool.

991
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,920
Wow.

992
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:42,840
Imagine going to the bathroom and you look in the bathroom mirror and you just see a

993
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:45,400
sign behind you that says evil evil.

994
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,080
I would run out of there instantly.

995
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:52,520
Or you get pulled into the mirror universe and it says fucking die scream fart.

996
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:55,240
You get pulled into the mirror universe and it says live laugh love again.

997
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:55,800
And you go oh.

998
00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,040
Yeah, you go wait a second. I'm just in the normal universe.

999
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:06,200
Fuck. I needed to go to the mirror universe to get a backward soda.

1000
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,640
A backward soda?

1001
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,320
It's just an idea, you know. Like I said, I'm a casual inventor. I just throw them out. I don't

1002
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,640
I don't worry about that patent shit.

1003
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,140
I leave that for the nerds.

1004
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,980
- Yeah.

1005
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,480
- I'm kind of a creative genius like Walt Disney.

1006
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,400
- Water, soda, adapter.

1007
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,040
So you can put soda in a water cup

1008
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
or water in a soda cup.

1009
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,680
- How about a soda scream?

1010
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,080
- Okay, hold on.

1011
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,220
- 'Cause it's already making a noise,

1012
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:29,520
but you press that button down, it goes.

1013
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,780
(screaming)

1014
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,480
Huh?

1015
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:34,840
- Maybe, yeah.

1016
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,480
- How about a scream scream?

1017
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,600
- Maybe tone it down.

1018
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,680
- Okay.

1019
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:41,640
- What about scream?

1020
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,080
What about whipping scream?

1021
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,080
Scream 2.

1022
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,520
What about scream of tartar?

1023
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Okay.

1024
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,880
You know?

1025
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:54,080
What is scream of tartar?

1026
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:59,520
It's a weird fucked up little dust that you fucking put on shit and it makes it bubble

1027
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:00,520
or something.

1028
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,520
Okay.

1029
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,520
Yeah.

1030
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:03,520
It's white too.

1031
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,320
Number 4, brownies.

1032
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,480
I don't like brownies, dude.

1033
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:08,480
I don't either.

1034
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,480
I don't need that.

1035
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,480
Really?

1036
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,480
I don't need that in my life.

1037
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,480
I don't like sweet bread.

1038
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,280
- No, no, no, sweet bread is good, but like,

1039
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,400
brownies and like cake, I hate.

1040
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:19,520
- I like brownies a lot.

1041
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,880
I don't really care about cake,

1042
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:23,960
but brownie with ice cream, that's very good.

1043
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,040
- I don't eat anything fudgy.

1044
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,280
- It needs to have the other thing.

1045
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,560
Like, it needs to have like--

1046
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,080
- Yeah, I mean, I still would eat a plain brownie,

1047
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,380
but a brownie with ice cream is another level.

1048
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,440
- A waffle with ice cream on it, amazing.

1049
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,320
A brownie with ice cream on it, amazing.

1050
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,800
- Waffle might be the most versatile food.

1051
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,680
- Oh yeah, waffle on its own great,

1052
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,400
but brownie on its own, no.

1053
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,520
- No, agree.

1054
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,960
- I disagree.

1055
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,240
- But like a cookie, if it's like a double fudge cookie

1056
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,500
where the cookie itself is chocolate, I can't do that.

1057
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,800
But if it's just like a chocolate chip cookie, that's good.

1058
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,680
- I'm not a huge chocolate fan, dude.

1059
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,520
- Me neither.

1060
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,840
- Yeah, I don't have any ailments that need to be cured.

1061
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:03,000
- I'm a gummies guy.

1062
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,760
That's my sweet.

1063
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:05,580
- You're a gummies guy?

1064
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,840
- That makes sense.

1065
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:08,680
- Yeah?

1066
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,500
- Makes a lot of sense.

1067
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,600
- 'Cause you're a little gummy bear.

1068
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,200
You put a gummy worm on the end of a fishing rod

1069
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,760
and stand in an alley and--

1070
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:15,600
Yeah, you could catch me.

1071
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,720
And dangle it out in front of the toy store.

1072
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,560
You catch yourself.

1073
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,400
No, you do that.

1074
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,400
No, I don't do that.

1075
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,620
You set up a whole Rube Goldberg machine

1076
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,560
to catch you with a gummy worm.

1077
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:26,640
That's what you do.

1078
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,260
It's the only way I can eat gummies

1079
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,920
without feeling guilty about it.

1080
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,200
Yeah, 'cause somebody else is doing it.

1081
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,040
You know what I had last night?

1082
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,660
I had the Haribo fruit mix.

1083
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:38,920
That's my recommendation for the week.

1084
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:40,080
You said that like you just had

1085
00:51:40,080 --> 00:52:03,080
like

1086
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:05,080
Nerds Rope? Is that what it's called?

1087
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,080
It's to die for, absolutely. It's beautiful.

1088
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:15,080
And you open the Laffy Taffy and you look at it, and you look at the wrapper of the Laffy Taffy and there's a little joke on the wrapper.

1089
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,080
And you can read it to your friends and you can have...

1090
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,080
It's amazing. It's absolutely amazing.

1091
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,080
It's great for a social situation.

1092
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:23,080
It's amazing for social scenarios.

1093
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,080
A perfect dinner party hors d'oeuvre.

1094
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,080
Like this one, this one, it says here, it says here...

1095
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,080
Oh fuck I don't know any.

1096
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,080
I don't know any Laffy Taffy jokes.

1097
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,080
What did the girl say to Pinocchio while he was fucking eating her out?

1098
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:40,080
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1099
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,080
Laffy on Laffy Taffy.

1100
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:44,080
Lie to me Pinocchio. Come on Laffy Taffy let's go.

1101
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,080
Dirty Laffy Taffy.

1102
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:48,080
She said Laffy Taffy.

1103
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,080
Laffy Taffy let's go.

1104
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,080
Lie to me Pinocchio. Fucking put your nose in my cunt.

1105
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,080
Come on Laffy Taffy.

1106
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:56,080
Laffy Taffy.

1107
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,080
Laffy Taffy Pinocchio.

1108
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:00,080
Pinocchio! Laffy Taffy!

1109
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,080
Laffy Taffy!

1110
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,080
That's one of my favorite Laffy Taffy jokes.

1111
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,080
I got a Laffy Taffy for Pinocchio.

1112
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,080
It's a really long answer, it's like a whole paragraph.

1113
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,080
Come on Pinocchio, Laffy Taffy!

1114
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:12,080
Using a jeweler's loop to read it.

1115
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,080
I think that they should put

1116
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,080
at the end of the Snapple Facts

1117
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,080
they should put "Snapple Out".

1118
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,080
That'd be pretty good.

1119
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:22,080
They should put "Just Kidding" at the end of the Snapple Facts.

1120
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,080
Just kidding, you idiot.

1121
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,080
Fuck you, stupid.

1122
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:33,080

1141
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,640
I hate milk so whenever I get milk with cinnamon rolls I eat a million rolls and

00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,760

Poppin' Fresh? Yeah. I thought it was Doughboy. No, he is the Pillsbury Doughboy and his name is

I don't wanna put nothing in your damn dough boy.

1156
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,600
You brought some nasty crap today

1157
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,580
and honestly, I'm not here for it.

1158
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:24,280
Number six. - Yeah, it's an off day for me.

1159
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,120
- A cake.

1160
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,800
- Seven doughnuts, eight chocolate,

1161
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,800
don't care, doesn't matter.

1162
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,800
Nine pie, top comment.

1163
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,000
Apple pie be the best.

1164
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,360
In Kolkata, you get the best at park.

1165
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,200
- True.

1166
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:37,640
(laughing)

1167
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,920
- That's facts.

1168
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,000
- Pop tarts.

1169
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,300
Pop-tarts are life.

1170
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,900
So when pop-tarts and milk are together,

1171
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,420
it was instant heaven.

1172
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,260
- It's true.

1173
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:46,340
- Can't eat without milk.

1174
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:48,040
It's a great breakfast.

1175
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,480
- I don't like pop-tarts.

1176
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,560
- Really?

1177
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,400
- I think maybe--

1178
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,140
- I think there's like one or two flavors that are okay,

1179
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:58,440
but all in all, that's a food you gotta grow out of

1180
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,500
by high school or else you're a permanent child.

1181
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:05,260
- See, if you're like me and you just ate too many of them

1182
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:07,420
for breakfast every day, you just get sick of 'em,

1183
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:09,280
that's what you have to do, I think.

1184
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,160
If you're a grown-up though, you can indulge every once in a while in a cinnamon pop tart.

1185
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,760
If you get one of these fruity ones or a s'mores pop tart.

1186
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,400
Oh, the brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts?

1187
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:24,760
You have something wrong with you if you're eating a fucking confetti strawberry pop tart.

1188
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,840
Yeah, the brown cinnamon are the good ones.

1189
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:27,840
The s'mores pop tarts?

1190
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,400
Those are the only ones that I would...

1191
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,640
Exactly, the s'mores ones are good, but again, those are ones that if you're eating those,

1192
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:37,640
you're older than like 16, you're gonna be shipped away.

1193
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,120
Yeah just make a damn s'more you fucking weirdo.

1194
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,120
I ate too many s'mores as a kid.

1195
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,120
Yeah just sit up.

1196
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,120
Come on dude.

1197
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:48,620
Every man gets home from a long day of work at the DEA.

1198
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:51,480
You get home, you fucking pop a swathe.

1199
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,120
You see the divorce papers that your wife left on the table for you to sign, you light

1200
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,440
them on fire, you cook a nice s'more above them.

1201
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,000
Yeah, throw a nice s'more on the grill, pour yourself some scotch.

1202
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,560
Come on dude.

1203
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,080
Pour the scotch on the grill.

1204
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,080
Grow up.

1217
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,040
But you know I live here, and he's here, maybe twice a week, so I don't want to make an enemy

1218
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,880
I'm right now. It's a non-fortune. He might be he might be happy to talk about weed

1219
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,160
But you know I don't want to start anything

1220
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:20,320
Definitely, and you don't want to deal with some fucking drug addict also there. I'm a waste oid oh my god

1221
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,640
It's like junky track marks all over his arm from I wish the Punisher was real

00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:27,080

Number 18, Twinkies.

00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,440
It says, "Me and my buds call this Twanky Milk."

1227
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:46,560
Twanky Milk.

1228
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:51,040
Kids in high school come up with the most fucked up combination foods.

I knew this dude who would he would put like a handful of after dinner mints in a glass of milk and then he drink

1230
00:59:56,980 --> 01:00:01,520
Oh and the after dinner mints would make like a paste at the bottom of the cup and then he'd eat that

1231
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,720
Are you serious? I swear to God

1232
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,340
We have a similar situation here on number 20

1233

Dip it in taste, wink emoji.

1242
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:50,940
It was just milk.

1243
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:54,720
That's a prank on someone who likes cotton candy but doesn't know what happens when you

1244
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:55,720
eat it.

1245
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:58,020
Yeah, no seriously, put this cotton candy in the milk.

1246
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,620
Put a bunch of water on your cotton candy.

1247
01:00:59,620 --> 01:01:00,620
See what happens.

1248
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,060
It'll be really funny and delicious.

1249

Yeah, then just throw it away cuz you can't fucking eat it anymore.

1255
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,560
Right, well I would eat it. I would eat it.

1256
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,260
Turns into fucking Teflon, dude.

Yeah, so bad.

1258
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:24,260
You could stop a train.

01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,260
Disgusting.

1260
01:01:25,260 --> 01:01:29,760
Number 31's hamburger, and the only comment is, "I do this every day."

That is my grandfather, dude.

1262
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:34,260
Oh, fuck.

1263
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,260
Milk and a burger.

1264
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:37,260
Milk and a burger, nothing better than that.

1265
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,260
Well, that was before they invented fries.

1266
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:43,760
Cola, cheese, yogurt, butter, ramen noodles.

1267
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:44,760
Pear.

1268
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:45,760
What is rusk?

1269
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,760
I don't know.

1270
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:50,760
A hard dry biscuit or twice baked bread.

1271
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:51,760
A hard dry biscuit?

1272
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,760
This techno shit's gone too far.

1273
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,760
It is sometimes used as a teether for babies.

1274
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:58,760
Oh fuck.

1275
01:01:58,760 --> 01:01:59,760
Mentos.

1276
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,760
Number 50 vanilla wafers.

1277
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,760
Holy Jesus Christo, these are good.

1278
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:16,840
flavors. Holy Jesus Christo, these are good. Oh my God. I've put Coca-Cola and milk, not

1279
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,760
very good. Yeah? Yeah, don't recommend it. How the fuck would that ever be good? I don't

1280
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,960
know, fucking milk and Coca-Cola. You know what? You should put milk in the Freestyle

1281
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,380
machines. Yeah. You should, dude. Mix it all up. You should be able to put different flavors

1282
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:35,760
of milk. No, you know what it should be? Okay, here's my invention. We're replacing Freestyle,

1283
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,440
or they're putting an update in freestyle machines.

1284
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,420
You can choose as many as you want,

1285
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,760
like as many different things as you want,

1286
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,180
but every additional thing you add,

1287
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,500
there's a growing chance that it will just add milk

1288
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:48,340
without telling you.

1289
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,320
(laughing)

1290
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:50,880
- He's playing Russian roulette.

1291
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,240
- Exactly, yeah.

1292
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,840
So if you just want one thing, that's fine.

1293
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,280
You don't get any milk.

1294
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:57,000
Two different things mixed together,

1295
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,960
there's about a 20% chance there's some milk

1296
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,120
getting plopped in there.

1297
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:03,000
- I think you've finally become an inventor, dude.

1298
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And we call it the Coca-Cola unfree style.

1299
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,240
Oh my God, dude.

1300
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:13,240
- The Coca-Cola battle rap.

1301
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,360
- Battle Royale Coca-Cola free machine.

1302
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,760
- Yeah, Coca-Cola battle Royale.

1303
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:19,360
- That's pretty good, dude.

1304
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:20,920
All right, I will go pee now.

1305
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:21,760
- Yeah. - All right.

1306
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:22,800
- Bye. - Bye.
