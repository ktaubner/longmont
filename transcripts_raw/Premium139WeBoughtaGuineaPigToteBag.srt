(laughing)

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,880
(explosion)

9
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,720
- I don't wanna blow my voice out.

10
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,960
- Okay, I just started recording,

11
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,160
so they actually heard him ranting.

12
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,960
Everyone heard him ranting and being rude to me just now.

13
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,800
- Nobody heard me ranting and raving.

14
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,440
- You see the physical assault

15
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,040
that Cameron deals with every day in this office.

16
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,840
- Yeah, it's a physical sonic assault.

17
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,680
- It's not physical, it's soul.

18
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,200
- It's physical, the sound waves,

19
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,240
but they vibrate my body and give me bruises. You're a loud voice.

20
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,040
It's a

21
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:40,740
wow. We are seriously on our Alvin and the chipmunk show. That was so

22
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,200
beautiful. We can make really good three chipmunks. Alex and the chipmunks?

23
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,780
That's a different show. What are you talking about? It's not Alex and the

24
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:49,200
chipmunks.

25
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,920
No, he goes,

26
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,600
oh, okay.

27
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,160
No, no, you guys are completely wrong.

28
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,480
He goes, "Alvis!"

29
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,320
Elvis?

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah, 'cause they sing, it's Elvis and the Chipmunks.

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
Oh, it's like the movie that just came out.

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
He goes, "Elvis!"

33
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,220
There's a new Elvis and the Chipmunks movie?

34
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,060
Yeah.

35
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:07,900
Really?

36
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,120
They meet Frankenstein.

37
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,560
Who's that?

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,560
Jewish guy.

39
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,180
Mmm.

40
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,240
Elvis Frankenstein?

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,360
Yeah, Elvis Frankenstein.

42
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,020
He's, he teaches them, it's a Hanukkah special.

43
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,860
Nice.

44
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:21,680
For Alvin and the Chipmunks.

45
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:22,520
Which is okay these days.

46
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:23,680
Yeah, it's a good thing to have.

47
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,520
Yeah.

48
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,520
I said that like it was

49
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,720
It's actually I think it's good I think it's good I think it's good

50
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,040
I think they should do a breaking bad

51
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,620
Special Jerry Seinfeld speaking of holiday specials Jerry Seinfeld had a book about Halloween

52
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,560
For real this I think what what is I had it as a kid

53
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:53,040
It's just an it's like an illustrated children's book that all the audio is a stand-up

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,080
bit about Halloween. There's an audio of a book. What it's it's comes with a cd

55
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:04,240
and you can listen to it along. I just don't believe you. I just don't believe

56
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,160
at all. I choose to not believe in anything. I know I know you're correct,

57
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,920
but the but

58
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,080
just saying all the audio in the book. I don't know that you're correct. I think

59
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,840
that you're lying to me every time he says something like that. He's right is

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,320
the thing. Nope, he's just lying. I believe he's right. I do. I believe in

61
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,680
him because the I'm going over of this we've is crazy we've recently

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,240
he's ignoring it I'm showing him the pundit he's literally his phones off he's

63
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:36,000
just showing you so can you show proof of the CD yeah or did you recently

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,320
discover that Patrick is right about almost everything he ever talks about

65
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,560
but instead of kind of giving him more more benefit of the doubt in situations

66
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,240
where he says something crazy I'm gonna go the complete opposite way I'm not

67
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,240
I'm not going to believe a single word. He said yeah ever

68
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:58,140
this was on the CD. This is an ad before the CD starts wow.

69
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,040
It's literally called Sun felt Halloween. Yeah, so there's no

70
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,140
proof. This is a CD. It's a YouTube video

71
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,740
can

72
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,140
get candy, get candy, get candy, get candy, get candy,

73
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:23,060
So food Seinfeld has always been a thing. Holy shit I didn't realize that

74
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:28,020
Seinfeld invented our whole wave. Yeah this is a whole book about him getting

75
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,140
candy. Yeah. The fuck? You know what's also crazy about Jerry

76
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:36,320
Seinfeld is he's one of those guys where Superman is his favorite superhero.

77
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,460
That's not right. That is a sign of a freaking narcissist. What are you talking

78
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:47,260
What is it? How's that crazy? The most popular superhero ever. That's crazy to be to have Superman be your favorite superhero.

79
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,460
That is yeah, it's weird. What?

80
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:56,600
Yeah, it's like everyone likes Superman. Everyone likes Superman sure, but like for Superman to be your like number one guy.

81
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:00,580
So it would be okay for Superman to be your number one guy if you lived in like the 50s.

82
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:05,380
Yeah, what kind of people? He did live in the 50s. If you lived in the 50s. He lived in the 50s!

83
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,780
Yeah, but now. I think he was born in the 50s. Now it's the 20s.

84
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:15,460
Yeah, you can't be doing that anymore. Why it's weird to have Superman be your favorite superhero because it's like

85
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,140
It's the same as picking Mario and freaking smash. It's like having your favorite meal be breakfast lunch or dinner

86
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,320
Yeah, instead of the in-between ones the snacks. Mm-hmm the brunch liner

87
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:34,440
Midnight night second breakfast breakfast. We took us a dinner to breakfast. So yeah, that's midnight snack

88
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,600
That's midnight. That's midnight snack or first break winner

89
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,320
breakfast. My mom my mom just a dinner to breakfast, so my mom used to take me out

90
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,560
for first breakfast at midnight because brick because Brenner would be lunch

91
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,760
because that's right between breakfast and yeah right, so you it has to be

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:58,320
deck fist yeah, it's deckfist didn't but it's commonly known as a fist yeah,

93
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,000
fist yeah, dink fist midnight meal third fourth meal third meal fourth meal is

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,680
Taco Bell. No, you're thinking of second meal. No, fourth meal. No, Taco Bell does

95
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,160
second meal. You're not right. It's between breakfast and dinner. I know you're not

96
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,240
right about this. Oh, I'm Patrick and I'm right about everything these days. They

97
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,080
actually had a CD at Taco Bell. They did. The audio of my taco was crazy. You get a CD of

98
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,440
that guy singing and he's, "Four times a steak, four times a thick juicy succulent

99
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,000
steak, you all say wow it's like a whole turkey crumb." I bet growing up he knew the lyrics to every

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,440
commercial. Yeah I did. Definitely. I was shopping for a new car which one's me? A cool convertible

108
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:16,440

109
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,600
looks like complete shit what's our do it head-on what the hell was that even

110
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,640
four Sham Wow that's gotta be a hooker he bit a hooker and the chip slap chop he's

111
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,120
talking about slapping nuts yeah yeah my nuts the fuck is going on with that he

112
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,120
made like this movie so before he was the Sham Wow guy he made this movie called

113
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,040
like the underground comedy movie and it's not good it's very bad comedians of

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:54,380
comedy no no it's like sketches and then he after that he was making a sequel to

115
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,540
it but then decided to make it all about apps and then the movie is called in

116
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,420
appropriate comedy inappropriate comedy yeah I think directed and wrote that I

117
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:10,520
think whoa uh-huh it's very if you watch it's pretty appropriate yeah yeah it's

118
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,880
really not all that I think it was inappropriate at the time maybe yeah

119
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,200
things have changed. Oh wait I think he does blackface in the underground comedy movie.

120
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:22,760
That doesn't surprise me. Well you don't, it doesn't surprise you that the Slap Shop guy

121
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,520
did blackface? Not at all. He also bit a hooker. I don't think he's a good guy.

122
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,320
What? I think he's probably a bad guy. But he gave all these great products. I think anybody who

123
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,680
tries to get, who becomes a job as like a seller, which I think is what they're called. If anybody

124
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:46,120
Anybody who like who gets who has a like a really small thing or small role and

125
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,480
get really gets really famous thing and gets really famous like gets like viral

126
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,560
or famous from it and embraces it really hard is a horrible person except for bad

127
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,240
baby yeah she's cool but every other person every other bad baby type person

128
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,280
is evil. I think Slash was in the underground comedy movie yeah Slash Chop

129
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:12,920
Yeah, and the the the DVD cover is a two women taking a shit

130
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,200
Holy fuck

131
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,920
Damn, I should call it the under ass

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,500
I wish I was underground under the toilets that those women are shitting into so their poop would go into my mouth

133
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,420
Yeah, that's pretty cool. Yeah, would you eat Pamela Anderson's poop? I don't think I'd ever eat any poop

134
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:35,520
What about okay everything everything has to have like a there's a qualifier. So every yeah, there's no it's not

135
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,400
- Yeah, there is definitely a situation.

136
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,980
- Only a Sith deals in absolutes, my friend.

137
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,820
- That's right.

138
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:44,740
There is only, there is situations where you would eat

139
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,360
an entire log of poop.

140
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,240
- I don't think there is a situation where I would eat--

141
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,080
- What if a woman--

142
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,080
- There he is, a black face and hair curlers.

143
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,360
- What if a woman ate so much--

144
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,160
- That's woman head, too.

145
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,320
- What if a woman ate so much delicious birria--

146
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,840
- Okay, fine, it tastes like,

147
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,960
if the poop is a whole log of candy--

148
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
No, no, no, it tastes like complete shit.

149
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,160
It's the reason why you're doing it though.

150
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,160
The reason why I'm eating it.

151
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
It's like your entire family is bundled up, completely bundled up.

152
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
I have to take a bite of poop.

153
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,480
And they're being dropped into an alligator, a giant alligator, the hugest alligator ever.

154
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,200
I have to eat the alligator's poop.

155
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,840
And the alligator's saying, I guess he's saying telepathically he's communicating to you.

156
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,760
So maybe you're just thinking this.

157
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
But it's like I have to...

158
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,720
Maybe you're hallucinating the whole thing.

159
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Yeah, yeah.

160
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,600
You have to eat poop.

161
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,800
have to eat my yeah and then yeah okay so your son gets pushed into the lion

162
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,200
enclosure at the zoo but you and you're thinking one of the one of the lions is

163
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,560
telepathically telling you that you have to eat shit or he's not gonna right okay

164
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,320
so you're schizophrenic and you eat poop against your own will yeah would you I

165
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,520
think I would have to okay so if you yeah if you if you if you were forced to

166
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,520
eat poop and there's no way to get out of it

167
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:07,220
poop would you do it if I was forced to physically yeah if you're forced to

168
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,560
physically or mentally physically restrained if my face was not a rubber

169
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,640
if you're being restrained if you are being restrained from eating poop would

170
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,240
you escape and do it no what if you were born and your head looked exactly like a

171
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,400
like a flesh toilet and you were just like oh I gotta try this one time like

172
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,480
everybody's saying I look like a toilet also would you go for pee or poop first

173
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,440
I'd probably go for pee first. Oh my god. He wants to drink pee. Yeah, what's wrong?

174
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
Oh, there's no that's not like uh

175
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,480
That's not like a ramping up thing. Those are just two different. Those are just two different gross things

176
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,480
I want to drink

177
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,600
You'd you'd rat you want to rather eat

178
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,820
Than just poop would you rather drink really clear pee or really yellow pee yellow? He's dehydrated

179
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:54,480
Okay, would you rather drink a gallon of crystal clear pee or do a cup of?

180
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,200
really yellow stinky pee

181
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,480
asparagus pea. You would choose the stinky? I would drink the... A guy, he's a

182
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:10,440
trucker, a fat sweaty trucker, it's a vegan trucker and all he eats is asparagus and

183
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,240
and radishes. And farts and beets. And beets, yeah. And farts, he eats farts too.

184
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,160
And he also sucks down fart stuff. Yeah. And he... Yeah, I would drink that

185
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,200
actually. And his butt is... And his butt also pees. And his butt has a

186
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,640
a pea gland. He has an issue with his body where his butt is really hot so it like

187
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,520
cooks it like boils and cooks whatever comes out of it. Yeah. I think poop's

188
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,920
already fully cooked. No but it's way more. It's bubbling.

189
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,120
There's so many vegan food like meat replacements that look

190
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,680
like poop. Yeah it all looks like poop. I think that if you cooked poop it would

191
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,640
look exactly like that. Yeah. Like a seitan steak. Some nice grill marks on a log.

192
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:04,280
yeah like a seitan steak I think I've never had a poop log it's always just the

193
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,720
fuck just the most insane tic-tac orange juice yeah you're something wrong with

194
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,500
you we know that we've established that like a long time ago like what is a

195
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,240
you've always had something really wrong with you in the toilet and be like that

196
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,520
was a seriously like are you proud of it no no I'm never proud of what I do in

197
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,560
I'd be so happy I think if I looked into the toilet I saw just a log.

198
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
If I pooped like a football maybe.

199
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,280
Yeah.

200
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,880
If I pooped a poop that was the size of a football.

201
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,880
My shit looks like a fractal.

202
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,560
The thing is I still wouldn't be proud, I would be worried.

203
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,960
Not necessarily about my body but about the toilet too.

204
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,360
You could probably do like tea leaf reading with my shit.

205
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,360
Yeah.

206
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
Yeah, I think so.

207
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,000
I guess what happened to me.

208
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,480
According to this pattern it smells horrible.

209
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,240
the room will soon smell bad.

210
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,720
Yeah, I found out I found out a huge

211
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,840
thing today yeah, which is that if you don't have a license plate on your car,

212
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,600
because of my life, I got stolen by an TFA. I don't know if I talked about that

213
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
on yeah, the show you did, but

214
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,400
if you have a license, if you don't have a place on your car, they can't give you

215
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,160
a parking ticket.

216
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,480
So I've just been doing a legal. I've been parking in front of fucking fire

217
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,020
I've been not paying for parking.

218
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
Nice.

219
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,640
And they just don't even, they can't even tow it because they can't put it in the system.

220
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
That's sick.

221
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
It's fucking incredible.

222
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,760
Well, you have the piece of paper in the back, right?

223
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,080
Yeah, I have a piece of paper, but it just has a license plate number on it, so they

224
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,720
could just, they won't give me a ticket.

225
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,480
Yeah, it could just be a random number.

226
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,000
It could be the person in front of me, I just wrote it on there.

227
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Yeah.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You know?

229
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And then I'd never have to pay the ticket.

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,880
So it's like, honestly, it's so fucking genius.

231
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,840
That is crazy that you got your license plate stolen.

232
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:52,840
so I mean it's it's been such a blessing dude yeah yeah probably one of those

233
00:13:52,840 --> 00:14:03,880
probably one of those at um quirky s restaurants stole it it's definitely

234
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:08,560
hanging up at a Twin Peaks yeah don't worry in Virginia it's made it's it's

235
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,480
the final piece for the big metal license plate bra they had yeah yeah

236
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,520
it's in some I was talking to I was talking about breasts around see other

237
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:24,080
day misleading name yeah there's a lot of restaurants yeah like restaurant well

238
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:29,240
yeah remember we saw yeah I do remember we saw hoots isn't that so fucking crazy

239
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,080
they don't even have waiters at hoots they've like no wonder like you just

240
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,520
ordered well yeah cuz if they did waiters that's true of course I can't do

241
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,760
waiters yeah there's no reason yeah they that is that's funny that they are there

242
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,680
if they really just can't have waders there yeah cuz everybody's gonna be oh

243
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,040
well these wait what's up do you waiters nobody also that yeah they'd have to

244
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,500
wear like well I understand is why I can wear the full why not just call it

245
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,960
something completely different yeah should have called it wings yeah with a

246
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:03,320
why it's way better wings that is good you remember that you remember that

247
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,840
dispute in like 2011 2000 something or when I was in middle school do you

248
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:14,200
remember they legally had to call boneless wings wings with a Y because

249
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:20,200
wings have to have the bone in them no who's they and what do you mean they

250
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:30,200
legally big three the big three Pierce Paul Pierce Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen

251
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:38,040
yeah they legally made it so you have to call boneless wings boneless w-i-n-g-z

252
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:46,400
Why does this do the Y and the yes? Why can't be it can't be called the wing?

253
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:52,920
I remember there was some there's some I've a similar type of thing I remember

254
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,320
seeing a really good memory of seeing an imitation crab meat thing called CROB.

255
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:05,560
C-R-O-B. It's already had called imitation. Yeah I know. It's so funny dude.

256
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:11,680
It's the same thing as like the like the chicken, you know where it has an apostrophe instead of the e in my in my hometown

257
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,480
There's a place called P T's

258
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:19,120
Which is really it's like burgers and fries place and they have lemonade and on their menu is the only thing the entire menu is

259
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,920
like this it says

260
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,800
in quotations fresh and in quotations lemonade and

261
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,940
They may it's just made they make the lemonade in front of you

262
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:33,840
It's just lemons and fucking water quotes at quotation marks and like around something on a sign is one of the ultimate

263
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,320
- Scary. - Gen X humors.

264
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,680
- Yeah, it really is. - I think it gets them

265
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,280
every time. - Every single time.

266
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,200
- They can't get over it. - It's funny.

267
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,200
- It is funny, but they could see a million of them

268
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,040
in it every time.

269
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,880
- Do you guys remember they used to do--

270
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,600
- Using, so legally they can't be called wings

271
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,640
if they're actually not, if they are actually,

272
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,000
or they can be called wings if they're made from wing meat,

273
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,720
but they're not made from wing meat.

274
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,440
They have to be called wings.

275
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,480
No other misspellings are allowed.

276
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,480
The product label must be submitted for approval.

277
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,840
White meat must be used.

278
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,280
The wings asterisk term must be prominent.

279
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,760
An asterisk must link to a statement

280
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,520
that indicates the product is not made

281
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,680
entirely from wing meat.

282
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,440
- Say asterisk again. - That's a crazy,

283
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,760
I mean, I feel like, yeah, it's fine

284
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,060
that you can't call them normal wings or whatever,

285
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,020
but to say you have to call them W-Y-N-G-Z,

286
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,040
you can't, no other spelling, is crazy.

287
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,720
chicken tender it's a chicken tender

288
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,040
you exactly discuss boneless wings I've been trying to remember what a boneless

289
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,160
wing looks like and I just can't remember

290
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,280
a chicken tender it's a chicken right it's not it's pretty long right yeah

291
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,400
yeah well it's short it's shorter than a

292
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,120
so it's a wing it's a well it's a wings it's a wings

293
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,920
well if it's if it's used if it doesn't you just use entirely

294
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,020
wing meat you can't call I'm gonna use you entirely I'm gonna use your wings

295
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,800
I'm gonna I would I'm gonna use your wings to get my satisfaction I will use

296
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,020
every part of you like a Native American.

297
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,860
- Nope.

298
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,680
- I really will.

299
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,520
- You won't.

300
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,360
- I'm going to.

301
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,700
- There's parts of me that aren't even here anymore.

302
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,540
- That's, I'm gonna hunt them down.

303
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,200
- I'm gonna hunt them down.

304
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,040
I'm doing a treasure.

305
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:12,860
- You're not gonna find my parts.

306
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,080
- I'm doing a treasure trek.

307
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,520
- You're not gonna find any of my parts.

308
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,720
- I'm gonna find every last one of them.

309
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,040
I'm gonna find your baby teeth

310
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,680
and those are gonna go up my butt.

311
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,520
- When I was in like third grade,

312
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,960
I lost, I had like a full metal tooth

313
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,920
in the back of my mouth, like a silver.

314
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,120
- Naturally?

315
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,040
- Yeah, grew in.

316
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,920
Whoa, but it was cut was a metal crown covering a baby tooth and one day it

317
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,240
fell out and then I lost the crown and I was so upset about that.

318
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:46,240
Isn't it? I see what I call it a crown because it fell off. Okay, you know,

319
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,960
you know, you know, well, you know who gets crowns in real life to always the

320
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,000
most rotten people

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,840
they get, they get crowns, but yeah, and there and it's and and you know the

322
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,980
another thing about these people who get crowns what you know they're

323
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,440
standing there standing all next to each other down in a line. They're all

324
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,440
they're all look the same. They're white yep white rotten people. Yeah crowns

325
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,140
white with little happening. What just flew out of your mouth phlegm and you

326
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,700
know what we'll say it white with with wh yt black holes in the middle of

327
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,160
their bodies. Yeah, where the soul should be yeah, but the soul of the

328
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,840
tooth yep, that's right. Yeah, I got a soul of the foot. I think about the

entire world that the sole of the foot on my tooth.

330
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,660
You want to put a foot in your mouth? No,

331
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:39,560

start getting boners from feet.

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,760

383
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,600
that's what we're really here for. Emma Watson's feet became very famous among the

384
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,560
foot lovers. We selected the best pictures of her feet for this collection.

385
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:32,520
We added not only barefoot photos but also high heels, toes, soles, and anklets.

386
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,480
This isn't doing anything for me. Yeah this is the best that feet have to offer.

387
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,680
I think that yeah these are kind of nasty to me.

388
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
Well all feet are nasty.

389
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,680
Yeah.

390
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,920
I have to sit down.

391
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,720
You know I don't know.

392
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
I don't...

393
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Feet videos by FeetWonder.com.

394
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,040
FeetWonder.com.

395
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
These are better.

396
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,040
These are better feet.

397
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,960
So okay I can tell when a foot is better.

398
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,600
But you can... this is the number one foot.

399
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
You're saying the opposite.

400
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:04,600
No that one...

401
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
I disagree.

402
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
I mean it's not an objective.

403
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,800
is is Meghan Markle. I heard look at me and Markle feet. I hope I'm hope there's

404
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:11,600
a website.

405
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,200
You just search Meghan Markle look up feet. Oh, yeah,

406
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,500
stupid. I'm feeling out of it today. All right. Well, there's a wiki feet.

407
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,800
There's not a website dedicated to it, but she it was ratings three stars.

408
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,200
Okay feet. What are you talking about? You're a liar. There's a Sun article

409
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,200
that says she had 90. Let's see who feet of the year is feet of the year 2021

410
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,800
contest results finals or Neal a caper and Anna de Armas. I don't know who

411
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,400
Neal a caper as an look at let's see Anna de Armas. Well, you like a for one.

412
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Oh, she did yeah. That's a hand. This is you. That's a hand. Most of these are

413
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,500
hands. Wait. Why is there so many pictures of this woman's feet? Who is

414
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,000
she? That's the other thing. It's got to be like there's got to be some just

415
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,900
vlogger or something. There's yeah, yeah, probably somebody's screenshots

416
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,540
somebody's not even five stars gorgeous feet, shoe size nine us birthplace turkey.

417
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:12,100
This bitch is made out of you can you can get notified for new pictures. Yeah,

418
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,420
let's get notified. Okay, let's look at an adarmus here.

419
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,100
The length of time that this website takes to load makes me worried about

420
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,540
what's happening to my computer. No, it's just how many people are accessing this

421
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,860
at the same time as you all right. This is the one we want to look at this one.

422
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:34,740
No, see the feet are barely in this one. You're not committed to the feet lifestyle.

423
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,300
Yeah, you're right.

424
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,340
Let's check out this one. What do you think about these feet?

425
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,700
Those are definitely, see that's what I mean, those are definitely better than Emma Watson.

426
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:46,740
Yeah, but those toes look kind of dead. She might have gangrene on this foot.

427
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,900
She does have three fucked up toes.

428
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,400
Yeah.

429
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,300
So, but okay, so now I guess the appeal is like you look at it with your friends and like

430
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,660
talk about it like it's like the like top five in the barbershop.

431
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:04,980
come on when you're at the barber shop, you got all those comments.

432
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,340
She is a beautiful woman, no doubt, but the overall shape of her feet and the

433
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,300
Morton's toe drops her score by a couple stars in the Harley score. She

434
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,060
definitely isn't in the same foot category. This literally is the the top

435
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:21,660
five. She definitely isn't the same foot category as Emma Stone, Selena Gomez,

436
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,760
Taylor, shifter, Sandra Bullock, the overall foot and toe shape of anada

437
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,880
arm is out of proportion by my standards. I know I do have a tendency

438
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,960
score a little on the harsher reserved side, but I know what I think is

439
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,500
beautiful and if I give a beautiful rating, they deserve it to me, though,

440
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,280
and okay rating is an average attractive guy. I'd be happy to massage any time

441
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:44,620
this guy's a Simon Simon Cowell. This guy's a complete Simon. He's he is

442
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,260
tough, but he's fair yeah right like he's not bullshit. He's not saying

443
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,180
everybody's a five. I like it's it's so interesting just like what turns you

444
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,800
These people have oh my God, this is this. We need to destroy these people.

445
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,100
Why I also prefer a longer second toe. I think it looks better and give that

446
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,900
feminine touch agree. She is beautiful, but here we rate feet. She has hammer

447
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,800
toes that would never allow her to enter my beautiful rating. I need I need to

448
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,700
see I need to put my feet on there. I need to know what my my really is. I

449
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,700
just like I don't think there's anything wrong with these people. I'd like to

450
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,500
join their ranks personally, but at first I need to do something to my brain.

451
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,660
I just want to know what people would think of my feet.

452
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,660
You have shit feet.

453
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,500
I definitely, me or Cam have the worst feet though.

454
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,180
I have really, I have a pretty ugly feet.

455
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,260
I mean I have a broken toe still.

456
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,380
Actually no, it's starting to wiggle again.

457
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,380
But that's like a cool unique, that's like when a girl has like a beauty mark.

458
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,380
Yeah.

459
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,380
You know?

460
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,380
Or like a gap in there.

461
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,780
I have feet like the scene in Watchmen when Dr. Manhattan is like growing back into human

462
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,020
form by like skeleton and muscles.

463
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:55,100
I the I don't know. Do you think there because I know of their there is a

464
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:02,220
jencom article about a guy who pays like skaters to buy like d3s and like big

465
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,780
puffy skate shoes and skating them all day and then sell the shoes to him so he

466
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,180
can sniff them to him. You think there's a guy like that that could give me a lot

467
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,980
of money. Yeah, here's a comment. This might shed some light on what feet

468
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,660
lovers are looking for. Okay, this is because this is a comment on an ad to

469
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,700
the arm is from a feet love. What is the beauty standard? Well, I'll tell you

about

473
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:39,260
okay, oh my God, okay, but but maybe he's just hungry. Maybe just reminded him of

474
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,340
French fries and he's like they look like French fries kind of a homer. She's

475
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,180
one sexy cuban fries she's cuban that's what some of that's what someone says

476

Yeah.

488
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,020
This guy's kind of an idiot.

489
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
He's not very smart.

490
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,020
He can't smell with that.

491
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,020
He's not very smart.

492
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:54,600
He's kind of, yeah, he's kind of confused at the very least.

493
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:58,140
Do they want the women's feet to smell bad?

494
00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:59,140
I think so.

495
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:02,740
The smell of feet is, that would, I don't think I could ever get into that.

496

Yeah.

497

499
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,620
I make that smell so much yeah, I don't need a I don't need a beautiful Cuban

00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,080
Yeah.

607
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,080

609
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,080
Scratchers is more fun.

They're both pretty fun.

611
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,080
I really like Keno.

612
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,600
I'm trying to think of the best Christmas gift I ever got.

613
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
That's a hard question.

614
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Yeah.

Yeah.

619
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,480
Nothing else was as good as a winning lottery ticket.

620
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,840
Not even my space ship.

621
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,360
Probably my jet pack maybe, actually.

622
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,840
Maybe it was friendship.

623
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,840
Yeah.

624
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,320
Maybe my unlimited video game detector.

625
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:53,720
Yeah, my beautiful friendship just shows if there's one around and then I go

626
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,320
play. What's the unlimited part mean? No batteries. All the friends I got. Yeah.

627
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,520
Did you guys ever have you guys ever go to a YMCA grown up? Yeah, I think I went

628
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,520
to the YMCA for somebody's party. I went to like a summer camp there. Our YMCA

629
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:13,620
had a I never once exercised there, but my mom would and they had a little

630
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:17,920
daycare area that had a Sega Genesis in it. Oh, that's sick. It was the sickest

631
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,920
I think about it all the time.

632
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,840
It was like the room was so small and it was me and 10 other kids all taking turns on a

633
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,840
Sega Genesis.

634
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,840
That's so cool.

635
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,840

Alvin do you think Alvin to be in the

684
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,240
doctor Jordan Peterson I do think he

685
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:32,720
would

686
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,480
yeah yeah I think it's going because

687
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
he's always wearing that red hat.

688
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
MAGA hat.

689
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:38,480
He doesn't wear a hat.

690
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,480
Alvin wears a hat.

691
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
Nope.

692
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,480

What the fuck are you talking about?

696
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:49,000
Are you going to agree with Simon/Theodore/DooDoo or are you going to agree with your fellow

697
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Alvin?

698
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,960
I don't have to agree with Alvin, I am Alvin.

699
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,480
I said fellow Alvin.

700
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,880
I think you're going to be on the side of Alvin.

701
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
Which is me.

702
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,880
I don't know.

703
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,600
Well they should make a new Chipmunks movie.

704
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,960
They made three new Chipmunks but they were girls so it should have been three new guys.

705
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,160
I remember when I agree three new guys yes three new chipmunks yeah maybe their

706
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,160
names are Caleb Cameron and Patrick oh my god they get I don't know like maybe like

707
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:25,400
a black a black shirt and then a black another black shirt and then a third one

708
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:31,240
with a black shirt you can't copy us there's three black shirts and they may

709
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,560
maybe one of them and they have the same voice. Yeah, I have noticed

710
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:39,560
yeah, like an actual chip like a realist monks fucking apart. Yeah,

711
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,520
not a million years got to tell to chip. I remember unless one unless

712
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,520
dog's glad unless it is glasses. If one has glasses that helps when I

713
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:50,280
was downloading a bunch of like we should make now. No, she is OC a

714
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,800
bunch of let's open up Photoshop right now and just a bunch of

715
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,600
Nintendo DS ROMs like in like playing them on an emulator on my

716
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,520
computer. I got like one of like an album in the chipmunks game. Yeah,

717
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,660
and it was like a rhythm game type game where you had to like draw shapes in the

718
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,260
rhythm of the song and like it started out and it was like like circles and

719
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:12,640
squares and stuff. Yeah, as the sun go on, it starts having you draw like

720
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,000
Viking room. Whoa, oh yeah, i'm really question. That's cool.

721
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,480
Yeah, the

722
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,400
like a

723
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:27,080
I think there literally was like a lightning bolt that like makes you drop

724
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,360
like

725
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:36,480
twice. Oh man yeah yeah, it probably also makes you draw maybe a fucking cross.

726
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,260
Oh yeah, which is also a symbol of hate in my eyes yeah and my my little chip

727
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:45,520
mark guys yeah and my little beady black. She's how the song should have

728
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,380
gone me. I want no hate on earth yeah. Yeah, we should stop killing and

729
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,220
converting people who are different than us.

730
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:00,620

00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,500
any part it's discriminatory and I would not want to do an interview with them

805
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,380
them and also FUD is not even a member of the podcast.

806
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:27,380
And they were tricked.

807
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,380
I'm glad.

808
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,380
They literally believed it.

809
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,460
The look on their faces was completely priceless.

810
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:34,900
I am glad that we didn't attach the picture.

811
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,900
They don't deserve that.

812
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:36,900
Me too.

813
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,900
I agree.

814
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:38,900
And also they would have thought that Phil was FUD.

815
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:44,100
But you know what, maybe if we did attach the picture, or we did attach the picture,

816
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,940
it maybe would have, maybe they would have replied.

00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:50,060

Name, I'll just paste in the email.

844
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,980
What does it say? Why does it say Emma Watson Fee?

845
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,980
We already covered this.

846
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,980
You weren't paying attention.

847
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,980
I'm happy to pay it if it

848
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:18,540
if it lands us in a big interview like this. Yeah. Okay. Well, so the name I'll

849
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:27,740
put Cameron, Caleb, Cameron, Patrick, Patrick and Fudd. Then I'll put our email

850
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:32,540
in. No, okay. Fudd with one D. Interesting. I don't think that's how he spells it.

851
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:39,820
Okay. Well, I'll add a D in a second. Okay. Fudd. And then there's the last

852
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:43,420
question says submitted by, and I'm going to paste in our email that we sent.

853
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,100
Okay, perfect. All right, and now I'm going to submit this. All right, that

854
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,380
should be okay. So thank you for your response. All right, cool. So now we

855
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:56,740
got that's at least that'll go somewhere. Yeah, yeah. Oh, okay, we're

856
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,740
back. Sorry, Patrick just had to take the stinkiest shit of all time.

857
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:04,940
Literally, it's probably the worst smelling shit I've ever taken. And you

858
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,380
took it in a room that has no fan. And when you left, you left the door open

859
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,380
for a second.

860
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,380
Leaving the door open at all is huge faux pas.

861
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,060
You should literally be sliding through a little crack.

862
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,140
I sat in there with that air freshener thing.

863
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,620
I did 16 squirts.

864
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:23,020
It doesn't work.

865
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,660
You did 16 squirts in the toilet.

866
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,660
Or you did 17.

867
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,580
So you have to do one squirt per squirt.

868
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:30,260
I drank one whiskey.

869
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,140
I am of the belief that even if it doesn't smell bad, you should always close the door

870
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,140
to the bathroom.

871
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,140
I agree.

872
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,140
That door should never be open.

873
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:40,740
I can't do that at my apartment anymore, because my I think my bathroom has black

874
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:43,760
mold. That's not my problem. Yeah, I don't.

875
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,660
You should you should what do you mean you think your party seen black mold?

876
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,340
Yeah, and if it's in a toilet, it's probably poop. Oh yeah, you're putting

877
00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,620
black mold like when you go to flushers black mold all in a toilet. Yeah, it's

878
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:02,060
more brown mold. Yeah, that is really dangerous. Actually don't inhale that

879
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:06,220
black mold. Yeah, I've been inhaling it for months. I think it's been there for

880
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:08,220
What do you guys think is

881
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:13,420
Black mold I feel like I didn't hear about black mold until I was like 15 16. It's fake. It's not real

882
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:18,320
I don't think it's real. Yeah, like what can it? What does it really do to a person gives them pneumonia?

883
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,320
It's how they got Brittany Murphy

884
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,820
No, she was addicted to drugs. Yeah, but then she got pneumonia and the drugs amplified it

885
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:30,660
So because I'm not I think I personally believe that people who are addicted to drugs have demonia

886
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,420
you think they're demons don't ever say that about Brittany Murphy again Brittany

887
00:50:34,420 --> 00:50:39,220
Murphy was an actual fucking succubus who fucking ruined him in his life I don't

888
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:45,500
know who she is what it's only in a movie I hope it's really like a whole

889
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,300
it's called eight mile where do you think you grew up eight miles away from

890
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,860
Detroit and that's where the movie takes place isn't it eight eight miles in a

891
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:59,740
what's that movie it follows yes it is yeah they go there and they're like you

892
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:04,980
don't want to go there yeah that's where Eminem and white rappers start yeah you

893
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:09,100
don't want to go there it won't follow us here yeah I was them and then shout out

894
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,260
Eminem shows up he starts battling the kids he looks at the sex ghost and he

895
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:18,300
says like that's a cool hot coffee pot I don't think he tries to get away I don't

896
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:26,300
think they try it they're like the the fucking monster won't follow us to to the

897
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,500
fucking like I don't think that's how it go to eight mile yeah but I don't think

898
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,060
like well we're going to 8-mile because the monster wouldn't be caught dead in

899
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:37,820
that bad of a neighborhood I don't think that's how it works hmm I don't remember

900
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,860
anything you're not like well the monster be too scared of getting getting

901
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:44,660
robbed or and mugged and bad why did they go to it they have all there's a

902
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:51,460
monologue I think they go so does it has a monologue prostitute right is that why

903
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:54,780
they go there oh is that really yeah is that really

904
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:59,820
I remember that movie well. I hope that that doesn't happen in that movie. I saw it one time.

905
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:04,460
I saw it one time, too. That's a movie you can see one time. Yeah. I thought it was pretty

906
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:09,100
cool. It was. I thought it was good when I was like seventeen. I liked Krampus a lot

907
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:14,180
more, though. Krampus is sick. Krampus is fucking cool as fuck. I saw Birdman in the theater

908
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:18,180
and I was like, "This movie's going to win an Oscar." That movie can suck my balls. I

909
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:22,580
never saw Birdman. I never will see that bullshit. Any movie that has a gimmick, unless the gimmick

910
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:25,800
is either war or nudity that we've not seen before.

911
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,720
- Well the gimmick in that movie is Batman.

912
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,300
- Those are the two acceptable things.

913
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,140
War can be the gimmick of a movie,

914
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:36,180
or brand new, the first time an actor's been naked on screen.

915
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,260
Those are the two gimmicks that'll get me in my ass

916
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:40,540
in the AMC theater scenes.

917
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:44,860
- Or a new enemy for Thor.

918
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,700
- Yeah.

919
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,980
- If Thor has a new enemy, a new villain.

920
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,020
- Not necessarily, it could be anyone.

921
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,100
- I mean, if you've seen there's like a--

922
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:57,700
if Thor has a new story to tell yeah and that was in the movie if that that'll

923
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,860
get me in them and there's a horse spider man or that I think I don't know

924
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:07,060
maybe the Guardians of the Galaxy Thor second I would not I would not he hangs

925
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,620
out with him in this new movie it wouldn't last even a fucking sec I cover

926
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,140
my eyes during those you guys want to go see that right now I'm gonna do I am

927
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:18,060
going to see the new Thor movie because it's an IMAX and I love IMAX it is out

928
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:28,420
tonight. I climax to the max at IMAX. And I shoot a wad of

929
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:36,940
spackle out of my bait and tackle. I shoot a wad of spackle out of my bait and tackle.

930
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:41,740
And Thor and Taika Waititi's voice makes me cackle.

931
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:47,260
That's right. He should be in shackles. He's from the islands.

932
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:50,820
I saw this video of him of him like doing like some like interview or like

933
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,420
podcast thing or it's like a video thing where he's like he's like playing with

934
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,780
an action figure while he talks and the interviewer guy is like completely

935
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,580
silent and take what he's like saying something about like a movie or show or

936
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:05,060
something and then he just looks up and goes I'm a gay icon and there's just

937
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:12,060
like ten seconds of silence. He's not gay is he? He's not gay. He's cheating.

938
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:16,620
he's a big icon. The funniest part is that I'm a gay icon and then just the

939
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,900
interviewer doesn't say it's like literally just long just silence. Yeah.

940
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,540
I think he's cheating by saying he's a gay icon. There's been a big backlash against Taika Waititi.

941
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:34,860
From me? Yeah. There isn't that much of a backlash. There's been a big enough backlash.

942
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:39,540
I will say, I liked Boy, I liked Hunt for the Wilder People, I liked Eagle versus Shark.

943
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:50,900
I like Thor Ragnarok, I like this Roland Free guy, but I fucking hate this weird creep.

944
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,780
Yeah, I don't think he's a weird creep, I think he's based, dude.

945
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,580
He is actually kind of based.

946
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:59,540
There's this movie he made about two Maori kids in a car.

947
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,020
What?

948
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:05,620
Yeah, I think he's a pedophile.

949
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,380
I think Taika Waititi's a pedophile.

950
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:10,860
obsessed with making movies about little kids. I don't think so. You know who he

951
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:16,460
should collab with? Thorophile. He should do a movie about Nicki Minaj. Yeah. I'm

952
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,840
gonna do a movie about your butt. Yeah. I'm doing a movie where I get a camera right up

953
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,300
your butt. I heard he's bringing back his role as Hitler in the new Thor.

954
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:33,220
Yeah. Oi, check me out. Hello Thor. Hey Thor, can I touch your hammer? I'm Hitler.

955
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,060
- Yeah, let me touch your hammer.

956
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,740
- Marvel's The Avengers, wait, no,

957
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,180
Captain America already fought Hitler.

958
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,020
- Captain America fought Red Skull.

959
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:44,340
But Brown Hitler is still out there.

960
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,900
Brown Hitler is still out there, Red Skull Hitler.

961
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,580
- Brown New Zealand Hitler is still.

962
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:49,580
- No.

963
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:50,420
- Huh?

964
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:51,260
- No.

965
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:52,100
- What?

966
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,900
That's what he plays.

967
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:56,580
- Who?

968
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:57,420
- Tiger with TT.

969
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,980
- Oh, oh, sorry, I was thinking of a different guy.

970
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,980
- A different Brown New Zealand Hitler.

971
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,820

Yeah, Pinocchio mask. Every time you sniff an ass, it gets even bigger, too.

Yeah.

1005
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:04,760
Yeah. And also, while we're there, we'll smell their feet.

1006
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,760
That's the experimental part.

1007
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,760
Just to see-- well, no. The whole thing is experimental.

1008
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,760
That's the control.

1009
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:10,760
Yeah.

1010
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,760
Yeah, this is what an awesome smell is.

Eating koi is a little like eating chicken wings, in that you essentially

1051
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,620
use your teeth to get the most meat off the bone. You're like a guinea pig, but

1052
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,620
