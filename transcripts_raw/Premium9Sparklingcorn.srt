13
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:42,640
you know i don't even know this time yeah i don't know what the fuck happened

14
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,040
to caleb i heard he fell into some kind of giant

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,600
butthole on the inside the ass of a giant guy inside of the butthole of the

16
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,540
ass

17
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,780
of a giant guy.

18
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:55,780
Yeah.

19
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,620
And I heard he's kind of making himself at home in there, wiggling around and pressing

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:05,640
and poking at the different points inside.

21
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,020
And kind of seeing what happens and what comes out of it.

22
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,940
He's kind of exploring the space.

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,020
Making it his home.

24
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:15,020
Yeah.

25
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,020
He's decolonizing.

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,020
No, he's colonizing.

27
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,020
Oh, he's colonizing.

28
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,020
The giant man's ass.

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:27,460
decolonizing. The giant man's ass. Yeah, Caleb would never decolonize anything. He's anti-decolonization.

30
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:34,100
That's true. Yeah. Oh boy. So Patrick was telling me you got three hours of sleep. Yeah, I'm

31
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,480
running on three hours of sleep, but when Cameron got here, Cameron was knocking on the

32
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:44,780
door for like, how long? I only knocked one time because I thought you might be in the

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,980
bathroom or something. Oh, okay. So I texted you a few times. How long did you wait before

34
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:56,300
you knocked on the door? Probably like seven, eight minutes. Yeah, so I was asleep for,

35
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:05,260
okay, so I went to bed at 7 a.m. and then I got up at 8 a.m. and then I've been up

36
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:13,900
since, yeah, since 8 a.m. and then I slept one hour and then Cameron got here and

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,900
And we're going to a show after this.

38
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,740
- Yeah.

39
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,100
- Which is probably not good for my fucking--

40
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,180
- Get some energy.

41
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,380
- Yeah. - Drink some energy.

42
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,100
- I drank some cold brew just now.

43
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,940
- Nice.

44
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,300
- And I feel worse.

45
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
- Nice.

46
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,420
- Which isn't good.

47
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,300
- I always in the morning,

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,980
if I'll like sometimes forget to drink coffee.

49
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,820
- Yeah.

50
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,340
- And then I'll just like take a whole cup

51
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,380
of like lukewarm coffee and just chug it all

52
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,380
in like one minute.

53
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,420
And it always, it just, it ruins my day every time.

54
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:50,060
I do it like once a week. Before work I used to chug, I used to like walk in...

55
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:59,740
God damn. Yeah fucker is sitting on my TV and it's like it's tilting the TV. Yeah

56
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,420
he likes to, well I mean he used to sit on the buttons, but now he's

57
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,900
sitting on the other side of the TV. I think we like told him to stay off the

58
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:15,100
buttons enough that he's like figured out that he can't sit there. Now he's

59
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:20,640
shaking the TV around. He fell off of it last night. Really? Did he like fall

60
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:28,800
asleep and fall over? Yeah. That's pretty funny. He, so like a week or two ago he

61
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,460
fell asleep on top of the TV. Like he's like balancing on top of the TV.

62
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:38,940
Like yeah it's a thin TV. Mm-hmm. But he's like sitting on top of it. He fell

63
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:47,540
asleep on the the volume button and he turned the TV all the way up and then he

64
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,500
was still sitting there and I didn't know it was all the way up and I went and like

65
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,460
I played a trailer for some movie yeah and the MGM sound like the lion at the

66
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,140
beginning like the volume he turned it up to 99 and he's sitting there and then

67
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,940
out of nowhere it's just the fucking MGM the Lions roar and then him and his

68
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:11,780
brother just fucking bolted for the back like the bedroom I didn't know what the

69
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:17,040
fuck was going on I have a really distinct memory of as a kid like going

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,780
up to going up to my my dad's like stereo which is like surround sound like super

71
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,240
like big like speakers and it's like being really little and just like

72
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,100
playing with the knobs and like turning the button nothing was playing but like

73
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:33,700
turning the volume all the way up and then like and then like five minutes

74
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,020
later my dad came in and like played a song. I fell over and started crying

75
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,660
because it was so loud. I scared the shit out of everyone in the house.

76
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:48,940
It was good times. I think I did that like two or three times. He just never

77
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:52,560
learned from it. Yeah, well how was I you know how am I supposed to know that

78
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,460
the knob that says volume controls the volume? It says vol. Exactly it says

79
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,260
vol. That could be anything. That could be volume. Velocity. Velocity. That

80
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:07,600
could be voluptuous, velocity of the sound as well. That's what volume means. Yeah, that's

81
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,720
what it's short for. Yeah, that's what vol is short for. When you see it on a stereo

82
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,180
or a TV or something, it says "volosity". Volosity of the music. It controls how fast

83
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,040
the music goes out of the speaker and into your ear. If it hits you really fast, it's

84
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:28,960
gonna be really loud. So you wanna make sure you got slow music. Oh boy. Yeah. I'm fuckin'.

85
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
Yeah. My brain is a piece of crap.

86
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
We already knew that.

87
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
Yeah, this is like

88
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,240
This is going to be like a a really energetic show. Yeah, and I don't think I can like

89
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,840
Go, I think i'm gonna have to stand in the back. Yeah, i'll probably stand in the back. Yeah

90
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,640
I don't know that. I usually I think the last uh, the last show me the body show I went to

91
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,840
I got where yeah, yeah, it was the day joe was leaving. Yeah, I didn't go to that one. Yeah

92
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,760
uh... i got my glasses just absolutely destroyed

93
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,220
yeah i don't know why i thought it was a good idea

94
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:09,600
as remember going back to lake jose and then

95
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,000
my glasses like with my glasses all stomped out

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,440
critical yeah i'd

97
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,520
the last did this is showing the body and daughters allies daughter show i

98
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,360

100
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,160

101
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:41,840
And then the after the show I went home I went to bed and I had nightmares about being in a mass

102
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:52,240
shooting. So I'll be praying for you. All right. That you don't... Yeah because then I have to go

103
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:58,480

104
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:04,840
show tomorrow at Muya's. I thought I had to like host a show and then go to like my

105
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:13,120
friend's party. Yeah. But I'm glad that Caleb's tour got canceled. Yeah. Fuck you Caleb.

106
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,160
Yeah I heard he bombed on his last show. I don't, I, yeah. That's what he said.

107
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,160
That's what he said.

108
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,160
That's what he said.

109
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,160
That's what he said.

110
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,160
Wink.

111
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,160
What?

112
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,160
Eh?

113
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,160
Yeah.

114
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,000
You can't see it, but I'm doing the Robert De Niro wink.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Yeah.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,600
Where he sticks out his whole tongue and he looks like a fucking idiot.

117
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,920
Is that what he does when he winks?

118
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,920
Yeah.

119
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
Why?

120
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,040
That's what every Robert De Niro impersonator does.

121
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,560
I don't see many Robert De Niro impersonators.

122
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,000
That's kind of not a thing I'm interested in.

123
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
No.

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Really.

125
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,520
I think it was the summer of 2018, but I got really into just like

126
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,080
inquiring about impersonators. I really got really into inquiring. I got really

127
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,480
into inquiries, but there's this like website I found, it was called

128
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:06,520
lookalike.com. I think it's my Twitter picture is a guy I

129
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,120
found on that website. He's supposed to be the guy, my Twitter picture

130
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,160
a guy on that website who's supposed to be a Kelsey Grammer impersonator and it's clearly

131
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:25,080
just like a picture of him at like a secondhand like furniture store and he's wearing like

132
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,720
just the funniest outfit. He's just - he's got his arm perched on a lion.

133
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,920
Yeah.

134
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,560
And -

135
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,600
It's a good picture.

136
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,280
Yeah, it's a pretty good picture.

137
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:34,440
Yeah.

138
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,440
But it says like Kelsey Grammer impersonator parentheses Frazier.

139
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:44,360
But I found him on a website and then I found like they have like sopranos and then like

140
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,880
there was one guy on that website that was clearly just

141
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:55,240
a guy who went as Napoleon Dynamite for Halloween. Yeah. That one's the funniest one.

142
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,720
But I keep, I kept sending them emails and I never, I haven't heard back from them.

143
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,640
Damn, they're onto you. Yeah, I know. I know it's just a hobby for you. Yeah, I know.

144
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,360
You're not into the real, you're not a real fan.

145
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,480
- I just wanna see what happens.

146
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
- Yeah.

147
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,380
Trying to think, let's see.

148
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,920
I went to dim sum today.

149
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,480
I haven't done anything really in the past few days.

150
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,800
- I just haven't been sleeping

151
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,560
and I've been smoking weed now.

152
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,080
- Nice dude, yeah that's true.

153
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,160
Yeah, you're not allergic to it.

154
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,080
- I thought I was allergic to weed for four years

155
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,220
because I threw up one time.

156
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,720
(laughing)

157
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,560
- Hey, I mean--

158
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,980
- No, I've thrown up--

159
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,840
- Two times.

160
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,400
- I've thrown up a couple times from smoking weed.

161
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,160
- Yeah, I always feel like I'm about to throw up

162
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,680
when I smoke weed.

163
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,500
- Yeah, like I fuckin',

164
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,820
I've greened out more times than I can think of.

165
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,040
But you know what the thing is,

166
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,480
when I was smoking weed,

167
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,160
I was also on Adderall,

168
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,600
so I was taking like--

169
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,440
- Yeah.

170
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,800
- Uppers and downers.

171
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,640
- That's true.

172
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,140
Not even, no. Uppers and downers is pills.

173
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,380
But weed is a downer.

174
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,140
Yeah, and Adderall's an upper. I think that counts.

175
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
I don't think it's just pills.

176
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,640
It counts, but like, you can smoke weed and take Adderall and be fine.

177
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,140
Yeah, hey man, I did it for a long time.

178
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:22,140
But I guess it just fucked with me really bad to the point where I thought...

179
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:29,140
It fucked with me. When I was on Adderall, alcohol, and weed, I would just pass out like instantly.

180
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,140
Oh yeah, me too. I would like, I'd violently throw up.

181
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:38,200
up. Because on Adderall like it like it like counteracts or whatever the alcohol

182
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,080
so you can't feel how drunk you are. Yeah. And then it's like once the Adderall

183
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,920
wears off all the alcohol hits you at once and I like knew that because my

184
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,440
doctor kept telling me that over and over and I was like okay fine I'll be

185
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,820
careful then just every once in a while it just you can't avoid it you know I

186
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:57,240
mean it just freaking hits you like a bag of beer and knocks you right over.

187
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,600
That's that's some true shit hits you like a bag of beer

188
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:04,100
But hey, man, that's just the way that the beer pours

189
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:11,180
Yeah, but I haven't I mean I feel like this is the best time into the bag

190
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:14,740
Yeah, the beer pours into that's the way the beer pours into the beer

191
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,080
The way my throw-up pours into the bag of beer I

192
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:26,160
Feel like this is the best time for me to start smoking weed again. Yeah, why cuz I mean it's

193
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,920
basically legal, I mean it's legal here.

194
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,040
So it's like a lot of the thing is,

195
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,400
is I was on Adderall then I'd get very paranoid.

196
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,640
I think maybe I would just have panic attacks

197
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,120
every time I smoked.

198
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,960
- Yeah.

199
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,520
- And then that might be it.

200
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,560
I thought it was a pollen thing.

201
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,400
- Yeah.

202
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,120
- 'Cause I'm like really allergic to pollen.

203
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
'Cause I haven't been smoking like straight weed.

204
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,720
- You haven't been smoking pollen for a while.

205
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,280
- No, I haven't been smoking pollen.

206
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,560
I've been using, plus I mean I sound like

207
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,320
so fucking annoying about this too.

208
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
Just like, oh yeah, well, I mean,

209
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,960
I haven't been smoking like regular weed per se.

210
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,800
I don't know.

211
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,880
(laughing)

212
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,720
- Yeah.

213
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,520
- I hate, 'cause now I just hate talking about it

214
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,360
'cause it's like, I sound like a fucking idiot.

215
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,320
- 'Cause it's legal.

216
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,220
- Yeah.

217
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,000
- Yeah, the weed in LA fucked me up.

218
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,200
It gave me panic attacks like every time.

219
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,040
- Yeah.

220
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,080
- I still did it every night.

221
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,440
(laughing)

222
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,600
- A lonely sun, there seems to be free in my heart.

223
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,680
exactly

224
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680

225
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,960

00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,680
lonely

227
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,080
loan and i don't know where walk don't know where the only island goes

228
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,840

232
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,000
it out is a good guy

233
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
school

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,600
he got sharp claws

235
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,680
and i hope he does not know what a lot of the panic attacks i had when i was

236
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,000
smoking weed in high school was uh...

237
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,860
i thought that

238
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,800
i was going to get high in the cops are going to immediately show up to get

239
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,340
because not going to do it yet they have a detector you're going to allow it

240
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,840
they could tell that we're being too loud

241
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,080
because of marijuana

242
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,280
so i would talk very quiet and i think you like

243
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,040
"Guys, can we keep it down?"

244
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,920
And I thought the cops were going to show up.

245
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:33,600
The funniest thing is in LA at the dispensary that was near campus, there was like a cop

246
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,000
who stood there and checked your receipt when you left to make sure you weren't stealing

247
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
shit or whatever.

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,080
And whenever he checked your receipt, he would nod and be like, "Well, enjoy the high."

249
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:47,200
So funny.

250
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,200
full cop out yeah enjoy the high I don't know I like I wonder if they told him to

251
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,360
say that if he just came up with that yeah dude he totally did how old was he

252

And he was in grown ups too. Shaquille O'Neal.

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,360
- Yeah.

270
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,320
- There's like a Shaq tweet from like 2011

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,320
where it was like going to Barbara Yard, statue time.

272
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,840
And he's like, "Damn, my fingers are too big for my phone.

273
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,200
"Damn autocorrect.

274
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,800
"Anyway, going to Harvard Yard, statue time."

275
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,160

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,880
- He challenged Chris LaAngel to levitate him.

280
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,880
- I didn't see that one.

281
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,960

282
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,420
on Criss Angel's show.

283
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,680
- Wow. - Yeah.

00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,520
- Yeah. - Opportunity.

286
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,360
I would love Criss Angel to levitate.

287
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,120
- I would love to get levitated.

288
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,600

289
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,520

290
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,120
- Onto my dick. - Criss Angel.

293
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,520
- Yeah, yeah, hypnotizing him to levitate you.

294
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,760
- Yeah, Jedi mind tricking him.

295
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,960
- Yeah.

296
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,600
- You will levitate me, Criss Angel.

297
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:25,200
a random guy on the street. It's just a homeless guy. Yeah. I saw the chatterbox guy today.

298
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:31,040
Oh yeah. The homeless guy and he uh he was it's the first time I seen him in a while. He was wearing

299
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:37,440
a Santa hat and he was walking back and forth on the corner and he was yelling "Ho ho ho, ga ga ga ga

300
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,200
ga ga ga ga ga ho ho ho!" Yeah. What if he's the real Santa? I think he is. That'd be awesome. Yeah.

301
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,520
If you think about it, Santa would be homeless because he lives in an igloo and that's not a

302
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:55,280
real house. So if you think about it for more than one second like me, you kind of understand.

303
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,040
I met Santa, she's black.

304
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,560
Yeah, so...

305
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,040
I think that's the only funny thing I've come up with in the past like three months.

306
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,080
Yeah, I think that's funny.

307
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,440
I met Santa, she's black.

308
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,240
I think it's pretty funny. Not. I'm joking. I think it's funny.

309
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:22,480
The Santa is black not like Borat. Yeah, like Borat. Yeah. The Santa is not black.

310
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,800
What a good movie. Yeah. Pretty funny to me. I watched Star Wars, I watched the three Star Wars

311
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:36,080
once. Yeah, three Star Wars Borats. Three Star Wars outside Ebbing, Missouri. Three Star Wars.

312
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:48,200
three borats outside Missouri. What about that? Yeah. What about the shape of Borat?

313
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,320
The shape of Borat, okay. And it's like the shape of water. I like his sex. Yeah. And

314
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:58,640
then they have sex in the water. But he's a fish. Okay. Okay, what else? What else we

315
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:06,120
got? Borat Wick. Borat Wick. Yeah, that one's good. That's pretty good. Okay, what about

316
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,120
Borat Star Wars.

317
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,120
Okay, I can see that.

318
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
What about Borat?

319
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Borat Jar Binks.

320
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,120
No, that's not a movie.

321
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
Jar Jar Borat.

322
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
That's not a movie.

323
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
We're doing it with the names of movies.

324
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
Oh, okay.

325
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Try again.

326
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Borat's List.

327
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
Okay.

328
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Borat's List.

329
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
It's just...

330
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
He's a Nazi.

331
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
(laughing)

332
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,160
He's a Nazi.

333
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:41,700
- Man, I watched that the other day for that fuckin' paper.

334
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,620

364
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,360
Rise of Skywalker? No. I want to see it. Then I can't talk about it. I don't really care.

365
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:35,480
I'll probably wait until it goes on streaming. I've been using Anna's Disney Plus. It's good.

366
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,760
controversial opinion but it's good when compared to the other two sequels which

367
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:49,160
are bad so it's not very good yeah I watched force awakens recently force

368
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,960
awakens is so bad I thought it was it was fun to watch but it do yeah it was

369
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,400
was just the first one. The first time I watched it I was like, Oh yeah, yeah, you

370
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,400
know, like, Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

371
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,400
this is pretty promising. Oh, oh, they got all the new Star Wars guys. Oh, wow,

372
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,100
okay, okay. I can't wait to buy all the toys. Oh my god. They've added so many

373
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,100
toys. There's so many toys I'm gonna miss out on. I hope they make a toy out of

374
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,560
the guy who sells for the droid. I hope they make a toy out of the fat guy in

375
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:28,160
backgrounds I hope to make a toy out of Meach Mongo. Meach Mongo? You know the new Star Wars character?

376
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,480
Meach Mongo is a four foot tall. It's a really problematic character. Yeah.

377
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:41,680
Oh yeah that's uh so everyone was complaining I mean not everybody but like people people like

378
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,080
to make the joke like oh yeah the Star Wars movies stopped being good when they had when they stopped

379
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,360
like having racist yeah when they stopped having the racial stereotype because the

380
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,380
prequels is just all racial yeah so just so haven't they always been good then

381
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,940
except for the new trilogy if you're going by that metric but what are their

382
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,820
racial what are the racial ones that stereotypes in the original trilogy the

383
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:12,200
original trilogy I guess is uh who well I mean there's Lando Calrissian black guy

384
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:21,320
right? Han Solo, that's white guy. There's a goddamn character in Star Wars that is

385
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,760
an a like half like an android named Lobot. Yeah I did know about that one.

386
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,200
That is so fucking stupid. Jabba the Hutt's Italian right? What are we gonna name this guy?

387
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,680
I do like there's a guy in the first one who's a fat guy named Porkins.

388
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,680
It's so funny.

389
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:49,880
Isn't the pattern on his helmet the same colors as Abba's Abba too?

390
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,880
Is it?

391
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
That'd be funny.

392
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,320
Oh no wait, no, that's Bigg's Darklighter's helmet.

393
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,520
He has the Abba's Abba pattern on his helmet.

394
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Nice.

395
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,320
Yeah, it's so funny how before they knew they were like really going all in with it, they

396
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,400
were just kind of like, yeah, Porkins.

397
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
I don't know.

398
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
Yeah, Porkins.

399
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,400
Whatever.

400
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,680
There's a guy named Luke Skywalker and his friend is named Biggs Darklighter.

401
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,680
Yeah.

402
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Darklighter.

403
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,680
Goddamn, dude.

404
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,200
It's kind of like if there was dark combined with light.

405
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Yeah.

406
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,000
It's so funny, like everybody, like I get it, like, yeah, like people like Star Wars

407
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,480
when it's like serious, but then it's like, you gotta think.

408
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,480
When has it ever been serious?

409
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,720
Yeah, you gotta think about how fucking, first of all, the dialogue in those fucking movies,

410
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,720
second of all.

411
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,720
The acting.

412
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,860
acting in the fact that it's a fucking kids movie yeah

413
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,560
well i don't know there's some pretty scary stuff in there man

414
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,080
darth vader's breathing

415
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:47,280
sounds like my dad when he's trying to sleep yeah

416
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:52,040
and there's nothing scarier than my dad being woken up

417
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,480
don't wake daddy was about my freaking dad exactly that was the daddy was based on

418
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:03,240
my dad was based on will wake up daddy

419
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,560
based him off the game. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, no, it hasn't been, it's, I don't

420
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:14,040
think there's anything serious about it. Having watched it. They tried to lean in

421
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,560
with the prequels to like the seriousness of it, but it's like, it's

422
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,040
like politics, right? Yeah, it's like the politics of it, but it's like, yeah, it's

423
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:25,800
cool. This is clearly just like a thing to sell toys. Yeah. And then like with

424
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,240
episode three, they were like, all right, we're gonna lean in way too fucking hard.

425
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:36,160
And then the prequels and then the standalone movies are like yeah this

426
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,620
actually some of this is about how the characters get depressed. Yeah. Which I

427
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:45,380
just I'm fucking sick of that. Can we just have like a normal. Hey can we have

428
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:50,780
normal people who aren't depressed. Can we have normal in the world. Can I hang out with a

429
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,340
guy who's not sad. Right can I hang out. Can I just hang out. Can I hang out with you.

430
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:03,340

434
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:27,340
It's a promise of action.

435
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,340
It's a promise that I will commit my act if you do not leave me alone.

459
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,100

00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:28,620
put it. Hey boys, it's me, Mr. X-Men. I own the X-Men. I'm the professor. And I'm the guy

497
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:32,940
the professor was based on. I love your idea and I'm gonna start jacking people

498
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,660

499
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:43,660

500
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,260
school full of kids? I'm gonna, I'm not gonna jack off any of the kids with my

501
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:57,340
mind that would be clear yeah let me be clear wink see that time I didn't even

00:29:57,340 --> 00:30:03,980

503
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:12,560

504
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:23,240
can't wink when he tries to wink yeah this is both eyes at once the doctor

505
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,200
saw that all right okay there's nothing seriously wrong with this kid oh this

506
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,840
Put him in a wheelchair.

507
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,340
Put him in a flying wheelchair.

508
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,640
Put him in a wheelchair he can levitate with his mind.

509
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
That's the only cure we can...

510
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
Is that what he does or does he have...

511
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,080
I don't know if it does that or not.

512
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,280
In my brain I imagine he...

513
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,920
I mean why wouldn't he do that?

514
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,600
Can he move things around or does he just go into people's brain?

515
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,600
I don't know.

516
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,600
He might.

517
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,800
You know nobody knows.

518
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
That's the thing about X-Men.

519
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,720
Nobody really knows anything about them.

520
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
There's too much to read and there's not enough pictures.

521
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:02,360
Exactly, there's no pictures in any of the X-Men books, and so nobody's read them before.

522
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:07,680
It'd be nice, because they have very detailed descriptions of what Wolverine looks like.

523
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,680
He's 5'4", he's Canadian.

524
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,720
What more do you want?

525
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,720
That's all you really need.

526
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,720
That's all you need to hear about him, and then you know what exactly...

527
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,560
Did they make him short in the movies?

528
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
No.

529
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,560
No?

530
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,560
He's tall in the movies?

531
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Yeah, he's tall in the movies.

532
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
That's fucked up.

533
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:30,560
should have done what they did with the hobbits the hobbit trilogy and then the lord of the rings where

534
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:35,440
they do trick photography on hugh jackman the whole time to make him appear uh because hugh

535
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,640
jackman's like six feet tall yeah i think well i heard what they did with the hobbit is they put

536
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,800
all the actors into a juicing machine and made them into juice and then poured it into a small robot

537
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,640
and the juice was able to infiltrate the multiple circuits of the robot thus activating its

538
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:58,800
electronicity and kind of imbuing with the personality of the actor and creating a shorter,

539
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,200
more kind of functional actor that had hair on the feet.

540
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,760
So I'm not sure that process would work for Hugh Jackman because I mean, the Hobbits,

541
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:10,600
the Hobbits they used them and then they disposed of them.

542
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,720
They're not in any other movies because they throw away the robots.

543
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,440
That's why you don't see Elijah Wood in anything anymore because he was killed in the filming

544
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,520
of the three Hobbit trilogies.

545
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
So

546
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,560
The Hobbit movies that he was, it's so funny how much they fucked up the Hobbit.

547
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,560
Yeah.

548
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,760
The frame rate thing is like the funniest shit.

549
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,760
Oh my god dude.

550
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,480
It was so, it was so jarring to see that in the theater.

551
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,680
Just like the, it drops, it like goes up to 48 for some reason.

552
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,680
It doesn't go to like 60?

553
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,680
Yeah, yeah.

554
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
In the water.

555
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
The part in the river?

556
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,840
Yeah, the water rafting thing.

557
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,840
They shot it on GoPros.

558
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,720
It just looks haunted.

559
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Yeah.

560
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,280
So fucking weird.

561
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,440
So funny.

562
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,680
they should have let Guillermo del Toro do the Hobbit trilogy he was going to

563
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,080
yeah before they gave they should have before they should have put a gun to

564
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,240
Peter Jackson's head and said they should have made a long movie make a

565
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,960
sequel to brain dead and then put a gun to Guillermo del Toro's head and say stop

566
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,040
being Mexican and then they put a gun to Quentin Tarantino's head and say make

567
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,200
the Hobbit let's put a gun to Quentin Tarantino's head and said become Mexican

568
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,280
yes which you and Guillermo del Toro switched lives with nationality which

569
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,200
nationalities switch identities and we're just gonna see what happens yeah we just

570
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,800
want to know what would happen so I could do that right now we won't shoot you I

571
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:37,520
think if they replace the hobbit with a meet the feebles reboot yeah I haven't

572
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,000
seen meet the feebles that's it oh it's very bad there's the three well there's

573
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,640
There's brain dead, bad taste, and then meet the feebles, right?

574
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Is there another one?

575
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Bad taste is on Amazon Prime.

576
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,480
Bad taste is really good.

577
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,480
That's probably my favorite.

578
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,920
I like that more than brain dead, which I think is an unpopular opinion.

579
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,840
Brain dead's the poster with the mouth.

580
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
Yeah.

581
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,080
Really gross poster.

582
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
You should see it.

583
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,040
I saw meet the feebles and parts of brain dead.

584
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,640
Brain dead's parts of brain dead or parts of bad taste?

585
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
Parts of brain dead.

586
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
Oh, bad taste.

587
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
Yeah.

588
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,140
Bad taste and brain dead are both really good.

589
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,380
I think bad taste is way funnier to me, in my opinion.

590
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:14,100
But brain dead has way cooler effects.

591
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:14,940
- Meet the Feebles is like--

592
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,980
- That's like Muppets with AIDS, right?

593
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,460
- Yeah, it's like Muppet, there's a Muppet who has AIDS,

594
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,820
and then there's also like,

595
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:25,980
it's like if the, like, it's every joke someone makes

596
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,420
about like, oh, Burt and Ernie smoking crack and being gay.

597
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,940
- Yeah, so it's like Wonder Shows in.

598
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,860
- But not, it's like he misses the mark completely.

599
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,100
- Yeah, I've heard it's good.

600
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:43,580
it's like it's just there's a way that you could do it but like the music cues

601
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:47,260
and everything and just the way that like the characters interact is just very

602
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,780
like it's just depressing it's not even like

603
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,460
it's not even it's like a dark it's like too dark of a

604
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,500
puppet comedy oh yeah there's got to be like some light

605
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,820
moments in there but there's like zero light moment like every time that he

606
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,980
tries to like put in the light moments it just

607
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,860
It has to do a lot with the score, I think.

608
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,580
Yeah, the score is just people whispering.

609
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:17,980
Yeah, it's just people saying that there's reptilians in the government and you need to

610
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,780
chop off their heads.

611
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,620
Yeah, it's just this constant voice that says "kill everyone around you."

612
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:22,860
Yeah.

613
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,900
I've noticed most movies nowadays are using that score.

614
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,540
A lot of movies have been using the same soundtrack.

615
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,020
Rise of Skywalker too, I noticed.

616
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,100
It's just, it's them saying, it's like the same song, it goes, "You need, you need to

617
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,980
take off, you need to take off Donald Trump's head and you need to show the world this lizard

618
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:42,980
body."

619
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:46,540
Yeah, and it's, and it's sometimes it even just drowns out the dialogue.

620
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:50,420
I think that people are doing a bad job of mixing the audio in movies nowadays.

621
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,780
It's that and then the screams.

622
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:57,300
Yeah, and sometimes just like a weird clown nose honk.

623
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,100
that might be from outside and others a guy who hangs out

624
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,860
type the movie theater

625
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,980
who like a lot of people who are now those of the people who are the people

626
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,460
both the penis clinton was a

627
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:09,500

an audible no i don't know if there is a really a bit of surgical horn penis

629
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,940
about a surgical penis

630
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,460
it strikes a precision

631
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,740
picking

632
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,780
yes this is my surgical penis

633
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,500

652
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,860
he did one game with them and then decided that he wanted to leave.

653
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,980
And they removed the game from shelves soon after.

654
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,860
It's called Custer's Revenge.

655
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:32,300
Yeah, it's called Custer's Revenge.

656
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,300
Yeah.

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:36,740
I'm here to talk to you about

658
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:40,380
bringing me on the pod to talk about Custer's Revenge.

659
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,740
That's a crazy story.

Yeah, that story, he totally could have just talked with them before.

661
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:55,580
Yeah, like it's yeah, it's an interesting choice. Yeah, it was like, I don't think it was necessarily

662
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:59,340
the wrong choice. No, I don't think it was the wrong choice, but like, he's very interesting.

663
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:04,140
He totally could have just been like, well, the way that he frames it is that he had to do that.

664
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,380
Yeah, he had to either do that or deny going on the show and then blasting them on Twitter. And

665
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,300
it's like, yeah, there's a third option where there's a million options. You could kill them.

666
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,100
That's another option. Yeah, there's an infinite possibility. You could do anything actually.

667
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:22,540
Yeah, you could actually, there's actually a 50% chance. You could do the episode and go to 7-Eleven

668
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:27,100
before. There's a 50% chance. You could go to 7-Eleven first and then do the same thing you did.

669
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:32,860
You go to 7-Eleven two times and then do it. You go to 7-Eleven three times. Now, think about what

670
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:38,940
I just said. While I go to the 7-Eleven across the street and I get a hot dog, I will be back in five

671
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:45,660
And then in the 7-Eleven, there's a big line, you're just screaming, "I'm on a

672
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,220
podcast right now, I'm teaching you about Custer's Revenge, I need a hot dog before

673
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,820
five minutes is up, please let me go in front of you." "Oh my god, you need to speed this up."

674
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:02,060
But he totally could have just like messaged them and just said like,

675
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:06,940
"Hey, it's kind of not cool that you're doing this here, why don't you just do

676
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,860
this instead but yeah or why don't we talk about it yeah why don't we talk

677
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,420
about this before the episode or like why don't we talk about it on the episode

678
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:19,260
but he could tell them beforehand right yeah I mean whatever power to I don't it

679
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:23,980
doesn't doesn't matter I don't care none of it affects me yeah exactly I don't

680
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,300
really care about native of the plight of the Native Americans is what Patrick is

681
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,580
trying to say I think no I think that's what Patrick you know as a point oh one

682
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:43,580
one

683
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:49,420
like a fraction it's like 1/64 but there's a decimal before the one. Okay

684
00:39:49,420 --> 00:40:05,060
there's two decimals, it's .01. .0000001/64. Okay, so that's a lot. I'm .0000001/64

685
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:10,740
Native American and I'm really offended that you said that. Said what? I don't

686
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:17,740
remember that i don't care about the plate of my oh yeah now you don't

687
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,180
uh...

688
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,540
that uh... he caught me dot uh... i was thinking about

689
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:26,300
stays xd a set

690
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,660
it's thinking about gay sex again

691
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,420
and try to figure out how to stop myself any listeners have any tips trying to

692
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:38,700
figure out how to stop it from happening to stop the case x from happening

693
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,420
i'm trying to find a way to travel around the world and stop people from having

694
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,300
gay sex

695
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,940
so if anyone wants to join my club... why don't we play cards against humanity instead you guys?

696
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,940
yeah, breaking into someone's house

697
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:55,060
here, try this game. I think this will get your binoculars out.

698
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,180
hey

699
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:01,020
couldn't help but oversee. I saw stuff was getting hot and heavy in here

700
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:05,220
and you're two guys. or two girls, I don't even know.

701
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,340
Why don't we play cards against humanity? Why don't we play Monopoly 2?

702
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:14,740
I just invented it. Is there Monopoly 2? No, I admit there's Monopoly for kids. Yeah, that's Monopoly 2.

703
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,460
That's Monopoly Junior, which is basically Monopoly 2. If you think about it, Junior is like the

704
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:25,620
second, right? So Monopoly Junior is like Monopoly the second. The thing about Monopoly for kids is

705
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:29,780
it's pretty much the same. There's some simplified rules, but instead of it being like... I'd rather

706
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,500
play Monopoly for kids. Instead of being hundreds of dollars, it's just like you have like a one

707
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,660
one this is one illnesses to

708
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,220
was this three it like you know it's like you collect two dollars from the

709
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,400
president

710
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,940
when this is five that's it it's not a six you don't get a sense seven it's not

711
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,580
a moment on this is the

712
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:51,220
when i saw him in a leading your when it says not even a bleeding and it was

713
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,180
that's not him

714
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:53,420
because of the five

715
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:57,220
i know 'cause i played not be a camera plays until the age of eighteen

716
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,860
one of the upgraded to monopoly middle

717
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:03,380
which is in between not please in your normal not only college edition

718
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,580
probably

719
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,260
monopoly for that for the smart child for the gifted child or child when i and

720
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,660
that's when they have friends and i want

721
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,220
that looks pretty funny to forking cabbage usually a wrinkled up cabbage

722
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,440
yeah we're talking about patrick's p_n_n_'s

723
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,140
i'm pulling out my penis to show cameron on the pod

724
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,660
uh... i was saying you you we need

725
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,140
to about uh... sparkling corn i want to discuss or a little horn

726
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:33,100
on your we're going back and forth uh... with food names so they're doing so

727
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,380
sparkling corn is kind of like

728
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,620
it's like carbonated it's a sparkling water but it's corn

729
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:42,780
and i was so if you guys can imagine what that tastes like

730
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,320
sink think about it and i think i'm on a silence

731
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:50,820
okay splinters the minds of his splinter and put a splinter and i thought it was

732
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,940
what

733
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,500
that's what revenge is there return to the

734
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:57,580
the empire's i expect was supposed to be called the events of the return of

735
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,420
Revenge of the Return of the Empire. What was this supposed to be called?

736
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:03,820
It was supposed to be called Splinter of the Mind's Eye.

737
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,580
Damn, that's badass.

738
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,100
And there's a lot - it's like a novelization.

739
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:09,660
Yeah.

740
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:15,500
So it's like the first draft of like a sequel to Star Wars and George Lucas had no idea what he was

741
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:20,780
going to do with it. And like before Luke - so if you read it now, it's like really fucked up

742
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:24,460
because it's like he was going to go forward with a Luke and Leia relationship.

743
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:24,940
Yeah.

744
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:29,500
but now like knowing that they're siblings like there's like scenes in the book where it's like

745
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:35,340
Luke could not stop staring at Leia's beauty. Like he doesn't know how to levitate things with the

746
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:44,540
force. Damn. Does he meet Yoda? They fight Darth Vader on Dagobah. Whoa. Yeah. And Leia has a

747
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:52,540
lightsaber. Like what color? Girl color. She's a pink one. He has a pink lightsaber with a flower

748
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:59,540
on the end. Every time she swings it, it makes flowers. And it smells really good.

749
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:04,800
Yeah, what if they made a lightsaber that smelled really good? Damn, I would be

750
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,900
smelling that shit all day. I bet lightsabers smell really bad. Yeah, probably

751
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:12,460
smells like burnt hair. Cause you're burning all the dead skin cells in the

752
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:18,420
air. Yeah, exactly. In Star Wars, in Star Space, there's a lot of... In Cyber Space.

753
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,860
cyber chase uh...

754
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,780
fuckin uh...

755
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:25,040

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,060
so sparkling corn return the sparkling

757
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:29,460
it

758
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,740
yeah let's go back to sparkling corn yet do we need to

i live fairly close to the venue my address it my address is one one one one

794
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,840
one one one one president lockbuster president avenue

795
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:59,880
blockbuster video

796
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,140
blockbuster city yeah

797
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,240
in almost a similar president got impeached

798
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:07,560
yeah he's in jail right

799
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,240
yet i was so excited

800
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,200
impeachment doesn't lead to like a media like

801
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,960
well the thing which i wish there was like uh... a statement like impeachment

802
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,500
only happens like every

803
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:24,000
so often but when it does it's like some weird like death it's a weird like

804
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,880
fucking rule from like the seventeen hundreds yeah we have a little bit like

805
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:30,840
i have to a rotating and you know you get like

806
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,000
put on a spit

807
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,360
or so you know you're like you gotta get like

808
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,880
uh... there that they put a cow they put

809
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,200
uh... granny smith apple in your book

810
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:44,560
the uh... and they have to shoot a arrow at it to you

811
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:47,720
the thing i think everyone is underrating is uh...

812
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,720
they're not going to give sanders the nominee nation they're going to give it

813
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,600
to biden uh... uh... and biden's gonna lose against ron so trump gets impeached

814
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,360
it means that he's not

815
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,920
he won't get reelected

816
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,680
i feel like everybody's class you know where that everyone's like

817
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:04,960
well there will be a few in this way it doesn't mean anything

818
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,760
but he's not going to be probably will get reelected so

819
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,840
yes that's nice

820
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:13,400
i've i feel like if you get impeached you shouldn't be able to run again i don't

821
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,520
i'd you might not be able to i don't know

00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,440
We say ah.

999
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,440
We say sucka.

1000
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,200
But if you want to take, if you want to.

1001
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,480
I really want to know if it's possible.

1002
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:48,480
Yeah.

1003
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:51,880
If you want to partake in the sparkling corn challenge.

1004
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,360
(laughter)

1005
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,600
- What you need to do is take a--

1006
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,960
- You take a soda stream, you fill it up with mostly water

1007
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,560
and a little bit of corn.

1008
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,640
- Like a cup of corn.

1009
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:03,520
- Like a metric cup of corn.

1010
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,200
- Like a standard metric cup.

1011
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,040
- Like the cup in your kitchen.

1012
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,300
- Like the size of one of your cups.

1013
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,140
- You put--

1014
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,420
- And put corn, cut it off the cob.

1015
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:15,480
Don't put the cob in.

1016
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:16,600
- You can use frozen corn.

1017
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,280
- We don't want a sparkling cob.

1018
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:21,360
'Cause you can't eat the cob to test it.

1019
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,360
You can't eat it if it's corn on the sparkling cob.

1020
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:28,360
Corn on the sparkling, normal corn on the sparkling cob.

1021
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,600
(laughing)

1022
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,560
It sizzles when you touch it.

1023
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,060
You just feel it when you touch the cob.

1024
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:41,240
So you put the corn in the soda stream.

1025
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:45,460
And then you turn on the soda stream.

1026
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,660
And then you send us those results.

1027
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:50,460
You send us the spreadsheet of your results.

1028
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:53,460
You send us your hypothesis and your data and your shit.

1029
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,140
Your hypothesis and your scientific method.

1030
00:57:55,140 --> 00:58:00,900
And then you send us a video of you eating the corn and you say, "I just took the sparkling

1031
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,900
corn challenge and I feel great."

1032
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,140
I just took the sparkling corn experiments.

1033
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,140
Yeah.

1034
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,660
And in 2020 we're only doing experiments, no more challenges.

1035
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:13,120
No more challenges, social experiments.

1036
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:17,100
Social media experiments, scientific experiments, not social ones.

1037
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:22,620
We're going to put launched a rocket to the moon and you put a bunch of spiders on if you superglue to

1038
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,900
uh

1039
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:25,900
You're a fork to a knife

1040
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,300
Facing the same direction. Yeah

1041
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,340
Yeah

1042
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,700
What would happen?

1043
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:38,860
That's called the super gluing a fork to a knife experiment and teens everywhere are going viral with it

1044
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,420
What happens if you superglue?

1045
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,860
A trash bag closed and fill it up with air

1046
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:48,700
and jump on it like a trampoline.

1047
00:58:48,700 --> 00:58:53,020
I think you might, if you do a big enough contractor bag, it could just work as like a bean bag

1048
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:54,020
chair.

1049
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,020
I think it could work as a trampoline.

1050
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:56,020
Yeah, that's true.

1051
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,020
If it's a bouncy enough bag.

1052
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,100
Yeah.

1053
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:03,420
What would happen if your dad found out you were stealing his money?

1054
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:09,820
Take the dad's money experiment.

1055
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:10,820
I stole my dad's money.

1056
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:15,100
You have to post it with the hashtag steal your dad's money experiment.

1057
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:17,100
I stole my dad's money.

1058
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:23,100
I stole my dad's money and then you have to make a video of me saying I stole my dad's money and he found out and I feel great.

1059
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:25,100
Yeah, and I feel great.

1060
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,100
Yeah.

1061
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,100
I'm just chilling.

1062
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,100
Ugh.

1063
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:30,100
Yeah, I don't know what would happen if...

1064
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,100
Ugh, boy.

1065
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,100
Yeah, that's uh...

1066
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:35,100
I feel like I fucking drooled in my sleep.

1067
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,100
Look at that.

1068
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,100
That's gross.

1069
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,100
All the cum that leaked out of Pat's mouth.

1070
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:42,100
No, it wasn't cum, it was drool.

1071
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,100
Made a penis shape on the pillow.

1072
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,100
It was mouth water.

1073
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:47,100
It was mouth wash.

1074
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:49,100
It was mouth wash from my mouth.

1075
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,100
I make mouth wash out of my mouth.

1076
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:55,100
My mouth was watering because I was having a dream about a big rotisserie chicken.

1077
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:57,100
About a big rotisserie mouth wash.

1078
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,100
About a big bottle of mouth wash.

1079
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:03,100
Chicken boiled in Listerine.

1080
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:06,100
I want this mouth wash chicken so bad.

1081
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,100
It looks so good.

1082
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,100
In your sleep you're just going.

1083
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,360
(laughter)

1084
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:17,500
- What time are we at?

1085
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,660
- Oh, we're in an hour.

1086
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:19,500
- All right.

1087
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,700
- Merry Christmas everybody.

1088
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:22,740
- Merry Christmas, we're not gonna do another regular--

1089
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,340
- No normal episode, so--

1090
01:00:24,340 --> 01:00:25,380
- Yeah, just a premium.

1091
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:26,220
- You guys enjoy this.

1092
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:27,540
- We're on Christmas break now.

1093
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,620
- We're on Christmas break,

1094
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:30,940
and also Patrick's on Hanukkah break,

1095
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:33,260
'cause I'm just being informed by text message

1096
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,700
that Patrick has converted to Judaism about five minutes ago.

1097
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,540
- Yep, I chose to be chosen.

1098
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:43,500
all right thanks and thanks for a hundred dollars thank you for who is the last

1099

01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:57,260
willful for next time you get a bit of shadow yet

1103
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:01,580
if you if you were the person who pushed us over the edge to the pushes to the

1104
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:04,540
limit of where you're going to go over the limit and you know we're talking

1105
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:05,340
about

1106
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:06,900
you know who you are

1107
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:09,840
and we can do to the respect we do to but

1108

were too lazy to look it up right now but we were so we do we're not lazy that's

1109
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:16,540
we don't do it on premium always all right okay

1110
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,660

1116
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:33,740
out

1117
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,460
Yeah, but it's Caleb and nobody cares what he has to say.

1118
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,460
Yeah, that's true.

1119
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:38,460
Alright, bye!

1120
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:38,460
Bye!

Bye.
