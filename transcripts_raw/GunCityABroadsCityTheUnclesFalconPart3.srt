1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mm-hmm, okay

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Last time on gun city stories a broad city the uncle's Falcon

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:14,800
Our intrepid detectives made their way to mommy good legs club where the eponymous mommy asked them to meet her in her dressing room some

4
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,680
Alone time and to gather some information on famed activist Sean McElwee's disappearance

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,280
McElwee's

6
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,520
Before they could get there, however, the lads found themselves face to face with a fearsome

7
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,540
stag party obsessed with snogging mommy good legs.

8
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,640
They duped it out, as it were, Blowtoss beating a few of those limey punks to death with his

9
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,200
pipes, Patrick Yoda used his trusty hoverboard boomerang and hoagie to wham bam Margera a

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,920
couple others, and Ray William Johnson threw his patented sexual grenade to annihilate

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,380
and humiliate the rest.

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,340
In the process, they saved a young British orphan's soul from the allure of being an English soccer

13
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,460
fan type, and from being covered in Ray William Johnson's deadly seed, avoiding a disastrous

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:06,380
Chris D'Elia type of situation for the podcast.

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,880
After taking care of business, the gang rolled up to Mommy's dressing room, where she divulged

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,460
some additional intel about Sean's activism before his disappearance.

17
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,780
#AbolishCox

18
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,020
Feeling friskier than Caroline Calaway when anyone is paying attention to something other

19
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,620
than her, Patrick Yoda started bounding about Mommy's dressing room looking for coins.

20
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,480
He found a few and him and Rey had a brief spat over these precious quarters.

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,880
Mommy told the gang to meet her at the club tomorrow in the AM, where they'll have more

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,980
time and perhaps more privacy to talk.

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,700
The gang left the club and were confronted by a one Michael the Crawler.

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,740
He told them to come to the abandoned porno factory because his employer was interested

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,340
in their activities.

26
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,900
In Yoda's mind, Patrick Yoda learned that the Crawlers' new tent was nefarious, and

27
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,500
he and Blotas began a little impromptu interrogation of their own.

28
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,540
Meanwhile, a despondent Ray William Johnson wandered the lonely highway of Gun City, unsure

29
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:07,500
of his detective abilities and dividing my attention between the two scenes.

30
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,580
Subdued, Michael the Crawler was ready to talk, but before he could, his body exploded,

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,580
cock first.

32
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:20,580
The gang, incensed, made their way to the abandoned porno factory, where they saw two V-like,

33
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,080
you know, virtual, like, iron warriors guarding the facility.

34
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,660
Using their wits and wiles, they made their way in, and now stand face to face with a

35
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:33,580
mysterious door, somehow less decrepit than the rest of this forgotten-

36
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
Excuse me.

37
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,580
You idiot.

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,580
Alright, just go again.

39
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,580
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,580
That was involuntary.

41
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,580
That was involuntary.

42
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,580
You could've at least turned more away from the light.

43
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,300
that was a volunteer police department

44
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,580
what do you think

45
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:49,020
i did not even know that i was going to have to talk about it

46
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,160
does it have to do it

47
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
i'm leaving that in

48
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,620
the

49
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,420
somehow less decrepit the rest of this

50
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,080
what is behind the door

51
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,780
what is the hashtag abolished tax

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,700
where is sean mckelvey

53
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:12,540
Why is the Milwaukee Police Department allegedly running a pedophile trafficking ring?

54
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,020
Maybe we'll find out on Gun City Stories.

55
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,540
A Broad City, The Uncle's Falcon, Part 3.

56
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:24,300
Which is uh, where we're at now.

57
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Woo!

58
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,300
Woo!

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,300
Woo!

60
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,300
That's what's up.

61
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,300
Yeah, so that is what's up.

62
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,380
You guys are, so yeah, that's what happened.

63
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:38,220
So last time, you guys were sort of goofing around, doing a little deception on those two

64
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,500
sort of hulking, seemingly sort of like virtual guards.

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,380
And Cameron, you told them, I believe, that you were repairmen.

66
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,380
Yes.

67
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,580
Of some kind.

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,580
And they believed it.

69
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:59,580
So you guys are standing in front of this door that was like less broken down than the

70
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,260
rest of the abandoned porno factory so what do you what do you guys want to do

71
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,380
what's what's going through your heads I'm gonna walk I want to walk into the

72
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,540
door wait is there a doorbell yeah that's a good question there's no door

73
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,860
bell all right that's all that's always my first question I just have to make

74
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:21,780
sure is a knocker though okay I use the knocker I'm gonna use your knockers but

75
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:27,220
Don't don't use the knocker. Okay. Why why not can well we can

76
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:34,500
We can is there a window what can we do come on spit it out?

77
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,300
Is there a window can you do you see a window I

78
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,860
Don't know. Maybe we should investigate another way in

79
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,780
Okay

80
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,260
Hey man, go for it. Sure. You go ahead, you go ahead Patrick. What Patrick, I have an idea.

81
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:57,180
I'm gonna investigate. Patrick, why don't you go into some distant room and just yell from really far away.

82
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:03,180
Okay. To have a conversation with us like you do every time we're investigating something.

83
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:09,180
That's a good idea. That's not a bad idea. Okay yeah, so what are you doing Pat?

84
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,180
I'm probably gonna go... Or you want to investigate or see if there's another way in?

85
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,660
I get self-conscious about them saying that so

86
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,500
So I stay with the party

87
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,140
Because you told me it was a bad idea I think you I think you are

88
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:34,700
You know embarrass you get embarrassed and you were kind of like you're two older brothers and you just do what we say

89
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:38,840
I'm no, I'm the oldest you do not use the knocker wait

90
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,620
Years old

91
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,180
Do a push-up right now. No. Do a push-up.

92
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,180
Dude, wait, wait. No. Oh wait, I'm getting a call.

93
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,180
I take out my phone and I put it to my head.

94
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,180
Right, yeah. Oh my god, it's the chief.

95
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,180
He says that you have to do a push-up right now.

96
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,180
I don't have to do a push-up.

97
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,180
Chief is right. He said you have to get me a glass of water, but I'll time it.

98
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,180
Retired. You don't have to get a glass of water from me.

99
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
No, you have to do a push-up.

100
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,180
You are not, you're not gonna get water.

101
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,180
Now you're just proving a point.

102
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,180
I'm telling you that now. You're getting no water.

103
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,260
- No water. - Just knock on the door.

104
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,220
- Touch the knocker.

105
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,160
- I'm not touching it. - Touch it.

106
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,580
- You touch it. - If you don't touch it,

107
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,140
you're gay. - I'm gonna touch you.

108
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,380
- Don't touch me. - I'm gonna touch you.

109
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,340
- Don't. - I touch Patrick.

110
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,180
- Ah!

111
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:26,000
(laughing)

112
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,060
- Okay, yeah, you can-- - I'll just knock on the door.

113
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,900
- I knock on the door.

114
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,260
(laughing)

115
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:34,180
- Okay, yeah, you knock on the door with the knocker

116
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,620
and there's no answer.

117
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:37,660
- Great.

118
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,160
- I try to open the door. - Wait, wait, Patrick, you try.

119
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,120
It might work if you do it. It might work. I try the doorknob. Okay yeah the door is

120
00:06:48,120 --> 00:07:01,080
open. Fuck. Yeah so yeah you open the door and before you is a... the room before you

121
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,320
is dark. Nearly too dark to see but what you can make out is a laboratory of some

122
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,280
kind. Test tubes, beakers, Bunsen burners, diagrams and equations, a 24 by 36 inch

123
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,840
poster of Marie Curie riding the Sibian, all the trappings of a fully functioning

124
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:22,440
lab. Also there's a Technoslime linear accelerator, isolate synthesizer, as well

125
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,360
as a full thermal ablation device. You can roll your intelligence in a moment

126
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,560
to see what these things are, but the room seems to be recently abandoned. It's

127
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,120
one of the Bunsen burners is still on, bubbling what appears to be raw Technoslime

128
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,720
cooling during the tail end of the thermal ablation process.

129
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,120
On behalf of this, don't tell him what'll happen.

130
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
So yeah, you guys are in here.

131
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,120
Um, actually let me see...

132
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
I walk up to you and I drink the slime.

133
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,120
Okay, yeah, you drink the slime?

134
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Yeah, the pure Bunsen burner slime.

135
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,120
Okay, yeah, so, uh, uh, do you, do you, okay, yeah, you roll up and drink the slime.

136
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Um, uh, oh man, okay.

137
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
Uh, so.

138
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,840
So, uh, anybody else engage with the slime or is it just Gale?

139
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,840
If you do, I'll kill you.

140
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Yeah, I don't, I don't engage with the slime.

141
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
So, I did the whole thing.

142
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Okay, so let's, let's resolve, uh, let's resolve the slime and then I want to do Patrick's investigation.

143
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,360
Yeah, and I want to, I want to look at the equipment too after that.

144
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,360
I want to see what's there.

145
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
That's investigation.

146
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
No, it's different.

147
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
I'm determining what it is.

148
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
It's determination.

149
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
You're still investigating.

150
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,560
Why don't you just investigate with me?

151
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,480
No, I don't want to do anything with you.

152
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Let's do the slime.

153
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,480
Wait, what's that about?

154
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
He didn't do push-ups.

155
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
He also yelled when I touched him.

156
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
And that was not cool.

157
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,480
I am sensitive.

158
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,480
I'm sensitive.

159
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
I'm sensitive, you see.

160
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Yeah, like a girl.

161
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,480
We're gonna work this out over the course of this episode.

162
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
Hey, nice boobs, girl.

163
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,480
I don't have boobs like a girl.

164
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,480
You have to roll them.

165
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,480
Caleb is saying this

166
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,480
this well drinking the slime so it's just a bubble. I'm doing like a ventriloquist trick.

167
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,480
You've got sort of really tiny boobs. I don't have two tiny... One is a four and one is a six.

168
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:22,480
A cup. I don't have boobs. Well what am I staring at and drooling over right now then?

169
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,480
You're looking at my penis. You're staring at and drooling at nothing because you just drank.

170
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,480
No, you're hallucinating.

171
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,480
You're hallucinating.

172
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Oops, I'm Patrick.

173
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
A panorama of colors, lights, and gnarled subspace

174
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
flood your senses.

175
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,480
Wait, you had something written for me drinking the whole thing?

176
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,480
Oh yeah.

177
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,480
I was pretty sure one of you guys

178
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
were gonna do that.

179
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,480
So I was just in case I had something ready.

180
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,480
As you attempt to move your body,

181
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,480
you feel each cell vibrate and stutter

182
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
as if you're slipping through

183
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,280
vast primordial humming. Your bones and muscles weaken, melt and shiver back

184
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,840
together, re-render not reform within each moment. Space and time feel observable

185
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,840
like seas of swirling plasma clouding what remains of your sense of self. Is

186
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:18,540
this ego death? Ray William Johnson, you see one of the fat bitches you love so

187
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:23,720
desperately fall through the sky almost forever. The weight of their ass carrying

188
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:32,480
them towards something. To where are they falling? And from where have they fell?

189

Tell me. Where are they falling? Where are these fat bitches falling from? And

190
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,320
from where have they fell?

191
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:50,720

204
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,200

210
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:00,680
his giant tits as this happens and you're gonna have advantage on checks

211
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:07,120
any any ability check until tomorrow morning that's all fucked up damn you

212
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,720

213
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,240
I'm sorry well let's resolve that investigation we might find yeah

214
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,920
additional tonight some of the goodies in here mm-hmm yeah so do you guys both

215
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,920
want to roll an investigation and like sort of support each other I want to do

216
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,240
the intelligence check to look at the equipment oh yeah you said Pat you can

217
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:33,360
investigate something else but I'm doing my thing uh let's do Pat let's do you

218
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,200
first I roll an investigation yeah just roll investigation see what you

219
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:45,280
could find around here what I guess you got a seven which is is not the best but

220
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:49,480
yes you do you try to do your due diligence around the room you find I

221
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:57,040
roll again yeah I need to investigate harder no you can have you know one of

222
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,920
or other I think you'd have one other guy on the team also check do an

223
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,160
investigation with you and and you could take the higher role okay should I do

224
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,200
that well I'm the one with advantage oh yeah you have advantage on all checks so

225
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,480
you would get to roll twice and pick the higher one yeah you're basically right

226
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,720
now vibrating at a frequency that is kind of akin to a god yeah yeah I'm just

227
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:24,000
walking around shaking and I'm like I I should I'm thinking I'm gonna go back to

228
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,000
college to finish my degree. I'm having a lot of ideas right now. Yeah, you're about to

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,280
open a small business. It's gonna happen. Yeah. Alright, investigation, right?

230
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:44,800
There's one and there's two. What did I get? I can't see. Goddamn. Yeah, you got, yeah, you

231
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,160
rolled an absolutely beastly one. Yeah. So yeah, Patrick, you sort of

232
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,960
look around you sort of flip some books over and you sort of look at the test

233
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,720
tubes more closely and you don't quite get a sense of what's going on.

234
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:06,580
Ray William Johnson, you're sort of, yeah yeah exactly, yeah you're sort of

235
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:13,200
hyper, hyper PCP coked out brain is just like your irises are vibrating, you're

236
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:18,360
scanning the room and you can see pretty much most everything that's going on. You

237
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:26,760
find there's a bug over there yeah there's a weird bug he's on the desk get

238
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,680
him he's gone yeah yeah you saw you saw a weird bug it was you guys smell water a

239
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,800
centipede with a sombrero on and you saw that just sort of crawl by you look at

240
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,960
the you look at around and you find all sudden you sort of realize that there's

241
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:47,160
tons of Maxim magazine scientist edition just sort of scattered around you find

242
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,600
you find also underneath those magazines you can almost like see just barely

243
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,840
peeking some sort of blue paper and you rush over there and you look at it and

244
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,200
it's a blue print and it looks like it's for something called the

245
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:11,320
Coculus Rift 2.0 the Coculus Quest Cordless Experience. And there's also a

246
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:19,560
a name at the bottom of the blueprint that says designed by Dr. Tool Lateralis.

247
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:26,960
You also, you also sort of like your head exorcists around and you see something

248
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:33,500
else and you walk backwards over there and you see some of these pens these like

249
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:37,680
men in black style pens and Patrick Yoda you would recognize those immediately

250
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,360
actually as the ones that Gavin shit Tommy gun clippy guy was using to get

251
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,280
everybody high by seeing spots oh so you'd see both of those things sort of

252
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,960
there the cowboy bebop drug and I just and I just said that I just said that I

253
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:02,480
knew that so yeah yeah we'll fix it we'll have Patrick say that in post we'll

254
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,600
use a computer to generate his voice to switch Patch's voice to Patrick's voice.

255
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,600
Can I roll intelligence to see to look at the tool the drug making tools?

256
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:18,320
Yeah. I can figure out how they work. Yeah roll straight intelligence. Alright I got

257
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:24,980
eight. Okay yeah so you look in... Can I come out again? Yeah you can. I got an eight I look at

258
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,560
them and I say guys I think this is a boombox.

259
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:37,820
boombox I've been thinking of getting into music myself music is my life

260
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:44,840
investigation Oh at 20 not a good nation sorry what am I in my roles are so good

261
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,440
I I would say yeah yeah that's fine cuz I was gonna say you should add your

262
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,360
proficiency anyway um yeah so you look at so who's I'm cracked right now yeah

263
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,680
- Yeah, you're absolutely-- - This is crazy.

264
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,280
- Yeah, your roles are insane right now.

265
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:03,920
So with that 26, I mean, you can observe these things

266
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,880
and you could whip up more raw Technoslime

267
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,920
if you needed to.

268
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,760
- Do it. - Basically.

269
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,840
- Do it! (laughing)

270
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,200
- So yeah, if you wanna do it, you can do it.

271
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,680
- I'm doing it right now.

272
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,180
- Okay, yeah, you whip that up.

273
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,760
- I'm in the kitchen cooking Technoslime.

274
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,800
- Yeah, yeah, you're in the kitchen, you're cooking it up.

275
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,520
Yeah, you cooked that up.

276
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,720
So you have about, you know,

277
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,040
two more sort of offerings of that Techno Slime

278
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,000
that you can slurp down

279
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
with what you were able to scrap together.

280
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,500
- What should I put my Techno Slime points at?

281
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,720
- Let's see what you're talking about.

282
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,400
- 'Cause I've definitely eaten a lot of them.

283
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,480
'Cause I think I'm low on Techno Slime.

284
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,440
- Didn't we recharge them in the last session?

285
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,500
- I'm at four.

286
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,840
- Oh, yeah, well that's 'cause you failed the roll,

287
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,200
so you got half of it, I think.

288
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,040
- True.

289
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Was that what happened? Yeah, yeah. Yes, right? Yes. Okay. Yeah. So I mean, I would say you're at max at this point because it's just you're like kind of buzzing.

290
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:18,040
That's right. But yeah, I mean, you would also know and I'll tell this to you as a kind DM that the come down could be fierce. If you can do. Yeah, no, yeah, you're not. Yeah, you're gonna be awesome. Yeah. Okay.

291
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Yeah, okay, sick.

292
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Yeah.

293
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Yeah.

294
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:26,320
So, yeah, you have these two other sort of pints of raw Techno Slime that you can do whatever

295
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,320
you want with.

296
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:32,760
And you would also know that these are just from your, you would probably search your database

297
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,600
since you're fucking computer.

298
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:41,400
And you'd see that, like, in particular, some of these, the thermal ablation device seems

299
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,640
like a newer model.

300
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,560
that like, like wouldn't have been published yet as like, "Hey, product update from, from

301
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,360
uh, uh, Poppy Chuko's Techno Slime Company."

302
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,880
Unreleased? Is that what you're saying?

303
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,200
Whoa.

304
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,240
Yeah. Yeah.

305
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:05,960
Can I, can I, uh, does it have like a, um, uh, some sort of production mark on it? Can I see,

306
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,120
does it say made by whatever?

307
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,140
Yeah, um, yeah, I mean, it says that it's it's like Papi Chuko's like,

308
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:15,800
Oh, it is.

309
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:20,440
property. Yeah, it's just it's just like a it's clearly though, like a, a, if not a

310
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,400
prototype, it's like, you know, it's the, like alpha before release of this guy

311
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,440
just saying, so somebody is doing something with it ahead of time, I guess.

312
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:37,400
Hmm. Very interesting. Yeah, I don't know. This is all this is all a fella

313

314
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,700
us yet so I'm trying trying to turn on the boombox and I'm putting my ear to

315
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,500
the machine and pressing a bunch of buttons on it yeah yeah it's just sort

316
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:59,860

320
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:25,860
boombox and and IDM is actually a very valid genre when you think about it yeah

321
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,860
I know I was joking when I said that.

322
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
I don't think he was joking.

323
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860

You're too quarter shy of a dollar.

00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Yeah, you're not so sharp in your shit.

330
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:50,860
I miss, I don't understand that

331
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Patrick is, it's a figure of speech and I take out the 12

335
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,940

337
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,380
with it. Yeah so what it looks like is that there's a drawing of a vivisected

338
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:30,340
penis. And there's a, where a device, and you see like a sort

339
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:34,140
of a device being inside of the vivisected penis and arrow

340
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,020
pointing to it, right? And then you see a big X over that image.

341
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:42,260
And then you see a different image of a penis. And then what

342
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:46,900
it looks like some sort of like satellite. And then, and like a

343
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:56,500
big checkmark underneath that and and that's really it okay they're trying to

Hold on.

356
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,980

Either of you have my mom's phone number.

00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:40,860
Yeah, and the weird shit you're seeing

359
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:46,020
just comes, uh, uh, you hear thumping coming in, you hear, you see the two guards appear

360
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,700
at the doorway of the room at this point.

361
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,580
Are you guys seeing this?

362
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,220
And you guys over there.

363
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:58,460
You hear like a lightsaber type of "mmm" right, with the energy sword drawn from one of them.

364
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,020
And that first one says "Motherfucker, this is an abandoned porno factory, why would there

365
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,660
be repairmen?"

366
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,780
And the other one says "You tricked us, bitch!" and they're just overlapping, they keep saying

367
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,100
"You tricked us, you tricked us."

368
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,260
And we need you all to roll for initiative.

369
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,260
Aww.

370
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,260
Oh.

371
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,260
I hate fighting.

372
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:18,820
God, why can't we all just get along?

373
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,340
Why can't we all just get along?

374
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:23,740
I'm gonna say that to the cards.

375
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,340
My rolls are so good.

00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,340
Yeah, they uh.

I did better than you.

378
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,380
Yeah, but I have minus one.

379
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,180
My rolls are terrible.

380
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,420

381
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,820
I got a 14.

382
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,300
And Patrick got zero, clearly.

383
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:45,580
What am I rolling? You already rolled initiative. What did you get? Say I got a three. I got

384
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,700
a three. Nice, thanks for the clean take. Dude, that's a good Charlie Brown Halloween

drawing skills right. We're only paying you a million dollars. Yeah well it's a

390
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:27,780
million it's a maybe maybe a maybe a couple extra dollars you can get. A million and five.

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:35,180
A million and five dollars. Oh yeah that's all I need. Yeah so they're in front of you and it is your turn Cameron. Oh

392
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:42,980
Oh nice, alright so how far can I move? How many squares? Let's see here. It doesn't say

393
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,780
on my character sheet so I don't know. So squares are like 5 feet a piece. Yeah but it doesn't

394
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:52,540
I don't have a speed on my character sheet. You don't? It's 30 feet away from us. It should

395
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:57,540
be 30 yeah. Alright they're 30 feet away. It's a big ass lab. Alright you know what I'm not

396
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,040
gonna run up to them I'm gonna take out my freaking gun, my Grinch gun and I'm gonna pop

397
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:08,360
one in them do it all right let me hold it sideways yeah I hold it sideways and

398
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:15,300
it's a and it's a big sniper rifle style thing and I hold it okay that's an eight

399
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,360
on the attack roll yeah the whichever one you're shooting dodges it pretty easily

400
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,040
okay I shoot it I have an additional or no wait I have advantage because it's a

401
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:32,520
say I have my assassinate ability oh so I get to roll again yeah I just noticed

402
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:37,840
that when I was looking for my extra attack ability can I do that is that yes

403
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,360
okay can I just realize you have that that's 11 so that's not much better no

404
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,280
and it's not it's not enough to hit all right but Aaron I I say from the sideline

405
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:55,400
airball obviously you have an extra attack I have my extra attack I'm gonna

406
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,620
to spin the gun around on my finger like it's like like a cowboy would do right

407
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:11,960
and then shoot again it's the ground it's cool I'm gonna let it slide it

408
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:20,480
kicks up no it's badass all right and I say yee-haw - right okay do I still have

409
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,320
advantage on the second attack yeah cuz they still haven't taken a turn okay

410
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:39,080
that's a 21 then damn this is like a that shirt being underneath that sweatshirt

411
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:46,920
is so crazy and I got I got hot dogs shirt yeah my

412
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:55,040

413
00:27:55,040 --> 00:28:00,440
gun there we go for damage nice okay cool yeah so you which one do you shoot at by

414
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,320
the way just for my purposes folks the one on the left okay the one on the left

415
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,660
as the energy sword staged left the one done when you're looking at the map the

416
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:19,740
one on the left. So you'd never say stage left again man. Stage left. So yeah you shoot at

417
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:24,420
them so you shoot it and you can see that the bullet sort of like does this weird

418
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,300
thing where like it lodges into it and it sort of like disintegrates almost but you

419
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:34,780
can tell that it got hurt from the attack. Whoa. And so the guy like you know he's

420
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,260
just like and just sort of like it lurches back a little bit. Caleb it's your

429
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:38,940

dude I guess it yes you throw it at them and there they are just like oh they're

434
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,580
just like they're like getting covered in calm and just like lighting on fire

435
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:16,220
and you could see again that the fire and the semen sort of just like fades into

436
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,940
them almost in this weird way like kind of absorbs in but they are still clearly

437
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:25,180
getting hurt okay so I'm gonna say to the other two real quick mm-hmm I feel

438
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,540
I feel like we're missing something here.

439
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,320
Why is everything that we do, why are they absorbing it?

440
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,240
'Cause they're virtual.

441
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,400
Oh.

442
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,140

448
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,080
That was a heroic dose of techno slime that I did.

449
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,860
Anyway, I'm gonna go over here,

450
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,860

Despite your three, you actually did quite well compared to them.

455
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,860
Alright, um, so they're still 30 feet away.

456
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,860
Could I, no, why would I use Yoda's mind?

457
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,860
You could if you wanted to.

458
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,860
Oh shit, I accidentally hit hoverboard boomerang.

459
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,860

What's the, what's this, what's the skateboarding trick you do?

471
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,980
I'm curious.

472
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:09,160
Um, I do like a, like a spin, like I do like a, like the Rodney Mullen, like

473
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,880
one wheel, like spins that he would do in those videos and I do one of those to,

474
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,020
uh, get speed on the hoverboard and then I launch it across the room.

475
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,620
Yeah, you launch it across the room, it like, is spinning around and it's just like breaking

476
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,580
a bunch of test tubes and shit.

477
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:31,860
Uh, just, and like, catches him off guard and just whips one of them across the face.

478
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,820
And his head knocks it to the other one.

479
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:39,980
And uh, one, the one that you hit Cameron is looking pretty fucked up.

480
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,460
The other one is still holding together.

481
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,780
But uh, it's their turn now.

482
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,220
So let's see how they try to fucking manage this.

483
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:59,180
So the one guy with the energy sword, he runs up to you guys and he draws his energy sword

484
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,940
and he's going to try to slash at you Cameron.

485
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,460
He's going to try to like just see how he does though.

486
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:07,180
Oh yeah I don't think, what's your AC?

487
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
Oh I think I just see.

488
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,340
My AC is 15.

489
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,760
Oh that's just enough, yeah.

490
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,360
So he swings his energy sword at you.

491
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,640
How do you try to get out of the way and how does he hit you before I roll for damage?

492
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:27,200
Oh, well I try to do a limbo, but I lean back about one inch.

493
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,200
I'm very inflexible.

494
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,920
Yeah that's just one inch shy.

495
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,920
If I had gone two inches it would have missed me.

496
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,880
Oh yeah it would have changed everything.

497
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:43,880
Yeah but instead you went one and you take eight damage from this energy sword attack.

498
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:44,880
Damn.

499
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,600
just slashes through you. Damn I'm at 4 HP. Yeah and uh now what he's gonna do is he's

500
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,920
going to use his additional action to stare at you Ray William Johnson and I

501
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:03,200
need you to roll. I'm in the corner bro leave me alone I'm fucking up. I need you to roll a

502
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:12,240
deck saving throw right now it's not enough so manage it's still not enough

503
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:22,280
now so he makes perfect eye contact with you and like a please stop a be I

504
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:28,040
seriously can't handle this right now a beam that is imperceptible to everybody

505
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,760
else like kind of comes out of his eyes and goes a little rule you know whatever

506
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:40,480
the fuck like that kind of shit like please man I'm serious and you take let's

507
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,360
see what happened you take is never a good start to a sentence in D&D yeah you

508
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:55,160
take a slice of cake and it's delicious you take five psychic damage and you

509
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,820
You have disadvantage now on checks because you are paralyzed.

510
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,820
What?

511
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:02,820
Dude.

512
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,820
What?

513
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,820
Oh man.

514
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,820
So you have disadvantage on any relative checks.

515
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,820
You are paralyzed for one minute of in-game time.

516
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:12,740
So each round in a battle is six seconds.

517
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:16,500
But you have at the end of each turn, you have a chance to break out of this paralysis.

518
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Okay.

519
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,500
I'm chilling then.

520
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,500
Yeah.

521
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,100
So you're, that's where you're at.

522
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,700
And then this other guy, he's going to take out the needler and he's going to shoot right

523
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:42,700
you

524
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,640
my mouth can still move and I'm just like,

525
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,260
yeah, if I wasn't paralyzed right now,

526
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,460
I would pretty much dodge that pretty easily.

527
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:54,020
- Yeah, so a couple of the needles go into you

528
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,400
and I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

529
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,060
- Okay. - So just go to your con.

530
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,320
Nice, good, okay.

531
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,220
So you feel like, you know, what is that noise?

532
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,100
- I got an 18.

533
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,420
- You guys have a needler noise?

534
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,100
- Yeah, it's Cameron. - I'll put it in.

535
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,660
I mean, I'll just edit it in.

536
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:10,900
- Yeah, Cameron, can you put that in?

537
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,740
Okay. - I'll put it in.

538
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:19,540
there Caleb just so I have it. It's like meow. Okay yeah so it is a really random meow noise and

539
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:25,500
the needlers go into you and you feel your body start to vibrate but then it

540
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,460
stops you master resist it using your your your just your fortitude and your

541
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:36,780
whoa your pure Yoda wisdom. That was cool man. Yeah that was awesome. But you

542
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,980
still take respect you still take a damage though never mind yeah you're a

543
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,420
loser wait so how much damage do I take a just

544
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:56,540
a it could have been more you take a okay so Oh current and so now it is your

545
00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,300
turn Cameron all right the one with the energy source the one that's near me

546
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:05,820
that's the one that's looking pretty bad right yeah all right I'm gonna whack him

547
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:20,820
in

548
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,380
one of them you can swear actually just phases through him.

549
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,380
What the F?

550
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:32,900
I say, "What the F?" and then I try again with my extra attack.

551
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,900
That's a 17.

552
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,500
Yeah, that's gonna hit.

553
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,500
Alright, okay.

554
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,820
So, I mean, I'm gonna tell you now, describe your kill.

555
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,660
Seven damage, oh, alright.

556
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,980
Describe your kill on this guy.

557
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,940
Okay, well, I start drumming.

558
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,940
I start using the two, the lead pipes like drumsticks.

559
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,940
Absolutely.

560
00:37:52,940 --> 00:38:00,580
And I'm drumming the intro to Numa by Tool where it goes like...

561
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:06,500
And I turn to Kalo, to Ray William Johnson, I go, "Hey, I bet this pretty much sums up

562
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,660
how you're feeling right now, pal."

563
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:09,660
And then...

564
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:14,620
Okay, and I just go, "What?"

565
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,180
And I say, "It's, you know, it's Numa by Tool."

566
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:20,940
You're just beating this guy to death and turned the other way, explaining.

567
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:26,140
Yeah, and my eyes are like, are like spirals like in a cartoon when someone gets hypnotized.

568
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,340
Yeah, and I'm just like, "I... can you please just leave me alone for a few more minutes?"

569
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,620
It's kind of, honestly, this is taking a bad turn for me.

570
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:38,140
And I turn back to the guy.

571
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,980
And he's just a blob of meat, of virtual meat.

572
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,500
Yeah, yeah.

573
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:47,500
Do you think listening to Tool will help you calm down?

574
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Do you have like an iPod Nano?

575
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
I've got a...

576
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,500
Or something?

577
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,500
I have a SanDisk Clip.

578
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Yeah, that's in your inventory.

579
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
Absolutely.

580
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Okay, sure.

581
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,500
Just add that in.

582
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,500
Do you have 26 and 2 on it?

583
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,500
I have 25 to 6 to 4.

584
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,500
I don't think that's a Tool song.

585
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:20,380
that's Chicago it was an accidental download I thought I was downloading 26

586
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:29,180
- I guess I'll take it it would be one of the most jarring sonic either way

587
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:34,820
yeah if you thought I was Chicago and you got the tool or if you wanted the

588
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,300
tool and got Chicago just make it run give up listening the music if that ever

589
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:44,020
I guess I'm never using a line wire again.

590
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,180
Oh man.

591
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,180
Oh crap.

592
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:57,380
I just realized most of the files on this Sansa clip, they're all the Bill Clinton iFreeClub.com

593
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,100
ad.

594
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:06,020
So you're going to have to sit there and go through the tiny buttons.

595
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:10,860
You're gonna have to press the tiny button and find the ones that are actual songs.

596
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,980
That's about 8 gigabytes of video.

597
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
I free club.

598
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:15,980
I'm free club.com clips.

599
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
I free club.com clips.

600
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
I free club.com clips.

601
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,980
I free club.com clips.

602
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,980
Okay, just give it to me.

603
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,700
Okay.

604
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,780
It's got a clip on the back so you can clip it to your shirt.

605
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,980
Thank you, that is such a great feature.

606
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:32,340
I love when I clip my mp3 player to my shirt.

607
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,420
I'm gonna need it back after this.

608
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,660
You're never getting this back.

609
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,660
I need it back.

610
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:39,660
The other guy just shoots himself during this.

611
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:45,660
No, yeah, it's actually, Caleb, it's your turn.

612
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:50,660
You're still paralyzed, so there's not much you can do right now.

613
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,660
I challenge you to a battle of wits.

614
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:54,660
Well...

615
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,660
He says, "I accept."

616
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,660
Okay, riddle me this.

617
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:03,660
There is a man in the desert.

618
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,660
He's dying.

619
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,660
Okay.

620
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:09,660
The only thing near him is a rock.

621
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,660
Okay.

622
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,660
The country?

623
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,660
No.

624
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,660
Please let me finish the riddle. A rock.

625
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,660
He was never attacked and he took no sort of poison.

626
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:23,660
But he is dying.

627
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,660
Who is the man?

628
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,660
Uh...

629
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,660
I don't know.

630
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,100
Is it Drew Drees?

631
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
Would you like a hint?

632
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,240
Yes.

633
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,260
His name is Clark.

634
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,780
Okay, it is Clark Kent from Superman.

635
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:45,740
Fuck yes, you're right.

636
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:48,940
Yes, you were right.

637
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,740
Okay, good.

638
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,880
So...

639
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,100
The Rock is Kryptonite.

640
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,260
So I guess I lose.

641
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,500
All right, well you can keep fighting my friends then.

642
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,060
Okay.

643
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:03,120
Yeah, roll a, roll a...

644
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,620
That went so badly!

645
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:11,560
Yeah, roll a Constitution saving throw to see if you can sort of shake yourself out of this.

646
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,820
Oh, that's our Nat 20.

647
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,000
Yeah, you are free. You're free of paralysis, so for your next turn you'll be free.

648
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,120
Awesome.

649
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,260
Yeah, and now it is Patrick's turn.

650
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:25,460
Okay, so the guy... did the guy shoot himself?

651
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:27,000
No, he didn't.

652
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,420
That was not canon.

653
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,420
Okay, yeah.

654
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,620
So what I'm gonna do... Okay. Do I have like a... no, Caleb's the only one who has the free moves.

655
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:44,160
Okay. Well you can still move and do stuff, you just can't do a second attack.

656
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,600
Yoda's mind doesn't cost any techno slime. Please just kill him or he's gonna kill me. Oh, no, no, no, no.

657
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,700
I'm gonna kill him. Who are you talking to? I'm gonna make him kill himself.

658
00:42:54,380 --> 00:43:00,160
No, Yoda's mine. I'm gonna make him kill himself. Yoda's mine does cost techno slime point. Oh, it does

659
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,300
It costs I think

660
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,540
Your full amount. Oh shit. Okay, but you also have

661
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:12,260
Excuse me Yoda force

662
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:15,260
Okay. All right that I

663
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:21,060
Fucking how many techno slime points does that cost that cost? I have a bunch of techno slime

664
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:29,700
Yeah, we can just smoke whenever we need to recharge it. That's true. Killed it whenever you can okay, then I use Yoda's mind

665
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,620
mm-hmm and

666
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,740
I

667
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:39,260
Try to find the most embarrassing thought

668
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:47,300
He has in his subconscious. Okay. Hell. Yeah, I'm gonna that's that's definitely what's happening here. We roll for him, okay?

669
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,380
This is wisdom. I gave him wisdom.

670
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,580
Oh yeah, nice.

671
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,080
Okay. Hopefully this goes your way.

672
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,080
No, he got a crit.

673
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,080
Uh, 20.

674
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,580
Uh.

675
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:09,580
So he just like, you try to enter his mind and it's like a perfect prison that just like, boots you right the fuck out.

676
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,080
He says, "Don't go in there."

677
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:14,080
Okay. So is that my only move?

678
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,580
Um...

679
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,080
I'm screwed.

680
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,580
You can still, you can move around if you want to.

681
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:23,140
okay then I'm gonna where is he right now he's all the way over here you can see

682
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:35,220
him on the map he's at the bottom okay I go over here no I run it down so you can

683
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:40,740
move all right you could move like this I'm behind Cameron okay good okay

684
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,460
perfect okay yeah it is now that guy's turn and yeah he is gonna shoot at you

685
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:54,900
Cameron so let's see how he does it that you guys do not respect me at all I respect

686
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:01,180
you and then why are you protecting me I am here can I jump in or is it not my

687
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:05,980
turn no you made you made your choice and the message is clear but all right

688
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,580
no he he misses though he shoots needler at you and he misses and he hits Patrick

689
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:30,420
to

690
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:41,340
action to try to just like ram into you. Oh. Oh no. You got a crit. Oh no. You're so dead.

691
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:49,220
I'm dead. Yeah I mean yeah you're definitely gonna be knocked out. I hate

692
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,900
I hate to say it let's see how he does though I mean it's gonna happen. I mean

693
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:57,340
you're already you're definitely knocked out I want to see how bad. Yeah let's do

694
00:45:57,340 --> 00:46:06,980
it. Yeah, it's not great. You take 14. What? Yeah. Okay, so I'm at negative 10. Yeah, so

695
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:14,160
the way death works in D&D, people have different rules for it, but we would do death saving

696
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,340
throws, so we're gonna do that on this turn. I think we did that actually in our very first

697
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:24,420
one too. Yeah, you know how you gotta make three successes or three failures, right? Yes,

698
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:30,420
Exactly. And the only other way that death works, or not the only other, but one of the other ways is that if you...

699
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:37,420
And yeah, also if you get a crit 1, you take 2 failures. If you get a crit 20, you take 2 successes.

700
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:45,420
But also, if you lose... if your hit points are in the negatives, up to... that's like your negative of your maximum.

701
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,420
So if your max is 35, if you have -35, then you're just dead. There's nothing but death.

702
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,420
Okay.

703
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:57,020
now it's your turn so you have death saves you can roll okay your monkey is

704
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:01,780
just like crying trying to wake you up oh I forgot I had a money yeah yeah yeah

705
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,580
you should have thrown him at the guy damn I should have all right so I make a

706
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:15,940
death save that's all I can do die and learn all right oh no that's okay die on

707
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:20,740
the third absolute failure okay you got two failures in oh my god okay see if you

708
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:30,940
get one more failure you're you're you're kaput yeah yeah make a new character

709
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:35,300
Patrick I'm gonna kill you in real life I can do anything you didn't go behind

710
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:41,140
me this wouldn't have happened it's your turn Caleb so it's my turn yeah

711
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:47,580

And we're gonna get, um,

840
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,440
started on the will!

841
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,420
*laughs*

842
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:13,920
*laughs*

843
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,420
What?

844
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:14,920
*laughs*

845
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,680
We're gonna get started writing each other's wills!

846
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:22,280
Oh, oh yeah, I guess we should write wills, I mean we are married now, after all.

847
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:22,780
*laughs*

848
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:29,780
Okay, I'm- I'm uh, I'm a virtual robot, so I don't really- I don't have any assets, is that okay?

849
00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:32,440
But you do have, probably like, information, right?

850
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,100
Uh

851
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,100
I mean he has a needler right?

852
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,100
I'm like, I'm like hired you

853
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:41,600
Yeah he has a needler and he has information stored in his brain

854
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:43,600
I was not hired I was created

855
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,600
Yeah but you know who created you of course

856
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,600
That's a truth bomb right there

857
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:50,600
Uh I have a vague understanding of who created me

858
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:54,600
Okay so maybe just like include that in your will or something you know

859
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,600
Yeah

860
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,600
Yeah sure okay

861
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,600
And he writes down

862
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,600
And the needler and your money

863
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,600
Yeah you can have the needler

864
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:03,640
- Okay, okay. - And the hard drive.

865
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:04,740
- To make it-- - And the hard drive

866
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,720
in your brain.

867
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,580
- True.

868
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:10,640
And to make it fair here, I'll write my will too.

869
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,960
And I start writing and I say,

870
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:15,840
"First of all, a big bag of poop."

871
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,280
(laughing)

872
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,240
And that's pretty much it.

873
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,640
- All right, and I'm a notary,

874
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,520
so I have notarized your wedding certificate

875
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,720
and I have notarized both of your wills.

876
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,560
- Okay, good.

877
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:35,760
And now that that's all settled, how about you turn around for a second?

878
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,760
Yeah, sure. I'd love to do that.

879
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,760
Hey baby, yeah, turn around.

880
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,760
I love turning around. Yeah.

881
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,760
This is part of the evangelical way of turning around.

882
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,760
You wouldn't know this because you're Hasidic.

883
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,760
[laughter]

884
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:53,760
Yeah, you wouldn't know as a Hasid, but basically evangelicals, the wife always turns around at the end.

885
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:54,760
Exactly.

886
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,760
Hasids taste water.

887
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,760
Water has a flavor to us.

888
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:06,160
So then I immediately pull out my my Italian job hoagie that is so it's so much older now

889
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:14,000
Mm-hmm. It is it's like a couple hours older. It's hard. Yeah. Yeah, and I I just just knock

890
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,600
Just knock his head clean off

891
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:19,480
At least I knew love

892
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:27,340
goes flying away and yeah you guys I mean you guys and now we get everything I get

893
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:31,440
the needler because I don't have a weapon. Take the needler. Combat is over.

894
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,920
Yeah combat is over that's right and you have these two these two heaps. Wait wait wait.

895
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:44,840
Did we get everything off of the body's corpse? Oh yeah for sure. I have the

896
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:50,320
needler I don't we have to get the hard drive out of its head. Yeah so you get the

897
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:54,760
well that was written how about you just bring me back to life instead well we

898
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:00,040
got we got to get all this stuff we have we have a bunch of stuff to do actually

899
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:06,680
talking to I didn't say that in a game you guys are acting crazy I'm talking to

900
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,420
you in person and I'm telling you that maybe look at this little bitch blowtoss

901
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:17,900
he fell asleep in the middle of a fight I can't believe it he must have come

902
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:23,260
down with narcolepsy or something. He can't even handle his shit. He's like Rowan Atkinson

903
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:30,180
in Rat Race. Oh look at him, he even looks a little bit like Mr. Bean too. Now that I

904
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:36,020
think about it, you're completely right. As soon as he fell down, he put on a nightcap

905
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:43,180
too. I'm so mad about this. And what kind of noises is he making? He's going *snores*

906
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:53,380
Okay, so you get the needler, you get the will that says who made them, and it just, it says

907
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:54,380
a man.

908
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:58,900
You guys got owned.

909
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,380
But we still have the hard drive.

910
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,320
You did roll the persuasion check after he was technically dead, so I couldn't give you

911
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,320
too much.

912
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,320
Oh my god.

913
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:09,620
But, that was good.

914
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,860
But also, god damn, okay.

915
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,860
Well, I have a weapon now. I don't give a shit.

916
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,860
Yeah. And I'll give you the stats on what the Needler is too.

917
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,860
Okay.

918
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:19,860
Yeah. But, uh...

919
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:22,860
You see the broken bodies of the Iron Men before you.

920
01:00:22,860 --> 01:00:27,860
They seem to almost be phasing out of existence as they lie in a crumpled heap.

921
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:32,860
Instinctually, you all light a cigarette and say some variant of "God damn it."

922
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:40,860
You hear the familiar French sirens of the Jollibee Peter Thiel private police force pull up to the abandoned porno factory.

923
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,860
Due to all the commotion.

924
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:47,820
Flashing the traditional Jollibee colored lights of red and I think white and yellow.

925
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:51,420
I didn't look at the logo when I was writing this. As you gather yourselves,

926
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,100
you see a few Jollibees file in to inspect the scene.

927
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:00,580
And coming up in the rear is the familiar shape of Jollibee police captain Filipino Mr. Bean.

928
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,580
*laughter*

929
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:04,580
I can't believe you thought of Mr. Bean.

930
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:06,580
Holy crap! He looks exactly like Blotos but Filipino!

931
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,580
This is crazy!

932
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,580
Am I still asleep this whole time?

933
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:11,580
asleep this whole time?

934
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:12,580
Yeah, you're alive.

935
01:01:12,580 --> 01:01:13,580
Oh, I'm awake.

936
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,580
I wake up?

937
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:16,140
Yeah, as you're all finally in.

938
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:19,500
We definitely didn't say you looked like Mr. Bean while you were asleep.

939
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:22,060
I never said that, but I did say it just now.

940
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:28,860
I say, I just had the craziest dream where Ray William Johnson got married to a robot

941
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:34,720
and then the robot's head flew off and then you guys call me Filipino Mr. Bean.

942
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,820
But it's a good thing it was just a dream because...

943
01:01:36,820 --> 01:01:37,820
Yeah, thank God.

944
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:40,220
Yeah, no, we would have said you look like regular Mr. Bean.

945
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:43,020
I'm actually Filipino Mr. Bean.

946
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,280
(laughter)

947
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:50,020
You have an amazing ability to speak.

948
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:51,620
(laughter)

949
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,720
Cool.

950
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,820
Incredible.

951
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,120
Thank you.

952
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,220
And he just sort of tries to waddle up to you

953
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:01,520
and he's just knocking shit over and being clumsy.

954
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:02,720
He's like pointing to one jolly,

955
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,820
be like, "Put that in the bag for evidence."

956
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:08,220
And he knocks it over before the guy can put it in the bag.

957
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:14,460
he's like "grrrr" and he comes up to you and he says "I should have suspected the top

958
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:20,100
tens tattle agency would send their finest to a place like this"

959
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:22,900
"You kinda sound like emo Phillips"

960
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:29,340
I was looking up how he talks and there's only that one scene where he sells the painting

961
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:33,340
and it's sort of like that it's like "uhhh"

962
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:34,340
"No?"

963
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:37,500
"Can you guys wanna workshop this with me now?"

964
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,500
I think you're doing well.

965
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:41,500
I am Mr. Bean.

966
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,500
It's more like a...

967
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Mr. Bean.

968
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
I think it's a little something like...

969
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
Mr. Bean.

970
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,500
Hello, it's me, Mr. Bean.

971
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,500
Hello, it's me, Mr. Bean.

972

01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,500
It's me, Mr. Bean.

976
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:03,500
It's me, Mr. Bean.

977
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500

you had a dream don't tell him that don't tell him we know how to do that I

983
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:45,560
I see things haven't changed much since Lenny's retirement hmm same old antics

984
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:52,380
did he used to do this shit cuz I feel like we're being kind of weird he used

985
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,920
to do that but just with himself

986
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:00,480
Everyone knows Lenny had a few screws loose.

987
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,480
Let's put it that way.

988
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,480
That's news to us.

989
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,520
I would try to keep that under wraps I suppose.

990
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:10,920
Then he does the thing where he licks his lips.

991
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:11,920
Classic.

992
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,720
Classic Mr. Bean behavior.

993
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:20,600
This appears to be an illegal techno-slum lab.

994
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:21,600
If that's what you're implying.

995
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:22,600
It's not ours.

996
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:25,000
How do I know it's not yours?

997
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Because we're telling you. We're telling you!

998
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Okay, roll a persuasion check with advantage.

999
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It's very unlikely that it's yours. I got a 14.

1000
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Yeah. Yeah, he believes you. He sort of says, "Mmm, fine, but what are these two here? Who are these two?"

1001
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
No, it was terrible.

1002
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Oh, you're talking about those dead guys. I thought you were talking about me and Blotas.

1003
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:00,000
us

1004
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,880
that we got here hold on don't need to relax and he sort of lifts up one of

1005
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:12,720
their he's like hmm these are these sort of like he's like lifting it up and he

1006
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:16,000
he accidentally drops and he gets a little spooked and he makes his little

1007
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,080
mr. bean face about it and he says these are that face is crazy yeah I just start

1008
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:32,000
laughing handle this oh my god you are you see one of the Jollibee officers

1009
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:39,880
like this fucking shit again just like he says these are hmm V folks are not

1010
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:55,720
supposed to be able to hurt people what do you mean by that by that by that

1011
01:05:55,720 --> 01:06:02,520
dual-time noise that you yeah what what was that I didn't know they weren't

1012
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:08,600
supposed to be able to hurt people oh yes that's folks are meant to be able to

1013
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:15,800
to exist in each world, the virtual and ours, but they're not supposed to be harmful.

1014
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,920
These are, seem to be V Spartans.

1015
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:19,920
Puuuups!

1016
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:23,480
See, you did it again right there.

1017
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:24,480
You gotta stop.

1018
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,280
It surprised me again.

1019
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,280
Do you have something in your throat?

1020
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,560
No, I just, all this new information.

1021
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:35,800
I'm trying to be more excited about things because I just suffered a near death experience

1022
01:06:35,800 --> 01:06:38,600
and I'm trying to now live each day like it's my last.

1023
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:39,600
So I'm kinda...

1024
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:42,000
- Well, you get this further from Sullivan's voice.

1025
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Hmm, how do I...

1026
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,400
There are...

1027
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:48,800
It's got to be maybe a bit more British, like...

1028
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:49,600
- That's it.

1029
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:51,000
Good work, Mr. Bean.

1030
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,400
- Good work.

1031
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,200
Thank you.

1032
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:56,000
- Thank you for leaning more into British than Filipino.

1033
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,800
- Yeah.

1034
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,000
Oh, I wouldn't even dream of doing that.

1035
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:03,600
[laughter]

1036
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:04,400
So...

1037
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,600
- Hmm.

1038
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,800
And you just came upon them in this abandoned porno factory.

1039
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:15,600
Yeah, we smelled them from outside so we came in to see what was up.

1040
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:20,100
We were outside and we smelled some moldy digital data.

1041
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,100
Just roll deception to see if he believes you smelled them.

1042
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,100
Ten.

1043
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:29,100
Yeah, alright, he's sort of like, "Okay, maybe that's how he does it."

1044
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:32,100
You see this who knows?

1045
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:34,540
Yeah, he nods, he nods.

1046
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:38,540
Now, who are known for their sensitive senses?

1047
01:07:38,540 --> 01:07:40,540
[laughs]

1048
01:07:40,540 --> 01:07:43,340
Hmm, this is interesting.

1049
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:47,140
If I may ask, what were you boys doing here?

1050
01:07:47,140 --> 01:07:51,940
What does the Top 10's Tattletail Agency want with this?

1051
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:56,440
An abandoned techno-slime lab and two illegal V folks.

1052
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,940
And that's with an X, of course.

1053
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:03,140
Patrick Yoda over here wanted to see if there was any porno left in the abandoned porno factory.

1054
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:05,220
That- yeah, he's a real pig.

1055
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:10,100
I'm a little pig man and I'm disgusting.

1056
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,820
He- we can't stop him even if we try.

1057
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:16,260
Look, we were in the neighborhood, I smelled the porno from far away.

1058
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:19,700
He's been caught in the broom closet at work like five times.

1059
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:23,460
Oh, I- for this scenario, I'm an absolute pervert.

1060
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:27,140
Okay, just roll deception.

1061
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,140
Until we leave!

1062
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:31,140
I'll say it, Patrick is an absolute pervert.

1063
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,140
Nope! The Yoda!

1064
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,140
Patrick jacks off at work.

1065
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,140
Everybody roll deception.

1066
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,140
Oh god.

1067
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:41,140
Uh, let's see. Deception.

1068
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:43,140
I still have advantage.

1069
01:08:43,140 --> 01:08:45,140
Nice, yeah.

1070
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,140
Let me roll his insight.

1071
01:08:47,140 --> 01:08:49,140
He eyes you up and down

1072
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:51,140
with his Rowan Atkinson

1073
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:53,140
looking ass eyes.

1074
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:55,140
He nods and he looks over

1075
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:59,660
and he looks over to Patrick Yoda and he says "You should be chased."

1076
01:08:59,660 --> 01:09:06,140
"I should be what?" "Chased." "What are you saying?"

1077
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:09,140
"Alright, come on Ray William Johnson, let's chase him."

1078
01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:12,140
"Well, either way." "You better, you have the count of three. One,

1079
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,140
two, three, I'm getting you." "I'm not going anywhere."

1080
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:18,140
"Yeah, I tackle Patrick Yoda." "Fuck!"

1081
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:23,140
You tackle him, you just crash in front of a Jollibee detective that is just,

1082
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:27,540
just that is like taking notes just crashed right in front of him he's like

1083
01:09:27,540 --> 01:09:33,460
well and just sort of starts to back away yeah you better back away pal you don't

1084
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:37,460

1085
01:09:37,460 --> 01:09:43,780

1086
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:53,700

1087
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:59,140

1088
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:10,900
this is a cool laugh where'd you get that laughs out Yoda's laugh so he's

1089
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,500
The Filipino Mr. Pete is observing this.

1090
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,500
And he sort of looks to you all and he says,

1091
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,500
"Well, regardless of what you're doing here,

1092
01:10:18,500 --> 01:10:23,000
thanks for tracking down these V-Spartans.

1093
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,500
And looks like also some illegal,

1094
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,500
or at least prototype, TechnoSlime."

1095
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:33,500
And he sort of holds up the pens that shoot the lights.

1096
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:36,500
And he says, "I don't think these have been approved for production yet

1097
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:40,500
by Stakem's Federation of Bodies and Spaces."

1098
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:48,500
Wait wait wait wait wait a second those are that's gel pens those are my gel pens

01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:59,820

1103
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:13,220
I dropped those on the ground when I walked in because I was trying to drop a picture

1104
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:15,700
We're detectives, we need to write down our clues!

1105
01:11:15,700 --> 01:11:23,060
Hey, Mr. Bean, fellow Mr. Bean, look over there. There's a banana peel.

1106
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:24,060
What?

1107
01:11:24,060 --> 01:11:26,420
It's a slip on it.

1108
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:28,900
It's a banana peel. Somebody has to slip on that.

1109
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:30,500
Okay, I want to do a couple of things here.

1110
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,940
I want to do a persuasion check with disadvantage for Cameron,

1111
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:39,460
but then I want to do a persuasion check with advantage for for Caleb for

1112
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:54,060
interesting use of banana peel to so so first Cameron let's go 12 okay yeah he

1113
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:59,740
believes that they were yours and you should be more careful with them and he

1114
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:04,420
he hands you back one of them and then he says ooh a banana peel and he just

1115
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:10,700
wanders over. Okay and then I look I look to Patrick and blow toss and I'm just

1116
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:18,360
like run we get out of there before yeah before he gets wise. Yeah yeah he

1117
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:24,220
slips you guys book it out of there. He slips? Can you describe what is he slip on?

1118
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,220
The banana peel what are you talking about?

1119
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,220
Yeah what are you talking about?

1120
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:30,220
Oh yeah shit I guess it doesn't exist does it?

1121
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:32,220
Um yeah he slips though

1122
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:34,220
He uh walks up and he

1123
01:12:34,220 --> 01:12:36,220
upon not seeing a banana peel

1124
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,220
he grows like

1125
01:12:38,220 --> 01:12:40,220
freakishly angry

1126
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,220
and sort of just conjures up what he

1127
01:12:42,220 --> 01:12:44,220
thinks would be a banana peel

1128
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:46,220
in his minds eye and he

1129
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:48,220
slips on nothing

1130
01:12:48,220 --> 01:12:50,220
and you see his brain he starts twitching

1131
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:52,220
he's like delighted though

1132
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:58,700
he found a way to be Mr. Bean in this moment. Even with no banana pill. Yeah, he just-

1133
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:03,380
With no banana pill, despite no banana pill, he persisted. Yeah, that's right, that's exactly it.

1134
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:10,340
And he, the other Jollibee cops sort of just like look, look, look around and see

1135
01:13:10,340 --> 01:13:15,700
that you guys have gone and you're sort of booking it out of there. So at

1136
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:21,540
this point, you know, it's sort of nighttime. You guys can head back to your

1137
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:26,640
abodes wherever that is take a little nappy poo I'm sleeping outside yeah where

1138
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:33,420
do you guys go to sleep it's his bedtime huh so oh yeah unless you want to keep

1139
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:37,860
exploring no it's sleepy time but you guys would probably be better off doing

1140
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:41,380
that so you can recharge your health and so what I'm gonna do yeah I got a

1141
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:47,300
recharge my freaking house so my mommy in the morning my hoverboard I can lay

1142
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:52,220
down on my hoverboard and then when I lay down on it a little like case goes

1143
01:13:52,220 --> 01:13:55,960
around it like a security case right that has a bunch of guns on that has a

1144
01:13:55,960 --> 01:14:01,840
minigun on the side just in case anyone tries to break in where do you lay down

I don't care if they believe me.

1181
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,640
What are they gonna do?

1182
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:23,640
They're gonna stay in the room.

1183
01:16:23,640 --> 01:16:26,640
Well, okay, are you trying to deceive them?

1184
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:27,640
Yes.

1185
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,640
Yeah, I guess I am.

1186
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,640
Okay, if you're not, you don't have to.

1187
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,640
If you're just saying shit, you don't have to.

1188
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,640
Yeah, they're stupid as shit.

1189
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:40,640
They're just like, yeah, okay dad, and they just like go up to their room and start, and

1190
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:47,140
they put on their, you know, their VR headsets and shove their PSPs inside their chest and

1191
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:52,620
they're hooked into some amazing new kind of Sims dude they're playing

1192
01:16:52,620 --> 01:17:01,480
battlefield 7,000 while you do taxes yes I'm with Cameron I'm basically fucking

1193
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:10,260
her big ass this is not okay I love giving you back shots I'm gonna leave

1194
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:27,960
about the name my favorite part - okay so and then I finally I finally busted my

1195
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:32,660
wife and I say I hope that I hope we make a third kid and then I fall asleep

1196
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:39,620
okay and my California King bed she's so I'm rich she sort of looks looks up and

1197
01:17:39,620 --> 01:17:41,380
and she says, "God, I hope we don't."

1198
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:45,100
And we cut to Cameron, what are you doing

1199
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,420
when you go to bed, where do you go?

1200
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:50,060
- So I assume there's some kind of public park somewhere

1201
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:52,860
in Gun City, yeah.

1202
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:56,940
So in whatever the equivalent of Central Park is,

1203
01:17:56,940 --> 01:17:58,660
I have a big tent set up.

1204
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:03,460
- That would be, yeah, that would be the, let me see.

1205
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,060
That would be the, okay, cool.

1206
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:07,420
Just looking at shit on my desk.

1207
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:08,860
- Chemtrail Park.

1208
01:18:08,860 --> 01:18:11,780
- Yeah, the Chemtrail Ticonderoga Park.

1209
01:18:11,780 --> 01:18:16,940
So I got a big tent and I go inside the tent.

1210
01:18:16,940 --> 01:18:18,420
- Chemtrail Park, I like, yeah.

1211
01:18:18,420 --> 01:18:23,420
- Taking up the entire tent is a snow globe of Whoville,

1212
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:28,420
my home that I emigrated from and I miss very dearly.

1213
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,180
And there's a little door on the side of the snow globe

1214
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,260
and I go inside the snow globe.

1215
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:33,820
And then inside the snow globe,

1216
01:18:33,820 --> 01:18:35,900
there's another smaller tent.

1217
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:38,780
And I go in there and I go to sleep.

1218
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:44,380
and I have Christmas dreams like from that one Christmas poem of the fairies and stuff.

1219
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,380
That's really nice.

1220
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,780
Because at the end of the day I'm still a Christmas based character even though I don't talk about

1221
01:18:48,780 --> 01:18:51,380
Christmas at all or mention bridges or anything.

1222
01:18:51,380 --> 01:18:52,380
That's still kind of my theme.

1223
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:53,380
Yeah that's cool.

1224
01:18:53,380 --> 01:18:55,180
I basically came in one of the wives' pussies.

1225
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:58,060
Yeah and then I go to Caleb's house, then I go to Ray William Johnson's house and I

1226
01:18:58,060 --> 01:18:59,060
kill his wife.

1227
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,060
I kill him and I kill his kids.

1228
01:19:00,060 --> 01:19:01,060
Please take it back.

1229
01:19:01,060 --> 01:19:02,060
Please take it back.

1230
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,060
And then I suck his dick.

1231
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:06,060
And then you suck my penis because you're my wife!

1232
01:19:06,060 --> 01:19:07,060
Yeah but you're dead so.

1233
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:08,060
Nah.

1234
01:19:08,060 --> 01:19:09,060
I was really mad.

1235
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:13,180
I go back to my tent and I go back inside my snow globe and I go back inside the tent and

1236
01:19:13,180 --> 01:19:16,340
then I go to sleep and I have a really good sleep.

1237
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:20,900
And it was all a dream but then I wake up and I go to Raylan Johnson's house and I kill

1238
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,380
him and I kill his wife and I kill his kids and I go back.

1239
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:26,820
I don't suck his dick this time and then I go back to the tent and I go to the snow globe

1240
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:28,700
and I go into the tent and then I go to sleep.

1241
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,900
And that wasn't a dream and Caleb's character is actually dead.

1242
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:32,220
No, I'm not.

1243
01:19:32,220 --> 01:19:35,580
Where does Sullivan sleep?

1244
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:38,020
Let's hear Sullivan's story.

1245
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:45,620
Sullivan been doing this whole time this is wife is named Cameron he's been

1246
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:53,680
sitting in the car quietly praying hoping you guys are okay because he loves you

1247
01:19:53,680 --> 01:20:00,900
and he's and he just sort of falls asleep in the car and I'm sorry I'm

1248
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:05,540
taking notes on these little elements of your characters yeah right down the

1249
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:07,540
Caleb has zero HP and he's dead.

1250
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:11,540
No matter how throw away they may seem, I believe in them.

1251
01:20:11,540 --> 01:20:14,540
So yeah, it's the, uh, it's the...

1252
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:17,540
You guys all go to sleep in your respective locations,

1253
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,540
nutting in your respective spouses.

1254
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:20,540
Yeah.

1255
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:22,540
Wait, what's my spouse's name?

1256
01:20:22,540 --> 01:20:24,540
Uh, it's Cameron.

1257

Yeah, that's what I thought.

1258
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:29,540
Yeah. And you wake up the next morning

1259
01:20:29,540 --> 01:20:32,540

1260
01:20:32,540 --> 01:20:33,540
You're in a snow globe, right?

As long as it's anything but digital biltong, I'm fine.

01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:14,740
Okay, well, it's definitely not that, then.

1291

1310
01:23:05,220 --> 01:23:10,460

1362
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:44,300
I need to exchange this.

1363
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,300
Why do you...

1364
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:47,140
Oh, are you saying you don't like it?

1365
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:50,580
Well, I'd rather have some beef jerky right now.

1366
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,580
I...

1367
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:52,580
All right.

1368
01:26:52,580 --> 01:26:54,060
I'm very hungry.

1369
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:55,060
You don't like the flavor?

1370
01:26:55,060 --> 01:26:56,060
I'm very hungry.

1371
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,060
No, I just...

1372
01:26:57,060 --> 01:26:58,060
You don't like the cheesy, the cheesy, gooey flavor?

1373
01:26:58,060 --> 01:26:59,060
He picked me up first.

1374
01:26:59,060 --> 01:27:00,060
I had to skip breakfast.

1375
01:27:00,060 --> 01:27:03,500
Yeah, it tastes like fried salami.

1376
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,140
I had to skip breakfast.

1377
01:27:05,140 --> 01:27:06,460
So, yeah.

1378
01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:07,460
Okay.

1379
01:27:07,460 --> 01:27:10,700
Sorry, I'm looking at my notes.

1380
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:11,860
I will commend you, though.

1381
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:12,860
This tastes exactly like Cubano.

1382
01:27:12,860 --> 01:27:17,620
down that Caleb's character's wife's pussy tastes like cheese is that what

1383
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:22,060
you're writing down in the notes? No it tastes like tastes like mungu. It tastes like

1384
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:29,260
porcini mushrooms. So yeah you guys are arguing about what pussy tastes like.

1385
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:33,980
No you don't understand it tastes like the back of your hand. See Nick, the back of your

1386
01:27:33,980 --> 01:27:38,580
And you drive up to uh to Mommy Good Legs so

1387
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:46,780
You get back through the Lockheed Martin shopping district down sepia alley to Mommy Good Legs Club

1388
01:27:46,780 --> 01:27:54,700
The feet on the end of the legs are now fuzzy morning slippers instead of red stilettos and the door slash pussy is now closed

1389
01:27:54,700 --> 01:28:01,860
But you can walk in and when you do you same this you see the same seedy nightclub as before

1390
01:28:02,300 --> 01:28:08,600
Except the lights are turned all the way up and the V folks are in but most of them are relaxing or getting ready for the

1391
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,560
Opening shift in the early evening

1392
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,720
Some are serving breakfast to the more senior staffers like mommy herself

1393
01:28:14,720 --> 01:28:18,360
Mommy sits at a private booth at the far corner of the clubs

1394
01:28:18,360 --> 01:28:23,560
Sipping on a morning mimosa and reading the Epoch Times the only news organization left

1395
01:28:23,560 --> 01:28:28,520
Welcome boys, please have a seat

1396
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:35,760
She calls over I now that I could see this place in full light. There are stains everywhere ma'am

1397
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,540
I just got to tell you that

1398
01:28:37,540 --> 01:28:39,700
yeah, we do our best to clean it up, but uh

1399
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,840
Boys will I can't tell what's blood and come a

1400
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:49,420
Lot of it is yeah, the solid mix between that stag party is still here. Did you guys even try?

1401
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:53,260
Yeah, I can smell it. It's been a couple hours

1402
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:58,400
and I think that you guys didn't even you guys didn't even unhandcuffed Jamal and

1403
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:03,100
you didn't clean the shit off of his head it seems like nothing has changed except

1404
01:29:03,100 --> 01:29:10,120
the lights well generally we sort of hope that it sort of works itself out that's

1405
01:29:10,120 --> 01:29:16,800
sort of Jamal isn't moving is he dead probably hasn't had water or something

1406
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,360
to eat in quite a while I mean you wanna he could have just eaten the shit off of

1407
01:29:21,360 --> 01:29:25,840
Yeah, you could investigate Jamal and see if he's alive or dead.

1408
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:27,340
Let's see.

1409
01:29:27,340 --> 01:29:29,340
I poked Jamal with a slipchip.

1410
01:29:29,340 --> 01:29:31,340
Wait, do I still have advantage on stuff?

1411
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,340
No, it's the next morning.

1412
01:29:32,340 --> 01:29:34,340
Oh, which reminds me.

1413
01:29:34,340 --> 01:29:36,340
Let me not do that.

1414
01:29:36,340 --> 01:29:38,340
Oh no!

1415
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:43,340
Yeah, you have, with your, with the next morning by the way, I should say, I forgot to even mention this.

1416
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:47,340
Yeah, Caleb, after drinking the raw Techno Slime,

1417
01:29:47,340 --> 01:29:49,920
Just fucking the shit out of your wife.

1418
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,720
Just fucking the absolute life out of my fucking dumb wife.

1419
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,720
Murdering your wife and your dick.

1420
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:59,340
Yeah, but you wake up the next morning and your head is throbbing.

1421
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:03,340
And everybody looks almost like, they look like they're made of colored pencil.

1422
01:30:03,340 --> 01:30:07,340
Like everything's so indistinct and it's just like a mess.

1423
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:14,340
So you're going to have a disadvantage on dexterity, any sort of dexterity based ability check.

1424
01:30:14,340 --> 01:30:17,340
or saving throw for the day.

1425
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:19,340
Because your head's just throbbing.

1426
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:20,340
Yeah.

1427
01:30:20,340 --> 01:30:22,340
I got hired in a motherfucker.

1428
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,340
And we get to recharge our HP and shit, right?

1429
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:26,340
Yeah, all your HP is fully--

1430
01:30:26,340 --> 01:30:28,340
That's technically a long rest, so everything is fully--

1431
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,340
Full HP,

1432
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:33,340
full Techno Slime recharge,

1433
01:30:33,340 --> 01:30:35,340
as well.

1434
01:30:35,340 --> 01:30:37,340
And...

1435
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,340
Yes.

1436
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,340
So, yeah.

1437
01:30:40,340 --> 01:30:42,340
What do you do? Investigate. Okay, yeah.

1438
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,980
Yeah, Jamal's alive, he's just like...

1439
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:47,980
He doesn't breathe when he sleeps.

1440
01:30:47,980 --> 01:30:48,980
[laughter]

1441
01:30:48,980 --> 01:30:50,980
Just that, obviously.

1442
01:30:50,980 --> 01:30:51,780
'Cause he's a worm.

1443
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:53,100
'Cause he's a worm, yeah.

1444
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:57,140
Yeah, and you can obviously try to wake him up, too.

1445
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:59,140
Okay. I kick him in the head.

1446
01:30:59,140 --> 01:30:59,780
Yeah.

1447
01:30:59,780 --> 01:31:01,100
It's like, "Gah! Blugh!"

1448
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:05,260
And he's sort of like, the shit falls off his head and lands in his mouth.

1449
01:31:05,260 --> 01:31:06,980
[laughter]

1450
01:31:06,980 --> 01:31:08,740
"Ha ha, you ate a boob."

1451
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:09,540
"Eat a..."

1452
01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:11,540
He's trying to say, "No, I didn't."

1453
01:31:11,540 --> 01:31:14,460
- It's in your mouth right now, I can see it.

1454
01:31:14,460 --> 01:31:16,060
Breakfast is served, Jamal.

1455
01:31:16,060 --> 01:31:18,900
- Oh look, he thought it was a Twix bar.

1456
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:19,740
- No.

1457
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:22,980
- You ate a poop like a Hershey Kiss.

1458
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:24,540
- You ate a Hershey's poop.

1459
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:25,900
- No, I didn't, no.

1460
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,860
- This is Ray William Johnson's poop.

1461
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:31,460
- Why'd you, okay, so you still ate poop though.

1462
01:31:31,460 --> 01:31:34,420
- You still admit it, he still admits it, oh my God.

1463
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:36,180
- You spit it out right then, what was that about?

1464
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:38,620
- I did, I spit, because it's poop

1465
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:39,780
and I don't want it in my mouth.

1466
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:40,620
- But it was in your mouth.

1467
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:42,620
So you admit that you had poop in your mouth?

1468
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:44,620
So why'd you put it in your mouth in the first place?

1469
01:31:44,620 --> 01:31:46,620
I didn't put it in my mouth, somebody kicked me in the head.

1470
01:31:46,620 --> 01:31:48,620
Hey man, listen, between you and me...

1471
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:50,620
What's up?

1472
01:31:50,620 --> 01:31:52,620
It's fine, right? It kind of tasted normal.

1473
01:31:52,620 --> 01:31:54,620
I heard that! I have very strong ears!

1474
01:31:54,620 --> 01:31:56,620
No, poop is so disgusting to me!

1475
01:31:56,620 --> 01:31:58,620
I heard what you said!

1476
01:31:58,620 --> 01:32:00,620
Poop is seriously so bad!

1477
01:32:00,620 --> 01:32:02,620
I heard what you said! I have the greatest hearing in the world!

1478
01:32:02,620 --> 01:32:04,620
Listen to me, Jamal.

1479
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,620
That's canon in the game!

1480
01:32:06,620 --> 01:32:08,620
If you liked that taste, you can always call me.

1481
01:32:08,620 --> 01:32:14,020

1482
01:32:14,020 --> 01:32:21,100

1483
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:25,260
Well this is all going. Mommy called you over and you guys instead. Yeah well

1484
01:32:25,260 --> 01:32:29,740

01:32:29,740 --> 01:32:32,900

1490
01:33:00,660 --> 01:33:06,620
off her face. Can you get your other two friends over here? They seem to be

1491
01:33:06,620 --> 01:33:11,060
berating and savagely beating my bartender. Oh no it's cool they're just

1492
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:17,260
they're just playing around with him. Okay. They'll be fine. I do I do want to

1493
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:21,260
I do want to speak with them. No let's just let this play out let's see what

1494
01:33:21,260 --> 01:33:27,660
happens. Sure yeah yeah so you guys continue your shit argument. And then five

1495
01:33:27,660 --> 01:33:29,020
Five hours later.

1496
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,860
Five hours later, it's the next,

1497
01:33:30,860 --> 01:33:32,860
20 hours later, it's the next day.

1498
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:37,580
So you guys go over, you sit down with mommy good legs.

1499
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:41,380
What do you think poop tastes like?

1500
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:42,780
You know what it tastes like!

1501
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,260
Is it good or bad to you?

1502
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:46,460
You said that it's good, you said that it's good,

1503
01:33:46,460 --> 01:33:47,300
I heard you say it.

1504
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:49,620
You're talking about this as you're walking over.

1505
01:33:49,620 --> 01:33:53,280
I heard you say it, you said it was good.

1506
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:56,540
I hate poop.

1507
01:33:56,540 --> 01:33:59,020
You like it! I heard you say you like it!

1508
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:03,260
If you don't like poop, then be not a Yoda.

1509
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:08,860
Okay, I'm looking around the room, I see...

1510
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:12,220
Oh, Patrick, it seems like you're a Yoda, so you like to eat poop, yes?

1511
01:34:12,220 --> 01:34:14,220
It does not work that way!

1512
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:16,860
I just said it works that way, and I think it does.

1513
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:18,860
It doesn't work that way.

1514
01:34:18,860 --> 01:34:19,740
It does work that way.

1515
01:34:19,740 --> 01:34:21,740
I start tickling Patrick again.

1516
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:23,740
Rope persuasion.

1517
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:25,740
Alright, let's see.

1518
01:34:25,740 --> 01:34:26,740
Let's see.

1519
01:34:26,740 --> 01:34:27,740
Yeah, do it.

1520
01:34:27,740 --> 01:34:28,740
With disadvantage because he's hungover.

1521
01:34:28,740 --> 01:34:31,260
Yeah, why am I fucking here?

1522
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:32,900
Do it.

1523
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:33,900
10.

1524
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,900
All right.

1525
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:44,060
Yeah, I guess this would really be, I guess Patrick Yoda, what you would do is roll, I

1526
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:48,740
guess roll a wisdom check against it, I guess.

1527
01:34:48,740 --> 01:34:50,740
It's really insight or something.

1528
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:52,740
Yeah, 22.

1529
01:34:52,740 --> 01:35:00,740
yeah so I guess Caleb you didn't persuade him. I don't really remember what that was for.

1530
01:35:00,740 --> 01:35:08,980
sorry I'm hungover. Disregard. No you said you made your bed you better lie in it

1531
01:35:08,980 --> 01:35:14,620
yeah you wish I would lie in it. Listen I'm gonna listen I'm gonna lie in both

1532
01:35:14,620 --> 01:35:18,940
of your beds if you don't shut up right now. Yeah you would like to lie in my bed

1533
01:35:18,940 --> 01:35:22,220
And then you would love to lie in it. I'm gonna lie in your bed

1534
01:35:22,220 --> 01:35:26,300
With you no yeah, you would like that, huh?

1535
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:29,800
Mommy hey mommy good legs. What's the deal?

1536
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:34,860
Yeah, yeah, she sort of was just like doing something else

1537
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:40,180
And yeah, she sort of sees you guys come over. She says well boys. It's good to see you

1538
01:35:40,180 --> 01:35:42,780
When any of y'all care for some breakfast?

1539
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:50,380
No, yes. Yeah. No. No, actually Patrick Yoda just told me he wants a poop for breakfast. I don't want poop for breakfast

1540
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:54,500
Yeah, why'd you tell me that then I didn't say it you did. He said it all confidence

1541
01:35:54,500 --> 01:35:57,220
I could get you poop if you need oh you could

1542
01:35:57,220 --> 01:36:04,300
I'm sure you'd like that. Yeah, you would know you would

1543
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:12,440
You would I'm looking at your Wikipedia page right now. Hey William Johnson. I want you to try to to try to

1544
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:19,960
to try to roll a stealth check to see if you could secretly order poop without

1545
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:26,280
anybody noticing and Patrick you had a roll roll in a a person I didn't check

1546
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:31,640
the sea and I roll a perception check - yeah try to see if you can hear well ah

1547
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:38,000
damn your perception so good I got a 20 dude I got him what do you say what do

1548
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:41,880
you say Ray William Johnson's you're secretly trying to order shit yeah can I

1549
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:53,280
please haven't wanted have a serious poop for my friend here no it's not true I

1550
01:36:53,280 --> 01:37:00,520
turned I turned to Ray William Johnson I say your secrets safe with me thank you

1551
01:37:00,520 --> 01:37:04,760
friend and then I turned and then I turned to mommy good legs and Patrick

1552
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:16,240
Yoda I say this MF eating poop lol I'm not talking you're so stupid you're so

1553
01:37:16,240 --> 01:37:22,320
stupid I I pick up Patrick Yoda and I throw him across the room and then I

1554
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:25,920
turn to mommy good looks and I say okay what's the deal mommy good legs I'll

1555
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:33,720
just get us all some pancakes that you know it's not poop it's fine you know

1556
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:39,320
He's being coy. Do you know why when each of you look at me you only see what is

1557
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:48,120
most beautiful to you? Because you're cool and beautiful? It's because of those

1558
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:58,080
cocky-less riffs you have installed. What? I have something installed? Yeah yeah so

1559
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:02,600
you all have cocky-less riffs installed. Everyone when they turn 13 in gun city

1560
01:38:02,600 --> 01:38:05,600
gets a coculus rift installed into their penis.

1561
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,600
So that is canon.

1562
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:11,600
In this arc at least.

1563
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,600
They allow me to change what can be seen.

1564
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:17,600
How each individual sees me.

1565
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:20,600
Using virtual reality superimposed on my form.

1566
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:23,600
Now, I'm quite the looker myself,

1567
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,600
but if I can make everyone see exactly what they want,

1568
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:29,600
well, that's where the money is.

1569
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:32,040
However I can only be mommy.

1570
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:39,040
She sort of smokes a cigarette and ashes it out on a pile of poop as it's served.

1571
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:41,320
That's the strength of V-Girls like Haseki Tsune.

1572
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:46,760
They can be whatever you want them to be, because they ain't even real to begin with.

1573
01:38:46,760 --> 01:38:49,400
And sometimes I think that's what happened to Sean.

1574
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,120
He got lost in a world that promised him infinite possibility.

1575
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:58,800
He got a small taste with that whore wife of his and from there got hooked on the stuff.

1576
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:03,040
Into Matrix 2 you can do whatever you want, be whatever you want.

1577
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,920
I think that might be where Shawn is.

1578
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:07,200
Come with me boys.

1579
01:39:07,200 --> 01:39:12,480
And she sort of gets up from her booth and starts leading you back towards the dressing

1580
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:16,140
room where you guys first went in to see her.

1581
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:18,880
I think she's gonna have sex with us.

1582
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:23,600
Okay, this is seriously awesome.

1583
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:24,600
I'm not ready.

1584
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,400
Oh, is it your first time?

1585
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:28,400
Yeah.

1586
01:39:28,400 --> 01:39:32,400
Wow. I'm 899 years old and it's my first time.

1587
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:35,400
Here, let me show you how.

1588
01:39:35,400 --> 01:39:36,400
Yeah, yeah.

1589
01:39:36,400 --> 01:39:46,400
So yeah, the three of us start having sex.

1590
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,400
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1591
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,400
We can end it there, if you want to.

1592
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,400
Four.

1593
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,400
Yeah, fuck it

1594
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:10,640
It's like it's like yeah eat you mama tambien style though. Yeah, right

1595
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:14,920
Yeah, like Cameron is just kind of like we first all three of us start having sex together

1596
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:20,000
But then Cameron slowly is kind of pushed out and then it's just me and Patrick fucking

1597
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,440
And I'm recording. I'm recording it the whole time. Yeah, turn that off

1598
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:30,680
Yeah, that's called revenge porn and it recently got banned from born up

1599
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:33,600
Yeah, I'm sure it did

1600
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,200
Yeah, I'm sure it's gone

1601
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:38,080
I

1602
01:40:38,080 --> 01:40:40,760
Guess you guys have like a e2 mama

1603
01:40:40,760 --> 01:40:46,120
Whatever kind of sex time excuse me what kind of moment me to mama?

1604
01:40:46,120 --> 01:40:50,260
Was that movie you say me to moment me to moment?

1605
01:40:55,160 --> 01:40:57,160
Eetu Mamatambiyan, yeah.

1606
01:40:57,160 --> 01:40:59,160
Alright, let's just clarify that.

1607
01:40:59,160 --> 01:41:01,160
Yeah.

1608
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:05,160
And, uh, yeah, you guys have that, I guess, in the middle of the club.

1609
01:41:05,160 --> 01:41:07,160
And then you move on.

1610
01:41:07,160 --> 01:41:09,160
I'm just gonna put into my inventory

1611
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:13,160
really quick video of Patrick and Caleb having sex.

1612
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:15,160
I'm just gonna type that in.

1613
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:17,160
That's in my inventory, canon.

1614
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,160
Mm-hmm.

1615
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,160
Oh, speaking of inventory, do I still have the...

1616
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,160
You have the needler, and I'll give you that.

1617
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:26,720
needler and I'll give you the needler no I have the needler but from the previous

1618
01:41:26,720 --> 01:41:35,000
game the I made a backup of the the whatever the oh that's that's actually a

1619
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,200
good question so let's figure that out next let's figure that out after we

1620
01:41:38,200 --> 01:41:42,240
finish recording yeah we'll talk yeah we'll talk about that because I think

1621
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:50,360
that's gonna open up some other talks in a good way yeah so um yeah so uh yeah you

1622
01:41:50,360 --> 01:41:56,520
You guys go and you follow mommy into the back into the sort of back green room area or whatever and

1623
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:59,800
you see she sort of walked all the way down to the end of the hallway and

1624
01:41:59,800 --> 01:42:05,600
It's a it looks like sort of a just a blank, you know gray wall

1625
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:11,400
but she presses, you know a tile in it and it's sort of a unfurls and

1626
01:42:11,400 --> 01:42:19,720
There's a door and now it's sort of a staircase a spiral staircase and she walks you down the spiral staircase

1627
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:27,100
and I trip you trip okay I trip and I fall the entire way down yeah you fall

1628
01:42:27,100 --> 01:42:34,180
the entire way down yeah just everyone you're like oh just all the way down

1629
01:42:34,180 --> 01:42:39,160
yeah and while and while and while you're uh you're falling she's talking

1630
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:45,800
she's talking okay yeah I'm falling at the exact pace

1631
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:53,200
You're like, "Ow, ooh, ow," while she's saying, "Doing business in Gun City isn't easy.

1632
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:57,920
Maintaining your enterprise means being ruthless, calculating, and jacked in.

1633
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:01,720
The problem with being jacked in is that's hard to do.

1634
01:43:01,720 --> 01:43:06,760
There are only a few working portals into the Dev Matrix 2, and they're only accessible

1635
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:08,920
if you have the money to spend."

1636
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:13,500
And yes, she's telling this to you guys Sorkin-style, walk and talk.

1637
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:16,100
You get to the bottom of the spiral staircase.

1638
01:43:16,100 --> 01:43:16,600
Ow.

1639
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:27,100
And you see a circular room with like electrical paneling and a control center and like lights and lasers are shooting around the room calculating things.

1640
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:33,900
In the middle you see a raised platform and it has three awesome race car beds in it.

1641
01:43:33,900 --> 01:43:35,200
Whoa.

1642
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:36,900
Okay.

1643
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:42,060
She looks to the race car beds and she says, "This is how Sean would get into

1644
01:43:42,060 --> 01:43:46,340
D-Matrix 2 when he was frequenting my club. This bunker is essential to my

1645
01:43:46,340 --> 01:43:49,820
business. It's where I recruit V-Folks, and that's what the next of course, and

1646
01:43:49,820 --> 01:43:54,900
snuff out the virtual competition. It's also how I expand and monitor the rest

1647
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:59,100
of the virtual world. Sean would come in here and make race car noises until he

1648
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:05,500
came. Then he'd go into D-Matrix 2. However, these things," and she slaps one of

1649
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,860
on the race car beds.

1650
01:44:06,860 --> 01:44:09,540
They haven't worked in the last couple of months.

1651
01:44:09,540 --> 01:44:10,380
- So why not?

1652
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:12,220
Sorry.

1653
01:44:12,220 --> 01:44:13,040
(laughing)

1654
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:13,880
- No, that's fair.

1655
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,500
That's a good question.

1656
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:17,380
I don't know actually.

1657
01:44:17,380 --> 01:44:18,660
They've either ran out of power,

1658
01:44:18,660 --> 01:44:19,500
they're missing a piece,

1659
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:22,380
or sometimes I think sabotage.

1660
01:44:22,380 --> 01:44:25,540
But to get the-- - Did you sabotage it?

1661
01:44:25,540 --> 01:44:27,340
- No, so that, no.

1662
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:28,940
- Oh, okay.

1663
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:30,460
Okay, I believe you.

1664
01:44:30,460 --> 01:44:32,380
We just have to check on everything, you know,

1665
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:33,860
like we're detectives, so.

1666
01:44:33,860 --> 01:44:34,700
- Exactly.

1667
01:44:34,700 --> 01:44:35,700
I'm just doing my job.

1668
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:37,900
If we didn't ask, it would just, it would look bad.

1669
01:44:37,900 --> 01:44:38,900
Right, no.

1670
01:44:38,900 --> 01:44:40,380
And that leads to my next question.

1671
01:44:40,380 --> 01:44:45,380
Do you know, like, the answer to the whole mystery?

1672
01:44:45,380 --> 01:44:47,060
She doesn't, believe it or not.

1673
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:49,540
Okay, well, you know, we just have to ask.

1674
01:44:49,540 --> 01:44:52,020
Yeah, it's just like, it's policy, you know.

1675
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:55,060
What kind of detective would I be if I didn't ask?

1676
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:58,980
Like any good noir, everybody only has bits and pieces of what's going on.

1677
01:44:58,980 --> 01:44:59,980
True.

1678
01:44:59,980 --> 01:45:19,980
I

1679
01:45:19,980 --> 01:45:20,980
my taste.

1680
01:45:20,980 --> 01:45:27,300
There is something else we need to do before we even risk trying to find another way in,

1681
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:29,620
or find a way to even repair these things.

1682
01:45:29,620 --> 01:45:37,260
We need to know if Sean got lost in Da Matrix 2, if that's where he even is, if he's alive,

1683
01:45:37,260 --> 01:45:41,360
and the only way to find that out is to look through the Jacked In Archives and Records

1684
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:47,160
offices in the United Health Group incorporated in Marlboro District.

1685
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:51,440
Those records are publicly available, but only to those who can privately afford it, and

1686
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:54,520
it costs about 10 million tokens to view.

1687
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:55,860
WHAAAAAT?

1688
01:45:55,860 --> 01:46:01,040
So you can either break into the records, or get an insane amount of money very quickly.

1689
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:04,960
I personally don't want to know which one you choose to do, but once you get it done

1690
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:08,000
you can meet back here and figure out a way in.

1691
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:12,920
I sent your frog scouting earlier this morning to draw up some plans to help with the heist,

1692
01:46:12,920 --> 01:46:15,600
should you choose to do so.
