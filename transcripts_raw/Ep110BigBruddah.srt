00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,620
- Podcasts for the hopeless.

3
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,200
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,060
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,360
(laughing)

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,320
- I look smooth.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,160
- Yeah, we--

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,200
- Yeah, Caleb looks very smooth today.

9
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,480
- For about like five or 10 minutes just now,

10
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:21,640
we just thought that Caleb had accidentally turned on

11
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,560
the smoothing, the face smoothing option on Zoom,

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,280
but then we just found out he didn't

13
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,120
and his face just looks like that now.

14
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,800
- Nah, I'm just naturally smooth, man.

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,100
I just have naturally smooth skin dude.

16
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,240
I'm blessed by the Cherokee gods.

17
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,240
Yeah.

18
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,240
Yeah.

19
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,240
Big Panther, Small Bird.

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,480
More like freaking raw chicken if you ask me.

21
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:43,480
Yeah, you'd look like a raw chicken.

22
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,880
You'd be called Chief Raw Chicken like my cat.

23
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
Nobody would call me...

24
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:47,880
You'd be called Chief Mayo.

25
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
No, no.

26
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:49,880
When I return...

27
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,880
Chief Mayo, man!

28
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,720
No, nobody would call me...

29
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,160
But thank you for assuming I would be the chief, by the way.

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
But no, I would not be the chief.

31
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,160
You would not.

32
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:06,860

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,480

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,040
Indian dude yeah I think I'm saying Indian not Native American so I don't

00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,080
I can't tell.

43
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,080
Yeah, I think you do.

44
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,760
You think I'm, you think I'm, you think I'm, is that Southwest Asian?

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Southeast.

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
Southeast Asian?

47
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
You think I'm Southeast Asian?

48
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,760
Yeah.

49
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
No, Southeast Asian is Japan.

50
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,400
No, it's not.

51
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Yeah.

52
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,760
Think about the directions, Pat.

53
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,760
Depends on where you're looking.

54
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,080
Depends on, so if you're looking, if you are looking at the globe upside down, then yeah,

55
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,080
you might be right, actually.

56
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,120
You might be, you could be right there.

57
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,640
I guess that is Southeast Asian.

58
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,040
No, that would be Northeast Asia. Southeast Asia would be like, would be Europe.

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,520
Yeah. Whoa. Whoa. That's deep. If you change the perspective of the globe...

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,880
You might change your perspective. Yeah, you might change your perspective. Think about

61
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,680
this for a second. If you spin the globe 360 degrees, you end up in the same spot.

62
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,640
Think about it. If you flatten out the globe, we're all Asian. Yeah. Every single person in the world.

63
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,040
If you take a big sharpie and you write the word Asia across the entire surface of the globe

64
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,360
Then everybody becomes Asian dude. We just solved every problem that there is.

65
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:01,280
Yeah, that's the root of the problems is not enough people are Asian.

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,600
If everybody became Asian, we're getting there dude. We'll get there.

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,040
It's just slowly but surely.

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,520
It's like that we're all one race, the human race, but it's like we're all one race, Asian.

69
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,720
We're all one race. We're all Chinese when you think about it.

70
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,560
if you think really closely and you close your eyes if you if you write China on

71
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,320
the globe then we're all Chinese yeah damn it's not it's not earth anymore

72
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,720
it's China whoa the globe the globe more often than not would say made in China

73
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,080
so that whoa so if you just hold it in dude yeah yeah I think we just

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:41,720
discovered the Illuminati truth of the world I know yeah the whole world is

75
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,800
China. It's that astronaut meme, but it's just the, uh, it's China.

76
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
Let's do some other memes real quick.

77
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,480
Yeah, let's do some other memes.

78
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,440

79
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,680

so I woke up and I was

143
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,900
acting, I woke up like a millisecond

144
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,900
before I fell off of my bed

145
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900

148
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,900
And I fell

149
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900

151
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:35,140
Jana woke up and went oh my god and I was on the ground and with morning wood I

152
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:42,460
had a giant boner coming out of the back of my head and it almost happened again

153
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,980
like 30 minutes later I like went back to sleep and then woke up and I was

154
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,980
falling off the bed again.

155
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,980
Why do you keep falling off the bed?

156
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,980
Dude, I have no idea.

157
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,980
What are you dreaming about?

158
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,980
I dreamt that I had a kid.

159
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,980
(laughter)

160
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,980
I dreamt that I had a newborn child

161
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,980
and I fell off the bed

162
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,980
and I woke up and I had metal in my head.

163
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,980
There's still a piece of my head

164
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,980
is stuck to the metal on my bed

165
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,980
and I...

166
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,980
it's like fused to it. Like I can't even get it off

167
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
my fingernail. Oh my god.

168
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,180
It's really bad too.

169
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,020
- That's awesome.

170
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,680
- Wait, it's on your fingernail now?

171
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,140
- No, I couldn't, I tried to scrape off,

172
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,640
there's like a piece of my flesh

173
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,480
with like two pieces of hair in it.

174
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,820
(laughing)

175
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,500
And I wanna put it back on my head.

176
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,460
- Well dude, if it's got hair in it,

177
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,940
that's not your flesh, that's someone else's.

178
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,860
- Wait, no, Caleb, you could take that hair

179
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,740
and you could move it to like a different--

180
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,140
- Yeah, that's a graft right there.

181
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,980
- You could graft it on a different part.

182
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,820
- True.

183
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,740
- If you fall out of your bed every morning forever now,

184
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
Eventually you'll have enough for a graft.

185
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,740
Uh-huh, you could do a whole follicular tramp transplant.

186
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,740
Follicular tramp stamp.

187
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,740
Fuck off! I went to bed at 5.

188
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:53,740
I went to bed at 5. I was making a shoe in a video game.

189
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
You knew we were recording at noon, dude. What are you doing?

190
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
I was making a shoe in a video game!

191
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
No, yeah, high heel.

192
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,740
Yeah, that's right.

193
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Yeah, you were making a high heel and Patrick dressed up.

194
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Yeah, high heel to stomp out your ball.

195
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
You're not gonna stomp my balls, dude.

196
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,740
I will.

197
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,740
I'm not into that, dude. I'm not one of those comedians.

198
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:11,000
(laughter)

199
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,540
(laughter)

200
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,380
- Woo!

201
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,220
(laughter)

202
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,060
- Ah, that's good.

203
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,900
- That's enough of that.

204
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,740
(laughter)

205
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,580
- Yeah.

206
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,400
- We're not gonna talk about that anymore.

207
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,240
- That's enough of that.

208
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,080
- That's the quota on that one.

209
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,340
(laughter)

210
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,000
- I've been in a good mood all day though.

211
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,980
(laughter)

212
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,940
- Yeah.

213
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,780
I drank a whole big can of Monster before this,

214
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,020
like the big ones.

215
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,060
- Dude, I drank a bang, the bang cola yesterday.

216
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,900
- Oh yeah, that's good.

217
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,460
- It's the worst thing I've ever had in my fucking life, dude.

218
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,300
- Oh, okay.

219
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,140
- Yeah, bang cola, that's like a fallout,

220
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,320
fallout consumable item.

221
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,380
- Dude, it's horrible.

222
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,260
And also like, I, like the caffeine is like nerfed

223
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,380
in the bang cola because of the taste.

224
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,540
Like my brain is too focused on like clearing

225
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,700
my taste buds out to even get like a rush from the caffeine.

226
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,260
- With another bang.

227
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,700
- Yeah, exactly.

228
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,780
Have you ever double banged?

229
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:10,660
you ever bang banged no dude I don't I do not have the fucking mental capacity to

230
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:16,900
do that you never bang bang skeet skeet no dude I've double banged one time in

231
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,500
LA well Will Cameron and I on a stream like the other night we looked up we

232
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:25,540
found a caffeine calculator to see how many like energy drinks he can drink in

233
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,180
one day like what's the safe limit yeah and what how many energy drinks will

234
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:34,740
kill you yeah you can find out the lethal dose of every I guess there's a

235
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,740
lethal dose of caffeine that makes sense yeah what is it for me it's - you have to

236
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,420
enter in your weight it's true so we were to energy drinks

237
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,900
two banks two banks they won't it won't kill you but it will be unsafe if you go

238
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:53,860
past yeah you you will get like sick I've definitely had unsafe levels of

239
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,940
caffeine before yeah oh me too I've had like full like like I don't know what the

240
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:07,380
I'm doing right now like the other every time I stop like drinking for a little

241
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:17,980
bit I think is a lethal dose yeah unless you're like Rob Dyrdek and then that's

242
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,820
just breakfast yeah wake up smash 50 bangs yeah we also did a kid the

243
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,260
calculations and we found out that if you were just eating bouillon cubes you

244
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:32,220
would die your your stomach would rupture before you died from sodium poisoning

245
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:39,060
just so you really yeah so it's safe it's safe yeah okay I didn't know that there

246
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,900
was sodium poisoning I mean you can get poison right pretty much anything any

247
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,980
water by the way you can there there is water poisoning that's called drowning

248
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:54,500
yeah yeah overdose on water dude so the amount of it's my maximum of monster

249
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:01,980
Ultra Fiesta four cans per day so I could drink like two today to stay under the

250
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,100
safe but it takes it takes a hundred so it's a hundred monster yeah the legal

251
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:12,660
limit yeah on energy drinks the legal limit there has to be a point where it's

252
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,340
like you can't dry yeah you have 40 bangs which is like tech it's not enough to

253
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,660
kill you but like you're gonna be going crazy you're gonna be you're gonna be

254
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:28,300
If you drink that many bangs you can just clip through the other cars you can just slide through the street like a ghost

255
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,960
That's sure you will no clip through the other cars. Yeah, that's like

256
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,960
Don't want you to have 50 bags. Yeah, they're hiding truth. They're hiding the truth

257
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,660
They just go through all the other cars you drink 40 bangs

258
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,100
And it's just like it's like God dragged your Photoshop layer just up one notch

259
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,140
front. Yeah, you don't bump into things anymore.

260
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Yeah, I think the most I've ever had was Tupang, so I think that's

261
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:06,140
probably the most caffeine I ever had. I remember just like I had like hot sweat

262
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,140
you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I had green hot

263
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:14,140
carbonated sweat dripping off of me. I don't think I've ever drank more than one

264
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:18,140
energy drink, but I've drank a lot of cups of coffee in a day

265
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,920
day before. I'm more of a coffee guy. I've had like maybe six cups of coffee in a day.

266
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,120
Yeah. I don't, I'm not a coffee person. That's why I drink Monster. I fucking hate coffee.

267
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,500
It's too bitter for me. I mean, that makes sense. There's a clear divide here if you

268
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:38,220
look at me and Cameron and Patrick, who drinks coffee and who drinks Monster Energy. I drink

269
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:44,380
the zero sugar one. That's even worse, dude. Is it? Yeah, man. When I, dude, I, when I

270
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,300
- I didn't blow you up,

271
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,460
'cause I feel like it does make sense.

272
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,420
- I used to drink like two Coke Zeros every day,

273
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,380
and I like didn't dream for six months.

274
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,420
- Well, I don't mind not dreaming.

275
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,380
- I mean, the thing about the sugar-free Monsters, Pat,

276
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,820
is that instead of putting in sugar,

277
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,060
they put in like, they just put in chemicals

278
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,340
that will like mutate your taste buds enough

279
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:06,740
to think it's sweet.

280
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,820
- They put in cotton candy.

281
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,100
- Yeah, they put in like,

282
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,620
they put in just viruses and bacteria

283
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,040
to make your brain think you're drinking something sweet.

284
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,820
- They kind of just put in whatever's around.

285
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,260
- Yeah. - Yeah.

286
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,340
- That does make sense.

287
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,260
If I was told that, that they just put in

288
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,820
whatever's around, I'd be like, "Yes."

289
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,420
- It's just like crushed up glass and shit.

290
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,520
- It's just whatever the factory worker sees first,

291
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,500
when they first get the can.

292
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,860
- Yeah, man, it's all just, it's just metal and glass.

293
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,380
- Dude, I feel like a fucking Mormon

294
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,060
when I talk about energy drink consumption.

295
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,520
It's just like, 'cause like they don't drink caffeine, dude.

296
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,700
Oh, they don't drink caffeine?

297
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,740
No.

298
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,300
Oh.

299
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,300
You didn't know that?

300
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,860
I thought that they drank fucking...

301
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,780
I thought they drank alcohol and caffeine

302
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,620
and said swears and didn't believe in God.

303
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,540
I thought they drank...

304
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,060
I thought they drank...

305
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,620
I thought they drank like soda.

306
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,460
They drink sugar.

307
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:04,140
They drink maybe a Sprite, maybe a, you know.

308
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,740
Sprite has caffeine in it.

309
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,700
No, it doesn't have caffeine in it, you stupid.

310
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,860
Sprite has caffeine.

311
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,900
Yeah, they wouldn't be included in a Happy Meal

312
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,900
if it had caffeine buddy.

313
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,900
There's enough caffeine in a McDonald's hamburger.

314
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
They don't need a Sprite as well, dude.

315
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
It's true.

316
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Do they have any caffeinated food yet?

317
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,900
Yeah, dude.

318
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Yeah, they make...

319
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Caffeine pills. Pills are food.

320
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
That's true.

321
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
What about like yogurt?

322
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
Yeah, what about yogurt?

323
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Caffeine yogurt?

324
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,900
Oh, they make Bang Makes a caffeinated ice cream.

325
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,900
Oh, that's horrifying.

326
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
That's true, caffeinated ice cream.

327
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
I know.

328
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
That is horrible.

329
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,460
They have like energy bars, right? That's a thing?

330
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,520
Yeah.

331
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,940
No, you're thinking like a Clif Bar.

332
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,940
Yeah, but okay.

333
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,940
That's just peanut butter.

334
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,060
That's just peanut butter and oatmeal, dude.

335
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,800
Let's see.

336
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,300
Peanut butter, but it has caffeine.

337
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
I'm just gonna search caffeinated food.

338
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,780
See if we can order it.

339
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,200
Yeah.

340
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,380
Caffeinated food.

341
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,780
Oh, they have like caffeine gum.

342
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,180
Chocolate covered coffee beans.

343
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,580
Coffee, energy drinks.

344
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,980
And drinks are not food.

345
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
Eating a coffee bean is not.

346
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:08,580
Oh, yeah.

347
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,740

369
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,900
You're not allowed because of how many you ate?

370
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,180
Because, yeah, I ate too many.

371
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,540

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
Yeah.

373
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,500
And they said I'm not allowed to have any more.

374
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,020
I wish I had something like that.

375
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,260
I wish you had nothing.

376
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,380
I've been back on the yerba mate.

377
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,380
Yeah.

378
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,380
Yeah.

379
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:24,100
What I like about it is that it doesn't taste good and it's expensive.

380
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,100
Yeah.

381
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,020
My grandpa, my grandpa John gave me a bunch of it when I was uh, he gave me a brick of it wrapped in like

382
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:34,020
A brick of yerba mate? Oh like the dry tea?

383
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:40,780
Yeah, and he was like, "Oh you might need a tea baller to drink that" and then he just handed, to drink this and he hands me like a fucking

384
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,100
A brick of yerba mate.

385
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,820
He's literally using you to traffic drugs.

386
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,340
I thought it was.

387
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,300
Absolutely.

388
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,100
I thought it was but didn't smell like it.

389
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,100
Yeah, that's why.

390
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,980
he's been he's been like completely he stopped smoking weed and stopped

391
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:00,780
drinking when he was 40. Oh good for Grandpa John. Yeah. Yeah. He's just a psycho.

392
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:05,220
Is he a ghost? Is he the one that travels around New England and

393
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,980
meeting people in bathrooms? He doesn't meet people in bathrooms he meets

394
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:16,860
them at train stations. Okay. He doesn't meet them in the bathroom.

395
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
He doesn't meet him in the bathroom.

396
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,340
Yeah, alright, unless you correct me there, that's fine.

397
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,340
He meets people like on the...

398
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
He uh...

399
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,340
Dude, he might be like...

400
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,340
I think I told you guys about this.

401
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,340
He might be Mossad.

402
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,340
Maybe.

403
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
Oh my god.

404
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,620
He might be an intelligence asset.

405
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:35,860
Yeah, my family's connection to Israel.

406
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,140
Yeah, it's gonna come out one day.

407
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,140
Yeah.

408
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,140
Sooner or later.

409
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,580
Did I ever tell you about the time...

410
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,380
So there was like a, he was waiting for the bus

411
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,500
'cause he used to take like the Boston Express

412
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,980
to like go down to just fucking walk around Boston.

413
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,220
- Gotta love Boston Express.

414
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,740
- Yeah, dude, it rocks.

415
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,180
It rocks, it absolutely rocks.

416
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,180
But fucking, so he like was walking around Boston

417
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,980
or whatever, came back, went to the bus station and--

418
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,220
- Speak into your microphone.

419
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,420
- There was a dude, I was talking into it.

420
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,260
- You were, as in--

421
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:16,100
Oh yeah, you were facing, you turned your head around 180 degrees like that.

422
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,100
I saw something outside.

423
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,100
Anyway, he...

424
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Outside where?

425
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,100
There's no window over there.

426
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,980
There's a window over there!

427
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,180
Show us the window.

428
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,180
I can't.

429
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,980
What just happened to your mic, Caleb?

430
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
What happened to it?

431
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:32,980
You just got really loud.

432
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,980
I just got really loud?

433
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,980
You just got insanely loud.

434
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
Yeah.

435
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,980
Well, I'm proud.

436
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,980
It's fine by me.

437
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,980
So he...

438
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,980
There was like a handicapped person trying to get on the bus, like someone with a wheelchair,

439
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,980
and he's like, "Oh hey, do you need help with that?"

440
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,980
And the guy's like, "Fuck off!"

441
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:53,980
And then my Grandpa John starts like getting into an argument with him,

442
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,980
'cause he wouldn't let him help, and he's like, "I don't need your fucking help!"

443
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
And he's like, "Let me help you!"

444
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,980
He was telling me on the way home, 'cause we took the bus home together one day,

445
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,980
And he was like, "I was about to fucking punch the guy."

446
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,980
It's like, it's a guy in a wheelchair, man.

447
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,980
What do you even do to that guy? How do you make it worse?

448
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,980
Did your mic come unplugged or something, Caleb?

449
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,980
No, it's plugged in.

450
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
What the hell did you do?

451
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,980
I don't know, something awesome.

452
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
Alright.

453
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:25,980
Is it really that loud?

454
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,980
We can just hear background noises too now.

455
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,980
I don't know, maybe it's maybe...

456
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,980
Maybe I'm imagining it.

457
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
Is it better now?

458
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,980
I think it's, yeah, I think it's fine now.

459
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,980
I don't know what happened.

460
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Um.

461
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,780
Yeah, I mean, what do you, a guy in a wheelchair, how do you, what do you even...

462
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,620
You cannot fight a guy in a wheelchair.

463
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,860
And what if he's like, what if he's built like, like Scrappy-Doo at the end of the Scooby-Doo

464
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,860
movie?

465
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
What if he's just ripped in his arms?

466
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,580
Yeah, what if there's a little dog inside him?

467
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:57,180
Yeah, yeah, what if he's being piloted, like Mr. Bean by a little dog?

468
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:00,180
Yeah, if he was being piloted, yeah.

469
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,740
I don't know.

470
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,740
He's...

471
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,740
he's my grandpa's Mr. Bean.

472
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,740
No, the guy in the wheelchair is Mr. Bean.

473
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,740
Mr. Bean didn't survive those movies.

474
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,740
Mr. Bean was controlled by Scrappy-Doo.

475
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,740
Mr. Monteverius.

476
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,740
That's his name in the movie.

477
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,740
No, that's another Mr. Bean that we gotta put in.

478
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,740
To the Bean bracket.

479
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,740
Scrappy Bean.

480
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,740
Scrappy Bean.

481
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,740
Scrapper Bean.

482
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,740
We can get that going soon, that bracket, probably.

483
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,740
Yeah, we can probably figure that out.

484
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,740
No, we're putting him up.

485
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,280
(all talking over each other)

486
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,920
- Today we have top 10 worst places from,

487
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,120
of course the top 10s.

488
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,920
- Yeah, we're never doing another website.

489
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,040
- No, come on, it's easy.

490
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,880
- I'll find some more.

491
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,800
- This one is very top heavy with how good it is.

492
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
The first one is just like,

493
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,160
the comments are incredible,

494
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,120
and then it just is kind of gradually gets worse.

495
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,040
But at the very least,

496
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,800
we got to read these comments on the first one.

497
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,000
So it's the top 10 worst places.

498
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,080
number one is hell

499
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,360
uh... and the top comment is from the gillicuddy

500
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,540
and it says

501
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,020
if there's absolutely one place i am certainly not going is hell i would do

502
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,880
absolutely anything to stay away from this place a person in richard sigmund

503
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,500
was able to get a glimpse of this place look up my time in heaven book and he

504
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,200
gave a horrifying description of what hell is actually like pure eternal

505
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,360
torture being burned by fire ripped apart by demons and put back together to

506
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,520
repeat the process, raped and so much other wild, torturous bullcrap that it's

507
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,200
just unbearable. No. No, no, no, no. I don't care what anyone says. Of course, I've

508
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,120
never seen it, but do I care? Well, considering the circumstances, hell no.

509
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,400
I'm a Christian and I'm staying a Christian because experiencing something

510
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,480
like this for an eternity is just ridiculous. I'm staying faithful to God.

511
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,440
Screw that. That's what I would be- if I was being eternally raped and tortured

The evil realm Satan tortures everyone with fire it is scary how satanic the whole place is.

522
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:05,680
It's scary how satanic hell is. Seriously satanic in here dude it's also really hot

523
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,560
whatever you do do not go to hell after you die it's even worse than the DMZ

524
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:19,600
what it in Korea DMV no I think that the demilitarized zone in Korea yeah I think

525
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:26,880
is just like a wall yeah it's like a fence do you think that those guys like

526
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,040
do you think like the North Koreans try to like that you know what it's named

527
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:36,640
after the DMZ. No. Dennis Miller's zone.

528
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:44,480
Sarcasm. There's a sign that says sarcasm is not allowed with not scribbled out.

529
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,640
Yeah.

530
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,400
There's a Korean guy just uh just just standing at the DMZ just being like

531
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,640
oh I would totally hate it if you came over here.

532
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,640
I would totally hate it. I would seriously hate it if we got into a scuffle right now.

533
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,640
So the North Koreans are in the news again.

534
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:17,640
Whenever. That's like Putin going down the Berlin Wall on a "Joanie loves Chachi" you know what I'm saying?

535
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,640
Get 'em Dennis. Sick 'em Dennis.

536
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,920
Whenever someone from whenever like a North Korean peasant escapes North

537
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:29,680
Korea and like crosses the entire ocean on like a piece of paper raft and then

538
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,080

541
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:48,040

Kim Jong-un had died with somebody's like did he die in the right case?

546

00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:31,600

561
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,240

562
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,080
being tortured with like you know Elvis and now I'm like basically the boss yeah

563
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,720
they saw my sepulchre t-shirt and they thought it was pretty cool yeah they

564
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,160
actually let me do guest vocals during one of their slave driving sessions I

565
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,080
actually got to scream at all the tortured souls someone said yes schools

566
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,440
the worst hell yeah dude someone says I'm not going to hell I would rather go

567
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:09,040
futuristic robot world. Me too. No I wouldn't want to go there. That's the mistake everyone

568
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,640
who dies and goes to hell they make the they make the mistake of not just going to futuristic

569
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,680
robot world instead. That's true. That's like that's Muslim hell. There's three.

570
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:24,720
There is three. You're right there's three. There's three, there's heaven, there's hell,

571
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,960
and there's futuristic robot world. Yeah. And you choose and not futuristic robot world didn't exist

572
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,280
till we got VR. Until Lost came out. Yeah. Until the final season of Lost.

573
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,040
And they were like, it's this third thing. See, there's not a lot of people in

574
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:46,160
the futuristic robot world. There's a lot of criteria you have to meet to be able to get in.

575
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:52,480
See, there's a... what's that? You have to take the Turing test to get in.

576
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,440
You gotta watch Robots with Robin Williams. Cyber Peter is at the gate.

577
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,440
Cyber Peter Griffin is at the gate.

578
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,440
Cyber Peter Griffin is at the gate and he's like,

579
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
"Beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep,

580
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,440
beep beep, take the Turing test."

581
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,440
And if you fail, you go to hell.

582
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
Oh my god.

583
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
Yeah, but if you get in he goes,

584
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
"Confirming, freaking sweet."

585
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Number two,

586
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:35,380
New Jersey. That's right. Yes let's fucking go. Woo! Let's go! First comment. Yeah read it.

587
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:41,160
Worse than hell for good metaphor see exorcist prequel where Lucifer fell from

588
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,000
heaven and landed on earth on the way to hell they built a church over the spot

589
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,120
where that evil landed with swords pointed down to keep Lucifer from

590
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,840
escaping then buried the church so that no one would find it and open it. Too

591
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,320
late. Christy and the rest of the damned evil state of New Jersey are ready are

592
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:02,260
already out and raining hell on earth. Too late for the Lord's Prayer to deliver

593
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:07,640
us from evil? Kingdom come to Canbun County? To Bergen County? Probably not and

594
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,760
most certainly not the case now." I really like the second comment. Chris Christy

595
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,360
Chris Christy dug up the church from the Exorcist 2? Is that what they're trying to say?

596
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,860
Yeah, to do his bridge, or to stop the bridge.

597
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:22,860
Yeah.

598
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,760
The second comment is, "God help those suffering in New Jersey.

599
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,040
God speed to those families not yet afflicted.

600
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:32,660
And God damn those in New Jersey who cause all the suffering until the strong and those

601
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:36,460
not yet too weak to fight can vanquish them and save all the people and their children

602
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,900
suffering at their malicious and evil hand."

603
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,980
God help the people in New Jersey.

604
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,980
Finish your food.

605
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:49,260

00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:55,460

611
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:21,460

they have a jersey great because they have food and vegetables there that's

616
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,940
That's something that's really great about New Jersey.

617
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,980
- Oh, there's so many vegetables in New Jersey.

618
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:45,820
- Dude, it's paradise.

619
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,860
We have blockbusters and we have grocery stores.

620
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
- We have roads you can drive a car on.

621
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,660
- Yeah, we have cars with four wheels.

622
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,500
- Yeah.

623
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,580
You guys aren't gonna believe this,

624
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,100
but the children are allowed to play

625
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,260
on playgrounds at recess here.

626
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,980
- Whoa, okay.

627
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,980
- Yeah.

628
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,220
- Wow.

629
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:07,020
- I'm pretty sure we even have a candy shop in our town.

630
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,060
You'd think that the state that Bon Jovi came from,

631
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,060
they wouldn't allow children to--

632
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,960
- So you're trying to make me look like a laughing stock?

633
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,060
I from New Jersey, loser.

634
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,040
You must be a redneck from Mississippi.

635
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,780
You must have been born on the Belt Parkway

636
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,900
because that's where most accidents happen.

637
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,620
We have Six Flags Great Adventure.

638
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,600
What do you have, some cheap rides from Chuck E. Cheese's?

639
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,060
Oh, should I mention that you are such a loser?

640
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:29,900
- Yes.

641
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,620
Woo, get 'em.

642
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,920
That Belt Parkway line is great, dude.

643
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,700
- Yeah. - Yeah.

644
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,800
That's a burn right there.

645
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:43,980
Yeah what are you from the nuclear factory from the Simpsons?

646
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,840
Cause you're having an ass in a lot of the opening credits.

647
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:56,040
This is a comment from SelfieFan68 that says "My city eyed not that bad."

648
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,920
Hell yeah.

649
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Let's see here.

650
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,920
Woah.

651
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,920
Alright wait wait.

652
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,400
Oh my god.

653
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,440
This is the lo- this comment is so fucking long, Jesus Christ.

654
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Is it on New Jersey?

655
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:14,520
This is- it's about- yeah, it's about, um, it's about the Clintons, um, trafficking children

656
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,480
and every word is capitalized.

657
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,080
Through New Jersey?

658
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,400
Not just gang violence, a corrupt state in many corrupt counties and areas surrounding

659
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,520
Camden and Englewood and Newark and Hoboken and, god damn, the state of New Jersey, as

660
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,600
bad and evil as Orwell's 1984 and Nazi Germany put together.

661
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,320
The division literally tortures and drugs and institutionalizes children and uses the

662
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,800
political abuse of psychiatry and court savagery with Gestapo police to do the

663
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,840
same to anyone who is for rights. Schools or they fear will say anything about the

664
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,360
rampant corruption and tyranny known by any attorney with the better ones just

665
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,680
beginning a fight to protect the people and residents and the children and the

666
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,040
families of New Jersey join the fight against the state of New Jersey

667
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,520
corruption malfeasance family court criminal enterprises and tyranny and

668
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:55,960
that's not even- Family court criminal enterprises?

669
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:01,960
That's not even half of that comment. It's insanely long.

670
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,640
They steal 40 billion dollars every year across the US.

671
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,440
Most of the abducted children are abused, sexually abused,

672
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,360
put on horrific psychotropic drugs to control them, and over half end up

673
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,120
homeless and

674
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,880
80% in prison and sex trafficked on the streets.

675
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,800
Horrific child holocaust. That's my favorite

676
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,840
Italian horror movie from the seventies.

677
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:37,440
Yeah. New Jersey Holocaust. Yeah. New Jersey, huh? New Jersey Holocaust. Yeah, I'm thinking.

678
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,520
Yeah, that'd be a great movie. I'm thinking about it. That would be a great movie. I don't get it.

679
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:51,200
New Jersey Holocaust. Are you talking about Italy? No, I just think it, uh, I think it'd be good.

680
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,080
I just think that'd be a good plot of a movie to happen. It'd be a good plot, it'd be a funny

681
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,280
plot of a movie yeah I like scary and funny number three jail mm-hmm

682
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,120
just read that man created this list when we were bored in school he put jail on

683
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,240
the list but not prison but then somebody else must have added prison to

684
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,840

- I'll become the warden pretty fast.

690
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,880
- Yeah, jail is about working your way up.

691
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,560
People don't realize that.

692
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,200
- 'Cause a lot of the people, they get to jail,

693
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,080
they just give up.

694
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,520
- You airdrop me into a jail,

695
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:36,680
by the end of the day, everyone's gonna be friends in there.

696
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,560
- You airdrop me a funny picture

697
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,400
while you're visiting me in jail.

698
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,240
- I'm gonna laugh.

699
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,060
- And guess what?

700
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,800
I'm gonna show the whole jail,

701
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,880
and they're all gonna laugh,

702
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,920
and they're gonna elect me class president.

703
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,760
- Yeah.

704
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,360
- Doesn't jail have like a class president thing?

705
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,200
- No, you're thinking of school.

706
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,040
- Jail should have a class president.

707
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,600
- I'm thinking of school actually.

708
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,320
Wait, doesn't jail have math and science classes and recess?

709
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,000
Jail does have recess.

710
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,280
- Doesn't jail have time out that you go to

711
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,200
when you bite the teacher's finger?

712
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
- Wait a second.

713
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,040
Isn't jail--

714
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,640
- Even jail has recess.

715
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,520
- Isn't jail a giant mammal that swims in the water

716
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,920
and was hunted by Captain Ahab?

717
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,600
- No, buddy, you're thinking of whale.

718
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,440
- Oh.

719
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,960
way sorry guys yeah that's a little both although both are a little you know a

720
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:29,520
little way for my day right that's no yeah I'm the only thing that is scary

721
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,080
about prison is the food I know it's probably not like the prison food you

722
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:37,240
see in TV but I still don't like thinking about it someone straight up

723
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:43,120
says the worst thing about jail is you get raped and get HIV AIDS that's true

724
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,980
Trans 45 says I hope I never go to jail I probably never will but you never know

725
00:35:49,980 --> 00:36:00,780
I know myself pretty well and I think there is a possibility you just never know

726
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:04,340
you never know you never know I could go to jail. What would you guys go to jail for?

727
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:09,660
me? yeah. being too cool. killing you. you would never kill me you couldn't kill me

728
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:16,020
in a thousand years. I could kill you right now. We should all go to jail. We should all do the same crime. Let's go to prison.

729
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:25,040
Yeah, let's go to prison. I don't know I think we could we could I think we would own in prison dude.

730
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,780
Yeah, I would be so good at prison. Yeah.

731
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:33,520
I would. Are you kidding me? I would set up obstacle courses for all the other inmates.

732
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,520
Yeah. And we would do Prison Ninja Warrior. We would do blanket forts.

733
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,820
It would be sick. I

734
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,420
Don't know. I feel like I could change the vibe of jail. Yeah, I could jail I could do around jail

735
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,280
The vibes are off man. I mean all you have to do is just smile at people, you know a smile can change someone's day

736
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,660
Mm-hmm. That's true. We may be in prison, but it doesn't mean that we can't smile

737
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,020
Yeah

738
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:01,380
Yeah, I think yeah, I would I would basically be the popular kid in jail

739
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,940
Yeah, no, I'm thinking we don't begging me to go to the dance now

740
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,940
I'm thinking the only reform we need in prison might be some beautiful smiles.

741
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,940
I'd be the chef in prison. Yeah. I'd be like chef from South Park.

742
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:20,780
Yeah exactly I would sing songs to everyone. I would do like a cool like I'd

743
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:24,380
have my own cool food like the chocolate salty balls I don't know what it

744
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,460
would be called. What would my food be? Your food? I would be so good at making

745
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:37,060
that that ramen loaf you would you'd make something called like blue meat yeah

746
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:41,580
yeah be like a steak that you marry it would be like yeah exactly or no when

747
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,500
you're gonna say you would just be it on like on like a like an iron a radiator

748
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:52,340
yeah yeah yeah I could do that all right let's send let's send Pat to jail here's

749
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:57,060
a comment at least I know two ways to escape the silent and the easy way oh

750
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:00,260
Oh yeah, how would you escape jail?

751
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
How would I escape?

752
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,700
Would you use the silent way or the easy way?

753
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,820
I would do, I would escape jail by being on such good behavior.

754
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,180
I would just, I would pretend, here's how I would escape jail.

755
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,420
I would hire one of you two to come visit me and have a big camera, right, and follow

756
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,580
me around for a little bit.

757
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:23,620
And then I would just tell the warden, I'd be like, "Alright, listen, I'm not going to

758
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,980
tell any of the inmates or any of the other people working here, this is an

759
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,420
episode of Undercover Boss. So just let me do whatever I want. I'm walking around,

760
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:35,340
I'm making sure everything's okay, all my employees are in order, but I'm gonna walk

761
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,900
out of here pretty soon because I'm not gonna stay in jail, you know what I mean?

762
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course. And I'd be walking around and I'd get the

763
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,860
heartfelt stories from all the like, all the gang members who are in there for

764
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:54,160
killing their killing their wives and I'd be like you know what maybe jail isn't so

765
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:59,860
bad yeah and then you wink into the camera yeah I would just teleport out of

766
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:05,700
jail I don't see a reason not to yeah yeah I'll just again I get out on good

767
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,940
I would try and he would try and like dig a hole in the concrete with a spoon but

768
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:13,500
he would die because he would keep eating the yeah yeah I would not eat the

769
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:17,260
concrete all the dust he would just keep eating I already said and then he already

770
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:20,740
I'd get out on good behavior.

771
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,740
You wouldn't.

772
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,740
No.

773
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,460
They would let me out day one because of how good I am.

774
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:30,980
The second, every time that the guard came by to like unlock your cell to let you go

775
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,620
eat a meal, you would just go like, "Baaaa!"

776
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,860
Really loud and scare the shit out of them and they would beat you up.

777
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:37,860
No.

778
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,860
I would do a curtsy.

779
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:39,860
You would get beat up so hard in jail.

780
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,540
I would do a curtsy and I would get out.

781
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,540
You would walk around.

782
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,540
You would walk around.

783
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,780
That's because you'd be in a girls jail.

784
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,780
I'd turn my shoes into tap shoes and I would be in tap dancing. You'd be in Orange is the New Black.

785
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:55,780
Yeah, sure. They had fun in that show. Patrick is the new fan. I'm not a fan of Orange is the New Black.

786
00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:02,580
Yeah, you're right. They do have loads of fun. I would request to be in a girls jail.

787
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:08,420
Maybe like, "Are you a girl?" and I'd be like, "No, I just get along with girls better." Yeah.

788
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:12,220
Someone says better than residential school.

789
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,920
That's true. No lie, no cap detected.

790
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,020
No lies, no crap. That's true.

791
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,120
Number four, Warzone. That's a fun game, dude.

792
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,220
Yeah. What the hell, dude? Come on.

793
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,620
Randomator says, "Yeah, it doesn't sound like a fun place to be."

794
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,620
I was here before. It is hell.

795
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:37,620
No, seriously. Screw Justin Berber stuff. That ain't bad.

796
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,620
*laughter*

797
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:41,120
Justin Berber ain't that bad, man.

798
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,320
Justin Berber.

799
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,020
*laughter*

800
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,020
Screw Justin Berber, I've been to war.

801
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,620
That shit's nothing compared to war.

802
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:54,020
Dude, remember what a godsend that was when Justin Bieber was on that episode of, like, Law & Order,

803
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,020
where he gets shot in the head?

804
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,020
Yeah, oh my god.

805
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:00,020
And just everybody was like, "Most epic moment in TV history."

806
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,020
Yeah.

807
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,020
"Justin Bieber gets murdered."

808
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:05,020
That is- it is really funny, yeah.

809
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,420
there is a video of Justin Bieber getting shot a bunch of times.

810
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,420
Getting shot by the police.

811
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,420
So sick.

812
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,420
When he was like 15.

813
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,420
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

814
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:20,920
They literally only did that so they would have like a video of Justin Bieber getting shot.

815
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,920
Definitely one of the creators was like

816
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,920
it would be really funny just to have a video of Justin Bieber getting shot.

817
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,920
Let's just write a whole guest episode.

818
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,920
Yeah.

819
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,920
Where he gets to act.

820
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,920
I haven't seen any other part of that episode.

821
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,080
episode that might be he might only be in that scene that might be like spliced

822
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:42,080
into like the cops go look it's justin bieber

823
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:47,040
he's not even like the criminal in the episode

824
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,360
uh... number five concentration camps

825
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,800
uh... yeah i mean obviously we can't even joke about that dude come on

826
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,220
yeah

827
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,920
there's a comment here from pizza guy

828
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:01,920
that says

829
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,680
This is why if I time travel to the 40s I will go to South America not Europe and North Korea's

830
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,080
concentration camp sounds really scary.

831
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:16,320
If I know one thing is that South America in the 40s was swag, it was nothing but fucking

832
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,880
coconuts and bananas dude.

833
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,400
It was paradise.

834
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
No one was doing anything weird.

835
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,280
Well if he time travels to the 40s and he goes to South America in like 1946 he's going

836
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,440
to be meeting the same people he would meet.

837
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,440
He only has a few years before.

838
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,440
Yeah.

839
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Yeah.

840
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,440
Number... He goes to Argentina.

841
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:40,440
Yeah.

842
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,440
I met this...

843
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,440
I went to this cabana... I love Argentina in the 40's.

844
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,440
Not a Nazi in sight. Yeah.

845
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,440
I met this beautiful woman

846
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,440
at this cabana named Ava.

847
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,440
[Laughter]

848
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,440
Number six is

849
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:56,440
black hole.

850
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,440
Cosmo says... I can survive it.

851
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,480
- If you went in a black hole, you would be spaghettified

852
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,080
and you would turn really long.

853
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,160
- That'd be kinda cool.

854
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,780
Maybe me and Pat could do that and we'd get really tall.

855
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,620
- It wouldn't happen.

856
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,960
- Yeah, I would come back and I'd be--

857
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:12,320
- Cameron's height, six foot nine.

858
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,240
- I could get in the NBA if I was,

859
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,080
every molecule of my body was just like,

860
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,920
kinda like one molecule wide,

861
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,720
but as many molecules as my body is tall.

862
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,360
Right, and I'm just like kind of an invisible

863
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,200
piece of string. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,440
I feel like I'd be a great basketball player then.

865
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,440
String Caleb.

866
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,440
Yeah.

867
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,880
That's what they would call you.

868
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,640
They would call you Caleb the String.

869
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,640
Caleb the String.

870
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,640
Like Wilt the Steel.

871
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:37,640
Yeah dude.

872
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,640
I'd be like 50 miles high.

873
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,520
They'd call you Caleb the Bale of Hay.

874
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
That's not a bale.

875
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,520
That's a piece of hay.

876
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:44,520
No.

877
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:45,520
He would look like a hay.

878
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,520
He would look like a singular hay.

879
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:47,520
But that's not what a bale is.

880
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,520
There's no such...

881
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,520
Hay is plural.

882
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:50,520
Hay is already plural.

883
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,520
What is it singular?

884
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,520
Ha.

885
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,520
It's hello.

886
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:54,520
Plural.

887
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,520
It's hello.

888
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,520
But in singular.

889
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,520
A piece of hello.

890
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,520
A piece of hi.

891
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
Yeah.

892
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:06,520
Yeah.

893
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,520
It's what's up.

894
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,520
Yeah dude.

895
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:12,520
And it's just the kind of stuff you learn

896
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,520
when you're me.

897
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:16,520
When you're a scientist.

898
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,520
Yeah when you grew up on a farm like me.

899
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,520
Yeah.

900
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,520
Yeah I grew up on a soybean farm.

901
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,640
the middle of the Sun the middle of that's the joke of the Sun though is

902
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,880
that the earth is the middle is hot the middle of the Sun is actually freezing

903
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:39,760
cold yeah it actually is just earth whoa yeah it's reversed holy shit yeah you

904
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,280
might want to think about that before you guys make fun of me for being like

905
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,120
stupid or bald is that I know stuff like that you know yeah I know so much about

906
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:52,160
the Sun cuz your head looks like it but it's so bright and and circular yeah you

907
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
You guys are jealous.

908
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,160
You guys are jealous. The next step in evolution is...

909
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,160
Evolution realizes you don't even need hair.

910
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
What is hair doing for you? It's slowing you down.

911
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,160
Guess who's fast at swimming? Guess who's a really fast swimmer?

912
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,160
Me. Except for my massive afro pubes.

913
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,160
Those really slow me down.

914
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Yeah. Funny you just put those on your head.

915
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,160
You have like weights on the end of your pubes that are dragging you down.

916
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,160
You get your pubes transplanted to the top of your head

917
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:24,040
you just look like Bert from Sesame Street yeah and everybody's like are you

918
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,840
doing shibs on your head no I'm not doing a bird thing I'm not a bird yeah

919
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:37,680
I'm half I'm half Dominican and I'm half Muppet so you have to respect my hair

920
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:45,160
it's my hair buddy feel it look put your mouth on it it's my hair all me baby now

921
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:49,720
this list this is where the list starts to drop off but I think we should

922
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:54,400
skip ahead to 10 which I would just kind of what was expected to be on here and

923
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,120
has a lot of comments so we're skipping over North Korea and Antarctica

924
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:03,960
nobody really says anything good about those but number 10 is a Justin Bieber

925
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:09,360
concert oh here we friggin go yeah here we go seen this before

926
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:14,060
here's a comment that says he got caught with a hooker I'm this close to dropping

927
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:21,020
down a nuclear bomb on his frontal lobe. Yeah, "Hey Baby" is that a song about himself?

928
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:29,300
Yeah. Ooh! Yeah. I'd rip my ears off then make myself die by the vibrations of his

929
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:35,580
suicide singing. Justin Bieber, why would someone ever go to his concert? Whoever

930
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:40,340
does this is crazy. His songs make my ears bleed. I wish Justin Bieber should

931
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:50,020
go to hell LeBron LeBron wrote that comment dude whoa dude what's up LeBron huge fan I

932
00:46:50,020 --> 00:46:57,940
could not agree more or a 1d concert that might be worse one Dylan one Dylan baby baby baby

933
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:05,460
oh ugh rather get pushed by a cow of a building rooftop than going to Justin Bieber's concert

934
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,300
that is horrible and I don't see why hell and prison is up this high because they ain't

935
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:16,540
that bad whoa Bobby the brony people spread too much hate to Justin Bob that's

936
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:21,660
funny to be a brony that hates Justin Bieber like what yeah what's your reason

937
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,500
for hating by the most common type of person that true yeah well now what how

938
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:32,380
do you how does that work cuz even a brony knows that he's a girl dude it's

939
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:36,980
true Roni's like girl things no no cuz there's my little ponies they're like

940
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,380
you know it's a pretty clear gender breakdown it's like 50/50. My Little Pony is not for girls.

941
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,380
Uh my Little Pony is Antifa.

942
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,420
Uh next is Flint, Michigan.

943
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,540
There's no comments on this.

944
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,980
I would survive Flint, Michigan.

945
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,860
That's a newcomer.

946
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,460
Yeah.

947
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:55,780
Whoa.

948
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:56,660
I-

949
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:59,460
Number 11 is school.

950
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,460
That's right.

951
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:01,860
Here we go.

952
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:03,300
Without school life would be hell.

953
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:07,700
Non-stop crimes, more wars, more gangs, dumb people, abusive people, and more.

954
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:11,700
Whoever thinks school is worse than hell, go to hell yourselves and find out how great school was.

955
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,900
Do not respect the author of that comment. That is fucked up.

956
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,200
You must be dumb!

957
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,600
School is a place where you learn!

958
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:19,900
Oh my god, dude.

959
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,500
Haven't ever thought of this before.

960
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,900
There's an acronym, some acronym action here for Minecraft Hater.

961
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:25,400
Okay.

962
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,200
School.

963
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,400
Seven crappy hours of our lives.

964
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
Hooooly shit.

965
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,600
Woooah.

966
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,300
I went to school for eight hours.

967
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,100
I feel like we could do a better one.

968
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:37,460
I went to school for like hundreds of days. I don't know why you guys only went for a few hours.

969
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:41,540
Stinky. Seven I would change to stinky. Crappy, that can stay.

970
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:44,660
H is hot poop. Hot poop, yeah.

971
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:52,820
O is our poop. Our poop. The other O is oh my god it's so poopy here. And L is...

972
00:48:52,820 --> 00:48:56,820
L is love you. L is love poop if you go here.

973
00:48:56,820 --> 00:49:00,420
Love poop if you're a teacher. It's true.

974
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:08,820
our way maybe the government found a way to torture us with school aka prison

975
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:15,860
that's true number 12 is the desert the deserts of Iraq Afghanistan Syria and

976
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:26,340
Somalia are hell on earth Vegas is an exception true true so hot it's just one

977
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:33,780
comments so I'm number 13 Bermuda Triangle and the lowest comment is the

978
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:46,260
tringle could be a I that shrink could be a I David potassium I've never thought

979
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,220
about that before the tringle could be a I David potassium told me yesterday that

980
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:56,620
There's a there's a there's an area of Boston called the Polish Triangle and

981
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,380
I've just been thinking about it as a Bermuda Triangle esque like place where shit just disappears.

982
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,380
Anyone who goes in doesn't come out.

983
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:04,380
Yeah.

984
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:06,380
Anyone who goes in there forgets how to screw a light bulb forever.

985
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,380
(Laughter)

986
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,380
(Laughter)

987
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:12,380
(Laughter)

988
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,380
(Laughter)

989
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,380
That's the secret of the Polish Triangle.

990
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:18,380
It's all of them stacked on top of each other like the Tower of Babel

991
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,380
trying to screw in a light bulb.

992
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:26,380
The problem with the Polish triangle is all the ships that appear have a screen door on the bottom.

993
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,380
Yeah.

994
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:32,380
They call it, the Polish people call it the Polish triangle but it has like five sides.

995
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:45,380
[Laughter]

996
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,780
Oh, I hate the Polish. That's some classic shit.

997
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:49,780
That is some classic shit, dude.

998
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:51,280
That's some classic dad shit.

999
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,680
That is some old school. Polish jokes, yeah.

1000
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,980
Old school shit.

1001
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,980
Yeah.

1002
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:01,380
I don't think, I think I, yeah, I didn't, I don't think I even knew Polish people were real until...

1003
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:01,880
Yeah.

1004
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:06,380
Until way late in life, 'cause I only knew of them through jokes from my grandfather.

1005
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,380
Yeah.

1006
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,780
Although I remember, I think it was...

1007
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:12,580
Oh, I told my grandpa...

1008
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:16,420
that I was talking to him about like friends that I made in Boston

1009
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:20,700
like my first year of school and I was like yeah I know this guy Neil

1010
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,780
and he's like Neil what's his last name? Oh no. I was like Linsky and he's like Linsky

1011
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,220
is he some kind of fucking BOLOCK?

1012
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,620

Yeah, the band Graveyard.

1046
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,220
And the comment is, "Oh gosh, terrifying."

1047
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:19,660
But I really like that they were trying to think of what's the worst place.

1048
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:24,020
Okay, there's hell, there's jail, there's a black hole.

1049
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:25,020
A graveyard.

1050

*laughter*

1055
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:37,020
Did you guys ever go to the graveyard and pee on stuff when you were young?

1056
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,020
No, not pee on stuff.

1057
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,020
We would hang out in the graveyard and smoke weed though.

1058
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,020
I did not.

1059
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:45,020
I did not smoke weed, but I did pee on every grave.

1060
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,020
I actually, I peed on like...

1061
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:52,020
I peed on like every grave in this graveyard when I was in high school.

1062
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,020
Jeez.

1063
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,020
I just thought it was funny to go pee on the graves.

1064
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,020
My high school was next to a graveyard.

1065
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,020
Was it?

1066
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:02,020
Yeah, it was like a little bit down the road, but

1067
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,020
it was pretty close and some kids got caught hooking up in it.

1068
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,020

You send all the clips about you having sex with your brother to your mom?

1149
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,800
Dude, I'm not gonna have sex with any of my four brothers.

1150
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,800
Three brothers.

1151
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,800
Was your fourth brother... did you add a brother recently?

1152
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,640
His fourth brother is you, Cameron.

1153
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,800
I included myself in the brother count.

1154
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:20,080
I'm not gonna have sex with any of my brothers.

1155
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,720
And you can take that to the bank.

1156
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:26,520
You're gonna have sex with your brother at the bank?

1157
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:31,120
No, I'm not gonna lock myself in the vault

1158
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:31,960
and have sex with my brothers.

1159
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,680
You're gonna bring a big check to the bank

1160
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,080
from Caleb's Big Brother House, the TV show.

1161
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,040
'Cause like if you requested a big check

1162
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,240
and you're gonna try and cash it

1163
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,120
and the thing at the bottom, it's not gonna say cash,

1164
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,600
it's gonna say Big Brother's.

1165
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,840
I'm not gonna start a new Playboy channel reality show

1166
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,660
called Home Brother House.

1167
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,960
You're gonna make a deposit.

1168
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,320
You're gonna make a deposit into your brother's ATM.

1169
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,280
- My brothers aren't big, except for where it counts.

1170
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,640
Then they're big brothers.

1171
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,760
Not that I would know, dude,

1172
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,440
I haven't seen them, my brother's wieners,

1173
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:05,320
when I was 10 or 11 years old, dude,

1174
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,060
walking in on him in the bathroom.

1175
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:10,160
That didn't happen.

1176
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,480
I would say, no, me and my brother did used to do--

1177
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,800
- Patrick's watching a video now.

1178
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,320
- When-- - I'm not watching a video.

1179
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,160
- What are you looking at? - Someone said

1180
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,400
it looks like Pavarotti.

1181
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,840
- When "Waiting" came out, remember that movie "Waiting"?

1182
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:21,840
Oh, the penis game? You did that too?

1183
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,840
No, not the penis game. No, we would do the donkey.

1184
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,840
Where you tucked your ball sack and your

1185
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,840
- Yeah, the whole game though. - ...penis around.

1186
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:29,840
You did it without the game.

1187
00:59:29,840 --> 00:59:31,840
We just thought it was funny to look at

1188
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,840
each other's balls.

1189
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:35,840
You didn't even punch your brother after?

1190
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,840
Dude, I'm not gonna hurt

1191
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,840
my brother.

1192
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,840
What if I accidentally, what if I miss

1193
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,840
and I actually destroy his beautiful

1194
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:45,840
penis with my fist?

1195
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,840
That would suck, dude.

1196
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,800
No, no you punch them because they looked at your penis. That was the point of the game

1197
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:55,420
I'm gonna I'm gonna pitch that to my grandpa like Shark Tank. I'm gonna pitch it

1198
00:59:55,420 --> 01:00:00,700
All right, so we're gonna put me and all the brothers in a house and you're gonna pay for the cameras

1199
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:08,700
And we're gonna punch each other in the balls, what do you think grandpa?

1200
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,860
It's all I've ever wanted from you boys

1201
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:16,280
That's what I raised as I raised you. Yeah

1202
01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:22,780
Yeah number 24 blood on the dance. No, you skip number 23 number 23 is Justin Bieber's underwear the top comment

1203
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,060
I would hate to be seriously guys

1204
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:29,400
You're telling me that a wide-open state with plenty of things to do and see that well fits 9 million people is worse than a super

1205
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:34,100
Tiny place to do nothing that would near be nearly impossible to fit even one person

1206
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:39,820
I wish people would get their facts straight and the comment I really like on this one is he will blow up when he sees

1207
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,820
this lol I

1208
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:47,360
I would hate to be in his underwear, especially if I was Caleb Bieber, then I would be double mad.

1209
01:00:47,360 --> 01:00:49,540
Yeah, if you were married to his brother.

1210
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,220
Yeah, if I was his brother, I'd be so... I would hate to be in his undies, dude.

1211
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:55,940
In his unders.

1212
01:00:55,940 --> 01:01:01,620
Did your dad's have a funny word for underwear growing up?

1213
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,780
No, my dad said underwear. My dad said unders.

1214
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:08,140
Your dad said Caleb's playhouse.

1215
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:11,320
No. That's what he called his underwear. No.

1216
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,400
- Oh, dude. - Yeah.

1217
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,240
- No.

1218
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:15,060
- He called it-- - I did.

1219
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,000
- Did you guys-- - He called it brother's game.

1220
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,840
That's what he called your underwear.

1221
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,400
- Did you guys-- (laughing)

1222
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,520
Did you guys have a phase where you saw on TV and stuff

1223
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,960
that people just hung out with their hands in their pants

1224
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,060
and then you guys did that for a little bit?

1225
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:31,000
- No. - No.

1226
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,020
- No?

1227
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,860
- I used to walk around-- - What do you mean

1228
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:33,680
hands in your pants?

1229
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,600
- Like walk around with sweatpants with your hands,

1230
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,060
like where your penis lives.

1231
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:39,560
- What?

1232
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,040
- You never did that? - I mean, no, I did that.

1233
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,040
I didn't see it on TV.

1234
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,040
Oh, I used to watch TV a lot.

1235
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,040
You just used to... what do you mean?

1236
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:49,040
You don't need to... come on, you've done that.

1237
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,040
It's chill, it's relaxing.

1238
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,040
Yeah, it's chill, you know you're safe.

1239
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,040
Maybe you're explaining it wrong.

1240
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,040
You put your hand in your pants.

1241
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,040
Put both your hands in your pants.

1242
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,040
That's about as simple as it gets.

1243
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,040
Where did you see it on TV?

1244
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,040
Put your hand in your pants.

1245
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:07,040
Security camera footage.

1246
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,040
(laughter)

1247
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:10,240
(laughing)

1248
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,080
- Come on.

1249
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:12,360
- You ever did that?

1250
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,200
- No.

1251
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,020
- I don't know.

1252
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:14,940
- At least one of you agreed with me.

1253
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,200
That would have been horrible if both of you were there.

1254
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,480
- I think that's a, I feel like that's

1255
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:20,360
a fairly normal thing to do.

1256
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:22,520
- Wait, like you're laying on the couch and you--

1257
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,400
- And you just stick a hand down there, dude.

1258
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,240
- Yeah.

1259
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,040
- Maybe it starts as a scratch,

1260
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:29,000
but then you're like, then you realize like,

1261
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,280
I don't have a better place for my hand to be right now.

1262
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,240
- Yeah, might as well.

1263
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,080
- Oh, okay.

1264
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:33,900
All right.

1265
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:34,740
- Yeah.

1266
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:35,580
- No, when you explain it like that,

1267
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:36,400
I thought you meant you--

1268
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,240
- What did you think it was?

1269
01:02:37,240 --> 01:02:41,720
did you ever see on TV when people put their hands down their pants and they

1270
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:46,800
hung out like that? TV is a reflection of reality and there are moments... I didn't know what you...

1271
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:56,240
Have you ever heard of Zakhla Khan dude? Come on Pat. I love her music.

1272
01:02:56,240 --> 01:03:05,520
Number 25, the ghetto. Damn. Yeah that's where I'm from. Number 32 is haunted

1273
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:20,520
mansion. I would hate to be in the haunted mansion. That'd be sick dude. Fucking Eddie Murphy's there, he's making you laugh dude. He's doing the raw routine from the first eight minutes of the special.

1274
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:29,520
He's calling the ghost. He's calling the ghost the slur. Yeah. He can't sit in the front row or look at his ass dude. Yeah. You're just dying laughing.

1275
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:35,000
number 49 is Saudi Arabia and it's the first line of the top comment is the

1276
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,480
cops there are very sketchy the cops in Saudi Arabia they're very sketchy and

1277
01:03:42,480 --> 01:03:49,760
43 43 90 year old ladies changing room whoa there's a comment here from British

01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:55,520
goat that says how would you even get in this situation

1279
01:03:55,840 --> 01:04:01,280
Wait, number 59 is Columbine High School and the top comment is from Joe Boy and

1280
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:06,680
says, "After the 1999 shooting, this place just got haunted."

1281
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:17,280
Trains 45 on number 60 Iraq said, "I would never visit this country. One of the

1282
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:21,360
worst places to visit." Back to the Columbine thing, I feel like

1283
01:04:21,360 --> 01:04:25,000
Columbine, if you went to Columbine High School, I feel like you would be pretty

1284
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:31,400
safe yeah now yeah I mean definitely not in 1999 but afterwards like you're just

1285

Take it off right now.

1298
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:26,400
Everyone lives on Earth.

1299
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,720
Number 74 is United States.

1300
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,720
First comment.

1301
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:31,720
Well we got a sub list.

1302
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:34,160
People do not hate America because they are jealous of you.

1303
01:05:34,160 --> 01:05:37,760
They hate America because they have poor education and are the most hypocritical country in the

1304
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:38,760
world.

1305
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,080
I have a lot of reasons the United States sucks.

1306
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:41,520
Number one, they eat too much.

1307
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:44,280
Number two, they hate any nation that can do things better than them.

1308
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,800
Number three, they are obese.

1309
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,800
They are ignorant.

1310
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,120
They only care about themselves.

1311
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:49,120
They are rude.

1312
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,120
They have Donald Trump.

1313
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,860
They have start wars, health care is expensive,

1314
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:55,180
they have stupid laws, they brag too much,

1315
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,300
they won't get over 9/11,

1316
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,060
they are the only nation without universal health care,

1317
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,360
they have a lot of gun crime,

1318
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,820
they elected George Bush twice,

1319
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,300
they act like they're the only country in North America,

1320
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,080
some Americans act like they're the only nation

1321
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,200
in the world, and they brag about their military.

1322
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,140
Peaceful countries do not need a big army or military.

1323
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,220
18 reasons America sucks.

1324
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,500
- Damn. - Wow.

1325
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,500
Wow.

1326
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,420
We have freaking gnome chomps in the comments here.

1327
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:21,420
Number...

1328
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:24,500
Yeah, that's from user Angela Davis.

1329
01:06:24,500 --> 01:06:30,060
Number 109 is Chernobyl and the comment says, "Terrible explosion that killed like 25 people."

1330
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:34,140
Yeah, it's just 25 people.

1331
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:35,140
I could survive Chernobyl.

1332
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:36,140
That's all they got in Chernobyl.

1333
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:37,140
Yeah.

1334
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,140
I could survive it too.

1335
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:39,140
I would just hold my breath, dude.

1336
01:06:39,140 --> 01:06:40,140
Me too.

1337
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,140
That's all you need to do.

1338
01:06:41,140 --> 01:06:42,140
I would just lay on it like an egg.

1339
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:43,140
Yeah.

1340
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:44,140
