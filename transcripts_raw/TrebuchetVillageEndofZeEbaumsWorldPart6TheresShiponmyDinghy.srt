1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,620
Last time on Trebuchet Village, end of the E-Bomb's world, Raw Dogen and Evil Steevel

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,000
joined the epic Hot Babe pillow fight on Hot Babe Island, while Patrick stayed in his old

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,080
room in the Hot Babe Beehive Palace and started coloring.

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,440
Raw Dogen entered crazy demon mode and became a deaf and blind monster that scared all the

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,700
beautiful women while Stiebel tried to mitigate the situation by almost dying.

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:40,340
Patrick meanwhile was finally no finally met his birth mother and learned the

7
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:46,200
truth about Trunchbull who he thought was a good uncle but was actually a bad

8
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,920
father. Right when she seemed like she was going to tell an even darker truth a

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,200
A rune on her body activated and killed her.

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,600
Patrick was inconsolable.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,880
After consulting with the Queen, they learned of the witch Albert, a hot babe who refuses

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,980
the moniker and lives deep in a cove on the island, but who just may be able to tell the

13
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,600
boys more about this rune.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,880
Evil also harassed a nurse very badly.

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,800
And that's that.

16
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Very badly.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,440
Mm-hmm. I don't think it was that bad. Hmm

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,080
Bruh for you know

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,780
So we're yeah you guys are in the palace

20
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,080
Patrick's mother has passed away death by rune

21
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,320
And I take my sword and I cut my arm oh

22
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,840
How how deeply never mind?

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,760
so and the

24
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,960
the the Queen has addressed you all and has told you about the witch Albert you

25
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,480
could go to her she lives in the cove in the in hot babe Island you can also just

26
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,960
stop investigating this and go back to trying to sail to the end of the world I

27
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:16,480
want to meet this witch I feel like I feel like maybe we can kill her yeah

28
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:25,520
yeah yeah yeah maybe has some cool stuff to take yeah yeah maybe maybe she has a

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,800
wand maybe a staff or wand or cauldron but does she have a she have a tall

30
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:40,040
pointy hat oh does she fly in a broomstick that's a good question

31
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:48,600
confirm or deny these things. Is she green or a warted nose? I don't I don't know.

32
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,200
Does she have... I can't say this. I can't answer this. You can ask you can ask. Does she have buck teeth?

33
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,560
Does she sound a little bit like this? Does she laugh a lot?

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:08,400
Ask the queen. Nah. I'm asking all of this to the queen. Does she have pubes that are greener than her

35
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,240
actual green skin so there's some contrast? I haven't seen her- Like a darker green? I

36
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,980
haven't seen her her pubes in a long time but- So she does have- I don't remember them being green. So she has

37
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:30,540
clothes on. Is her robe dirty or clean? Does she know how to use uh- I don't care

38
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:45,500
anymore I didn't even know what I'm asking does she know Joe Joe who all

39
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:50,100
right let's go find a living a Halloween castle okay we could go no to the

40
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:55,620
Halloween castle that she lives in so Halloween Cove well what you should know

41
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:00,900
is that she lives... Halloween Cove on Hot Babe Island would be choice! Oh my god, so many

42
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,120
cats and nurses. Well her name is Albert so she lives in Albert's Cove she's the

43
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:09,280
only one who lives there. I didn't say that I didn't say that in character voice.

44
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:19,260
Okay, Albert who? She just goes by Albert. She goes by Albert? Albert one.

45
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,460
Interesting name for a hot babe. Albert Finney. Albert your hand with a

46
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:33,140
a match. Albert Einstein. Now Albert Einstein is a guy I used to know. She was one of the

47
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:39,940
fairer babes but she's decided that she didn't want to have anything to do with us and off

48
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,860
she went to the cove. You say fair babe like a bearded lady? Yeah she's got a full beard

49
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,980
right? I don't remember. She's a geek. You see at the fair. Not that I remember. Holy

50
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
I don't I don't fuck with geeks.

51
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,620
She's more of a freak or a geek?

52
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,660
If we mean geek by

53
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:06,900
Circus terms I guess freak then just cuz she uses a she's a freak, but she has all her faculties, you know

54
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Oh, she's and what direction did you think she was?

55
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,500
So she works at the school from freaks and geeks. Okay. She's faculty

56
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:20,740
She's the therapist in this guidance counselor. Oh the one with the long hair. Yeah, who's in that?

57
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,540
I always knew that was a girl because of the long hair.

58
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,140
Yeah, that makes sense.

59
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,540
It makes sense that it's a girl.

60
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,540
What is it a long time?

61
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:32,140
Because he has long hair or she has look.

62
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,240
I don't even know anymore.

63
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,240
Let's go to the Halloween Cove.

64
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,740
So it's she'll tell you how to get there.

65
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,140
So on the woods on the far side of the island is a sharp cliff

66
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,540
that drops off and from below their inland is Albert's Cove.

67
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,620
Okay, so sort of around that cliff and then inland and towards the island.

68
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,060
The best way would be to take your ship around the island from where you've docked.

69
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,500
I have to take a ship.

70
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,500
You have your own?

71
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,480
Yeah, I just shipped my pants.

72
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:10,260
I want a bag of ships.

73
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,100
Around the island towards the cove until the waterway will narrow and then you'll anchor

74
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,460
it and then take your dinghy through the rest of the way.

75
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,460
Yeah, I took a ship on my dinghy.

76
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,460
*laughter*

77
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:25,460
No, your dinghy is on your ship.

78
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,460
That's how I got a dinghy off of your ship.

79
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,460
*laughter*

80
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,460
No, I got ship on my dinghy.

81
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,460
Get that ship off of your dinghy.

82
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
What you must know...

83
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,460
*laughter*

84
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,460
It's already the worst episode we've ever done of TNT, bro.

85
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,460
is that the

86
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,560
the the co so there are women on this island who

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,460
Are not born hot

88
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,320
These are average looking women as we know they become feral

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,920
So oftentimes we try to take care of them

90
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,260
Some of them though they don't want to be taken care of and they

91
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:12,620
They run from us and they end up towards the cove and you should you should

92
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:20,300
Know that they are there and they are dangerous the legacy sorority girl the hot girls childhood best friend

93
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:27,320
The loud girl who could be hot, but she's really loud. So when you try to remember her face, she's always fatter than you think she is

94
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,440
or worst of all

95
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,840
The horse girl whose eyes are too close together

96
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,180
So she sort of looks like the horses she rides and you're thinking why would you pick this as the thing you do?

97
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,620
It's like sort of increasing the association

98
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,500
They're all here though on the island and so you should just be wary of that.

99
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,140
Do they have a bathroom on the island?

100
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,420
Because I gotta take a ship on my dinghy.

101
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,420
Mm-hmm.

102
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,580
You guys like that?

103
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,860
Did you guys like that?

104
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,540
She tuned you out.

105
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,540
What'd you say?

106
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
No, I'm not talking to you.

107
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,180
I'm talking to my boys.

108
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,580
I, you know, I feel like we were so far gone past the ship and dinghy thing that I honestly

109
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,360
tuned that out completely.

110
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,540
Alright that makes sense.

111
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,540
I'm going.

112
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,300
I will give you.

113
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,260
It's gonna be funny again in a little bit.

114
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,260
I do actually believe that.

115
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,260
I think it's already pretty funny.

116
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
I think it's already pretty funny, yeah.

117
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,260
I'm going to give you.

118
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,260
Get that ship off your dingy.

119
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,260
Oh my god.

120
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Patrick your dingy.

121
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,260
It's covered in ship.

122
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,260
Put your dingy.

123
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,260
First of all, I'm not going to put my dingy on the ship.

124
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,260
I'm not going to put my dingy on the ship.

125
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,260
I'm not going to put my dingy on the ship.

126
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,260
I'm not going to put my dingy on the ship.

127
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
I'm not going to put my dingy on the ship.

128
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,260
I'm not going to put my dingy on the ship.

129
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:40,540
Patrick, your dinghy! It's covered in chip!

130
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,340
First of all, put your dinghy away.

131
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,900
Nobody wants to see your dinghy.

132
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,620
Second of all, it's covered in chip!

133
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
Ain't nobody got time for that.

134
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:57,340
The hot babes who've been endlessly tolerant with you all, their eyes are glazing over.

135
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,980
They're just trying to focus.

136
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,260
You see one of their nose starts bleeding as you keep rambling about dinghies and chips.

137
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:12,080
Okay, I would like to go capture these ugly women this very instant. I'm ready

138
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,780
to go to the witch. They're not ugly, they're average. Oh that's, you know what, it's it's

139
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,780
all on a, you gotta, it's a curve on the island. It's like you're trying to keep us in this room. Yeah, stop, just

140
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,460
just don't correct me, but here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna, I'm gonna attack

141
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:33,500
every last one of these ugly women and I will put them all over the dinghy and

142
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,500
and put shit all over them.

143
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:38,100
(laughing)

144
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,060
- Yeah, and I'll do that too.

145
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,660
- Yeah.

146
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,740
So I'm gonna go find them right now

147
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,060
and you will give me a dog that I can give their scent to.

148
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,160
I can give the dog things that ugly women like.

149
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,380
- I can be the dog.

150
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,180
When I was deaf and blind,

151
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,380
my sense of smell got super powered like daredevil

152
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,860
so I'm like a dog now for women.

153
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,380
Okay, here, smell this cammy.

154
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,820
It smells like shit.

155
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,060
(laughing)

156
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,980
Woo!

157
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,540
I'm gonna put it on my dingy.

158
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,780
(laughing)

159
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,940
Yeah.

160
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,780
Yeah.

161
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,740
Okay, now point with your entire--

162
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,860
Now it smells like dingy.

163
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,620
Okay, yeah, so let's, I guess I have to.

164
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,980
So yeah, you guys are sent out of the palace.

165
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,820
Since you won't walk out.

166
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
you're sent out of the palace.

167
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,820
This heat's cooking me.

168
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Woo!

169
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,820
I am so tired.

170
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:41,820
I can't function at all.

171
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,820
It's okay, we're gonna power through this.

172
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,820
My brain is literally only shipping

173
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
patches.

174
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
You need to right the ship, ship diggy.

175
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I've got stuff.

176
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
I've got stuff for you.

177
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
I'll right the ship.

178
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
I think I got it.

179
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
I'm gonna be honest with you.

180
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,140
the I don't remember what we're talking about yeah so which yeah so here's a

181
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:09,260
rune on the room I'll give you a little no there's nothing like that going on

182
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:25,660
there was so the rune on your mother my mom yeah the character yeah when it

183
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:34,580
activated disbelief yeah you were your mom died yeah yeah your mom died and

184
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:44,020
when she died there's one you can't say shippy dinger yeah she said shippy

185
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:56,540
dinger and she said chippy dinger and then she died. And after she died you guys were like well we

186
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:02,980
don't know the actual origins of the rune all that stuff and so the Queen Bee

187
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,100
suggested you could go to see Albert she's the one on the island who might

188
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:10,660
have something to say about that and that's sort of what this is is you trying

189
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:16,420
figure out why did your mom die when she said what she said how can you figure

190
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:22,380
out what happened there do we have the room with us I mean so you can request

191
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,140
that you can try to get either you can make a copy of it or you can do

192
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:34,580
something more and we're gonna draw on my flesh no I'm gonna Patrick yeah so we

193
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,020
both that we agree you didn't know that was your mother right I don't remember

194
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:43,180
Yeah, you didn't know. So you're not exactly attached to the idea of her body

195
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:49,620
being completely intact at this point in time. Look, honestly, I got real into that

196
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,520
ship and dinghy thing. That's all I care about right now. Okay, cool. Can I put, is

197
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,340
there maybe a big blanket in the room that I could just throw over, over

198
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:04,380
Patrick? Um, was there a big blanket in the room? I mean, so some of the guards have

199
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,580
like cloaks that they're okay I'd like to take that off of one of the guards and

200
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,180
throw that over Patrick's head and then I'd like to go and I'm gonna try to cut

201
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:17,460
out the rune from his mom's body okay yeah I mean you start to start to do

202
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,460
that and she's like what are you what are you doing one of the guards what are

203
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:25,220
you doing yeah I have a different voice for her I got ship on my dinghy look at

204
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:31,820
that guy he's he doesn't know what he's yeah he stole your cloak I stole a cloak

205
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:38,140
okay well stop doing okay this is cut it off cut it off from the mom's body yeah

206
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,740
I cut it off yeah dude nice roll roll medicine check actually let's have you

207
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:49,100
roll but I can see how well you cut it off I would say very well but we'll see

208
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:56,380
we'll play your little game through five you've been playing it for years uh-huh

209
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,380
Uh, a five?

210
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:08,300
Yeah, you kind of like cut a little bit through it as you're cutting it off so you can I can I can I accidentally just cut her head off?

211
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,980
Yeah, i'll allow it yeah

212
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:16,940
And where on her body is the rune?

213
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,500
The rune was on her

214
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,340
Neck if I remember correctly, okay, so so either way

215
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,240
I got the rune right?

216
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,680
Yeah, it's kind of mangled.

217
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,960
So I just have her head in my hand? Yeah.

218
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,440
Guys I got the rune! Let's take it to Albert.

219
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,760
Okay, let's go. Alright, it's fine.

220
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:44,560
So you got Patrick's mom's head in your

221
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,040
I guess inventory. You guys get on the ship.

222
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,080
I guess I need to hide that so that Patrick doesn't see it. I don't think he saw it.

223
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,800
I have my hand inside it.

224
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
I'm doing it.

225
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,800
I don't give a crap.

226
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,520
I'm doing its mouth like a sock puppet.

227
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
I'm going like...

228
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,560
What are you making her say?

229
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,040
Really don't give a shit at all.

230
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,040
There's shit on the TV.

231
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,360
That's about what I thought it was.

232
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,360
That's what I like.

233
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,440
I like that.

234
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,760
It's so heavy that I don't really want to...

235
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Oh, I'm dead.

236
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,760
Oh, I'm dead.

237
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Yeah.

238
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
I'm doing that to Patrick.

239
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
That's my mom's head.

240
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,920
- That's my mom's head and she died.

241
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,360
- Hey Patrick, check this out.

242
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,800
- I died, my head came off, look at me.

243
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,240
- My mom's head came off and she died.

244
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,480
- And look Patrick, I'm completely making out with her now.

245
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,960
- Yeah, he's making out with her now, look at that.

246
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,300
That's crazy.

247
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,680
That's crazy, that is crazy stuff happening.

248
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,760
- And because the head is kind of heavy,

249
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,540
if I'm just gonna put it in my backpack,

250
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,780
- She's a heavy, she was a, let's be real,

251
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,180
she was a bit of a heavy set, big ass set.

252
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,780
- She was a hot babe.

253
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,820
- She had a big head, okay.

254
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,220
- Yeah, she was a hot babe.

255
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,660
- If she was Patrick's mom, she had a big head.

256
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,860
So I'm gonna take the head and it's a little heavy.

257
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,700
So instead of just carrying it--

258
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:03,020
- We're playing a fantasy game, you didn't have to say that.

259
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,460
- I'm gonna throw, just every couple of--

260
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:06,900
- It's a complete fantasy game,

261
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,460
you did not have to say that at all.

262
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:12,020
- Every 20 feet or so, I'm just gonna throw it ahead of us

263
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,660
to just, so I don't have to carry it

264
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,500
and then just keep picking it up.

265
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,340
- I'm running to catch it.

266
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,380
And maybe as it hits the ground,

267
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,580
it's like picking up leaves.

268
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,820
- Yeah, roll athletics.

269
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,540
- There's pine cones getting stuck in her head and stuff.

270
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,380
- Both of you roll athletics.

271
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,420
- I'm instinctively trying to fetch it

272
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,540
because I'm a dog now for winning.

273
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,820
- I got an eight.

274
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,700
- You roll two.

275
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,580
- Dogen, raw Dogen.

276
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,660
- What am I rolling?

277
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,700
- Athletics.

278
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,180
- So an eight, it's a pretty bad toss.

279
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,020
It's kind of low.

280
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:43,140
It's kind of like when you're playing catch with somebody

281
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,600
and they kind of throw it like.

282
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,600
I got a nine.

283
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,480
Around your like gut and you're like, "Oh, okay, I guess I'll have to catch it there."

284
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
A nine?

285
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
Okay.

286
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,360
Yeah, he just kind of like, you overshoot it and he just throws the head at like the

287
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,720
back of your like calves as you're running.

288
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,720
It's like it's caught.

289
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,720
Ow.

290
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,240
Yeah, he's holding his arms close to his body like he's about to catch like a perfect football

291
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,240
throw.

292
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,240
Yeah, yeah.

293
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,720
And I do spiral the head, by the way.

294
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Yeah.

295
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
Awesome.

296
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
That's awesome.

297
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
That's awesome.

298
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
And you end up on the ship.

299
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
And you guys take the ship around

300
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720
Hape Bay Island. It takes a little bit of time.

301
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
It's not like an insignificant island.

302
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
You know, it takes a few...

303
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
It takes probably like an hour to get around.

304
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
I spent the hour

305
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,720
building

306
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,720
a new body for

307
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
Patrick's mom out of mud.

308
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
[Laughter]

309
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
You see some of your

310
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
rubbers coming and you're like commanding

311
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,720
them to help you build the...

312
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Didn't we leave them in our sex factory?

313
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Did you leave all of them in the sex factory?

314
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
I thought that was the whole thing.

315
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
While he's doing that, I...

316
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
I cut off a rubber's head and I put my mom's head on it.

317
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
No, you don't kill one of the rubbers, man.

318
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Why?

319
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
We need them for our sex sperm woman factory.

320
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
Because we're sperming, we're using them for sperm.

321
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Our women in spermulators.

322
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,720
I'm turning a rubber into a woman.

323
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm turning a rubber into a woman.

324
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
I'm turning a rubber into a woman.

325
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,140
I'm turning a rubber into my mom. That's not they're both

326
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:18,080
Made a perfectly good. Yeah, mom. Yeah

327
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,020
All right. I guess I have a mud mom now

328
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,080
But she can't talk unless I stick my hand in her mouth

329
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,800
It's cool, they got like a mud

330
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,780
Mom, you got solvent toilet. You need to sort of populate your whole

331
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,200
World you're right. You're right. That's a really good point patches. We start using her head as the toilet instead

332
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,220
Let's just consolidate it all yeah

333
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,800
Yeah, I don't want it. We don't need a mutt. We don't have room for a mud statue. There's already too many

334
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,800
We need another toilet. There's

335
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:56,080
Are you gonna use the rune then or no? Yeah, we're bringing a bomb with us. Yeah

336
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Okay, bring it all the mud bomb comes wherever we go. I guess we don't want shit in her when we

337
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,200
we'll wait until yeah we'll wait until after but yeah so we're just so I guess

338
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,400
we'll just hold her head with the mud body on it yeah with a it's a more of a

339
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,040
mud case it's a mud mom yeah mom body it's like a pillar for a bust yeah it's

340
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:22,520
like a moth full bomb bomb body would be a with big front and back yeah gathered

341
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,880
around the crew to try to explain what you're doing.

342
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,720
- Yeah.

343
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,560
- They're all like standing there.

344
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,400
- I need no mind, this is, this is,

345
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,220
- Looking on.

346
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,060
- This woman's not alive.

347
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,900
- This woman's not alive.

348
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,720
- Okay.

349
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,560
- It's a mud mom body.

350
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,400
- Okay.

351
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,600
- A mud body, a mud back and mud front.

352
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,360
And I assure you, she's not feeling any pain right now.

353
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,560
- Where'd you get her head from then?

354
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,800
- We don't really remember.

355
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,760
- All right, that's no problem then.

356
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:49,800
But where'd you get the mud from then?

357
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,680
- The ground.

358
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
That's really none of your business.

359
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Sorry, sorry, Captain.

360
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
My apologies. Mom, me, my apologies.

361
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,680
Plank. Plank.

362
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,680
Oh, no. Not the plank.

363
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
I see one other. A bigger crew member

364
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,680
takes out a plank.

365
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,680
I'm making a new plank.

366
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,680
I take a picture with my

367
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,680
iPhone. Oh, this is so

368
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,680
humiliating.

369
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
You like it. It's the new trend.

370
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
I don't like it.

371
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,680
Because this world is so old, it takes place

372
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:24,620
so long ago the plank was still viral yep holy shit and that's how far back in

373
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,380
time we went I didn't realize that we were so ancient that it was set in a

374
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:34,460
fucking time when the plank was still viral. The plank was still viral. Holy fucking shit are you for real?

375
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:41,220
you're not just kidding right Cam? It was still viral the post planking. The plank? Oh my god so alright so that means

376
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,660
Is the plank viral right now? The plank in this world it's so far back in time

377
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,500
that planking is still viral to do.

378
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,580
- Oh my God!

379
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,980
- That's really fucking crazy.

380
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,740
- And Gangnam Style just cracked 1,000 views.

381
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,140
- Whoa.

382
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,740
- It's over a billion now, how's that fucking possible?

383
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,940
- It's 'cause it's so far back

384
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,520
that even planking took off.

385
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,980
- All right, if we're gonna exist

386
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,020
in this weird, fucked up, old ass world,

387
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,060
then let's just continue on with it.

388
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,940
- I guess so, if this is how it's gonna have to be.

389
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,780
- Yeah.

390
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,600
- All right, we're at the, we got--

391
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,800
- You get to the cove.

392
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,520
And you guys get to the cove, and it is like,

393
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:20,400
much like everything else on Hot Bay Bayon,

394
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,240
it's beautiful.

395
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,720
Like it just sort of is immediately like arresting visually,

396
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,760
has this like, kind of beautiful dark rock

397
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,080
that makes up the cove,

398
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,920
with like sort of a, you know,

399
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,600
crag, craggy sort of sidling that you can walk along,

400
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,120
and this sort of like, you're rushing waves

401
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,520
that are like colliding in the center of it.

402
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
but is getting narrower now and see certain for the ship and you have your

403
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,520
dingy

404
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,920
you take your dingy out in the three of you i guess in the mud mom before view

405
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,920

it's it's it's such a good obviously if you're cool

413
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,480
as you're selling through search to get darker

414
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,760

He's taken the entire dinghy.

437
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,740
I'm teasing the tip of the dinghy.

438
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,740
Where is...

439
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,740
It's just the front end of a boat

440
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
with the tip of it just going slightly

441
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:23,740
in your asshole.

442
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,740
Being like, yeah.

443
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,740
Nuh uh. That's all you get.

444
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
I can take it all.

445
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Ladies, if I wanted to...

446
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,740
My feet are in the water.

447
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,340
Yeah, so that's your position.

448
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:37,840
Yeah.

449
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:46,620
Uh, wait, but Pat, when you say "all the way down," where is that in the boat?

450
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,980
Is it like in the front of the boat?

451
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:48,980
The bow?

452
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
The stern?

453
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,640
All the way down.

454
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,640
All the way down.

455
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,640
That should be it.

456
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,660
Where's the mud mom?

457
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,660
She's on my lap.

458
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,660
What?

459
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,660
Bro.

460
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,660
So you're...

461
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
Don't.

462
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,660
You didn't say anything.

463
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,520
So are you getting...

464
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,560
you say you're getting are you like getting like sort of like penetrated by

465
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:17,120
the tip of the boat no I got a little bit yeah a little bit okay and so the mud

466
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,520
mom is like there's a tease yeah how are you guys balancing that so that the boat

467
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,760
doesn't tip over I guess okay then I guess I have the back end of the boat

468
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,960
the big flat part in my ass because I would say weight wise Dogen is the

469
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,680
lightest probably so it's not an issue yeah so then I'm sitting at the back of

470
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,440
it okay okay that's probably fine and I guess yeah Patrick is all the way down

471
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,520
so which is at the back so Dogen I need you to roll dexterity saving throw with

472
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,920
disadvantage because you have a mud mom on your lap and I have a tip in my ting

473
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,640
it doesn't affect your dexterity oh it affects mine you know my legs are shaking

474
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,640
I can't react properly.

475
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
Uh, what do I need to roll?

476
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Dexterity save?

477
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,640
[Groan]

478
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,640
With disadvantage?

479
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,640
Oh yeah, yeah Jerry.

480
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,640
Well that was good.

481
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
Thank you.

482
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,640
I have to get out moments of peace.

483
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,640
Wow, they're both 20.

484
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,640
No shit, really?

485
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,640
Gorgeous.

486
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
I rolled two 19s in a row.

487
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,640
So a, like, a, um,

488
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,760
perfectly average arm reaches out from the rock on the side of you. As you're

489
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:37,580
getting into this cove, the sides of it are sort of narrowing in. You could see

490
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,600
areas where you could walk, but you guys are taking your boat, which is probably

491
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,920
safer. The walking area starts to slope. But from the walls on the side, an arm

492
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,440
reaches out and grabs you, and you're able to pretty deftly dodge it. And you

493
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,640
start to see a sort of a like, not a great haircut, but like she's doing her

494
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:59,140
best pop its head out of the wall and we need you all to roll initiative.

495
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,860
Holy crap. Finally a little bit of fucking action. Yeah we haven't had action for

496
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,080
like I mean pretty much two episodes because the pillow fight kind of became

497
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:16,320
more of a psychological standoff. Yeah. So I got an 18 and then a 22 because it says

498
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:28,460
virtual tabletop not found. I got an 11. 18, 12. You got an 11? Yeah. Charlie Brown reference.

499
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:34,480
I got an 11. He would be pretty, I mean that's a pretty good roll though. I got, well it's

500
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:37,800
really. It's more the phrasing that's the reference rather than. Charlie Brown, he got

501
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:48,780
rock yeah dice is kind of like a rock so the actually the the the the average

502
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:54,720
women go first despite that 18 which is very good just they were 22 when you're

503
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,240
saying average do you can you maybe name like a real-life women woman that like

504
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,320
all four of us know as like a like kind of a jumping-off point but not a

505
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:11,280
of celebrity like someone we personally know? Let me think for a little bit. Let

506
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:20,000
me see like let me look at some of our group chats. Hold on. Yeah. Oh they

507
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:31,760
changed the name of that one. One of the girls in here for sure. Oh that one okay.

508
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,060
Say no more.

509
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,360
Okay, yeah.

510
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,060
Yeah.

511
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,060
So yeah, the woman who reached out to grab you,

512
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,060
she's going to try to swipe again.

513
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:48,060
This time she's trying to reach out with one arm and then her other arm is now

514
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:52,060
like bursting out of the wall and coming out for another swipe.

515
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,060
And it's like a pretty ferocious swipe.

516
00:27:55,060 --> 00:28:00,560
It's like kind of like almost shocking, but she's not able to get you.

517
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,480
you're able to dodge it, even with the mud mom on your lap.

518
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,880
You're able to dodge it.

519
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,440
- I have the brick in my thick.

520
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,080
- And then you, Patrick, you spot

521
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,480
at the peripheral of your eye,

522
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,320
one of the women who burst out of the wall,

523
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,480
and she's holding in her hand two glowing rocks,

524
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,480
that are two glowing rocks,

525
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,120
and she's hurling them at you and going, "Nyah, nyah!"

526
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,800
And she rolls them.

527
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,980
- Two glowing rocks, rocks, dude's rock.

528
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,000
And, uh, oh, she got a natural 20.

529
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,880
Uh, yeah.

530
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,440
Okay.

531
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,520
You take, uh, uh, 15 damage as she hurls this rock square between your,

532
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,000
uh, your eyes, Patrick.

533
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,760
Oh, I don't care anymore.

534
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,680
It's, it's not letting me hold on.

535
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,400
Yeah.

536
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,520
All good.

537
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:54,920
It's all fine.

538
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,400
I'll also take a look.

539
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:07,640
Meanwhile, the last one who is currently fighting you all, who popped down from

540
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:14,600
below the ceiling, and she's falling onto the boat right now. And I think for

541
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,160
cinematic's sake, I'm gonna give you all a chance to sort of use a reaction as

542
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,600
this woman who looks like she like has to splurge at Ambercrombie and

543
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,240
fish is sort of falling onto the boat.

544
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,720
Is there anything you guys want to do?

545
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,200
Are you going to let her sort of like pounce?

546
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,280
She'll probably land on patridge.

547
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,980
There might be things you can do that like you have a reaction for.

548
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,440
So you can dodge, you can definitely like try to like shove her off.

549
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,880
Can I like swing the mud mom by her ankles and like try and hit her out of the way?

550
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,880
I swung my cutlass at Cortez and got a 23.

551
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:57,040
Okay, so you could do either of those things.

552
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,720
I would say that like in this scenario, which is very much me breaking

553
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,280
a bunch of rules, but you can pick one sort of action

554
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,320
that I think like will sort of determine like...

555
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,640
One action for all of us or each of us?

556
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,080
That's a bad idea. I think here's the thing, if each of you do an action, I think like

557
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,600
either, because I'm being very playful right now, you can either each like

558
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,020
pick an action that all works together and then like kind of resolve it together

559
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,180
or if you're all doing like like if you're swinging your cutlass and you're

560
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:29,020
swinging your mud woman we're gonna have to kind of resolve both those things

561
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,220
happening as this person is coming guys hear me out what if we all got on the

562
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:38,580
back of the boat so the pointy and that used to be up Dogen's asshole that he

563
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,420
was teasing with his little asshole if we if we got all on the back of the boat

564
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:47,260
straight up like this and then she landed on the tip and like just yeah just got

565
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,140
like sliced in half by the shark oh my god Dogen was that thing that was in

566
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:59,780
your ass would you describe it as razor-sharp it's covered in ship well

567
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:04,140
that's perfect cuz I think that we might be able to kill this this woman who must

568
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:10,100
be on her period we can kill her with the shippy dinger all right let's do it

569
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:31,660
all right I run to the back of the boat okay so you hear is just coming with you

570
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,180
okay let's do a couple rolls in the resolve this y'all thought I was teasing

571
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:43,660
teasing. I think to make this work, let's have you guys do a

572
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:50,020
let's have a straight decks checks. And then I'm trying to

573
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,540
think Yeah, I think I think athletics really is honestly

574
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,980
what this is. I say either acrobatics or athletics, sort of

575
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,180
make the call of like, sort of maneuvering to the back. And

576
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:05,380
then we're gonna have to figure out a couple other like probably

577
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,700
one or two other checks just for balancing the boat. I think this is like a fun idea.

578
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
So athletics?

579
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,700
We're rolling athletics.

580
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,780
Yeah, all of you guys pick either athletics or acrobatics.

581
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:20,980
Oh, either? Well then I'm choosing acrobatics. Well, never mind, I'm choosing my athletics.

582
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,100
I got a 10 on both so it doesn't matter.

583
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,100
I got a 19.

584
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Okay, and you, Patrick?

585
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,100
22.

586
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:33,420
Okay, Caleb, you're fine, or sorry, evil I should really be saying. You're already in

587
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,220
the back of the boat, so it's sort of like-

588
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,020
Yeah, I didn't know who you were talking about at first.

589
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:41,180
I should say that because that's, I think, I feel that's proper etiquette.

590
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,180
I agree.

591
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,180
I agree.

592
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,180
Oh, heavens.

593
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,060
You two, very nice rolls.

594
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:50,020
You're able to make, to maneuver to the back.

595
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:56,340
Now, and this is, I want you to both roll, all three of you to roll.

596
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,140
I would say, oh, this is fun.

597
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,060
I kind of want to do like, I think if this is, I think this is just straight, no, this

598
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,400
is either athletics or acrobatics again just to make sure you're balancing

599
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,260
correctly so you all made it to the back pretty quickly while this thing is this

600
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,760
thing is like popped its head out falling down you immediately all new to like

601
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,320
strategize and go to the back but to balance the boat I think correctly all of

602
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,000
you should roll acrobats and athletics again okay acrobatics or athletics or

603
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:32,720
both again or or just about you know knowing your I got a weight okay 16 okay

604
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,720
Patrick?

605
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,720
Patrick?

606
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,720
Hey Pat.

607
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,720
Patrick?

608
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Eighteen.

609
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,720
Eighteen?

610
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,720
Okay.

611
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,720
Very helpful to offset that eight.

612
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,720
Pretty good.

613
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Yeah, I would say you're like, this woman is falling down and as she is, you can hear the

614
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,720
tip of the boat, like, because you guys can barely even like see it.

615
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,720
You kind of just all like, it's actually new just from fighting together for all these years.

616
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,720
So just like sort of like, you know, you can hear the tip of the boat.

617
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
You can barely even like see it.

618
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,720
You kind of just all like, it's actually new just from fighting together for all these years.

619
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,720
So just like sort of like, you know, you can hear the tip of the boat.

620
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,720
You can barely even like, you can barely even like, you can barely even like, you can barely

621
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:54,720
and as she is, you can hear the tip of the boat,

622
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,280
like, 'cause you guys can barely even see it,

623
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,800
you kinda just all, it's actually new,

624
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,960
just from fighting together for all these years,

625
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:06,000
to just like, sort of, for these six months, really,

626
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
in game, but you guys have been fighting together

627
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
a while, pretty closely, to just go like,

628
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,980
oh, let's fuck her up, and you guys run to the back

629
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,280
of the boat, sort of like, adjust your weight,

630
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,400
and boom, boom, and this just gets the small of her back

631
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,920
she's falling like here and she just like knocks her fucking she smashes her

632
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,600
head like on the front of the boat as the boat sort of like gets back down and

633
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:34,600
she's she's not looking good she's still alive what the dinghy went right I don't

634
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,840
think that it I don't know if that impales her in a pair impaled Ogins

635
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:48,240
fucking get it little man okay if it injured her at all she's gonna

636
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,600
get like sepsis or something cuz there's there's shit all over that yeah I start

637
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:59,800
tapping my wrist and now we wait I couldn't give you I couldn't give you a

638
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,600
full a full impaling based on the rolls but you did very well she's not it must

639
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,160
be so hard to DM us because we're so fucking like creative and it come up

640
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,600
with ideas like no other person has ever come up with and in Dungeons & Dragons

641
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,680
history. Basically, but also though you don't argue with anything I say when it

642
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,840
comes to rules so it's easier because I'd have people going well actually

643
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,360
that's not how you would do that move. Oh. So it's be like hmm it's both easier and

644
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:38,000
harder. I'm gonna start doing that. Please. Yeah I'm gonna learn. Stay tuned. I'm gonna do it. I don't have to worry. I'm gonna finally learn the first thing about D&D. I don't have to worry about that. But now it is

645
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,840
actually who got the 18? Patrick you did. It's your turn. Okay. So you have one of them

646
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:48,220
coming out of the side well I got that 22 with the cutlass of Cortez do I have to

647
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:52,280
roll again no you said you got oh yes you do have to roll why'd you say that

648
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,160
like such a bitch I got the 22 with the cutlass of Cortez.

649
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,160
I got a 21.

650
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,160
Wow.

651
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:11,280
My cutlass is a Cortez.

652
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,600
And I got 9 damage.

653
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,400
Okay, who are you attacking?

654
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
So uh.

655
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Whoever.

656
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,400
I'm attacking everybody.

657
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,400
Oh my god.

658
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,160
What about the lady who we impaled?

659
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,360
Will she live if we don't attack her?

660
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,120
You get 9 damage.

661
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,440
able to then slide nine damage for a total damage of 27 no that's what it

662
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,760
says right here so this is 10 plus a long because my slashing damage is 10 I have

663
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,640
to slashing damage I'm I what have I done it says slashing my hand slashing

664
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:55,200
damage eight and then well there's a sneak attack roll here but I don't think

665
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
that I got a sneak attack. - Oh yeah.

666
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,820
Ooh, do you have a sneak attack here?

667
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,380
- We're flanking them. - How do I know?

668
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,560
- The mud bomb is flanking them.

669
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,000
- I don't think you're flanking.

670
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,840
- The mud bomb is flanking them.

671
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,680
- All right, I guess we'll just take away the--

672
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,100
- The mud bomb just stayed in the bow of the boat.

673
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,280
- Yeah. - So you're flanking her.

674
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,540
The sneak attack rules, I always like,

675
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,660
they're very annoying.

676
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,200
You don't have advantage. - I don't know how

677
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,920
I got a sneak attack though. - Oh, you know what though?

678
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,840
You are within, yes.

679
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,120
That has a hostile creature within 5 feet of it.

680
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,360
But you're thinking, "An enemy has a hostile creature within 5 feet of it."

681
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,320
And it does, because you're all within 5 feet of her.

682
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,840
That's true.

683
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,280
So it's not quite flanking, but it is, um...

684
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,320
Yeah, you do get sneak attack also.

685
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,280
Okay, so...

686
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,120
God, I figure how easy it is to get sneak attack.

687
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,760
Um...

688
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,440
So I got a 27 damage.

689
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,200
No, hold on.

690
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,560
That's what it says.

691
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,800
You might be right, I'm just, um...

692
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,000
You may be crazy.

693
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,040
Might just be a lunatic I'm looking for.

694
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,040
I just want to read.

695
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,400
Okay, that's 1d6, 5+5, right you got 5 on that I forgot.

696
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,960
Because it gave you the bonus.

697
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,920
Because you have the charisma of a conquistador.

698
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,920
And 3d6.

699
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,680
And another 2d6.

700
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Who is that?

701
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,720
What is the origin of that?

702
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,720
2d6?

703
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,920
That sounds like sneak attack to me.

704
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,760
Well it is, but there's like an additional 2d6 I'm trying to...

705
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:23,760
Double sneak attack.

706
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,760
No, it's not.

707
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,320
You can't just say stuff.

708
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,000
Only I can do that.

709
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,240
It's a double sneak attack.

710
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,240
I mean, you know what?

711
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,920
If it's resolving that, I'll look up the origins later or somebody will correct me and DM me.

712
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,920
Oh my god.

713
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
What is that?

714
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,920
27 damage?

715
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
I'll have to figure that out.

716
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,560
I'm going to have to figure that out later.

717
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:54,560
I mean, describe your kill, obviously, on this sort of firm 6 out of 10 type of broad.

718
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,560
Well...

719
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,120
A 6 out of 10 New York.

720
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:01,960
I cut her head off and then I put it on the mud mom's body.

721
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,980
Whoa, what do you do with mud mom's head?

722
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
You chillock it.

723
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:07,980
It's two-headed.

724
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,240
Oh my god, a two-headed mud mom.

725
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,500
- Oh my god. - We got a two-headed mud mom.

726
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,880
- And I turn to the other guys.

727
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,060
- We got a two-headed mud mom.

728
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,480
- I turn to the other guys and I say,

729
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,920
yeah, just aim for their heads

730
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,200
and then we're just gonna keep putting them

731
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,920
on top of the mud mom's body.

732
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,360
- Mud mom totem pole.

733
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,320
- Mud mom. - Mud mom.

734
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,240
- Totem pole. - Mud mom.

735
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,240
- Mud mom, totem pole.

736
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,360
- This is great.

737
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,160
So it is now,

738
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,840
who got the 12 again?

739
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,920
- Cha-cha-cha-cha.

740
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:48,240
I talk like that sometimes. I think I got the initiative roll. An 11 or something. I think

741
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,200
it was... Okay, so it's you. Me? What did you get Caleb? I don't remember. I think I got

742
00:39:54,200 --> 00:40:00,600
the 12. I think you got the 12. So wait, did you kill the... So is the one who hit the

743
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,680
tip of the dinghy, they're dead right? The ship tip. The ship who shipped all over the

744
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,200
- The dinghy, there's a shippy tip.

745
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,040
- Yeah, she already took--

746
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,440
- The shippy dinghy tip.

747
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,280
- Which one's closest to me?

748
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,480
- She already took a significant amount of damage

749
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,760
when you killed her.

750
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,600
- Okay.

751
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,480
- So the one that's closest to you is,

752
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,280
the one that's flinging rocks at you,

753
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,720
I mean, she's all the way up there.

754
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,680
Like, you gotta do ranged attacks on her.

755
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,240
There's one that is within reach

756
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,760
and is like grabbing at you.

757
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,080
That one, you can try to take her out.

758
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:32,000
- Hmm, interesting.

759
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,920
Okay, so maybe I will use...

760
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:37,080
(whining)

761
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:42,900
Maybe I will use Guiding Bolt.

762
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:46,840
- Okay, but aim for the head.

763
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,680
- Oh yeah, I guess I need to cut her head off.

764
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,000
- But not the brain.

765
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,380
- Wait, hmm.

766
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,640
- What kind of-- - Get it at her neck.

767
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,720
- Can I-- - Her head is quite strong.

768
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,440
Do you wanna aim for a specific body part?

769
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,180
- Yeah, can I aim for her fucking neck right now?

770
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:11,220
You don't mind. I'm gonna see if I feel like there's something either buried in the yes

771
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:14,260
Yeah in the Dungeon Master guide about

772
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:17,500
body parts and if not

773
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,340
Yeah, I don't think there is. All right

774
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,780
Okay, cool

775
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:25,900
You can definitely aim for the neck what we'll do

776
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,660
Trying to think of what we'll do

777
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,260
Has a hundred and twenty foot range on that one

778
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,140
Yeah

779
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:41,420
You'll roll for an attack roll and then we'll roll a we'll just roll a

780
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,520
D20 again just to see if you're able to approach the head

781
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,780
and

782
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:53,340
We'll I'll average it out from there. I'll come up with a better system for body part attacking

783
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,020
I feel like somebody has one out there. So yeah roll an attack roll just on the guiding bull

784
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,600
So I click cast on God and Volt, right?

785
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Yep.

786
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:05,100
Nothing happens on my screen when I do that.

787
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,780
That's so strange.

788
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:11,620
Except it takes one of my spell slots, that's it.

789
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,620
You should be able to press on the damage.

790
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,500
Oh, I think it thinks you're dead.

791
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,820
Why would I be fucking dead?

792
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,500
You might have played so damn badly.

793
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
No.

794
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,780
It's just not true, so...

795
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,580
Let me just make you back to life.

796
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,580
Alright.

797
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,740
I'm gonna take my spell slot back then.

798
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,700
I think that my neighbor got a bird.

799
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,820
What kind of bird?

800
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,140
One that goes "wow wow wow wow wow".

801
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,460
That's just a sparrow.

802
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,980
I think it actually might be a sparrow.

803
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,780
I think I might have a pirate in my fucking building.

804
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,780
A sparrow.

805
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,700
My God, my neighbor's pet sparrow is so loud.

806
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:02,780
I'm sick of all the sparrows in my neighborhood.

807
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,340
Am I alive again?

808
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,520
Yeah.

809
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,300
Just click on the damage thing.

810
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,220
But that, I have to hit if I do that.

811
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,340
I have to hit before I go.

812
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:13,580
So hit the plus four, oh no, not the plus four.

813
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,020
Yeah, plus four and guiding bolt.

814
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
Oh, there we go.

815
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,020
Okay, so I got a 20.

816
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

817
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:19,460
Beautiful, that hits for sure.

818
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:24,120
All right, and now I'm gonna roll for damage and I got a 22 with my damage nice

819
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:30,100
You're aiming which one again the the one that was throwing rocks at me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so you you

820
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,700
Sling your guiding bolt at her and it like

821
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:41,800
Roll another d20 just do a nice. You just do that. That's the only thing that this doesn't is this doesn't does

822
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:46,340
19 nice. Yeah, you got it fucking right on the neck. Oh

823
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,860
you get her neck and

824
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,180
You start to see tearing there

825
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:58,920
Starting to show and is there blood just fucking everywhere. Of course. Oh my fucking god

826
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,640
Yeah, there's blood and guts everywhere

827
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,580
Yes

828
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,260
Just gushing

829
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,900
From her neck. She's still alive, but she's not looking too

830
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,700
She's hot nor was she ever

831
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:14,820
And you're up

832
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,860
Dogen, Rod Dogen, me.

833
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:18,860
Okay.

834
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,860
Um...

835
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,860
What's...

836
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,860
Is there one close to me that I can just swing at the neck?

837
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,860
Yes.

838
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:25,860
I'm just gonna go ahead and swing at the neck real quick.

839
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,860
Yes, just the one I was reaching out at you before.

840
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:28,860
Yes.

841
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,860
With my war oar?

842
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,860
Go for it.

843
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:32,360
I'm not gonna do anything fancy with it.

844
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:33,360
Let's see here.

845
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Mm-hmm.

846
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,860
My attack is a 14.

847
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:37,860
Okay.

848
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:43,860
If it does not hit, she's able to sort of swiftly dodge out of the way of it.

849
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:44,860
Okay.

850
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:51,860
for you. Okay. Okay. No bonus actions. I don't think you have anything really worth doing.

851
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:58,740
No. Yeah. And I'm not going to do anything. I'm just going to chill. Meeep! Okay. No.

852
00:44:58,740 --> 00:45:07,660
It's their turn. So the woman you just swung at, she's going to pop back inside the wall.

853
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:13,180
And so she's gone from inside, she went back inside the wall. The other one who you like,

854
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:14,460
who, Steve-o, you like-

855
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,660
A wall woman?

856
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,420
seared her neck

857
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,480
um

858
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,840
she's gonna, uh, take her-

859
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,640
she's gonna reach back inside the wall, both her arms

860
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,500
and just sort of

861
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:24,880
*weird noise*

862
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,260
and yank out a giant fucking rock

863
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:28,900
and toss it directly at your-

864
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,940
PUT THAT BACK!

865
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,120
um

866
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:33,260
so I need all of you to roll a

867
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,840
uh, dexterity saving throw

868
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:35,340
ok

869
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:35,840
this one

870
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,340
ok

871
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,840
I got a-

872
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:39,700
you're gonna roll something like that?

873
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,040
I got a six

874
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,820
which is

875
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:48,660
I think it's out of six or seven. Mega yikes, dude. I got a 13. Okay.

876
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:51,620
Patridge.

877
00:45:51,620 --> 00:46:06,020
Seven. So the rock fucking crashes onto the the uh the dinghy and um uh it traps your leg,

878
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:13,660
Stievel and your arm Patridge. Both of you take... Traps it in a good way?

879
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:22,500
Both of you take 11 damage. Fuck. Dogen you're gonna take half damage. I'm at 1 HP.

880
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:33,140
Yeah. It's half of 11 so 5.5. No no no no you take you take you take 6. I'm gonna go

881
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,180
ahead and take five thanks mmm yeah thanks for your input but yeah I'm gonna

882
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:42,860
go ahead with 5.5 probably gonna take oh everyone says it rounds down and I don't

883
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,940
believe in that I think you should always round up that creates more tension yeah

884
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:53,420
I'm gonna go ahead I just took 5.5 I'm fine you can take five damage do you know

885
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:58,460
that's the wrong number do you know where to find your health top right

886
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:05,980
corner. Oh yeah okay so it it thought that I was at zero HP the entire time so what

887
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:10,260
should I be at? Should I just be at max HP?

888
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:17,220
From your max HP is 35 so you took 11 so you should be at 24. Yeah okay so now

889
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:23,380
yeah but in D&D Beyond I was for some reason I was at zero HP so now I'm at 24

890
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,380
Okay, I'm ready to go.

891
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:27,380
Alright, fine. I like rounding.

892
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:29,380
I'm back.

893
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:31,380
Plus he's at Wizards of the Coast.

894
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,380
Who I love, also.

895
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:35,380
And I love Hasbro.

896
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,380
I already rounded up. You can drop it.

897
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:39,380
Drop it!

898
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:41,380
Drop it.

899
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,380
Change the subject.

900
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:45,380
Drop it.

901
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,380
Ummm...

902
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,380
And the other...

903
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:51,380
Yeah, she missed already, right?

904
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:57,220
other one? No, she went in the hole. Yes, oh yeah, that's gonna be fun. Your turn,

905
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,220
Patrick.

906
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:09,260
Who am I close to? Right now... Do I have like potions that I can take to heal

907
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:16,940
myself? I don't know if you have healing abilities. Your friends, you, I think

908
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:23,580
Stevel should have a cure wounds spell maybe okay then I'm gonna take my sword

909
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:29,460
and just hit anyone in my vicinity so before you do that the only people in

910
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,580
your vicinity are your friends and your mud mother okay please don't hit me bro

911
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:41,140
do you have other abilities you have a gun too by the way I have a gun yes okay

912
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:50,340
then I will shoot my gun. You can shoot it at the one who's who's far away. Yeah. Okay

913
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:58,660
roll d20. I had a whole gun system but I'm abandoning it right now. All right.

914
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,660
I just don't want to deal with that.

915
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:12,580
I mean it's seven. So yeah that that way. So you shoot your gun. 20 plus anything? I mean it's

916
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:17,180
gonna be adding your your dex and your proficiency which is which is plus five

917
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:22,540
which is still not enough. Okay. So you shoot it and sort of just like clinks off the

918
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:30,220
side of the rock and you're not able to hit her. I mean you have you know you have

919
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:36,380
bonus actions, not really though. I mean I guess you can you can use a eye for

920
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,620
detail. So you can use a bonus action to make a perception check to spot a hidden

921
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,220
creature object. Okay I'm gonna do that. Make an investigation because one of them did just

922
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:56,500
disappear. I just did that. Okay so roll, you rolled perception. Ten. Cool. You don't

923
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:00,380
know exactly where she went but you start to listen and you go to hear kind of

924
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,580
like scurrying along the walls so if somebody else maybe tried listening

925
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:10,260
they'd maybe be able to find where this thing is gonna pop out next

926
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:16,420
next I put my gun in my mouth and I say

927
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:40,160
I roll intimidation 10 that's not enough all right and we're gonna go to Steve

928
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:53,800
it's your turn. Alright, um, hmm. I'm gonna cast a level fucking nothing chill touch

929
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,480
I think, because she's pretty much dead right? That the bitch all the way over on

930
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,720
the other end. Make sure to get her head though. Yeah, so don't worry I got an idea

931
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:09,500
here. She's pretty close yeah? Yeah, she's not doing the hottest of all time. Alright, well

932
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:11,260
she was never the hottest of all time right?

933
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,300
You used to have a shit head, come on.

934
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,140
All right, so I'm gonna roll chill touch.

935
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:16,220
- Maybe the hottest dog of all time.

936
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,980
- All right, I got it.

937
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,420
- Canine creature.

938
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,820
- Yeah, you're the hottest of all time.

939
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,140
Yeah, the hottest dog of all time.

940
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:22,980
That's pretty good.

941
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:23,820
- Yeah, I am.

942
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,640
- I'm gonna have to remember that, write that down.

943
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,480
- I got an eight.

944
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:28,100
- On your attack?

945
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,700
- On my attack, is that considered good?

946
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:31,700
- No way that's that hit.

947
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:33,220
- Okay, down a notch.

948
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,460
All right, no, no.

949
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,460
- It's not either.

950
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:38,300
- I got an eight.

951
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,140
- You're out, Dogen.

960
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,360
I'm just, I'll shoot my gun. I roll a d20.

961
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:09,840
You're...

962
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,900
Okay.

And add what?

964
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,440
Add your dex plus your proficiency for you.

965
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,460
Okay, I don't know what that is.

966
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,120
So your dex is...

967
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:23,320
My dex is one. Okay, then that's a... Your proficiency is two.

968
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,800
So that's supposed to be...

969
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,880
Oh, where did it go? Oh my god. I think it's a thirteen.

970
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,760
You should be able to see it.

971
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,760
I can't find it.

972
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,760
No, it'll be a 15.

973
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,760
That hits.

974
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:34,760
Oh, okay.

975
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:35,760
Yeah.

976
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,760
Okay, a 15.

977
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,320
Then what do I roll?

978
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:39,920
That's not so bad, bro.

979
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:42,760
Now roll 1d10.

980
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,160
Okay.

981
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,160
That is a 3.

982
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,320
Okay, plus 3.

983
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,640
Alright, so you shoot her...

984
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:52,640
In the neck.

985
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,600
In the neck also.

986
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,600
Adding to the gushing blood, but it doesn't quite kill her.

987
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,920
uh... he's shooting her neck

988
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,960
he's like please stop

989
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,240
pretty impressive

990
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,680

991
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,840

999
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,400
I'm not making any more rolls for the rest of the game.

1000
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,760
I got a five.

1001
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,760
Okay.

1002
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,760
Um...

1003
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:38,480
Two cold, bony hands grab your shoulders.

1004
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,480
Roll a strength check.

1005
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
Oh, fuck.

1006
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,480
Um...

00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,480
Seven.

1008
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:48,480
I got a seven.

1009
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,800
You are dragged towards the wall, off the boat.

1010
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,200
God damn it, bro.

1011
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,200
*Steve laughs*

1012
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,200
As you hear *laughs*

1013
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,200
Oh my god she does laugh like that!

1014
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,200
As a woman drags you off the boat.

1015
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,200
It's not necessarily the witch.

1016
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,200
I think it might be necessarily the witch!

1017
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,200
*laughs*

1018
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:10,200
And the other one who's looking really bad with her neck.

1019
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:12,200
She takes out a rock and she's throwing it at you, Steve-le.

1020
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,200
And she's going to have advantage on the throw because one of the other women is holding him.

1021
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,200
Holding you. Him.

1022
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,200
You.

1023
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,200
You.

1024
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,200
You.

1025
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:37,140
holding you him you so let me roll for that excuse me pardon me yeah pardon you

1026
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,900
is right hey there ain't gonna be a pardon for you you're going straight to

1027
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:49,020
jail she throws two rocks at you and somehow even with a disadvantage I mean

1028
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:51,820
even with you, even with her having advantage on it,

1029
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:55,800
she misses all four, just like somehow,

1030
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,540
just like whiffing it, like probably her neck

1031
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:04,980
hanging barely on her head, her body rather,

1032
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:08,060
just sort of fucking with her aim.

1033
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:12,740
And then you are gonna be up now, Patrick.

1034
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:15,220
Steve-O right now is being held back,

1035
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,940
not too far from where you guys were,

1036
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:24,100
all within the same, it's all within six seconds but he is now being held against

1037
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:32,000
his will by a average-looking woman. I rolled my my d20 on my gun and it was a

1038
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,260
13. Okay so we're gonna add your deck. That hits! With your decks that hits. Who are

1039
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:48,640
you aiming at? Stevel. You're aiming at Stivel. Why me man? No I'm aiming at whoever is holding

1040
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:56,580
nice okay roll for the shot roll roll roll 2d6 that was close guys I almost died

1041
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:06,800

1042
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:12,940
shoot at her at her and she lets go Steve will see well you're now sort of

1043
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:21,320
wading in this, wading in the water, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, with your armor on.

1044
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,960
So you're probably having a little bit of trouble swimming.

1045
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,100
Um, uh, you are now up the Stevel.

1046
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,760
Um, I mean, you can use your turn to just get back on the boat.

1047
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,400
That's probably what you'll have or, or you can just hang out.

1048
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:34,600
In the water.

1049
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:37,720
I think, I guess I will, I guess I will freeze my foot.

1050
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:38,120
Yeah.

1051
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,700
I'll, I'll swim over to the dinghy.

1052
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,320
Yeah.

1053
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,580
This is moving pretty fast.

1054
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:46,580
So you huff and you puff and you get over to the dinghy.

1055
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:50,300
- Can I flop up onto the dinghy on my back

1056
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:54,060
and then cough and I spit up like a goldfish?

1057
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:57,980
- You spit up a really beautiful, weird looking fish.

1058
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,860
- Okay, and then I, does it look like

1059
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:00,700
it's gonna be worth something?

1060
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:01,960
- Whoa, can I collect it?

1061
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,760
- You spit it up.

1062
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,580
- I wanna collect it from him.

1063
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:07,620
- And when it hits the boat, it sort of dissolves

1064
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:14,020
splinters into like these weird like fragments of color and goes back into

1065
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:22,620
the water it's very strange that was quite strange you're up to again okay is

1071
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:04,560

00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:16,280
to the boat. She's gonna swipe at you, Patrick. And she do... oh. She do hit you.

1091
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:16,320

1102
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,860

1103
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:34,140
average woman yeah but you can try with your ore to dig through the rock to try

1104

1106
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,980
you're able to hear the rustling a little bit with a little bit more

1107
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:56,880
precision at this point. So now we're back to top of the order.

1118
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:33,920

1121
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:56,240
describe your kill I'm just so fucking good us on the head wounds I think if I

1122
01:03:56,240 --> 01:04:00,720
remember correctly it rips their head off it instantly so once the head but

1123
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,760
it's gonna do it with such force that her head just pops off her body and the head

1124
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:09,420
is actually gonna do three or four somersaults in the air on the way to the

1125
01:04:09,420 --> 01:04:14,340
mud mom sit directly on top and now we got a fucking quattro mud mommy.

1126
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:19,400
Quattro mud mommy. Yeah. Okay. And then I just start poking all it just put

1127
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,260
my hand in every single one of their mouths just back and forth like I'm like

1128
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,340
I'm playing some kind of instrument. That is awesome. Yeah. Yeah you guys won that

1129
01:04:27,340 --> 01:04:34,940
fight and I'm gonna tie all their tongues together okay at one they're

1130
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:39,700
kissing and I actually like time my tongue in well I do it on purpose but I

1131
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:46,900
pretend it was an accident so after you guys defeated the the uggo ass women or

1132
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:55,460
sorry average you once you've made it past the gauntlet you see a faint sort of

1133
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:59,720
things start to go like really black. Before it was already pretty dim and

1134
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:04,160
hard to see but now that you're much further in it's kind of like that inky

1135
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:11,200
darkness. You see a faint prismatic glow in the immediate distance, sort of like a

1136
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,820
pulsing light and then another and then another. Varying shades and hues and a

1137
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:21,920
sort of like a nascent constellation of dolapolescence and it fixes like a

1138
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:27,360
pockmarked glints to the expanding sea of blackness. So you start to see this kind

1139
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:31,080
of like almost like it's like almost musical the way it looks and then you

1140
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:35,680
look up you see these winding fissures in the rock which were imperceptible until

1141
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,240
now and they cut through with like a glow and that's like sort of the origin of

1142
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:48,080
this light and it's giving shape to your journey. It's giving shape sis. You can see

1143
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:54,440
murky shimmering shapes that rise in concert with the stream and meet the air

1144
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,320
and they flicker fly and spill back into the sea these are the fish that you were

1145
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:04,760
in your mouth earlier. Steeble. And when they hit the surface they leave trails

1146
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,200
of sort of squirming weird color create little sort of gossamer puddles.

1147
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:14,400
I'm gonna leave you squirming. It's giving puddles. These filmy things atop the surface of the water.

1148
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:20,960
and then there's this sort of a rolling light that is forming from all these

1149
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,920
different sources of light that are kind of these bizarre sort of like spectacles of

1150
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:30,960
light and the interstice, like these cracks, are growing larger and

1151
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,440
larger and the light is brighter and brighter. And from deep below this fish

1152
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:39,720
in the sea you start to see vegetation as well that's like pulsing and shimmying

1153
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:44,760
and pushing smoke and heat. It starts to feel kind of like Primordial where you're going

1154
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:49,920
into. It's not quite the same kind of like regular cove now. There's something magical

1155
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,360
and a weird low rumbling too. And then you start to hear a chittering sound too. So we're

1156
01:06:54,360 --> 01:07:00,800
hearing the sort of grumbles of average women. Now you're starting to hear these sort of

1157
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:04,440
chittering on the lengthening side wing. It's flanking your vessel, right? So it seems more

1158
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:08,240
like a walkway on the side of you is forming.

1159
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,440
And as it reaches its peak, you can make out three glowing eyes.

1160
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,560
Like, one for one eye, one for another eye, one on the forehead.

1161
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:21,280
And you start to see like a snout pop out from that, and a reptilian frame and a poodle

1162
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,280
tail.

1163
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:25,360
And then this creature sort of like squeaks at you and squeezes in between the glowing

1164
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:28,860
cracks.

1165
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:33,560
As the crevices themselves now start to resemble more like latticework, it's more intentional

1166
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,640
in their design, they're not just cracks through.

1167
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:37,240
Somebody made this happen,

1168
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:39,520
somebody carved this whole sort of scenery.

1169
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:44,760
You start to see within sort of that darkness

1170
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:49,760
a small opening and this sort of like painterly,

1171
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,480
striking scene of like a large cavern before you, right?

1172
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,520
Sort of this like perfect symmetrical shot, right?

1173
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,760
And you see a woman sitting there

1174
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,720
and she's one of the most,

1175
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,720
if not the most beautiful woman you've seen so far.

1176
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:10,720
And she's sitting on a porch that's sort of fungal in shape.

1177
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:20,720
And on top of a domicile, like a part of a domicile that's made of stone and metal and some sort of organic matter meshed together.

1178
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,720
And her head whips towards you before you can even really register her frame.

1179
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:30,920
And a grim smile sort of cuts through her face, her aquiline face.

1180
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,920
And this is Albert.

1181
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,520
And as you approach the cavern, I'll describe that next time.

1182
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,120
Lesbian.

1183
01:08:36,120 --> 01:08:39,420
What did you just say?

1184
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:41,420
I called her a lesbian.

1185
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:46,320
Okay, we need to see her head on the mud, mom.

1186
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:50,720
I need to see her.

1187
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,720
She's the piece de resistance.

1188
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:53,220
Yeah.

1189
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:57,920
Okay, everybody can stop recording.

1190
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:04,920
Must be the season of the rich Must be the season of the rich

1191
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Must be the season of the rich Must be the season of the rich

1192
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,920
When I grew up

1193
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,500
(upbeat music)
