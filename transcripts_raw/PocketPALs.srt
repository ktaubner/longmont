1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
We're starting.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
He showed me that.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I don't even know what this game is.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You guys know this Pokemon song?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Whoa, jukebox.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Mate, you playing Zelda.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
No, it's one of the Pokemon songs.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I got Squirtle?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You got Blue.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,880
- What the fuck? - Your water, bro.

12
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,800
- We are in-- - You said your water.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,760
- I never-- - You chose water.

14
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,200
- I never chose water.

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,360
- Then someone didn't check the group chat often enough

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,080
to respond in time and pick the two best types.

17
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,760
- So, here's-- - This is busy.

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,880
- First of all, water's way better than grass, but--

19
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,160
(Justin groans)

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,600
- Okay, girlish woman.

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,480
- Fine with me. - I actually like it.

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,320
So, we are in, we're doing a little test run.

23
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
I wanna try this out.

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,340
I sort of took some 5e stuff, re-skinned it with some Pokemon stuff.

25
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,340
I wanted to see what it would look like to have you guys play as Pokemons.

26
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,340
Can I change my sprite?

27
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,340
Yeah, if you want to. You're in control of that.

28
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,340
Oh, I can change that on my own?

29
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,340
I think so, yeah. I'm pretty sure I gave you controls of that.

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,340
I can't believe how slow my computer runs when I have Roll20 open.

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,340
Yeah, Roll20 is optimized for sure.

32
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,340
So you guys, the trainer Sullivan is on a mission

33
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,980
to become the greatest of them all, the very best,

34
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,140
and he got to have three starter Pokemon

35
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,140
because he's such a bad trainer.

36
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,980
So they're like, we're just gonna give you all three.

37
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:37,620
And he got you three Pokemon,

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,260
and you're now in the first gym,

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:43,500
and you're up against Dwight.

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,400
- We skipped all the town stuff?

41
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,020
That's the best part of the game.

42
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:49,700
- This is what I wanted to try out the fighting first.

43
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,820
I wanted to see how this worked.

44
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,500
- Oh, I thought maybe you prepared stuff.

45
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,240
- Oh, so we're playing out of order?

46
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,300
- Mm-mm, mm-mm.

47
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,100
We're starting in the gyms.

48
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,780
We'll go back to the towns.

49
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,980
- Then maybe eventually we can become trainers ourselves

50
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,820
instead of just little animals.

51
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,040
- Yes, that's what I mean, that's what I mean.

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,120
We're starting with this,

53
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,260
'cause I maybe would want you guys to just be trainers.

54
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,100
I wanna see what's up to have you be--

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,220
- I'm overprepared.

56
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,140
- Animals first.

57
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,880
No, tell me about your guide. - You're overprepared?

58
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,720
- You're overprepared.

59
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,580
- I wrote a character intro, man.

60
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,820
I thought that this was the beginning

61
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,020
of something amazing and new.

62
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,100
- It is a beginning. - And new and amazing.

63
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,020
- Well, we're gonna do that.

64
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,440
I do wanna do like a real Pokemon campaign,

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,180
but I didn't wanna just rush into it

66
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,820
'cause I had lots of other things to prep for that.

67
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,940
But I wanted to start with the battles at least.

68
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,900
So tell me about your character.

69
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,540
What are your starter Pokemon?

70
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,620
Who are you guys?

71
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,660
- I'll go last 'cause I actually have

72
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,060
something awesome to read. - Go, Caleb.

73
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,200
- And you guys are the Pokemon. - Go, go, go.

74
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,820
- Yeah, Caleb, go first. - I'm adding stuff to it

75
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,820
as we speak. - Oh, you're adding to it.

76
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Yeah, so. That's awesome.

77
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,820
So you guys should go ahead and finish adding.

78
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:55,820
I'll probably be adding for a couple minutes, so you might as well just go.

79
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,820
Alright, well we can sit and wait. I don't mind waiting.

80
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Okay, I'm gonna go.

81
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Whatever.

82
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:07,820
Okay, go ahead.

83
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,820
I thought it was gonna be...

84
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,820
Okay, make sure to do the voice.

85
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
You gaze through the tree line in the dead night.

86
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,000
(laughing)

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,980
No sounds to be heard, no sights to be seen.

88
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,540
It's quiet.

89
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,460
Thank you.

90
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,300
Too quiet. - Perfect.

91
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,940
- That is, until you see two glowing red eyes

92
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,020
breaking through the dark.

93
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:31,600
At first, you may think it might be two leaves

94
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:35,520
or two red marbles or a red-eyed bear.

95
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:38,380
But as your eyes adjust to the darkness,

96
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,780
you realize it's something much, much more terrifying.

97
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,600
Me.

98
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:48,460
part dog, part ant, part monkey, part lava, part food,

99
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,420
part bird, and part fire ant.

100
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,940
My name strikes fear across almost all cultures,

101
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,020
and they all have some name for me.

102
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,020
Helios, Kagatsuchi, Chantico, Pele, Gira.

103
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,900
But please, just call me Flamer.

104
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,900
(laughing)

105
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,100
- The frog named me Flamer.

106
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,340
(laughing)

107
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,540
- Yeah, Flamer's my favorite, go Flamer!

108
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,860
- Okay, thank you.

109
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,580
- Patches, I tried to switch my character token

110
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,180
and it didn't work.

111
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,820
- So my Pokemon is known as Smoku.

112
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,860
I'll do a Pokedex.

113
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:36,540
Smoku, the smoking weed and watching TV Pokemon.

114
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,100
Able to watch over 100 episodes of Netflix in a single day.

115
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,500
and able to smoke weed and watch 100 movies in a single week.

116
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,180
- How much weed can he smoke according to the Pokedex?

117
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:50,980
- Over 100 joints of weed can be smoked

118
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,580
by this small but pint-sized Pokemon.

119
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,420
- But what does he look like?

120
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,980
- Small but pint-sized.

121
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:59,660
- He's the size of a pint. - This small but pound-sized

122
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,980
Pokemon packs a powerful punch with his special ability.

123
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,180
And he looks like a weed. - What is it?

124
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,060
- What does he look like, sorry?

125
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,820
- He looks like a weed leaf holding a TV remote,

126
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,380
or a Roku remote, more specifically.

127
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:20,900
And he has red eyes, like you, but in a different way,

128
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,860
if you know what I'm saying, if anyone at home

129
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,860
knows what I'm saying.

130
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,700
- Okay.

131
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,340
- Not fire eyes.

132
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,060
- Not fire, but-- - Not like a fire ability eyes.

133
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,940
- No, like maybe he was using fire,

134
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,540
and the eyes got red because of that.

135
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,180
- Later evolutions, you're gonna be grass poison,

136
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,140
That's what I'm hearing.

137
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,500
- Well, we'll split more grass psychic.

138
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,100
- No, definitely. - Oh.

139
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,880
- Yeah, I think poison.

140
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,540
- Or maybe it'll be three or four types by the end.

141
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,220
- You can't really do that, but that's fine.

142
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,380
- Yeah, I might, probably 10 to 12 types

143
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,260
by my second evolution.

144
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,340
- Helios is sort of like a-- - Because there's so many

145
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,340
different channels on TV that it's kind of--

146
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,180
- Well, it's Flamer. - Sorry, Flamer.

147
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,620
- I could be watching water channel or fire channel

148
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,900
or basically whatever.

149
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,180
- Flamer's sort of gonna be like dark fire

150
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,940
or something like that.

151
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,780
- Right. - Dark.

152
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,600
- Fire.

153
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,960
Just fire, pure fire you'll be the whole way through.

154
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,920
- Yeah, I don't need a second thing.

155
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,120
- Yeah.

156
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,880
Who is this then?

157
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,240
This blue one.

158
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,360
- Did you get my...

159
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,080
- Did you send it to me over Discord?

160
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,920
- Yeah.

161
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:28,160
I tried to change it on roll 20, but it didn't let me.

162
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
- All right, I'll do it.

163
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,920
You explain who your guy is while I do this.

164
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,900
- Why the photo has to show up first.

165
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,860
it's the only way for it to make sense

166
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,060
okay give me one second

167
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,740
is it a bowl of water?

168
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,340
no

169
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:53,340
or a cup i guess? why do i think it's going to be a sperm? why am i guessing right now that it's about to be a sperm?

170
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,740
why would that be a water animal? i'm the water pig

171
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,780
what? ok...

172
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:02,300
water's a stupid idea for a pokemon

173
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,020
damn

174
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,740
what are you even doing?

175
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,180
I'm a pig that lives in water instead of mud.

176
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,860
Like a swimming pig?

177
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,300
Yeah, it's a pig that swims.

178
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,660
I guess that's kinda cool.

179
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,660
And his ability is eating.

180
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,800
Any animal eats.

181
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,100
Not like a pig.

182
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,860
So you're some kind of water pig.

183
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,700
Yeah, I'm going ahead.

184
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,140
He is a water pig, not some kind of water pig.

185
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,620
I'm sending my guy's icon to you right now,

186
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,360
Pat, just real quick. Yeah, please do.

187
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,880
just so you can tell. - Oh, oh, oh.

188
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,320
And I live, I'm from the Bahamas.

189
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,000
- Okay, this is getting to something.

190
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,920
- Okay, but your name is still just Waterpig?

191
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,960
- Yes.

192
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,880
- Which region is the Bahamas?

193
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,320
In like, the Bahama region? - Alola.

194
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,720
- Is that Alola also?

195
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,560
Yeah, okay.

196
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,320
- I would like to change my image to this.

197
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,160
- Yeah, I changed it already.

198
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,040
Are you giving me another image?

199
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,120
- I gave you another one, and it's even better.

200
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,420
- So you're still a pig?

201
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,040
- Why'd you send a pig wearing a human suit?

202
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,520
- I was gonna be the human pig,

203
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,640
then remembered that it had to be water.

204
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,480
- So you went water pig.

205
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,300
- So you changed to the water pig.

206
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,680
- So this was the other one, I said water pig.

207
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
So this is--

208
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,120
- That's a good one.

209
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:17,960
- Okay.

210
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,800
- That looks almost like a Pokemon.

211
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,880
- Are you both the pig, it's like--

212
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,080
- That's part of my body, yeah.

213
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,440
It's like Klefki.

214
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,000
- It's like a snail shell.

215
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,520
You have a water fountain attached to your back.

216
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,360
- Okay guys, I'm gonna create--

217
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,200
- Oh, my name is LK.

218
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,480
- I'm gonna create my point of orders.

219
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,480
Like the water company, like the water bubbler company.

220
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,880
LK the water pig.

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,540
- You should just be Bubbler.

222
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,640
- I'm water pig.

223
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:46,840
No, I'm gonna continue to be water pig.

224
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,240
- Go Bubbler!

225
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,840
- 'Cause he named me or Cameron.

226
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,200
- You know he named you Bubbler.

227
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,040
- Pokemon.

228
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,940
All right, I'm Bubbler, the pig.

229
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,240
I'm Bubbler the pig.

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,120
- Bubbler the pig.

231
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,920
- Well I'm fucking, I'm a flamer.

232
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,960
- Flame animal? - Charmander.

233
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,440
You're just a regular Charmander?

234
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,240
- No, I'm a flamer and I'm a fucking,

235
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,880
some kind of crazy god.

236
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,400
- So, okay, cool.

237
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,520
So now I know who you guys are.

238
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:22,840
So you're facing off against Dwight, Dwight Trainer.

239
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,080
- And, Dwight Trainer?

240
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,680
- No, Dwight, Dwight-- - Oh, now I see him.

241
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,960
- He's really hard to say.

242
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,720
Dwight Trainer. - Truth.

243
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,360
- No, 'cause he's not, no, it's a different guy.

244
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,160
- Okay. - Looks like Dwight Schrute.

245
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,400
- Yeah, looks a lot like Dwight Schrute.

246
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,680
- And he says, "You're never gonna beat my Pokemon."

247
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,600
And then Sullivan says he's going to beat him.

248
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
- So let's-- - What kind of line is that?

249
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,200
- He says he's-- - You're never gonna

250
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,360
beat my Pokemon?

251
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,200
(laughing)

252
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,040
- That's what he said. - That's what he sucks.

253
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,480
- Sometimes some trainers be saying that

254
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,320
in the Pokemon games. - That's literally

255
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,680
what they say, that I thought maybe you'd have a--

256
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,320
- Well, no, usually they say something more like,

257
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,080
"The sky is so blue," or something.

258
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,440
- Okay, I'd like to-- - Or they'll say--

259
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,520
- I like swimming with rubber pants on.

260
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,680
- Get back here, Flamer.

261
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:08,360
- We're rolling for initiative?

262
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,280
- Don't clip that, by the way.

263
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,120
- Yeah, sure.

264
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,560
Everyone roll for initiative.

265
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,280
- Okay, I got a 15.

266
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,120
- Okay.

267
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,600
- Okay, I have a character sheet.

268
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,000
- Why am I getting the wrong character sheet?

269
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,920
Under Pokemon, I'm getting this one that says weird stuff.

270
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
- Oh, I've got mine.

271
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,200
I got mine, y'all.

272
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,040
- You should be getting yours.

273
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,000
- It just looks weird.

274
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,840
- Yeah, it is weird.

275
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
It's a simpler one.

276
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,480
- I keep finding better pictures of the 12s.

277
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
- Can you, sorry, can you re-roll, Pat,

278
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,580
but make sure you have your character clicked?

279
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,680
'Cause then it shows up in the turn orders.

280
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,440
- Okay.

281
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,260
- And I will edit it.

282
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,280
It'll be 15 still.

283
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,840
- Why is White Spy rolling rolls?

284
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,520
- 'Cause he's confused.

285
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,320
- What's White Spy doing here?

286
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,160
- Did you ever--

287
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,000
- Get out of here, White Spy.

288
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,560
- White Spy at the bottom.

289
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,880
- Pat, you gotta have your character clicked.

290
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,220
- I did.

291
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,900
So click on the little initiative.

292
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,220
- Just rolling D20s.

293
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,980
- You have to roll the initiative.

294
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,700
- Click on the character sheet

295
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,860
and then there's initiative is a little dice,

296
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,380
a little die between actions and your name.

297
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,820
There we go.

298
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,220
- Crit one. - That's awesome.

299
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,220
Okay, that's fine.

300
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,380
It'll be what you want it to be this time.

301
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,020
Cameron, you're gonna go first.

302
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,900
- What does that mean?

303
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,740
- No, 15. - Okay.

304
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,980
- It's gonna be 15. - Okay.

305
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,740
- I'm going to use Smoker Beam.

306
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,360
- So you don't have, I did not give you,

307
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,020
what does Smoker Beam do?

308
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:37,260
(laughing)

309
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,820
- Basically my guy takes out a blunt and he smokes it

310
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,500
and he gets high as fuck.

311
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,460
- Where's the beam come from though?

312
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,860
- The beam is the light shining out of the TV

313
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,700
onto his face and he smiles at it.

314
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,060
- Oh, he like turns around and clicks on the TV

315
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:56,700
and it like blasts like a,

316
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,380
like it's a shadow almost of his entire body.

317
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,100
- Exactly, that's what I was thinking all along.

318
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,940
So it's like-- - See,

319
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,760
why am I so good at this Pokemon shit?

320
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,700
- Who are you shooting that at?

321
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,900
Which one are you shooting at?

322
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,880
- The water pig.

323
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,140
(laughing)

324
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,740
- Don't shoot at the water pig.

325
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,660
- I'm super effective against the water pig,

326
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,260
so I might as well shoot at it.

327
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,200
- Stop, he's on your team, mate.

328
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,220
- I'm not gonna shoot at the water pig.

329
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,900
So who's here, are these just normal Pokemon?

330
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,740
Whoa!

331
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,300
- How are you doing that blast?

332
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,740
- What the hell is that?

333
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,540
- I have a blast ability now.

334
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,580
- That's so fucking cool.

335
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,520
- What, are these just normal Pokemon

336
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,700
that we're fighting against?

337
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,540
- Yeah.

338
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,660
- An Onix and a Jamaican?

339
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,580
- An Onix and an Executor.

340
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,220
(laughing)

341
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,700
Okay, I will shoot my beam at the Onix.

342
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,940
- Oh!

343
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,700
- That is a critical.

344
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,900
- Did you get a critical hit?

345
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,420
- Yeah, but it doesn't do anything for the first turn.

346
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,340
- For this turn, yeah.

347
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:55,100
So this first turn, you start charging up your,

348
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,060
what did you call it?

349
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,000
- Smoker's beam.

350
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,820
- Well here's what it says about solar beam,

351
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,660
which I think we can--

352
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,220
- Smoker's beam. - Smoker's beam.

353
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,020
The user gathers light on the first turn,

354
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:09,020
then blasts a bundled beam on the next turn.

355
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,860
- Okay, that is from--

356
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,020
- So next turn I think I'll be blasting a bundled beam.

357
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,480
- Okay, that's just, that's what it said.

358
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,620
So I tried to find descriptions.

359
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:18,460
- A bundled beam.

360
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,900
- And they called it a bundled beam.

361
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,740
- What does that mean?

362
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,900
- Okay, but yeah, I don't do anything this turn.

363
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,540
- Okay, so you're gathering your charge here.

364
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,100
- But maybe we can use that attack roll next turn.

365
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,500
- Oh yeah, we can use that.

366
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:38,220
You are up now, PatrickPokemon.

367
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,460
- Okay, so I'm effective against,

368
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:44,020
or is it water against, or no, no, no, no.

369
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,740
Is it water, these are both,

370
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,380
I'm effective against both of them, right?

371
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,220
- No, you're not.

372
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,940
- You're effective against rock.

373
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,200
- Water's good against rock, but water's bad against grass.

374
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,340
Right, okay, that's what it was.

375
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:59,380
Okay, then I'm gonna go for the onyx.

376
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,100
- Okay, cool.

377
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,940
So what are you gonna do?

378
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,900
- I blasted it with wet pig shit.

379
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,160
(laughing)

380
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,620
- So is that muddy water?

381
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,100
- I don't have that.

382
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,020
- I gave him muddy water.

383
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,300
- No, it's not muddy.

384
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,060
I didn't even change muddy water.

385
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,060
he just updated it before i can change them

386
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,060
he changed, he changed, yeah he changed

387
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,060
yeah you can change it, this is what

388
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:26,060
yeah you can change the name of your moves

389
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,060
yeah so he changed

390
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,060
he changed water gun to wet pig shit

391
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:32,060
*laughter*

392
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,060
*laughter*

393
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,060
cool, wait, describe to me how does he shoot wet pig shit

394
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,060
how does bubbler shoot, and what sound does bubbler make

395
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,060
can you just imagine how he would shoot

396
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,060
wet pig shit

397
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,060
ok, so sullivan goes

398
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,060
bubbler use water gun

399
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,060
then instead... *burp*

400
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,060
yeah

401
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,060
*laughter*

402
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:54,060
I do that, turn around

403
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,060
and then the bubbler on my butt

404
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,060
shoots

405
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,060
wet pig shit out at

406
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,060
Onyx. And that was a... did I get a

407
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,060
20 or...

408
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,060
It looks like you rolled it with advantage

409
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:08,060
Oh. So let's take the...

410
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:10,060
what was the first one?

411
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,060
17? The first one was a 17. That still hits

412
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,060
for sure. So yeah, so now

413
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:17,060
So now you're gonna roll for damage now.

414
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:21,220
So you'll see there on your sheet, it'll say what to do.

415
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,280
- I roll 1d6 plus three.

416
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:31,200
- And that's gonna be doing double because of the type.

417
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,040
- Four.

418
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,400
- So it's doing eight damage to this rock snake creature

419
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,580
that writhes in pain as it's showered in your pig shit.

420
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,820
(pig snorting)

421
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,060
- He's like the nastiest Pokemon.

422
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,860
Nobody usually chooses him.

423
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,820
- He's gross.

424
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,320
- Maybe someone felt bad for him.

425
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,960
- Sullivan was bullied into picking him.

426
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,760
He did feel bad for him,

427
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,880
but he didn't necessarily want him either.

428
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,260
But now it is that Onix's turn.

429
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,320
And so he's gonna go after spying a type differential

430
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,700
using his keen Dwight senses.

431
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,640
- Bastard.

432
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,340
- He's just gonna go after Flamer.

433
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,200
- Uh-oh.

434
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,080
- Wait, he's gonna go after him specifically?

435
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,120
He's targeting him?

436
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:17,960
- He's targeting me?

437
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,480
I don't know about that, man.

438
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,960
- He's targeting the character.

439
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,340
- He kinda looks like me.

440
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:27,360
Both of these kinda look like me.

441
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,480
- You have kind of a moment of recognition.

442
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,960
- Okay, so what do I do?

443
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,800
I dodge it?

444
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,460
Okay, I dodge.

445
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,000
- You will have to roll, actually.

446
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,920
- Okay, I'll roll.

447
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,960
- Roll a D20 against your decks,

448
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,080
'cause as the onyx rears its head up.

449
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,040
- 13 with my dex bonus.

450
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,640
- 13 with your dex bonus.

451
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,600
Okay, that is not enough to save.

452
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,520
- Oh shit.

453
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,120
- It rears its head up and starts knocking around

454
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,560
and rocks, smaller rocks fall out of the crevices

455
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,960
of its bigger rocks.

456
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,240
I have no idea how else it would do that, to be honest.

457
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,240
But you end up taking 16 damage in that case.

458
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,320
- 16, man, oh crap.

459
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,440
- So here's the thing. - That's a lot.

460
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,200
- How do I change my damage, my health on this new version?

461
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,520
- Go to your, if you click on your icon,

462
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,560
you'll see the number on the top.

463
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,760
- Oh yes, I see this. - Just subtract, yeah.

464
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,680
So that'll be 19 you'll have.

465
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,880
Also, so next for you guys,

466
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,120
you have five potions you can use that will fully heal you

467
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,080
for this whole fight.

468
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,520
There are a couple other Pokemon you'll have to fight.

469
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,520
Three revives you can use as well.

470
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,000
And then three of each status effect healing item.

471
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,680
- Mr. Patches?

472
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,320
- Yes, Maya Califf.

473
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,500
- My life won't change.

474
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,800
- I'll do it.

475
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,440
- I don't know what-- - Thank you.

476
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
- I'm sorry.

477
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,760
- There you go.

478
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,920
Okay.

479
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:01,820
So now it is your turn, Flamer.

480
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,060
- Well, I want to use fire blast on the egg.

481
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,400
- Okay.

482
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,760
- 16.

483
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,880
- That hits the egg.

484
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,360
- Yes.

485
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,680
Oh yeah.

486
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,460
- 24.

487
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,400
- Yeah, you-- - 24?

488
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,680
- Yeah, so times two. - You kill my kill?

489
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,760
- Yeah, describe your kill on the egg.

490
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,320
You have five uses of this, so you have four now left.

491
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,320
- I close my eyes and I rumble around, I clench my fist.

492
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,240
(growling)

493
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,360
And then I flame it all over him.

494
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:43,380
- Yeah, and Dwight goes, "No, Jamaican!"

495
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,160
And he takes him back, and then he throws him out.

496
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,480
- He's fucking dead.

497
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,500
- Yeah, but he puts him back in the ball.

498
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,480
- They put the dead ones in the ball when they're done.

499
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,600
- Yeah, okay, yeah.

500
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,720
- Can I jump into the Pokeball?

501
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
- Yeah, you jump, yeah.

502
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,440
- I jump into the Pokeball too?

503
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,900
- Roll a d20 and we'll add your decks.

504
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,740
What'd you get?

505
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,680
- 12.

506
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,280
- Okay, cool, yeah, you land in the Pokeball with--

507
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,120
- Come here!

508
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,360
- Nope, just you.

509
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,640
- You land the executor.

510
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,400
You're out of the match now.

511
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,240
- I wanna just--

512
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,760
- I'm just beating the shit out of him.

513
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,640
(laughing)

514
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,480
- You see--

515
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,000
- Last nobody tried this tactic before.

516
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,720
- Yeah, chase him into the Pokeball, man.

517
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
- Yeah, just go in there with him.

518
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,520
- Dwight, please, please, please tell him to stop.

519
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,060
and Sullivan joins, return, Flamer!

520
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,160
- No.

521
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,200
- Didn't, Sullivan kinda just shrugs.

522
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:40,240
- Okay, I'm individually choking out every single head

523
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
on the executor. - Please!

524
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,240
Yeah, you're just, you're--

525
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,800
- I'm taking both of my hands

526
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:48,160
and I'm putting them between two sets of heads each

527
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,320
and slapping them front hand, back hand,

528
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,640
front hand, back hand, over and over and over again.

529
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,200
- Okay, yeah.

530
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:59,200
- Dwight makes executor, Dwight, oh no, I shit.

531
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,560
- There's nothing he can do, man.

532
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,520
He can't get in this Pokeball.

533
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,680
- I was trying to figure out what he can do.

534
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,840
- Okay guys, the strat here, we're all gonna get

535
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,320
into the other guy's Pokeballs

536
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,720
before he can even send out the other Pokemon.

537
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,520
- This is a new strategy I came up with.

538
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,880
- This is the perfect strategy.

539
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,680
- This is a strategy that's gonna change the way

540
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,640
that the game is played forever.

541
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,240
You're going to have to address this

542
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
in the next Pokemon game. - They will.

543
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,300
Dwight starts to plead with Sullivan and says,

544
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,140
"I concede, I concede, please!"

545
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:28,980
And Sullivan goes, "Okay, okay."

546
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,680
- Who's conceding?

547
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,180
- Yeah, sure, all right.

548
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,260
- I would like to destroy one of the,

549
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,980
I would like to cut off one of the heads.

550
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,620
The other two can live.

551
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,580
- Roll a strength check.

552
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,180
Let's just see if you can saw through it with your claws.

553
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,300
- No, I can't.

554
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,140
- Okay, yeah.

555
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,260
It's worse though, almost,

556
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,340
'cause you just kinda mangle it.

557
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,340
- It's kinda hanging off a little bit.

558
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,580
- Yeah, yeah.

559
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,420
- Okay, I'm done.

560
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,980
- Dwight does give up.

561
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,560
Dwight gives up.

562
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,580
- What, I didn't even get to use Smoker's Beam yet.

563
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,340
- Okay, you wanna use Smoker's Beam?

564
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,180
Or you wanna save it for the next?

565
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,260
- Yeah, we gotta take out the Onix.

566
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,940
- No, he gave up.

567
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,240
- Oh, wait, yeah, that's true.

568
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,460
We could save it for the next.

569
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,580
- It's super effective, and it's 17 plus 25,

570
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,900
which is 42 times two.

571
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,720
- Yeah, it's 84. - You could save it

572
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,260
for the next, the first Pokemon that he throws out.

573
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:20,900
- So I've used it on the Onix and I did 84 damage.

574
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,740
- He wants to see.

575
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,740
- I also climbed inside the Onix's mouth

576
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,880
so that when he takes a back on the Pokeball,

577
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,020
I'm going into the Pokeball with it.

578
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,060
- Okay, cool.

579
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,900
So, you're gonna--

580
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,740
- 'Cause listen, turn order and concede,

581
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,160
I already was charging this up.

582
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,140
It's gonna happen whether or not he concedes.

583
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,620
I can't keep the bungled beam inside my body.

584
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:39,060
- Just shoot it at Dwight.

585
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,460
You can shoot it at Dwight.

586
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,460
- Okay, I shoot at Dwight,

587
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,220
but then I also am still going inside Onix's mouth.

588
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,800
- Oh yeah, you kill Dwight.

589
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,660
and uh... yeah

590
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,220
the next day i don't worry i get all of the white spooky was a sir cracking them

591
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,300

i've got sullivan in a book you bought the

594
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,580
but i don't know

595
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,420
you're an animal

596
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,380
or a little bit

597
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,740
you know that i like

598
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,220

599
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,940
okay cool

600
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,300
- All right, now the other trainer and the gym leader

601
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,100
are both throwing out their Pokemon

602
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,420
'cause they're terrified of you guys.

603
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,340
- They should be.

604
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,300
- Yeah, so here they come.

605
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:27,100
- Better not be Tarakion.

606
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,140
- I don't know what that is.

607
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,020
- Is that called Ekis?

608
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:32,860
Or Ekis?

609
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,260
- Arbok. - Arbok.

610
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,400
- Arbok. - Arbok.

611
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,620
- And that one's called My Arms?

612
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,020
- That's Machoke.

613
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,020
- Machoke. - God damn it.

614
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,600
- It's okay.

615
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,640
And then last but not least,

616
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,280
Raichu.

617
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,120
- Raichu.

618
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,840
Tell me why this old guy patch

619
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,920
is only using the first generation of Pokemon.

620
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,760
- Right?

621
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,160
- Come on, throw some Clefkies in there.

622
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,200
- I'm not gonna do that on the first,

623
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,200
this is like a trial run to see what I win.

624
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,040
- That's true.

625
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,600
- Can I put stuff on the map?

626
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,800
- Can I put an image on the map,

627
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,920
or is that only a DM thing?

628
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,640
- If you have the ability-- - I would like to throw

629
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,440
my Pokemon. - You might have the ability.

630
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
You wanna throw your, you can throw your own.

631
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,880
- I wanna throw my own Pokemon. - One of us needs to,

632
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,120
one of us needs to pretend to be the trainer

633
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,760
so they don't get wise. - I'll do it.

634
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,120
- We're stray Pokemon. - Yeah.

635
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,700
- You guys can-- - I got that sound.

636
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,200
- So I'm in the back, I mean I have a suit,

637
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,040
so I'm sitting in the back. - Yeah, sure.

638
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,360
- I'm pretending to be a normal--

639
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,080
- A pig? - Human, yeah.

640
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,960
Just a pig man. - What the fuck

641
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,240
is on the screen? - Big red block.

642
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,160
- Sorry y'all.

643
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,800
- What are you doing?

644
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
my b

645
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,080
does my son on your sorry about that

646
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,920
all right cool

647
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,000
we're back to the top of the order

648
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,800
uh...

649
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,680
array waits a long first okay you're pretending you're a guy

650
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,240
so i don't know

651
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,640
uh... and i think

652
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,320
i'm glad i did it

653
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,160
that i had a lot of these

654
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,160
i'm trying to be a a human i'm trying to speak so you can only say water pig

655
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:08,440
you know but what do you have a a a a a

656
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,800
you know you're going on your say your name

657
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Oh my god!

658
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,120
So the trainer comes up to you, the gym leader.

659
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:24,280
He says, "Okay, I could have swore there was a frog here a little while ago."

660
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,760
I'm smelling his butt.

661
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,600
Are you getting rolled?

662
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,840
Roll to see how it smells.

663
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,320
What'd you get?

664
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,320
Six.

665
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,320
six

666
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
the case is that the

667
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,320
the

668
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,320
the

669
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
the

670
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
the

671
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
the

672
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
the

673
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
the

674
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
the

675
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
the

676
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
the

677
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
the

678
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,320
the

679
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
the

680
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
the

681
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,040
I know that Pokemon. Where's your train?

682
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,560
That's one of the original 153.

683
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,080
And I blast him with my udder.

684
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,320
Damn it.

685
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,680
Okay, I mean you still hit him, he's a normal guy.

686
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,560
Yeah. He's like, "Oh my god!"

687
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,280
And he starts to just blast him to the other side.

688
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,520
He just, yeah, he runs back there, he like sends out his Pokemon, he's like,

689
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,960
"Alright, I gotta take care of these rogue-ass Pokemon."

690
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,800
And, uh, yeah, uh, let's start from the top of the order again.

691
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,460
- You're up.

692
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,780
And then we'll see what happens after you beat him.

693
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,860
'Cause then you guys are gonna have the town

694
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,140
at your disposal, I guess.

695
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,740
- Is Grass effective against the strong guy?

696
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,100
- The strong?

697
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:48,260
Is Grass effective against the strong?

698
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,820
- I think so. - No.

699
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,420
Grass is not effective against fighting.

700
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,420
- What about the everything else that's on the screen?

701
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,340
- No, he's weak against poison.

702
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,300
- Weak against poison?

703
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,380
Okay, well, all you--

704
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,220
- These are guys,

705
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,860
These were supposed to be staggered out as you fought them,

706
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,700
but then you guys trapped your trainer in a pokeball.

707
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,680
- Well, we have new strategies where the effectiveness

708
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,900
barely even matters these days.

709
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,740
- Oh, okay.

710
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,320
- So first of all, I'm going to use my attack, Hulu,

711
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,940
which, I'll read this here,

712
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,660
Hulu shoots two to five seeds in a row to strike the foe.

713
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,260
- So roll one D6 to see how many seeds

714
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,060
when you do Hulu.

715
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,500
- Six.

716
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,180
Three.

717
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,380
- Okay, so you get three seeds, and so--

718
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,580
- One D4 each it looks like.

719
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,780
- Mm-hmm.

720
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,820
- Okay, so.

721
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,980
- And who are you shooting that at again?

722
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,540
- Now I'm shooting this directly at the gym leader.

723
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:52,620
So that's eight damage from my seeds.

724
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,660
And I'm aiming for his groin.

725
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,260
- He's--

726
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,780
- 'Cause I'm high, and when I'm high,

727
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,460
Honestly, I can't control myself.

728
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,660
- And how much damage did he get from Utter?

729
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:04,500
What did he get?

730
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,860
Oh, Christ.

731
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,580
- Dude, I don't even think he did any damage.

732
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,300
I think I was just blasting him away from me.

733
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,140
So you don't have to worry about that.

734
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,980
- So you weren't using, it says torn water.

735
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,460
- You were not using Hydro Pump then on this guy.

736
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,580
- No, no, I was using Utter, which is the foe is bla--

737
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,140
Oh, it is Hydro Pump, actually.

738
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,500
- Okay, so he's dead.

739
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,300
(laughing)

740
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,980
I was kinda like wondering how long it would take for you guys to attack traitors, but

741
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
this is immediate.

742
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,060
Alright you Arbok macho, macho Raichu, get it back in your balls.

743
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:41,300
Or join us and we will destroy all of the human civilization.

744
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,540
Stop Waterpig.

745
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,040
Stop copying me.

746
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,500
I thought that we were supposed to look menacing.

747
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
The snake is like...

748
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
I just got Deja vu, Waterpig.

749
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:55,820
I feel like I heard what you said before.

750
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,820
That's my character's voice and that's the first time he's talked to.

751
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:02,820
Arbok, Arbok says, "Uh, what's in it for us?"

752
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,820
Dude!

753
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,820
I will feed you this.

754
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Snotilisp.

755
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,820
You sound gay.

756
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Well, no, you're flamer.

757
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
What is that supposed to mean?

758
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
Whoa!

759
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,820
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

760
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,820
Okay, I'm going to attack him.

761
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,820
Arbok, I will feed you this.

762
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,820
I

763
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:30,360
Don't see it what I sent it to him I sent to him on this on discord

764
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:38,380
Oh, that's not a private message. You said this and private message. Yeah, I didn't think that through he sent me a hamtaro hamster

765
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:44,780
I have this in my back pocket. He's sent me one of the hamtaro

766
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,260
What's the deal with these guys?

767
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,140
- It's so small to hold a seed like that.

768
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,260
- Okay, here's what's in it for you, Arbok.

769
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,860
You don't have to live in a Pokeball anymore,

770
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:01,280
and you don't have to hide away and hide your true self.

771
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,840
You can be whoever you want.

772
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,780
- And you can eat this.

773
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,620
- You're calling me gay again, I think.

774
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,100
- I'm not, what is up with you being obsessed

775
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,460
with gay stuff, okay?

776
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,300
I'm just saying.

777
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:15,060
- You're playing the victim here, dude.

778
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,900
- Once we get rid of all the humans,

779
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,440
There's nobody to look down on you

780
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,900
for whatever kind of lifestyle you choose to live.

781
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,160
- Urgent as to whoever you want to spend your time with.

782
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,560
- And the snake goes over to the Raichu

783
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,720
and they start to confer.

784
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,660
And the Machoke goes over to you, Flamer,

785
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,540
and he says,

786
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,460
so,

787
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,300
me know

788
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,180
have to listen

789
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,420
to

790
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,860
puny humans.

791
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,940
(laughs)

792
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,060
- He's thinking about it.

793
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,800
And they go, okay.

794
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,180
They agree, all three of them agree

795
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,420
that that would be better. - Wow.

796
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,820
- The hamster-- - Okay, now we can launch

797
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,020
a surprise attack and kill them.

798
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,420
- Okay, I put the hamster back in my back pocket.

799
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,140
- Oh no, you guys are gonna attack them?

800
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,500
- Caleb said he's frozen, can we hear him?

801
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,900
- No, we can't hear him. - But he's not talking.

802
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,700
He's just looking around.

803
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,340
- Yeah, wait, is he actually frozen or is he lying?

804
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,100
- I think he's lying.

805
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,100
- It's a weird lie.

806
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,220
- He hasn't even tried to speak.

807
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,320
- He hasn't seen you, I haven't seen your mouth.

808
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,620
You're not moving at all.

809
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,900
You're not talking.

810
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,740
- He's gonna reload.

811
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,260
- He's just lying.

812
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,220
- Maybe we're frozen?

813
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,140
- Okay, so while he's doing this,

814
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,500
we should change his character token.

815
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,340
- Hello.

816
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,180
- Okay, he's back.

817
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,020
- We could see you, man,

818
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,860
when you weren't even trying to talk.

819
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,860
You were just looking around.

820
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,860
You guys were frozen.

821
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
I really just wanted to get your attention.

822
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
He said, "Can you hear me?"

823
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,860
I was trying to see if you guys were moving.

824
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,860
Can you hear me?

825
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,860
I don't know.

826
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,860
I knew you guys were frozen,

827
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
so I figured I was too.

828
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,860
Like a fucking baby.

829
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,860
What's that about?

830
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
What's that dig?

831
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
It's like a baby.

832
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:19,020
thinks how about your ball frozen patches so why would that it's not just on your

833
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:27,420
why would it just assumed what because I thought that my zinc castor crash that's

834
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:33,300
funny patches is call me a baby and I'm sorry man anyway what did you want to say

835
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:38,260
they agreed to - they're gonna say I think we should just kill them now though

836
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:43,580
So they have, now we know that we could basically have domination over them.

837
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:44,580
We might as well kill them.

838
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,580
Here's what we do.

839
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,300
Guys, guys, okay.

840
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,420
We're gonna do our plan.

841
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,660
We're gonna take over the human world.

842
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,980
But six Pokemon running around.

843
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,980
Listen, we don't have the numbers for this.

844
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
That's a whole team.

845
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,980
What are you talking about?

846
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,980
We don't have the numbers for this yet.

847
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,700
We don't have the numbers for this yet, okay?

848
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:00,700
They're gonna get wise.

849
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,700
We have no trainer.

850
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,700
We're gonna be running around.

851
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,820
We're gonna have to have you guys get into Pokeballs just for a little bit so that we

852
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,420
collect a bunch of Pokemon and then we'll let you all out

853
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,420
at the same time and we'll kill the mayor.

854
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,740
- Except for Machoke, we're gonna put you in human clothes

855
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:19,860
and we're also going to actually implant an explosive

856
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,260
into your body that we have a remote to,

857
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,300
but you don't have to worry about that.

858
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,140
- And a fake nose.

859
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,660
- But you're gonna be in human clothes

860
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,060
and a fake nose and a fake mustache.

861
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,940
- We're going to give you a disguise.

862
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,460
- And you will be our trainer.

863
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,020
- Mm, yay.

864
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:38,140
- So we have Sullivan in a Pokeball plus Raichu and--

865
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,500
- Put 'em all in the same one.

866
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,340
- Yeah.

867
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,180
- And we only have one ball.

868
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,220
- We'll see what they do to,

869
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:45,300
see what they do with Sullivan.

870
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,100
- You can just see a skeleton,

871
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,200
like, coming out the other side of that.

872
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,380
(laughing)

873
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,580
- Carrying around just a fat Pokeball,

874
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,780
a big, fat, bulging Pokeball.

875
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:59,420
- Yeah, so okay, so you put the snake away,

876
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,300
you put the mouse away,

877
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,900
You dress up the macho thing in this suit.

878
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,100
So you guys have your guys,

879
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,240
you guys are now done with this gym.

880
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:12,180
So you're in this town now.

881
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,620
Let's zoom out.

882
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,560
You're in the town.

883
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,340
What do you guys wanna go?

884
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,180
It's the first town, it's like the Pewter City town

885
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,020
kind of thing.

886
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,420
Is Pewter the first one in Kanto?

887
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,820
- I wanna go to Nurse Jackie's office.

888
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,020
- I think Pewter is the first one 'cause that's rock.

889
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,340
- Right, yeah, that's right.

890
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,940
Nurse Jock.

891
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,780
- Nurse Joe. - Nurse Jackie is the show.

892
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,020
- Nurse Jackie.

893
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,860
- All right, so you want, is that Carmella Soprano?

894
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,180
She's Nurse Jackie, right? - Yeah.

895
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,460
- Okay. - Oh my God.

896
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,540
Was that Carmella Soprano on the phone right now?

897
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,380
- Is this Carmella Soprano?

898
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:46,620
(laughing)

899
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:50,660
- All right, yeah, you wanna go to Nurse Jackie, okay.

900
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,980
You guys go to the-- - Yeah.

901
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:55,260
- The Poke, what's it, the Poke Center?

902
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:57,860
- Center. - Poke Center.

903
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,740
- Pokemon Center. - The Pokemon Center.

904
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,300
You guys go in with the Machoke.

905
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,780
The Machoke is still trying to figure out

906
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,540
like kind of how to do stuff.

907
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:09,460
So he kind of, he sort of, it's a push door.

908
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,620
He figures out that it's, he tries to pull it.

909
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,340
And you could feel the hinges coming off.

910
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,980
- The first thing he tries is pulling it.

911
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,300
- Does Nurse Jackie think, is she attracted to Machoke?

912
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:24,380
- Why don't you roll Insight?

913
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,300
- Okay.

914
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,820
- Probably girls would be.

915
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,420
- She should have to roll some kind of wisdom save

916
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,820
against those muscles.

917
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,020
I think she can't help herself.

918
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,240
- How do I roll insight?

919
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,280
- Oh, just roll intelligence.

920
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,420
I didn't give him skills.

921
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:43,180
- Why does Machoke have all these lines on his arms?

922
00:34:43,180 --> 00:34:44,500
What's that supposed to represent?

923
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,340
I'm stupid.

924
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,160
- Tattoos.

925
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,300
- Self-harm, dude.

926
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,140
- Yeah, that's a nice thing.

927
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:48,980
- It's really sad.

928
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,860
- They made him have crazy hair as well.

929
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,700
- I'm stupid.

930
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,700
Inside is wisdom.

931
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,180
I just saw I and thought, yeah.

932
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,220
- Well, it's the same multiplier,

933
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,240
so I'll take my first one.

934
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,940
- Sure, yeah, that's fine with me.

935
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,740
What is the multiplier, plus one or something?

936
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,580
- Plus one, yeah.

937
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,840
- Okay, so 15, cool.

938
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,680
She's definitely looking him up and down,

939
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,100
like he looks, most of the trainers

940
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:11,940
that come in here are 10.

941
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,580
- Here's a question I have, I guess, real quick.

942
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,380
- You know, it's the first man trainer

943
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,060
she's seen in a while.

944
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,220
- Since you're kind of the master

945
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,660
of this Pokemon world right now,

946
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,580
you might be able to answer this for me, Patches.

947
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,420
- Yeah, I'll do my best.

948
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,420
- But is his underwear part of his body

949
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,820
or does he have a thing under it?

950
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:31,220
Is that the kind of thing I'm supposed to?

951
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,060
- You should know that.

952
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,900
- Well, I mean, right now,

953
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,820
you have power over everything, essentially.

954
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,660
- So this is your decision.

955
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,140
- So I'm gonna go ahead and pull down that--

956
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,780
I'm gonna go ahead and pull down that--

957
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,620
- Pants him.

958
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,860
- Speedo, real quick.

959
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:45,860
- And it's, yeah, 'cause they can breed, right?

960
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:50,400
- Can a Pokemon like Machoke breed with a human woman?

961
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,980
- Can they at least go on dates

962
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,820
if they're not gonna-- - Can we see--

963
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,340
- Whether or not they're gonna breed?

964
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,660
- Can they fall in love, at the very least?

965
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,540
- Yeah.

966
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,540
- At the very least.

967
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:00,980
- All these things are possible.

968
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,340
- Life partners.

969
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,660
- Okay, so what we need to do is try to have

970
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,420
Nurse Jackie to have sex with this animal.

971
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,060
- Right, then we create human Pokemon hybrids

972
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,980
and that's how we take over the world.

973
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,740
- Okay, so it's a long term plan.

974
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,740
- We need to breed Nurse Jackie with a giant lizard.

975
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,740
- From what I'm seeing on Google Images right now,

976
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,260
It seems like Machoke has sex with other men.

977
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,820
- Okay, so I tried to...

978
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:33,260
(laughing)

979
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,020
I tried to look up how long does breeding a Pokemon take

980
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,340
'cause I know it does it in game

981
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,740
and it says after every 256 steps.

982
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,940
- Okay, wait, this is, okay.

983
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,780
All right, so let's get these two rocketed and rolexed

984
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,780
and then we'll send her on a little, a brisk walk.

985
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,700
- Let's Google here, how long does it take to take 256?

986
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,180
- Yeah, so let's fight, can we find something

987
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,860
in between that and nine months?

988
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:00,700
Or is it like--

989
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,500
- No, it's 256 steps, dude, come on.

990
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,340
- Yeah. - Okay.

991
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:06,020
- Yeah, play it as it lies. - It's a dominant gene.

992
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,120
I guess I have been playing it as it lies.

993
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,100
- Come on.

994
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,380
- How long does Pokemon breeding take?

995
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,380
- 100 steps.

996
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,260
- You can get a new egg every couple minutes, smiley face.

997
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,460
- 100 steps a minute would be brisk walking.

998
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,580
- I can estimate it's roughly 1,000 steps,

999
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,320
spread about six eggs now and each time was on the spot.

1000
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,060
- Yeah, people can see this, Patrick.

1001
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,200
- What?

1002
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,000
- The thing you just said.

1003
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,260
(laughing)

1004
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,500
- So?

1005
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:41,520
- I guess you're right.

1006
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,100
(laughing)

1007
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,400
- Sucks.

1008
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,860
Hey, for those listening, those just listening--

1009
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,100
- Don't watch the video.

1010
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,940
- Yeah.

1011
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,160
- So Pokemon breed every two and a half minutes.

1012
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,620
- Okay, that's, okay.

1013
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:57,820
So, can we--

1014
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:00,300
- But then, so would that make the--

1015
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,140
- Well, all we have to do is--

1016
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,740
- Can we do like a ratatouille?

1017
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:05,060
Can we do a ratatouille thing first

1018
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,420
where you guys take her on a date?

1019
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,700
- Sure, but all we have to do is get them in the same room

1020
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:11,540
for about five minutes and they're gonna have a red twice.

1021
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,140
- They're definitely gonna fuck.

1022
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,380
- Here's my question.

1023
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:22,460
So, when the Pokemon puts the baby inside of her,

1024
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,900
(laughing)

1025
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,980
- So it takes 250, is that just to...

1026
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,340
So she's gonna have a baby.

1027
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,820
- That makes an egg.

1028
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,860
I don't know how long it takes for the egg to hatch.

1029
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,880
- But it takes like a full day.

1030
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,580
It basically takes a full day to hatch a Pokemon egg.

1031
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:43,540
- A whole day?

1032
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,660
We don't have that kind of time.

1033
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,940
- Hold on.

1034
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,700
- Look up how long it takes for an egg to hatch.

1035
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,120
So in the meantime, while you're looking that up,

1036
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,320
What are you guys telling to the Machoke to get the nurse to get interested in him?

1037
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,520
But it's also not gonna be an egg because this is a human woman and humans don't lay eggs.

1038
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,720
So what would it be like a...

1039
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,220
Hold on.

1040
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:02,720
She might have to care for this child.

1041
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,720
This will answer the question.

1042
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,120
10,240 steps or if it's a...

1043
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,120
The fastest...

1044
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:16,720
The fastest Pokemon egg to hatch is 1,280.

1045
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,720
So...

1046
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:21,400
How long does it take for a Machop?

1047
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:25,080
Look up how long it takes for a Machop egg to hatch then.

1048
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:25,920
Guys, we're getting,

1049
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
I think we're getting ahead of ourselves.

1050
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,120
We don't even know if she like likes him.

1051
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,040
We don't know.

1052
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
I just Googled here what happens

1053
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,120
when a Pokemon breeds with a human.

1054
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:36,240
Okay, what does it say?

1055
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,840
It says that there will never be a half-breed

1056
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,960
from a female Pokemon.

1057
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,800
Okay, but that's--

1058
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,760
Yeah, but we have a male Pokemon.

1059
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,600
Solved.

1060
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,400
Okay.

1061
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:56,200
DNA follows a different set of rules. It takes 10 minutes and 30 seconds.

1062
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:01,720
So apparently guys, Pokemon DNA follows a different set of rules y'all. So it takes two minutes.

1063
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,080
I would like to... Here's what it says. Human female and male Pokemon is a little more

1064
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:11,440
tricky. The offspring is full human with minimal Pokemon traits. The human

1065
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,040
would still give birth to a baby so the human offspring could gain some IV

1066
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:19,360
traits from the father, maybe be stronger than normal humans, or faster, or etc.

1067
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,000
- No, a human wouldn't be able to use Pokemon moves

1068
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,960
unless there was some other mutation.

1069
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,800
Maybe a human osprey could.

1070
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,640
- Wait, who's writing this?

1071
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:26,460
- So you're saying it would have hidden stat values.

1072
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,760
- This is on GameFAQs.

1073
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,600
- It would have hidden.

1074
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,840
(laughing)

1075
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,120
- Okay.

1076
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,760
- So it would have hidden stat values,

1077
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,440
but it can't use quick attack is what I'm getting at.

1078
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,280
- Right.

1079
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,120
- It would be a Pokemon in disguise.

1080
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,700
- And it does say maybe if you breed with a male psychic type

1081
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,120
that the Pokemon could have,

1082
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,600
the human could have psychic moves.

1083
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:48,440
- Okay, okay.

1084
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,200
- Okay, this guy's a fighting type though.

1085
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,680
- So he'll be able to fight.

1086
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,520
- Yeah.

1087
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,340
- So that's a good way to--

1088
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,180
- And he'll be strong.

1089
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,520
- That's sort of a good way to hide it too.

1090
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,600
These are just, you're basically making

1091
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,200
Master Chiefs right now, right?

1092
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,000
Like you're just making super soldiers basically.

1093
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,520
- Oh, somebody else said that they tried it

1094
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,160
for a while with Gardevoir and they proved

1095
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,840
that it can happen.

1096
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,740
- Interesting.

1097
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,580
- Oh, okay.

1098
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,360
- Do you have any footage of that?

1099
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,520
- Yeah, let me check their page.

1100
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,680
- What does that mean, a while?

1101
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,320
- I would like to set up a romantic spaghetti

1102
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,920
and meatballs dinner by candlelight

1103
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,480
in one of the checkup rooms.

1104
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,600
- Okay.

1105
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,920
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

1106
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,760
- Are you guys gonna--

1107
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,560
- Red tablecloth, all that.

1108
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,520
- You guys are gonna have to coach Machoke

1109
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,480
on how to talk to a woman.

1110
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,920
Usually Pokemon just bang

1111
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:35,000
when you put them in the house together.

1112
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,720
You gotta help him here.

1113
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,960
- Listen here, Machoke.

1114
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:45,040
You need to just smile, nod your head.

1115
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,560
Can you nod your head for me?

1116
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,980
Can you say yes?

1117
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,820
- Yeah.

1118
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,640
(laughs)

1119
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:50,480
- There we go.

1120
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,400
- It's horrible.

1121
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,040
- That's okay, yeah.

1122
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,880
Yay, yeah, perfect.

1123
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,800
All right, so I want you to go in there

1124
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,440
and do that maybe four or five times

1125
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,240
and then you'll pretty much make her move.

1126
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,080
- Uh-huh.

1127
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,240
- Yay.

1128
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,080
- Machoke.

1129
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,900
- Yeah, there we go.

1130
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,360
- Hold on.

1131
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,760
- Machoke, do you have five fingers

1132
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,600
or are you a four fingered cartoon?

1133
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,280
- Yeah, how many fingers do you have?

1134
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,720
- He starts shaking his head at the thought of counting.

1135
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,080
- I played this video on my pig phone.

1136
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,680
- What video?

1137
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,680
- How to use unspoken riz, okay.

1138
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,720
- Tutorial.

1139
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,080
- Oh, that could be useful for a Machoke.

1140
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:26,920
- Yeah, that would work.

1141
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,520
- Yeah, let's roll insight for Machoke

1142
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,120
to see how he does reading that.

1143
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:33,080
Or understanding that, rather.

1144
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,400
I guess it's really just an intelligence check.

1145
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:40,000
- I mean, he's an animal.

1146
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,480
- All right, he got a solid 11.

1147
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,320
- He's pretty good.

1148
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,680
- He gets most of it.

1149
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:47,700
He starts putting his hand in what he thinks is his pocket.

1150
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,440
He's trying that out to see--

1151
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,200
- His hand is down the front of his pants.

1152
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,520
(laughing)

1153
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,800
The front of his shorts.

1154
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,560
- She'll like that, man.

1155
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,840
Oh wait, wait, we need to give him a makeover.

1156
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,680
Can we make him sag his pants?

1157
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,340
- Yes. - Yes.

1158
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:02,320
- Girls love that shit.

1159
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,080
Okay, so we sag his pants.

1160
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,560
- Sag his speedo.

1161
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:08,500
- We sag his speedo so his butt cheeks are out

1162
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:12,200
like the Johnson and Johnson logo.

1163
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,380
And then we're going to,

1164
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:18,000
what's the male version of makeup?

1165
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,420
- Beard.

1166
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:20,920
- We are going to,

1167
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,280
there's gotta be some like biohazard,

1168
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,880
like pube trimming somewhere in this hospital, right?

1169
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,920
- Yes. - Yeah, there has to be.

1170
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,240
Yeah, I mean like,

1171
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,040
what kind of hospital would it be?

1172
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,760
- So we will spray him with some kind of adhesive,

1173
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,360
throw those on his face,

1174
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,840
kind of just like blow him into his face.

1175
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,680
- Yeah. - So there's just these

1176
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,120
- Little Pokemon just running around the hospital,

1177
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,280
like knocking shit over, grabbing pubes.

1178
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,360
- Wait, the babies are already there?

1179
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,360
- No, you're the little Pokemon.

1180
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,160
- Sorry, I got excited, little Pokemon.

1181
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,600
- We ain't that little, buddy.

1182
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,680
- I guess I was 100 feet tall, did I mention that?

1183
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,600
- So where are you guys telling him

1184
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,000
how to do this and stuff?

1185
00:43:59,000 --> 00:43:59,840
You guys were like--

1186
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,280
- We're telling him in the lobby.

1187
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,600
- Oh, the lobby of the hospital.

1188
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,400
- Yeah, and then we come in and we say,

1189
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,480
nurse Jackie, nurse Jackie, this guy,

1190
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:12,440
whose name is Darren, needs a checkup.

1191
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,920
- Darren Chris.

1192
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,000
- He needs a checkup very, very badly in room 21B.

1193
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,020
- So his pants are all the way down.

1194
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,100
He's going, "Yay!"

1195
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:27,720
(laughing)

1196
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,720
Staring directly at her.

1197
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,520
We're gonna roll Riz for him.

1198
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,360
- Okay. - Yes!

1199
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:35,960
- Bovine eyes.

1200
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,080
- Can we always rename Charisma to Riz?

1201
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,920
As a meme for ourselves?

1202
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:41,800
- As a meme-y?

1203
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,360
He's gonna do it with advantage 'cause he's so fire.

1204
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,600
- Oh.

1205
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,860
- Okay, so that's 14.

1206
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:50,960
So she sort of like looks him up and down and goes,

1207
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
"Okay, I'll take him."

1208
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,800
(laughing)

1209
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,080
- Okay. - I'll take him.

1210
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,080
- Okay. - I'll take him,

1211
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,920
I'll check him up.

1212
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,040
So she goes back in the room.

1213
00:44:58,040 --> 00:44:59,440
Do you guys follow?

1214
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,760
- Yes.

1215
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,640
- Yeah, but she does it in a way where nobody knows.

1216
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,480
- Yeah, I use sneak. - Roll stealth.

1217
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:10,980
Oh, I don't want to fuck this up actually. I kind of just want to, but we need one person who can coach him.

1218
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,980
Who has the highest charisma?

1219
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,480
I have plus one charisma.

1220
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
Mine's plus two.

1221
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,480
My, um, hold on.

1222
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:23,480
Oh, 14.

1223
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,480
So that's also plus two.

1224
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,480
I got a 19.

1225
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,480
Okay, well.

1226
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,480
I'm a crazy buddy.

1227
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:32,480
Okay, well you want to follow them and kind of coach him through it?

1228
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:33,320
- Can you guys hear it?

1229
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,440
'Cause it's gonna be harder if all three of us come.

1230
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,680
- I put my pig suit back on.

1231
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,520
- Yeah, there we go.

1232
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,920
- My human suit.

1233
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,280
And I'm walking behind them.

1234
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,240
- And so she says,

1235
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,640
"What kind of pain have you been feeling?"

1236
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,000
- It's no different than a dog being in the room

1237
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,080
when you're getting it on.

1238
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:48,920
- Exactly.

1239
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:49,760
(snorting)

1240
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,100
(laughing)

1241
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,940
Exactly.

1242
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,540
- What kind of pain have you been feeling?

1243
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,800
(grunting)

1244
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,400
He's like trying to...

1245
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,600
(laughing)

1246
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:02,960
Don't mess it up, bro.

1247
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,460
What are you saying to him?

1248
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,960
Um...

1249
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,460
Are you saying--

1250
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,960
Groin pain.

1251
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:08,960
Okay.

1252
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,460
Tell him to just point.

1253
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,460
Point to your groin.

1254
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,960
Day.

1255
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:23,960
[Laughter]

1256
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,960
Day.

1257
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,960
Pointing at his penis.

1258
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,960
Yes!

1259
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,460
Okay.

1260
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,460
Alright.

1261
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,460
[Laughter]

1262
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,460
That means the pain scale is at a nine.

1263
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,460
Yeah, you're saying that.

1264
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,460
He can't even talk.

1265
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,460
He can't even talk.

1266
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,460
Yeah.

1267
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,260
You're telling, you're this pig with a suit on, it's like leg to nurse though.

1268
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,900
Like, that means he's really hurt.

1269
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,900
I kicked him.

1270
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,100
I'm sorry.

1271
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,980
She takes him back to the room.

1272
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:54,140
She says, "Do you want to come in or should I?"

1273
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,020
To you, the pig.

1274
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,020
Don't go in then.

1275
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,020
Don't go in.

1276
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:00,020
Don't go in.

1277
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:03,460
that means I'm gonna stand outside and listen.

1278
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:04,300
- Okay, cool.

1279
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:05,120
- Don't say that.

1280
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:07,360
(laughing)

1281
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:12,600
- I mean, I'm actually not listening.

1282
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,460
I'm gonna not listen.

1283
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,420
- Cool, all right.

1284
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:19,260
So you're standing outside now and--

1285
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,820
- And I have a glass up to the door like this.

1286
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:24,860
- Do you have any words of encouragement

1287
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:28,340
before Darren Chris goes in there?

1288
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,740
- Any words of advice to-- - I hold him by the--

1289
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,060
- I hold him by the hands. - Give him a speech.

1290
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:33,300
Give him a Riz speech.

1291
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,140
- Yeah. - Okay.

1292
00:47:34,140 --> 00:47:35,860
I hold him by the hands and I look at him and I go.

1293
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,100
(slurping)

1294
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,380
- Inhuman.

1295
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,340
Inhuman, please.

1296
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,180
- That means.

1297
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:48,740
- That means fucker right in the pussy.

1298
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,140
- Okay.

1299
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,900
Yep, I really should have gone, man.

1300
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:54,940
That's where I'm at.

1301
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:55,900
This one's on me, guys.

1302
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,540
We're not gonna get our baby.

1303
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,380
- Remember that one?

1304
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,200
Remember that one?

1305
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,360
- I know, I remember that, yep.

1306
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:02,200
- Pretty good.

1307
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,040
- I remember that.

1308
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:05,000
- Oh, I'm glad you remember that.

1309
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,320
- Remember that.

1310
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,360
- I'm glad you remember that.

1311
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,680
- So meanwhile, a doctor comes into the lobby

1312
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:15,680
and sees you two, Flamer and Smoker.

1313
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,120
- Sounds like Thanksgiving.

1314
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,560
- Yeah, my name's Smoku.

1315
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:21,400
- Smoku.

1316
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
- It's like a combination of Smoker and Roku.

1317
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,920
- It's actually an anglicization of the Japanese name

1318
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,160
of the Pokemon, which is Samoku.

1319
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,760
How are you two fellas doing?

1320
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,320
Where's your trainer?

1321
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:35,560
- He's in-- - Smoku, Smoku.

1322
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,240
- Smoku, Smoku. - Flamer, Flammy Flamer.

1323
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:40,520
- You're adorable.

1324
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,120
- Yeah, but-- - I'm a Flamer.

1325
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,920
(laughing)

1326
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:44,920
- Clip that.

1327
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,240
- Flamer. - Roll, just charisma.

1328
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,640
Roll Riz. - Riz.

1329
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:54,480
- 14. - Nice.

1330
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,240
- 15. - Cool, yeah.

1331
00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:58,520
Yeah, he's like, oh, you're adorable.

1332
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,420
- Well if you guys don't mind just sitting over there

1333
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,860
by where the other Pokemon are,

1334
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:04,420
while we take a look at your trainer.

1335
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:05,860
- You guys, you guys bite.

1336
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,140
Bite right now, bite.

1337
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,320
- No!

1338
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:12,660
- Oh, oh, I'm rolling on my back as if I have an ache.

1339
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,900
- Oh no!

1340
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,140
- Flamer, flamer!

1341
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,900
- What does that mean?

1342
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,500
- I'm kind of, I'm like, help him!

1343
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,340
- Okay, yeah.

1344
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,160
- Flamer, flamer!

1345
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,300
Flamer, flamer!

1346
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,900
- Pokemon, the Pokemon doctor picks up Smoku and goes,

1347
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,980
- Oh, you poor little thing.

1348
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:33,140
And he goes to walk, he picks me up

1349
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:35,580
and I fucking come into the palm of his hand.

1350
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,420
(laughing)

1351
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:39,500
'Cause I'm an animal and I don't know any better

1352
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,220
and I'm just overstimulated.

1353
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,460
(laughing)

1354
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:47,540
I have jizz everywhere.

1355
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,820
And I look into his eyes and I go,

1356
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,220
smooch, and bat my eyes.

1357
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,480
(laughing)

1358
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,740
(laughing)

1359
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:00,280
- The doctor, he goes, "Oh."

1360
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,640
- I'm just trying to keep him out of work.

1361
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:02,480
- Here, oh.

1362
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,320
- He's going.

1363
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:06,420
- Why don't you wait right here and I'll,

1364
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:09,760
I'll be right back, I should just clean this up.

1365
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:11,960
- Wait, wait, point to like a napkin or something.

1366
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,080
Make him clean you up.

1367
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,280
He puts you, he puts you, he puts you.

1368
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,120
What did you say?

1369
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,560
- I started licking it up out of his hand.

1370
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,560
- And he maybe gets a little HP off that.

1371
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,400
(laughing)

1372
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,240
Uh-huh.

1373
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,060
- He's like, "Oh."

1374
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:24,900
- Definitely gets some HP.

1375
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,100
- Does he try to stop me?

1376
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,260
- No, he does, he puts you--

1377
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,460
- He doesn't try to stop me.

1378
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,220
- Well, he puts you on the--

1379
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,940
- Okay, so Flamer is videoing this whole thing.

1380
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:36,580
- Yeah, I have the whole thing on a flip camera.

1381
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:39,420
This guy, and I'm talking over it,

1382
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,580
oh no, y'all, this doctor just let this dog

1383
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:43,980
eat his own jizz.

1384
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:45,860
Y'all, this shit is disgusting.

1385
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,820
- Flamer, Flamer.

1386
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:50,660
- Flamer, Flamer, Flamer, Flamer, Flamer.

1387
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,900
(laughing)

1388
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,580
No, please, I just want to help this poor creature.

1389
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:03,220
And meanwhile, you...

1390
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,420
We just got to keep this guy occupied for two and a half minutes.

1391
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:10,460
Pig, pig, pig, pig man.

1392
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:12,220
Water bubbler.

1393
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:13,220
Water pig.

1394
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,820
Bubbler the water pig.

1395
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:17,220
You hear...

1396
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,220
Say the whole thing.

1397
00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:19,620
Bubbler the water pig.

1398
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,220
You hear the nurse make sort of a surprise yelp.

1399
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:26,480
(laughing)

1400
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:32,780
- What do you mean a surprised Yelp?

1401
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:35,920
- Like a ah.

1402
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,060
- Yeah, like that.

1403
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:40,660
- And then you hear some other noises

1404
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,320
that you ain't never heard before.

1405
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:47,300
- I'm sniffing the crack in the door.

1406
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:48,940
(laughing)

1407
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:49,780
I'm just going.

1408
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,940
- Is he hitting it from the back?

1409
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,220
- I can smell it 'cause it smells like wing stop.

1410
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,700
- Roll to see if you can tell what he's doing.

1411
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:02,580
- Roll the smell check.

1412
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,220
- Roll insight, I guess.

1413
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,620
Or roll, yeah sure, insight.

1414
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:08,140
31, yeah.

1415
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,540
You rolled a D100.

1416
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,380
- Oh, I didn't mean to.

1417
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:12,740
I thought I'd get a D20.

1418
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,020
- Cool. - Oh, I got the reverse.

1419
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:16,020
I got 13.

1420
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:19,940
- He's doing something not very Christian,

1421
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,940
but everyone seems to be enjoying themselves.

1422
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:28,820
- Mommy don't know, dad is getting hot.

1423
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,660
- Yep.

1424
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,940
- I'm singing that in pig. - At the pokey stop.

1425
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,280
- Oh my god.

1426
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,740
- And meanwhile, the doctor now is bringing Yusmoku

1427
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,860
to the healing station.

1428
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:46,560
And he starts to hear loud noises going on

1429
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,480
in one of the rooms where people get attended to.

1430
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,480
- I shoot, I use my attack in a non-damaging way.

1431
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:59,760
I use smoke shoot and I shoot smoke into his mouth

1432
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,000
to get him high as fuck.

1433
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,200
- Okay, cool.

1434
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,360
- And then I turn on, I use my universal Roku remote

1435
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,200
to change all of the heart monitors in the hospital

1436
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,800
to be playing Planet Earth.

1437
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:10,640
- Damn.

1438
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,520
- You use the smoke shoot, it gets in his eyes,

1439
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:18,360
Oh! Nurse, can someone get this creature in a Pokeball quickly?

1440
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:20,360
I just need to...

1441
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:24,720
You see a nurse walk over to try to get you in a Pokeball.

1442
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,200
Meanwhile, you, Water Pig, see...

1443
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:34,600
The nurse walks out, she's kind of in a daze.

1444
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,600
Her hair is askew.

1445
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:39,000
She's pulling down her nurse's...

1446
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Yeah, she's doing that.

1447
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:48,560
And you see he see the machoke and he is uh he is a like on the ceiling like spider-man

1448
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:57,680
And he falls he lands on his back and he's got a raging boner

1449
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,920
Still yeah - man

1450
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:04,480
Any I get I flick his boner till it goes away

1451
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,780
Okay, it slowly goes down and he

1452
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,720
He looks to you, and he goes do good

1453
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,760
and

1454
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,160
Just like that guys

1455
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,360
We are going to have an empire over this planet

1456
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,860
Yeah, well we need him to do it twice so so we can make them mate with each other

1457
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:26,840
That's a good point to make sure they're both women - or both

1458
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:29,800
Male and female or you need to get other Pokemon

1459
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:34,360
So that there's less because otherwise you're gonna start getting inbreeding shit, and they're gonna be all fine

1460
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:36,000
- They do in the Bible. - What's wrong with that?

1461
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,400
- Yeah, but you're not gonna get a good army out of that.

1462
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:38,240
- That's true, also.

1463
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,880
- It's not about an army, it's just about

1464
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,240
getting more people than the other people.

1465
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,840
- Exodus 620, Amorim as his wife,

1466
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,920
Jochebed his father's sister,

1467
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,600
and she bore him Aaron and Moses.

1468
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,680
You think Moses was fucking inbred?

1469
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,520
- He was. - It sounds like

1470
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,520
he literally was, yeah, just based on that.

1471
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:58,320
- But you mean that he was like stupid type of inbred?

1472
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,560
- I guess not, yeah.

1473
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,200
- He built a boat.

1474
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,160
- No, it's Noah.

1475
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:04,000
- He opened all the exits.

1476
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,680
- Ophosus did other stuff.

1477
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,520
He ran around the desert.

1478
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,360
- He parted the seas.

1479
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,180
- He parted the Red Sea.

1480
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,020
- So similar.

1481
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,860
- Yeah.

1482
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:10,680
- All right, I guess it's--

1483
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,520
- But you gotta be a genius

1484
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,360
to do something like that. - Maybe these guys

1485
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,180
will have magic powers then.

1486
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:15,680
(laughing)

1487
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:16,960
- They can learn--

1488
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:18,840
- Sorry, my fucking mic unplugged.

1489
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:22,440
What were we exactly in the middle of?

1490
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,920
- We were debating incest.

1491
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,000
- Right. - Yeah.

1492
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,160
- Yes.

1493
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,600
- But, so okay.

1494
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,880
So the nurse is now pregnant at the desk.

1495
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:35,600
That just like happened in the last two minutes.

1496
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:36,440
- So that happened.

1497
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,360
- She's like, I have to go to the bathroom.

1498
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,320
So she runs to go to the bathroom.

1499
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:46,400
So here's the thing, it's gonna be an egg.

1500
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,000
- Fine by me.

1501
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,840
- You guys--

1502
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:52,000
- It could be like children of men.

1503
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,960
We could be like protecting the first Pokemon

1504
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,800
human hybrid egg.

1505
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,480
- Oh my God, that's such a good idea.

1506
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,080
- I would just say, like you guys should be like,

1507
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,440
- She's gonna be like, "Oh God, I fucked a Pokemon.

1508
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,520
"That's why an egg came out."

1509
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:06,360
You guys really cannot think of that?

1510
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,700
- Somebody fucked up an egg.

1511
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:10,080
- That would be, listen, if I was a girl

1512
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,600
and I had sex with someone and I laid an egg,

1513
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,840
my first thought wouldn't be that's a Pokemon

1514
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:16,400
that I fucked, it would be that there's something

1515
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,240
wrong with me, but like--

1516
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,960
- I fucked a chicken. - Oh my God, I have an egg.

1517
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,080
- Yeah, an egg came out of me for some weird reason.

1518
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,000
- Yeah, she might think she is a Pokemon.

1519
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,160
- Yeah.

1520
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,160
- So instead of her realizing what happened,

1521
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,500
You think and said she would...

1522
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,500
- Well, she might just not just instantly think

1523
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:35,340
that's what happened.

1524
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:38,180
Maybe she got through a few other explanations.

1525
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:40,100
- Maybe she thought that guy she just had sex with

1526
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,820
used, put an egg in her.

1527
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:44,980
- That's actually maybe true.

1528
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:48,900
- 'Cause why would he be a Pokemon?

1529
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:51,240
- Right, yeah, he was a pleasant, polite guy.

1530
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,160
- Yeah, he's--

1531
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:54,980
- With a strong command of the English language.

1532
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:57,500
- Yeah, and his this hurt.

1533
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:58,620
- Oh, he--

1534
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,780
- His duh.

1535
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,280
- His dog. - His dog.

1536
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,860
- His dog. - His dog.

1537
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,100
(laughing)

1538
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:10,340
- Cool, she runs to the bathroom, you hear a--

1539
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:11,180
- Plop.

1540
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,140
- Oh, no!

1541
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,060
- Dude, she's shit.

1542
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:17,580
- Don't, why are you such a shit?

1543
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,020
Bro, this is like a TV show,

1544
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:19,980
you're trying to show the characters

1545
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:21,220
going to the bathroom, man.

1546
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,340
- True. - You hear a plop,

1547
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,500
and then you hear,

1548
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:26,580
and when you hear like a second later,

1549
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:28,980
she gets off the toilet and you hear an egg fall.

1550
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:31,240
(laughter)

1551
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,200
- You hear a plop.

1552
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,740
- Yeah, you hear a plop, a flush, and then--

1553
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:37,580
- The second it does--

1554
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:38,640
- Oh my god, wait, an egg.

1555
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,480
- Wait, I have to sit back down again.

1556
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,740
- The second the egg plops out,

1557
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:47,200
your friend, Darren, his eyes like

1558
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,160
light up and he starts shaking,

1559
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,520
and he fucking bum rushes to bathroom

1560
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,920
and paternal instinct's kicking in.

1561
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:57,000
- Okay. - I just let him go.

1562
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,320
kicks down the door and you hear, wait, no, I don't let him go.

1563
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,560
I don't let him go. Then I don't let him go. Actually.

1564
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:07,480
I'm realizing the error of my ways. I stopped him. I stopped him and I go,

1565
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,720
and that means

1566
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:13,280
you have to make her think she pooped an egg.

1567
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,640
Yeah. She's just a regular poop.

1568
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,400
Maybe she ate an egg earlier and did she didn't digest it like a kernel of corn.

1569
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,760
He's like sort of like looking around like, and then just like,

1570
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,160
Like he kind of looks at you, kind of nods, and then like dashes for the door.

1571
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,120
Uh-huh.

1572
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,720
And he goes, "EH POOP!"

1573
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,820
And like reaches into the toilet and pulls out the egg.

1574
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:40,960
And you hear her scream.

1575
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:52,760
Well, look, she probably is embarrassed by this whole situation.

1576
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,120
She probably just wants to be rid of this egg, right?

1577
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:04,120
And he's just like, sort of like, running to the bathroom and crapping his shit.

1578
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:08,120
This guy that just fucked craps his own crap on the sheet.

1579
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,120
And then he sits on it.

1580
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:13,120
Am I the asshole?

1581
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,120
That's funny.

1582
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:15,120
Yeah.

1583
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:21,120
Am I the asshole that craps the girl that I just hooked up with's poop out of the toilet?

1584
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:28,120
it

1585
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:29,320
She's like yelling.

1586
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,420
He's holding the egg in front of her and says,

1587
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,620
"Poop! You poop!"

1588
00:59:32,620 --> 00:59:33,820
And then like...

1589
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,020
I grab the egg too.

1590
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,520
I also, I grab the egg out of his hand and I go...

1591
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,720
You're eating the poop, man?

1592
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:46,420
I'm not helping at all.

1593
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,320
Yeah, you...

1594
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,920
I'm grabbing it.

1595
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,020
I'm just like trying to make the whole situation seem normal.

1596
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:54,020
So I pick up the poop and I'm just like...

1597
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,260
(laughing)

1598
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:00,260
- Put the egg in a Pokeball, man.

1599
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,100
- Yeah.

1600
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:01,940
- Oh, that's a good idea.

1601
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:02,760
- Oh, I could do that.

1602
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:03,820
- Or an incubator.

1603
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:04,660
- Yeah.

1604
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,220
- They have incubators at the Poke place.

1605
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:07,060
- A Pokeball is safer though.

1606
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,420
- A Pokeball is basically the incubator, so.

1607
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:10,340
- Oh, okay.

1608
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,180
- Yeah.

1609
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:13,540
- So you put the egg in the Pokeball,

1610
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:15,460
and she sort of has an instinct of like,

1611
01:00:15,460 --> 01:00:16,300
trying to reach out for it.

1612
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,340
- Putting her poop in the Pokeball.

1613
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:18,180
- She's like.

1614
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,860
(laughing)

1615
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:21,740
- Filling all my friends Pokeballs with shit

1616
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,980
- And then, Moriarty goes to his big gym battle.

1617
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:25,660
(laughing)

1618
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,860
- I do that.

1619
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:29,300
- Yeah, and she's just sort of like rattled,

1620
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:33,620
and he goes up to her and he puts his hand on her face

1621
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:37,340
and like, like, touches it and then runs

1622
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:40,300
and then crashes out the window of the bathroom.

1623
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:42,740
(laughing)

1624
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:44,580
- I'm a champ.

1625
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:47,620
- So yeah, you guys might wanna go see what he's up to.

1626
01:00:47,620 --> 01:00:48,460
Or you guys can--

1627
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,300
- No, he doesn't matter much anymore.

1628
01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:50,980
- He did his job, he did his job.

1629
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,620
- Yeah. - Okay, yeah.

1630
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,820
- And we're on the, what, 30th floor anyway?

1631
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:55,820
He's probably dead.

1632
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,660
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1633
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:01,740
- That's the sad truth.

1634
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,040
- You guys now have this egg.

1635
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:08,140
It is going to hatch in 1,000 steps, I think we calculated.

1636
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,300
- Yeah, that's 10 minutes of walking,

1637
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:12,260
according to my Google search. - Let's get our steps in, man.

1638
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:13,460
- Yeah. - Risk walking.

1639
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:15,980
- Yeah, you guys ready to see what happens

1640
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,660
when this thing hatches? - Yeah, let's just take

1641
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,940
really small steps really fast so that it goes quicker.

1642
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,700
- Oh yeah, like ding ding ding ding ding ding.

1643
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:23,500
- Oh my god, let's walk in a circle.

1644
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:25,620
You guys, we will walk in a circle.

1645
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,100
- And if we're all walking together,

1646
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,980
it's three times the steps.

1647
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,340
- People won't think it's weird.

1648
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:32,900
- And wait, most of us have four legs.

1649
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,300
- Oh my god, you guys, no no no no no.

1650
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:40,060
We will put on a special presentation for the hospital

1651
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,660
and we are all gonna do the game plan.

1652
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:43,580
- We don't want them to see this, oh.

1653
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,100
- No, they're gonna kill our baby if they see it.

1654
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,380
- Oh no wait, the Machamp jumped out the window.

1655
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:51,600
I was gonna say we could have him,

1656
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:54,040
we could have him come say like,

1657
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,040
and here I am with my traveling Pokemon.

1658
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,080
- He can't say that, you know he can't say that shit.

1659
01:01:59,080 --> 01:01:59,920
- He would say, me duh duh.

1660
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,680
- We could say it, I mean we could roll to see

1661
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,400
if he says it and then--

1662
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:07,560
- No, we're outside, we're walking in a circle.

1663
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:10,720
- All right, well the can can was a good way

1664
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:15,720
to get all the steps in, but I guess just F me, I guess.

1665
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,080
- You can do the can can still, outside.

1666
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:19,480
- I'm gonna do the can-can, okay.

1667
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:21,280
- Away from the prime eyes of the humans

1668
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,000
who wanna take away our new genetic anomaly

1669
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,840
that we've developed. - Then I do it.

1670
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:25,660
Then I do it.

1671
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,120
I'm standing and I'm doing the can-can.

1672
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:27,960
- Why don't you roll performance?

1673
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,720
- Make him roll. - Roll Riz.

1674
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,720
Make him roll, Patches.

1675
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,680
- I roll Riz.

1676
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,800
- 11.

1677
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,040
- It's like a serviceable,

1678
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,480
sometimes you miss a,

1679
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,840
you're supposed to put up the knee, but you do the leg.

1680
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:46,720
- It's like I'm doing the can-can on Lip Sync Battle.

1681
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:53,460
Mm-hmm. No, you're gonna have to worry. It's just it's mostly it's like when Tom Holland did the

1682
01:02:53,460 --> 01:03:00,160
Umbrella dance and it was just like, you know, he's missing. He's fucking up the choreo, but he's mostly got it

1683
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:07,380
Yeah, I haven't seen that. I hate to say it. Yeah, I mean so what you're saying is it's a bad dancing job is no

1684
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:09,580
No, no, no, no it cuz it impressed service

1685
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:12,080
It impressed

1686
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:15,400
Zendaya somewhere, her heart's aflutter.

1687
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,760
- Uh-huh, Zendaya is impressed.

1688
01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:18,600
- By this pig.

1689
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,280
And you guys hatch.

1690
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,240
(laughing)

1691
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:26,920
- Somewhere Zendaya turned to Tom Holland and said,

1692
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,940
"I just got impressed by a pig."

1693
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:31,840
(laughing)

1694
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:35,540
- All right, okay, actually I kinda want this to be

1695
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,000
a collaborative thing.

1696
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,080
What do we think this guy looks like, this baby?

1697
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:44,440
- I think that he looks, he has no belly button,

1698
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,240
like KyleXY. - So it's a guy.

1699
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:50,040
- And he, it's definitely a guy,

1700
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,960
'cause Machamp is a guy.

1701
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,560
Oh wait, but his mom's a girl.

1702
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:56,960
- I guess then it would mix together

1703
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,440
and be something halfway.

1704
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:01,560
- Okay, so it's half guy, half girl.

1705
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,840
- Yeah. - Okay.

1706
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,720
- So it's girl from the-- - Like a Pokemon.

1707
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,080
- From the wheels up, the waist up.

1708
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:08,920
- Wheels. - It has wheels.

1709
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,800
- It has wheels. - It has wheels.

1710
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,280
- It's a handicap kid.

1711
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,160
- It's born and it does completely as wheels.

1712
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,000
It's a robot.

1713
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:16,840
(laughing)

1714
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:19,360
- It's a woman for the wheel.

1715
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,500
- It's like a two completely different species

1716
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:23,600
of Pokemon breed and they make a third

1717
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:24,960
completely different thing.

1718
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,640
We've just, it's a car.

1719
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,900
(laughing)

1720
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:30,600
It's a car with a human head.

1721
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,440
- It's the first ever car type Pokemon.

1722
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,280
- Yeah.

1723
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,120
- With a human head like an ornament,

1724
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,760
like a hood ornament on the top.

1725
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,560
- Looks sort of like a--

1726
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,280
- It looks like a baby's head because it was just born.

1727
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,120
- Yeah.

1728
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,120
- It looks sort of like a,

1729
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:46,520
what's the clown from Twisted Metal?

1730
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:48,520
- Yeah, Sweet Tooth.

1731
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,360
- Sweet Tooth, it looks like Sweet Tooth.

1732
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:51,560
- It looks like Sweet Tooth's car.

1733
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,660
- But a baby.

1734
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:53,500
- Yeah.

1735
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:54,400
- In the head.

1736
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,080
And so it's a really tiny car right now,

1737
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,720
so it's like a little Hot Wheel.

1738
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,140
- It's like one of the, yeah, perfect.

1739
01:05:00,140 --> 01:05:02,560
Okay, he's going in the cookie bowl.

1740
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:03,560
- But it's gonna grow fast.

1741
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,520
No, come on, what does he actually look like?

1742
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:06,920
Come on, what does he look like?

1743
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:07,760
- That's what he looks like.

1744
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:09,760
It's just a Machamp with boobs.

1745
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:10,760
(laughter)

1746
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,760
Boobs?

1747
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,760
Patrick, that's a newborn baby.

1748
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:14,760
No, it's a Pokemon.

1749
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:15,760
Yeah, it's a Pokemon.

1750
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,760
It doesn't matter what it looks like.

1751
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,760
He's not saying he likes the boobs, man.

1752
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:19,760
No, no, I don't like it.

1753
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:22,760
It's just, yeah, I'm talking about genetics.

1754
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:26,760
(laughter)

1755
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,760
Yeah, it's got boobs.

1756
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:28,760
I don't like boobs.

1757
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:29,760
It's just sign us.

1758
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:33,760
It's a blue Machamp with long blonde hair and white boobs.

1759
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:34,760
Yeah.

1760
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,760
Plain, plain white boobs.

1761
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:41,760
There's nothing wrong with plain white boobs.

1762
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:46,760
Cool. Alright. I think it's either that or a car.

1763
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:51,760
Now the car is sounding pretty good to him, huh?

1764
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:56,760
Now you like the car.

1765
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:01,760
I just think that's the best Pokemon anyone came up with in a long time.

1766
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,680
- Car with a head.

1767
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,200
- All right, so this is the beginning of your guys' journey

1768
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:10,220
to, I guess, destroy all humans with your sort of like

1769
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:14,360
twisted metal Pokemon creations.

1770
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:15,800
- That's cool. - Okay.

1771
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,400
- Yeah, I think this is a good trial run.

1772
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,720
I wanted to see what this would play like.

1773
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:21,200
It kind of basically did exactly what I thought,

1774
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,160
which was take whatever I had planned

1775
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,960
and throw it in directly--

1776
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:29,060
- I bet you didn't think three buttoned up nerds like us

1777
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,560
would spend so much time breeding during a session

1778
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,680
like this, did you?

1779
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:34,020
And yet here we are.

1780
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,840
- I thought you guys were gonna do a lot more math,

1781
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,400
so that was really surprising.

1782
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,240
- No math, man.

1783
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:43,200
- But next time we do Pokemon though,

1784
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:47,760
maybe we'll do something a little bit more interesting.

1785
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,800
- Can we go to Poop Brown Town?

1786
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,000
- We can go to Poop Brown Town, for example.

1787
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,920
- Okay, I always wanted them to put that in the game.

1788
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:56,360
- That's just somebody's house.

1789
01:06:56,360 --> 01:06:58,420
Poop Brown Town. - Yeah, it's your house.

1790
01:06:58,420 --> 01:06:59,760
- Mr. Poop Brown Town.

1791
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,520
I was on your side and you went and you changed it.

1792
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,200
- I'm just telling you what nationality you are.

1793
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,920
- I'm not brown.

1794
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:09,880
- You're poop.

1795
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:12,120
- It's not a nationality anyway.

1796
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,880
- Give me a nation of brown.

1797
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:15,140
- Nation of brown.

1798
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:17,280
- I thought it was.

1799
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:21,720
- Now we can talk about, okay, bye guys.

1800
01:07:21,720 --> 01:07:22,560
- Bye. - Bye.

1801
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:29,760
- Is it unattractive to women when you throw your back out?

1802
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:30,600
- Yes.

1803
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,500
Really? Man, if you hurt yourself, that sucks.

1804
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:36,000
If you ever stub your toe, this is what you should do.

1805
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,400
You say, "I didn't stub my toe."

1806
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,000
Yeah.

1807
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,300
"I didn't stub my toe."

1808
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:41,300
"I didn't stub my toe."

1809
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,000
Number two.

1810
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,800
Wait, can I just ask your fans real quick?

1811
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,800
Lady fans, what is more attractive?

1812
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,300
When a man peels off his shirt like this and then kind of drops it?

1813
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,000
And then, you know, he's shirtless?

1814
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,600
Well, you just did that gayly.

1815
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah.

1816
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:53,400
Right.

1817
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,200
Okay, well, if he did that straightly...

1818
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,800
If someone did that straightly...

1819
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,300
- When he peels off his shirt?

1820
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:04,520
- Or if you just pop out of it.

1821
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:06,780
(laughing)

1822
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:10,580
- Do you mean rip out of it or do you mean

1823
01:08:10,580 --> 01:08:12,460
pop out of it as a different thing?

1824
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:13,300
- Like if you kind of flex.

1825
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:14,800
- Like you go like this, you go like this

1826
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,560
and then you're next to all your clothes

1827
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,400
falling in a pile next to you.

1828
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,240
- Do you get raptured out of your clothes?

1829
01:08:20,240 --> 01:08:22,840
- Your nightcrawler bamps out of your clothes?

1830
01:08:22,840 --> 01:08:24,940
Oh, like you have clothes that are on you

1831
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:26,060
with suction cups?

1832
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:30,060
Like there's a tear on your e-flexor bicep and then your bicep pops out of that.

1833
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:33,060
I don't think a single person has ever done that.

1834
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:36,060
That necessitates having a very tiny shirt on for anybody.

1835
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:38,060
Right, well that's what I mean.

1836
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:41,060
What is it? More sexy when you peel off a tiny shirt?

1837
01:08:41,060 --> 01:08:44,060
If you're a woman, leave a comment down below.

1838
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:46,060
Address it to Pierce. Say "Dear Pierce."

1839
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:51,060
And then write what you think is sexy about a boy taking off his shirt or whatever.

1840
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:54,060
Is it sexy? Because I think it's sexy when a boy pops out.

1841
01:08:54,060 --> 01:09:04,060
The question is, so your question is, women, do you think it's sexier when a man takes off his shirt or explodes his clothes?

1842
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:10,060
Do you think it's sexier if a man explodes his clothes or takes his shirt off?

1843
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:13,060
Women, do you like it when a man pops out?

1844
01:09:13,060 --> 01:09:15,060
Pops out or takes his clothes out?

1845
01:09:15,060 --> 01:09:16,060
Do you like it when a man pops out at you?

1846
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:17,060
Or slides?

1847
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,060
Slides or pops?

1848
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,060
Do you like it when a man slides on you?
