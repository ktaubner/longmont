1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
(laughter)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,180
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,040
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,880
- You better not say what you--

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,720
- Chucky, Chucky Cameron.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,540
- Don't say that.

9
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,380
- Checkin' out my toilet.

10
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:16,220
Check out my toilet.

11
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:17,040
- Stop, please, Chucky Cameron.

12
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
- You wanna play with my toilet?

13
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:19,380
- You wanna play a game with my toilet?

14
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,220
- That's not a real--

15
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,040
- You wanna play?

16
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,240
- I'm small enough that I can fit in my own toilet.

17
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:23,080
- No.

18
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,920
- I'm Chucky Cameron.

19
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,740
- The toilet's big.

20
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,580
- I'm not small.

21
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:26,420
- Chucky Cameron's not small.

22
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,240
- I'm small.

23
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,440
- And also Chucky Cameron doesn't exist.

24
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,280
- Chucky Cameron.

25
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,460
It's me Chuckie Cameron. You wanna play the game?

26
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,900
You can only play it when you're peeing into my toilet that I'm in. Chuckie Cameron wouldn't say that.

27
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,640
I'm Chuckie Cameron and I would say that. No. You bitch. Wait, what does he say?

28
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,640
Chuckie? Yeah, Chuckie when he gets to the toilet. I think Chuckie goes like, "You stupid bitch, you want to suck my dick? You wanna fuck with me?"

29
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,280
He says, "If you'll excuse me, I have a date with a six-year-old boy." So Chuckie Cameron says he has a date with a six-year-old boy.

30
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,280
I thought Chuckie says that. I thought Chuckie's thing is like, "Heh heh heh, I farted."

31
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,000
Isn't that Chucky's thing?

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,400
No I think that's Caleb's thing.

33
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,400
No.

34
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
No I guess.

35
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm getting farted up in your room.

36
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,200
Your cord is fucked up.

37
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,200
Let me get the other one.

38
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Oh my god dude.

39
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,200
I'll just pause.

40
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Oh I think that I found myself Chucky Cameron.

41
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,200
I'm a melted toy.

42
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
I'm a fucking freak.

43
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
I think he says that.

44
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:17,200
I got blood and I'm a toy.

45
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Yeah I think he said.

46
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,200
I got blood and I'm a toy.

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,360
I'm Chucky Cameron.

48
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,560
My toy knife is sharp.

49
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
I think he said that too.

50
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,560
Chucky.

51
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,560
I thought it was funny.

52
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,560
Chucky Cameron isn't a thing.

53
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,200
- It's funny that Chucky has like a little,

54
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,840
like an actual little knife.

55
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,740
- You would give off, honestly, I'm gonna be honest,

56
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,300
I mean this might be true about anybody,

57
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,900
if you were a foot and a half tall,

58
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,600
you would low-key give off Chucky vibes.

59
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,800
- I don't think that would be true.

60
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:42,980
- I think I would probably give off more like Gnome.

61
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,740
- No, you would be Chucky.

62
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,580
- I think I'd be more of a Gnome.

63
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,040
- You'd be Gnome named Norm.

64
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,360
- If you had a--

65
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,360
- You'd be like, "Oh, big rounders."

66
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,840
- If you were a foot and a half tall,

67
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,060
you had overalls on and a scar, I think you might low-key, like, just thinking about it,

68
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,160
you might give off some Chucky vibes to someone like me.

69
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,760
I don't think that I would do that.

70
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,760
Okay.

71
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,760
I don't think...

72
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,680
I think I might see you in, like, at first, even though I know you, at first, from the

73
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,760
back, I might be like, "That might be Chucky."

74
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:13,520
If you saw me in overalls, I would probably give off tiny farmer vibes.

75
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,520
Yeah.

76
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,520
No.

77
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
If I was really small and wearing overalls.

78
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
No, you don't have a sweet look to you.

79
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,160
You have a diabolical look.

80
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,040
I would look sweet if I was small.

81
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,040
If I'm sitting in my bathtub and I'm holding...

82
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,440
I was really small I would be cute and adorable. Which one of us would look the cutest?

83
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,560
Me? I would look like a literal baby. No you wouldn't. You would not. Yeah but you'd have the face of a grown man.

84
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,080
You would look like a baby. Yeah you'd look like

85
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,880
somebody like pretending to be a baby to like get into somebody's house.

86
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:44,080
You'd be like, "Ooooh." Oh dude, wait, has anyone... I know that people do that thing where they're like

87
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,200
like there's been a couple people who pretend to be like a missing kid. Yeah.

88
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:55,880
and then like go to the movie Orphan. Yeah. Is there anybody who is like a really small person

89
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:01,640
and pretended to be a baby? Yeah, you. Yeah. Might be a good idea. That could work. Yeah,

90
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,280
I'm a baby. Why is our baby not growing? Yeah. Yeah. Well, you would be growing too.

91
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,440
It has to happen, right? No. Someone pretending to be a baby, a midge,

92
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,800
babying up, has to happen, dude. A midge? I'm not going to say the full word.

93
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,920
It feels worse.

94
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
Yeah.

95
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,920
Okay.

96
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Okay.

97
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
All right.

98
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
He's trying.

99
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
He's testing the waters.

100
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I don't know.

101
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
I mean, yeah.

102
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
A little baby, I think you're supposed to call that.

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,920
A baby person?

104
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,920
Yeah.

105
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
They want a person of baby.

106
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,920
Yeah.

107
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Yeah.

108
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,920
No.

109
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,920
No, that's so disrespectful.

110
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
I take everything back that I said.

111
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,920
Because like they don't wear diapers all the time.

112
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Yeah.

113
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,920
Right?

114
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:39,920
Yeah.

115
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Yeah.

116
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,920
Yeah.

117
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
Yeah.

118
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Yeah.

119
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Yeah.

120
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:45,920
Yeah.

121
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Yeah.

122
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,280
Have you guys been since I've been gone?

123
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,560
Honestly, I was telling him earlier, I have never, since you moved here, there's not been

124
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,680
five days where I spent less money than when you were gone.

125
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,680
Yeah?

126
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
Yeah.

127
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,880
I literally spent $10 in five days and I was like, "He needs to go out of town like every

128
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
week."

129
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,960
I was like, "Oh my God, I'm rich.

130
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,560
If Matt didn't live anywhere near me, I would be a millionaire."

131
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
Shit.

132
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Yeah.

133
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
and sobbing and lonely.

134
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,560
- It's true, I went to the big needle.

135
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,060
I went to Seattle.

136
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:24,060
Thank you Mike and Lindsey for having me.

137
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,900
- Thank you very much.

138
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,560
- That was his host friend time.

139
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,060
- He was doing a podcaster's exchange program

140
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,060
where he switched with a 12 year old boy

141
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,060
who had a Minecraft podcast.

142
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,060
- Yep.

143
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,060
- Caleb got to house the boy.

144
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,060
- Yeah, at Mumpits.

145
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,560
- It's like everyone's dream.

146
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,060
- No, you have a grandma bed.

147
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,560
Don't try to hide your grandma bed.

148
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,880
I would swap out my grandma bed for,

149
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,280
dude, I need to pitch bunk beds to Jana.

150
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,120
Yeah.

151
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,940
'Cause she fucking--

152
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,780
That would fit the aesthetic.

153
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,620
She's literally, it would, right?

154
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,580
Yeah, you could get like, yeah, big like,

155
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,960
grandma bunk bed.

156
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,720
Or you could get like three cots next to each other

157
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,320
and we could all sleep there whenever we wanted.

158
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,160
Dude, she's just a fucking, she's a maniac.

159
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,400
She's a freak in the sheets in the way

160
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,280
that she just pushes you off the bed

161
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,720
when you're trying to go to sleep.

162
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,560
Yeah.

163
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
I need a bunk situation bed.

164
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,040
- Or I just need to break up with her and move out.

165
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,880
- Yeah.

166
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,720
- Yeah.

167
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,540
- Might be a good idea.

168
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,000
- Or yeah, you could like put on,

169
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,320
you could make yourself really heavy before you go to bed.

170
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,480
- You could get a weighted blanket.

171
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,640
- Yeah, you could eat a lot of food

172
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,600
or you could wear like armor to bed or something,

173
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,040
but then it would be harder to push you around.

174
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,560
- You guys have weighted blankets?

175
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,600
I have one.

176
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,440
- No.

177
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,260
- I have a 10 pound blanket.

178
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,500
- We used to have one, but we got rid of it.

179
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,340
- I slept under one.

180
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,760
- It's not heavy enough for me.

181
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,020
- I slept under one one time at my brother's house

182
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,640
and I had a dream that I was being crushed by a car.

183
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,640
- Yeah. - Yeah.

184
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,120
- All right, yeah.

185
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,940
- I was doing this bit this weekend.

186
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,120
Me and Mike were talking about Austin Powers.

187
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,080
Oh, did I show you guys my Austin Powers Mike got me?

188
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,280
- No. - We went to this flea market

189
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,840
and he found this Austin Powers plush doll.

190
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,360
- Oh my God. - Oh wait, yeah, wait,

191
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,760
hold on, I forgot to tell you guys this.

192
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,080
- Yeah, tell.

193
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,000
- Do tell, pray tell.

194
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,220
- So big news, big appearance for me.

195
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:14,660
I was leaving, it was this thing called the Punk Rot Flea Market.

196
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
I bet that's seriously cool.

197
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,580
It had the Austin Powers plush doll there.

198
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,420
It's what got me that we were leaving.

199
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:27,620
I'm standing outside getting a pic of it and this woman comes up to me and she has like

200
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,180
two cameras with her.

201
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,180
She's like, "Oh, what?

202
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,980
Can I take a picture of you and your doll?"

203
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,700
I was like, "Oh, okay."

204
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Wow.

205
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,700
People of Seattle?

206
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:43,660
he took a photo of me on two cameras and says, "I work for the South Seattle Emerald."

207
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,660
No way.

208
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,660
Wow.

209
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,460
So there's going to be a photo of me in the South Seattle Emerald.

210
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,220
Look for me in there in the South Seattle Emerald.

211
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,220
It's going to be great.

212
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,100
It's a big moment for me.

213
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:59,900
They would never take a photo of me with the kind of things that I find at a flea market.

214
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,940
It's going to be me holding an Austin Powers doll in the South Seattle Emerald.

215
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:04,940
That'll be big, dude.

216
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,940
Headline, yeah.

217
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,940
We were doing...

218
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,100
Weird freak found on the streets.

219
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,100
Does not belong here.

220
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Weirdest guy.

221
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
We need to kill him.

222
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,100
Yeah.

223
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
F-file detective.

224
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,100
No.

225
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,300
But before we found that, we were doing this bit where it's like you tell someone you're

226
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,180
about to do this, like, "Oh, do you want to hear my Austin Powers impression?"

227
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,180
Yeah.

228
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,180
And you just do Alan Alda's voice.

229
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,180
Yeah.

230
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,180
It's just like...

231
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,180
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:34,260
I hate to ask this, but do I make you Randy, baby?

233
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,260
Do I make you horny?

234
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:39,980
I like that you have, that's probably the third time you've told me about something you've done

235
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,820
and it's just something in Alan Alda voice because that's your go-to.

236
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sorry to bother you but can I have a one million dollars?

237
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:53,100
He's more polite than anyone in that movie. Yeah.

238
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,380
Yeah, I'm the fat bastard. I'm here to eat your baby.

239
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,900
Basically, I'm the fat bastard.

240
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,100
I'm the fattest bastard of all time and I would absolutely love to eat your baby.

241
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,300
What's that one line, blimey or kibble?

242
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,140
What?

243
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,820
Blimey or kibble from your coaster?

244
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,860
Oh, oh, core blimey, yeah.

245
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,540
Blimey, or kibble.

246
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,780
Does it say or kibble?

247
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,620
No.

248
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,980
It says something kibble.

249
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,700
I don't forget a kibble, man.

250
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,540
Come on.

251
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,160
A kibble would be a hard word to make up.

252
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,260
The fat bastard coaster that I have just says,

253
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,740
there's something mentally wrong with me.

254
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,980
(laughing)

255
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:38,500
It's not even a recognizable quote.

256
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,700
It's just like, "No, I don't remember fat bastard saying there's something mentally

257
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,700
wrong with me at all."

258
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,700
There's something mentally wrong with me.

259
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,700
But also you could picture him saying it.

260
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
There's something mentally wrong with me.

261
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,900
I would picture him more saying there's something physically wrong with me.

262
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,140
Yeah, it's like, yeah, you want to start with how you're the biggest, fattest guy I've ever

263
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,660
seen you fucking piece of shit.

264
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:02,260
The other thing is like the gold member one doesn't say like, "I love gold," or like,

265
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:08,020
smoke in a pancake it says I've completely forgotten what I just said

266
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:13,180
so I think that maybe these were being dictated by somebody who contracted

267
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:21,540
Alzheimer's yeah in the middle yeah exactly what I just said you know you

268
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,540
sell to do like Amazon m-turk for like extra money yeah did you ever do any of

269
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,060
the transcription stuff yeah like a little bit yeah where they would play

270
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,320
like the task was like they play 10 seconds of like an old movie or

271
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,020
something and you're supposed to like put what it's supposed to say and they

272
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:41,340
don't check any of it. Yeah. You can just put anything. Well that's because I'll watch like movies on

273
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,020
Amazon that clearly only like 10 people have ever watched and like see that

274
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:52,060
there's a mistake in the subtitles and be like oh yeah I get it now. I did that too.

275
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,020
Amazon what? Amazon Mturk? Mechanical Turk. I mean it was like I was so broke in college

276
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:02,620
to just like I would spend my extra time at my job where I was like if I had

277
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,760
access to a computer doing these like tasks for Amazon that not for Amazon

278
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,880
Amazon is a marketplace for like people hire people to do you basically work as

279
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,820
a computer slave and it's basically like two cents an hour it's like probably two

280
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,680
bucks an hour yeah damn but you can do it we could do it while we were at our

281
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,180
job our real job also so it was we're doubling up yeah yeah but it was this

282
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,340
- Wispod and Amazon Mturk.

283
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,420
- Yeah, it was a lot of crazy shit.

284
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,660
Like you would do like,

285
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,180
it was a lot of that kind of shit,

286
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,020
like transcription and then a lot of like marketing surveys.

287
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,860
- Yeah, the best part was to try and like luck

288
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,880
into like a high paying survey

289
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,040
by pretending that you were like the,

290
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,780
like it would be like a survey where like,

291
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,580
you'd have to be like a middle aged woman

292
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,860
with two children in order to take it.

293
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,020
But it like rewarded you like $5 for like a 10 minute survey.

294
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,620
So you'd have to try and answer the questions

295
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,060
and make them think that you like,

296
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,140
you have to guess what they want for the survey.

297
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,380
- The answers that got you into the good surveys

298
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,900
were Asian American, 35 years old,

299
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,740
three kids, $120,000 or more.

300
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,860
If you said that, that is like the survey golden goose, dude.

301
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,420
'Cause apparently those people are,

302
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,300
'cause why would, if you're making 120 grand a year

303
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,180
when you have like kids,

304
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,700
why would you be on Amazon M-Turk

305
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,420
fucking like filling out surveys?

306
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,100
So they gotta make it worth their while.

307
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,820
- Yeah, $5.

308
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,460
I'm trying to remember what the other tests were. There were stuff where like you had

309
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,420
to like look at pictures and like and like say yeah yeah a lot of them felt

310
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,620
like they were just like trying like it would it's like a test that they give

311
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,820
like a psychic child in a movie where it's like made me go crazy yeah look at

312
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:42,140
this yeah look at this picture of the of the devil and type in like five

313
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,480
adjectives yeah no it was like that it would show you like a picture of like

314
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,700
like roadkill and it would be like like what do you like this is this good or

315
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,940
bad yeah it would be like because you're trying to teach an AI like these things

316
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:53,940
are good, these things are bad.

317
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
So you basically did-

318
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,620
There were ones you had to draw stuff to, I think.

319
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,300
Yeah, there was that shit. But you know that job that everyone could play? They're like,

320
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,220
"Oh, we want to kill ourselves because we're the people who have to go on YouTube and remove

321
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,180
all the murder videos?"

322
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:10,140
Or Facebook, remove all the murder videos and stuff. We were basically doing that job

323
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:17,340
for $2 an hour sometimes. And it made me go completely insane. And I think in the year

324
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,580
and a half I did it, I think I made $800.

325
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,900
dollars. Yeah, I did not do it as much as you did it. I did it like very, very briefly.

326
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,340
You made $800 over the course of a year, so that's like...

327
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,900
I mean, and I was working, I did it every single day.

328
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,260
Yeah. Yeah, it was fucked up.

329
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,140
Yeah. It was not fun.

330
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,700
It's evil.

331
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,580
And then I had to, and then they don't withhold taxes, so then like, I had to like pay taxes on

332
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,540
it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

333
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,180
It's diabolical.

334
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,100
Well, the thing, it's nice when you're, when you have a job that's boring.

335
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,340
Yeah.

336
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:43,980
Because it's, yeah.

337
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,860
I guess, yeah.

338
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,460
It's just a, but yeah.

339
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,860
I should have been playing World of Warcraft. I could have made more money

340
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:53,740
leveling an account on runescape in that time and then selling it. That's true. I could have weighed like I made like literally

341
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:58,820
Way more money. Yeah. Yeah, but you would have to see all those cool pictures. That's true

342
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:01,240
I would have learned right from wrong as a hitman

343
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,740
You'd be a terrible hitman. I would have yeah, I would have

344
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,500
It's too obvious. I would be a great hitman. People you walk in people like people just Agent 47's here

345
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,020
If somebody like kind of real things to like oh

346
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:19,000
Maybe someone's trying to kill me and then they see me walk into the coffee shop that they're in they're leaving

347
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,980
I think they no one would suspect me of being the hitman, but I would do such a terrible terrible job

348
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,880
With the murder aspect. I don't think I would be silent or or like yeah

349
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,120
I like start to strangle someone and then like fart really loudly

350
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,840
Yeah, cuz you're trying to keep some deep cover so you're doing like

351
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:54,540
Healing you

352
00:13:54,540 --> 00:14:00,660
Well, the thing is if you walk into if somebody thinks that they're they're about to be killed and some guy walks into a restaurant goes

353
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:09,220
I'm in a pinwheel hat

354
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,420
Yeah, like a big lollipop.

355
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:19,060
A big lollipop with like a tight like, you know, like the suits that like bicyclists wear.

356
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:23,060
So I'm like, "Oh, I just got back from the Tour de France!"

357
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:26,260
It's just like they can't tell that I'm a hit man.

358
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,740
It's just like, "Oh, I got 67th place in the Tour de France!"

359
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,660
Yeah, they're like, "Oh, that's too many details.

360
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
You can't be lying."

361
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,680
I mean this guy must be kind of famous. I actually go up and get his autograph

362
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,940
I should get really close. I have like a big like belt buckle - that has just a gun

363
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:57,860
It's just like a gun like pointed straight, yeah, it's just like an AR-15

364
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,860
You're trying to play it off as a belt buckle

365
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,860
Oh this is my big Parisian belt buckle

366
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,860
Oh I got it after winning the tour

367
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,580
I did have to win the tour. Actually I was 67th place, the more modest place.

368
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,060
Yeah, I think the more background you give to somebody, the more likely it is that you're

369
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,060
going to kill them.

370
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,060
Yeah.

371
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
Yeah.

372
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
Yeah.

373
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,060
The more they're like, "Why are you telling me this shit?"

374
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
That's why dating is so hard.

375
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,420
I would walk into a coffee shop and I'd be like, "I pretty much didn't have a childhood

376
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:27,380
and nothing ever happened to me up until now. And there's really nothing interesting about

377
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,380
me in any way."

378
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,260
And they go, "You're a man I can trust."

379
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,260
Yeah.

380
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,260
I'm pretty much a blank slate.

381
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,260
Yeah.

382
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,020
- Basically, basically nothing ever just happened to me,

383
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,860
so like I just didn't do anything,

384
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,700
nothing really happened either.

385
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,280
- I was basically an orphan and I forgot 25 years

386
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,660
and then now I'm in this coffee shop right now.

387
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,380
- I was just chilling for a long time too.

388
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,300
- Also there's certain words that make me act up.

389
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,260
- Yeah, there's a barcode on the back of my head,

390
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,500
you wanna scan that shit?

391
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,320
- What do you, if Agent 47 went to the grocery store,

392
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,180
what do you think he gets rung up as?

393
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,740
- Mm, bananas, 'cause that guy's crazy.

394
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,620
- You think he gets bananas?

395
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,460
- Yeah, maybe.

396
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,820
- Yeah. - 'Cause that guy's loco.

397
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:03,180
- Yeah, damn coconut, 'cause I guess he--

398
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,180
- Probably a white coconut.

399
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,020
- Probably a shrimp.

400
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:06,860
- Probably a shrimp.

401
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,680
- A coconut.

402
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,520
- A young coconut.

403
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,360
- A melon.

404
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,180
- A melon maybe.

405
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,020
- An egg.

406
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,860
- A single egg.

407
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,900
(laughing)

408
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,140
- One white egg.

409
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,860
- Code for a single egg.

410
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,220
It's a gun, they don't sell them at the grocery store.

411
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,620
- Dude, that's probably what it is.

412
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,160
- Probably is a code for a gun.

413
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,480
- Yeah, that would be cool.

414
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,780
- It is cool that he has the barcode on the back of his head.

415
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:26,980
- I have never played those games.

416
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,540
Why'd they put a barcode on his head?

417
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:29,660
Let's be honest.

418
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,500
Like what is that?

419
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,900
- So he can purchase his services?

420
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,300
- I don't think that's how,

421
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,660
I don't think you explain that you need a Hitman

422
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,860
and then he's like, "Okay."

423
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,700
And he turns around.

424
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,340
- I need you to scan this first.

425
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,220
That's my price.

426
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,640
- No, no, no, no, don't swipe it, tap it.

427
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:47,100
It's a chip, you gotta put it in.

428
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,380
- You can scan it, it takes you to his website.

429
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,220
It's like a QR code.

430
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,940
- Oh, see nowadays if they made a Hitman game,

431
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,500
they haven't made one in 25 years.

432
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,940
If they made a Hitman game today,

433
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:58,140
it would be probably a QR code.

434
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,700
- Did I tell you guys about the time

435
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,260
I almost accidentally charged somebody

436
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,460
like five billion dollars. Did I tell that on the podcast before?

437
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,140
No, you told me it outside of this.

438
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:09,620
Okay, well I was working at the liquor store and with the way that barcode, the barcode

439
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,220
scanner works is you scan a barcode and it's like a number associated with it and it just

440
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:18,740
auto fills. It's actually a skew number, but it auto fills the skew number into the like

441
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,700
into just the text field, like whatever text field you have selected. So I like I was like

442
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:30,420
I accidentally had the price selected before I scanned it. It scanned in the skew number,

443
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:36,980
which is like you're like one five two nine six one five three and I came so

444
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:41,860
close to pressing the like finish and pay button like or like the charge and

445
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,940
it literally would have been like like like five hundred billion dollars.

446
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,640
It would have been so funny if that just like if it was on like like a debit

447
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,700
card that like it it went through like it like you just overdrafted. Yeah,

448
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,800
- $500 million?

449
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,640
- I didn't notice.

450
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,480
- Dude.

451
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,080
- That would be so sick.

452
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,840
- So, 'cause the person didn't notice

453
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,080
'cause I canceled it in time,

454
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,760
but I just stood there, just scanned the thing,

455
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,960
and just going like, oh!

456
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,480
Just 'cause I realized how much of a close call it was.

457
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,800
I was just laughing, all like ringing them up.

458
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,640
- That would have been so good.

459
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,480
- It was so funny.

460
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,680
- That's why we should get a Square Reader.

461
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,520
- Yeah.

462
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,340
- And tip, please.

463
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,180
- Yeah.

464
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,020
(laughing)

465
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,840
- We should get a tip.

466
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,360
- Dude, that is such a good scam,

467
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,400
is just get a Square Reader

468
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,580
and just charge people a lot of money without telling them.

469
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,180
You guys get one of the small ones

470
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,360
that like attaches to your phone

471
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,860
and be like, "Oh, my phone screen's broken

472
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
"so you can't really read it."

473
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,700
But just put it--

474
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,900
- Well, dude, I get freaked out

475
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,260
'cause I just got a new debit card

476
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,580
and it's one of these tapping ones.

477
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:40,420
- I gotta get a new debit card, dude.

478
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,620
- I just got one and--

479
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,920
- Did I show you mine?

480
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,760
- No.

481
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,580
- It's so fucked.

482
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,140
- I got the, I just got a new one

483
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,220
and it's a tapping one and those like,

484
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:51,500
you just get it close to the thing.

485
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,340
- Yeah.

486
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,660
- So like if I, if somebody just like--

487
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,060
- Yeah, yeah, if somebody had those

488
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,900
and just held it.

489
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,720
- Just put it near me.

490
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560
- No, it's crazy.

491
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,500
- And they wouldn't be able to get much money.

492
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,300
- That's why I like you doing the tap,

493
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,800
when it's tapping, I like using my phone

494
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,640
'cause I have to like--

495
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,460
- Oh yeah, yours is fucked.

496
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,300
- Yeah, my credit card's so fucked.

497
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,120
- Yeah, that is fucked.

498
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,060
- It's about to snap at the thing too.

499
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,900
- Just get a new one.

500
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,760
- I was trying to buy, I made my,

501
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,720
I couldn't sleep last night and mimosas make me sleepy,

502
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,100
so I tried to buy mimosas and I had to put it

503
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,140
on my credit card.

504
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,980
- Mimosas make you sleepy?

505
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,800
- Yeah.

506
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,640
- What?

507
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,460
- Why don't you just buy like melatonin?

508
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,460
of them and then I think they make you sleepy because you usually have them in

509
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,760
the morning yeah it's and you're like oh I should be awake right now but I'm

510
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,920
drunk yeah yeah that's in you know what it is I usually have mimosas at

511
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,680
Christmas too so I'm up early dude cuz I'm so excited about the presents we did

512

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,400
Christmas because I think is disrespectful to the Santa Claus yeah

515
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,320
It's not disrespectful to Santa.

516
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
It's very disrespectful to Santa.

517
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,320
What do you think?

518
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,000
You give Santa eggnog, he drunk drives.

519
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,640
No, you give him milk.

520
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,840
No, you give him eggnog.

521
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:00,840
You give him milk.

522
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,800
By the end of the night, you know Santa faded by the end of Christmas morning.

523
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
He isn't.

524
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
He doesn't do that.

525
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
He's swerving that sleigh.

526
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
He's like, "Skrrr."

527
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
That's not true.

528
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
Don't say that about Santa Claus.

529
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

530
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Poor kids don't get presents.

531
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Well, I guess that's that.

532
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
God, fuck 'em.

533
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
I don't need to do this 'til next year.

534
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
I guess I know two guys who aren't getting presents this year.

535
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
Yeah.

536
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
I don't have a brother.

537
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
I don't have a brother.

538
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I don't have a brother.

539
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
I grew up.

540
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
You're not getting a present from me this year.

541
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
I grew up and I don't get presents anymore.

542
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,800
You're not getting a present from me this year either.

543
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
What?

544
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
Not from you?

545
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
What the fuck?

546
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
I got, I, you know.

547
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,440
I don't give a shit about Santa, but you?

548
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,200
You guys were really disrespectful towards Christmas just now.

549
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
Which one of you gave me a gnome outfit last Christmas?

550
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
That was me.

551
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,200
Oh, yeah.

552
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,400
And you gave me a Paw Patrol helmet.

553
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,960
Yeah, which I've never seen you wear.

554
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
It's too small.

555
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
So?

556
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,640
I can't put it on my fucking head.

557
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,640
Also, don't shrink your head.

558
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,480
- You drank your head.

559
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,280
- You didn't even take a single picture with it ever.

560
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,480
- I did take a photo with it, I showed it to you.

561
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,560
- No you didn't.

562
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,120
- He took a picture of my gnome suit.

563
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,960
- He did, he loved the gnome suit.

564
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,840
- The gnome suit was way better, dude.

565
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,680
- Yeah, see this--

566
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,520
- It's a way better gift.

567
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,480
- I'm definitely not getting you a present this year.

568
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,320
- I'm gonna get you one.

569
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,880
- You didn't even, you didn't get me one last year.

570
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,720
- I'm leveling up.

571
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,560
- I didn't want to.

572
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,240
- Or for my birthday, or for my other birthday,

573
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,280
or my other birthday, or my other birthday,

574
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,240
or my other birthday, or any of my other birthdays.

575
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,000
- I don't like giving presents.

576
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,840
(laughing)

577
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,500
That's kind of true. I kind of hate giving gifts.

578
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:17,100
Giving gifts sucks unless it's you can give somebody like something like a

579
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
Paw Patrol helmet.

580
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:24,640
Except I got Rex. I realized this the other day. I bought Rex something and I'm not

581
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,140
gonna say his real last name but he has a very pretty normal last name but I

582
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,480
didn't know his last name at the time so I and I bought him a Christmas gift and

583
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,740
it was a kettle with the Star of David on it and I put his billing address

584
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,740
I put his name as Rex Shlomo Eisenstein.

585
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:50,740
They never delivered it because they were like, "This guy doesn't exist."

586
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,740
I forgot about that until the other day.

587
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,740
I ordered something on Amazon.

588
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,740
I was like, "Do you want to send this to Rex Shlomo Eisenstein?"

589
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,740
I was like, "No, this guy doesn't exist at all."

590
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,740
Yeah.

591
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Then I told him he was mad at me.

592
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,740
Yeah.

593
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,440
probably wanted that kettle. He wanted it so bad. Yeah, it wasn't even started. It

594
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,980
was an Israeli flag on it. Oh, okay. Yeah, but she was because he needed a kettle. I

595
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:22,300
just got one of those the other day. I actually just purchased one. Really? Yeah.

596
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:26,620
That's nice. Yeah, for the for the... Can you imagine if Israel was in like the

597
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:32,680
like World Cup of Soccer one year? Isn't it? No, like in the finals

598
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:37,580
or something. Oh. That would be the most buck wild fucking... Yeah. The cross

599
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,740
Palestine? I don't think Palestine has a... I think Israel versus Palestine would be

600
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:46,100
a good... The World Cup? The Marlboros.

601
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:51,620
Yeah yeah yeah Palestine will get free cigarettes for a year if they win and

602
00:22:51,620 --> 00:23:00,620
Israel wins well they get this. They get Palestine. That would be a... If Israel wins

603
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,140
Palestine will also get free cigarettes but it's because they'll all be executed

604
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,980
- It's very funny to me.

605
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,820
- They're all filled with racism.

606
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,180
- Not Israel Palestine, but it's very funny to me

607
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:11,860
that there's still like countries that now,

608
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,020
like young people from these countries,

609
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,860
hate people from like the country right next door to them.

610
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,380
- Oh yeah, like Armenia and Azerbaijan.

611
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:20,060
- And like Turks and Serbs.

612
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,060
I played a fucking game of Valorant two days ago

613
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,780
where it was like four people on my team

614
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:30,420
that were all playing from like that area.

615
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,900
And it was like two Turkish guys and two Serbian guys.

616
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,820
And they just said like, "Fuck you, you fucking piece of shit,"

617
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,460
to each other the entire time.

618
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,340
I was like, "I can't believe that these guys still..."

619
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,180
- That's sick, dude.

620
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,300
- I don't even know what happened there, and I don't care.

621
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,060
- It's kind of like the US and Canada.

622
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,900
- Nah, dude, no.

623
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,740
- We have a pretty sour relationship with Canada.

624
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,580
- Do we?

625
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,860
- Yeah. - What'd they do to us?

626
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,820
- I mean, these fucking Quebecois people

627
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:56,820
coming down and going to Hampton Beach.

628
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,780
- We deserve that land.

629
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,060
- That's actually true. - You gotta annex it.

630
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
At least Montreal.

631
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,500
i think montreal should become part of uh... vermont i don't think there's a

632
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,440
single part of canada that i would care to have

633
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,960
they can just make it falls

634
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,200
the good we have a good part of niagara for all we have the good part of you

635
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,460
know i went out of the new york city by the fall and a shit they should divide

636
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,280
up canada into different size pieces and unlike can have its be so that every

637
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:27,060
whatever no so every state is the same size so like they could give a lot of

638
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:28,520
canada to rhode island

639
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,340
like a tiny bit to texas and just make them all the exact same size as a split

640
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:32,960
a weapon

641
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,200
provinces

642
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,360
right and then

643
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,760
and then and then what

644
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,020
now let's keep going here and then i will let you know so anyway you've been all

645
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,840
the states will be the same size and then the flag would make sense 'cause

646
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,440
right now the flight makes no sense 'cause all the stars are the same size

647
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,720
that is really far how can you know how can these represent different states

648
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,440
not no are our flag

649
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,160
but the hell is wrong with you

650
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,120
Well the Canadian flag makes sense because it's one leaf that's the same size.

651
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,620
Yeah.

652
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,120
Which is Canada's one country that's the same size.

653
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,400
We have all these fucking white stars.

654
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,120
Yeah, and it's like how am I supposed to tell which star of this...

655
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,840
How am I supposed to tell which star is Hawaii so I can cross it off my own personal flag?

656
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,840
[Laughter]

657
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
It's...

658
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
It's so I need it.

659
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,340
Honestly dude, fuck Hawaii.

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
Hawaii is goaded.

Dude, I actually did some freelance work for a Hawaiian guy like two or three years ago.

685

I did some freelance stuff.

686
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
His name was Tito.

687
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Tito.

688
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,440
I did some freelance work. I had to skateboard and snowboard and surf.

689
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:29,200
We agreed on a price. It was $1,200, right?

690
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,080
I do the work. I send it to him. He sends me a box full of fucking shells.

691
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:44,240
Okay? I call him. I'm like, "Tito, what the fuck is this?" He's like, "Count them. It's $1,200.

692
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,800
Right there."

693
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:45,680
You can eat those.

694
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,640
Yeah. Plus, they're food and clothes. So, come on.

695
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
I was like dude this is the worst place in the world.

696
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,440
And then he said "Aloha" which actually also means "that's just enough shells".

697
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,240
Aloha, they literally, they have a language, they have their own language.

698
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Oh, we have our own language, we're a state.

699
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,440
Their own language, it's one word.

700
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,440
Over and over again.

701
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,440
They're like fucking, they're like that, they're like that fucking, what's his name? Hodor.

702
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
They can only say Aloha.

703
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,440
They're like Pikachu.

704
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,440
They're exactly like a Pokemon.

705
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,940
They can only say Aloha. Half of them are named Aloha and then the other ones are Aloha Jr. dude.

706
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,900
yeah it's literally every Hawaiians name I had a big Maui trip planned for yeah

707
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:30,340
there's a guy there's a big Maui guy named trip the really big guy in Maui

708
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,980

709
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:41,420
they're literally like I mean that is the worst place in the world it's Hawaii

711
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,160
- Are you supposed to hang out on a piece of paper?

712
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,860
- Hawaiian coffee's really good.

713
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,080
- Hawaiian coffee?

714
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,900
- Yeah.

715
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,740
- What is that?

716
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,240
Is it coffee made out of sand?

717
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,340
- It's coffee, they put lava in it to make it hot.

718
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,580
- They put vanilla and macadamia nuts in it.

719
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,340
- Oh, that sounds so good.

720
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,700
- Yeah, that seriously sounds awesome.

721
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,540
- No, you guys are talking--

722
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,000
- Hey, hey, Pat, aloha.

723
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,380
That means fuck you.

724
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,460
- Talking shit about our 50th estate.

725
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,220
- No, it shouldn't even be a state.

726
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,060
Here's what we do.

727
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:11,880
- Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

728
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,640
- We swap out Hawaii for Puerto Rico.

729
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,960
- Yeah, absolutely.

730
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
We just Puerto Rico should be a state. Yeah

731
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:25,700
No, no, absolutely, yeah if you want to have another civil war

732
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,520
Try and merge Puerto Rico and Hawaii because Puerto Rico are the most upstanding

733
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:37,800
Hard-working people in the world and Hawaii are just scumbag fucking pieces of mango addicts

734
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:44,060
Who sit around all day fucking too far? No, they're pieces of shit too far every single person in Hawaii

735
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,480
I hope, I honestly hope the big one hits.

736
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,320
- No.

737
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,980
- I've been, I hope the big one hits Hawaii tomorrow, dude.

738
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:53,820
- No.

739
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:54,660
- You know why?

740
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,480
'Cause they would all, you know,

741
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,380
a big wave starts coming to wipe out the entire thing.

742
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,220
- Yeah, they'd all grab their boards.

743
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,340
- The entire island starts paddling towards it, dude.

744
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,180
It's a stupid thing.

745
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,020
- That's right.

746
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,840
- Don't, right?

747
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,460
- There's so many concussions from coconuts

748
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,820
falling onto their heads.

749
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,340
It's fucking embarrassing, dude.

750
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,040
I don't, I want nothing to do with Hawaii.

751
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,420
- Stop talking about Hawaii like that.

768
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,740
Oh no. Yeah that's I mean it's literally the worst place in America.

769
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:11,540
It's not even in America. It's in the sea. God literally within the

770
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:15,660
next a thousand years, the reason that God had created global warming is to put

771
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,220
Hawaii back underwater. No. How did people even find Hawaii? He didn't do that. Like what

772
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,020
the fuck? Like why? People have... some... like Hawaii... is that just where they

773
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,980
put all the worst people in the world? That's not what... no. For like a million years

774
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,680
they were just like... if you had like like a cousin who couldn't get his act

775
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,500
together, you'd be like, "Oh no, there's this beautiful place. Go to Hawaii."

776
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,900
Well yeah, that's people who couldn't grow out of making macaroni necklaces

777
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:49,540
got sent there. This place is a joke man. It's a fucking joke. And not a funny one either.

778
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:55,180
No. No. Why are you guys doing this about Hawaii? What's wrong with this? Why are you so pro-Hawaii? It's

779
00:30:55,180 --> 00:31:00,500
great there. You would fit in. I've never been. You would fit in.

780
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,780
You would fit in. I had yesterday, I had these chips. They were Hawaiian chips.

781
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,820
so Hawaiian barbecue flavor. What the fuck are you even talking about?

782
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,100
Hawaiian barbecue chips. That's not Hawaii dude.

783
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:19,260
A Hawaiian barbecue is when they just leave the meat out and

784
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,180
hope that some lava comes and cooks it for them.

785
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,620
Yeah. Are you kidding me? Hawaiian barbecue is literally rocks.

786
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,500
You want lava in your life? Yes. More lava in your life? Yes.

787
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,740
Dude, you would be like, you would die.

788
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:36,460
If you move to Hawaii, I give you seven days before you literally like

789
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,620
sit in lava accidentally don't notice till it's at your waist and then you're

790
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,340
just gone.

791
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,200
I would notice. You would move to Hawaii and you would

792
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,060
go to your roommates every day and say I think there's lava in our house.

793
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,060
I think I saw a piece of lava run across the floor.

794
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:56,500
And they'd say

795
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,780
Aloha, Mahalo. Which is the same word by the way.

796
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:04,500
I think I have lava sickness. Look at Aloha and look at Mahalo.

797
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,300
Okay. Look at the letters in them. It's the same word. No. Yeah. It's Mahalo. People in

798
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:14,780
Hawaii go up to they go to McDonald's they say, "Uh yeah I'll have the Aloha

799
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:20,020
Mahalo." Yeah. And a Mahalo Aloha. Every single thing on the menu is the Aloha

800
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:26,740
Mahalo Aloha. You can get um. You can get an Aloha Mahalo there. I think you can get. Yeah.

801
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:31,220
Some there's like some Hawaiian. Did you know that the Hawaiian language has over

802
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:48,660
50 different words for recliner. And no word for job. What dude? That's so messed up to

803
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:56,460
say. About Hawaii? Yeah. Why? They're great people. They're not. Every single, I mean

804
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,100
scumbags dude. They invented the worst shirt worn by the worst white people in

805
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:06,600

813
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,620
Did you eat a pen? No. I'm just chewing ice. No. I was just breathing really hard.

814
00:33:56,620 --> 00:34:01,860
Okay here's this list. This list was sent to us by a listener on Patreon by World

815
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:05,740
Park. So thank you World Park for sending this because this is a good website.

816
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:12,020
This is from factinate.com. Okay. This is a list called "Call the burn unit.

817
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,240
these epic comebacks are deadly. And then it says fact in a video of the day,

818
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,880
but it's not a video. It's just a list. There's no video on the page. Um,

819
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,500
but so I'll just read this first, this first comeback here. There's only four,

820
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,720
but I found a second list, you know? So here's the first one. Um,

821
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,280
it's kind of a story based thing here. So number four,

822
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,720
keeping him in suspense.

823
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,720
I was at a friend's place with a lot of people who I didn't really know too well.

824
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,000
We were all having a few beers. Whoa. Suddenly this dude from across the

825
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,800
table says to me quite aggressively that my suspenders were ugly and that they

826
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,000
made me look like I was trying too hard which to be fair I was and then in bold

827
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,160
but I still dealt him a crushing blow all right without skipping a beat I stood up

828
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,000
unclipped my suspenders and put them in my pocket when I sat down I looked

829
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,000
straight into his eyes and replied now let's talk about that face tattoo of

830
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,880
yours yeah that's fire that is a crushing blow you guys ever had an epic

831
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,560
- Was that a comeback moment?

832
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
- I think so.

833
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,980
- Which was what?

834
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,660
- I think I was,

835
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:22,200
yeah, there was like a guy,

836
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,540
like a guy making fun of me.

837
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,480
I think I was ordering food.

838
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,300
I said,

839
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,300
"Thank you, have a nice day."

840
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,080
- What?

841
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:40,240
- I said, "Thank you, sir, have a nice, I don't know."

842
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:48,760
have just you know I'm jet-lagged I straight up I aborted that joke midway

Probably true you might answer you could have cancer you have a tumor in your brain that makes you stupid

It could be what that would be so cool if we found out every single one of our fans

Some tumor that like like yeah, really like cuts brain fun. Yeah

Like a new disease and it turns out like the only like it is everybody who listens to this has

That could happen they have a brain eating it's like video drum everybody's been everybody's been to the same river in Brazil. Yeah

Oh, and there was that huge outbreak of that evil worm that eats your brain?

00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,420
Yeah.

862
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,420
Did you also pee into the river?

863
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
Yeah, I did.

864
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:34,260
Wait, and did you also drink the pee with the straw afterward?

865
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,300
Well, yeah, of course.

866
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,780
The pee sits on top of the river.

867
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,580
Whoa, dude, alopecia alert.

868
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,980
That guy doesn't have any fucking eyebrows in that car.

869
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
He just saw me.

870
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
Whoa.

871
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,300
He saw me and he heard me say that and he looked at me.

872
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Yeah, well, that's a baby.

873
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
He's picking his nose, dude.

874
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
Holy God.

875
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,300
Get your act together, bro.

876
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Oh, I see him now.

877
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,300
Oh, he ate it!

878
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
He ate his book?

879
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,300
He ate his book!

880
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,760
- He ate his bug!

881
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:57,680
- Damn, okay, this guy's actually cool as fuck.

882
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:58,880
- He ate the bug.

883
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,500
- Grown man eating his bugs.

884
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,340
- Yeah, in the car, dude, in the car with your kids,

885
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,180
just eating boogers. - I got nothing

886
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,020
to say to you, man.

887
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,820
You, I can't touch you, bro.

888
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,480
- Right, yeah. - If you're a grown man,

889
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,840
if you were like in a presidential debate

890
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:13,580
and you just fucking licked a bug in the middle, dude,

891
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,700
I think you might win.

892
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,660
- Yeah. - Right?

893
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,860
- Shows that you're human. - Could, yeah.

894
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,060
- Well, it also just, like, yeah.

895
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,060
- It shows you don't give a damn fuck.

896
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,820
- Let's be honest, when was the last time you guys ate a bug?

897
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,180
I don't think I ever have. I think that is always disgusting. I've picked my nose a bunch

898
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
of my life, but I've never eaten it.

899
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:31,700
I was really hoping you guys would, I would trick one of you into saying today.

900
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,700
Today.

901
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,700
Ha ha.

902
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:40,220
Oh, you got me. Oh no. No, I don't understand what's, I don't understand what's attractive

903
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:43,700
about like why would you want to do that? That doesn't seem like it would ever seem

904
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,940
like a good thing to do.

905
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,700
Yeah. It's funny to make like your little brother eat your booger.

906
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,180
but like a like a baby maybe would eat dirt but I feel like when you get like

907
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,140
there's an age where you know you're not supposed to eat dirt or poop and I feel

908
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:59,040
like when I have a baby go along with that babies will totally eat poop if

909
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,480
they could know they well babies probably eat stuff that they would

910
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:07,540
apparently disgusting just whatever they can get as a baby like that baby like a

911
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:11,140
booger should be included up the apple and eat it when I was a kid apparently I

912
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:19,440
I would poop my pants and then I would smell it and vomit. I'd poop or fart and

913
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,060
then I'd just go, I was so gross that I would just vomit immediately. My little brother had like a

914
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:31,060
bad like, I guess, like he had like a sympathetic like gag reflex. Oh yeah.

915
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:35,700
Yeah so if you like went like or like around him he would like start going like

916
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,700
like, "Eh, eh."

917
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:39,180
Ugh, that's a bad place to be, man.

918
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,180
Yeah.

919
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,180
Yeah, that sucks.

920
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:45,300
I was, the only time I think I've ever really hurt someone's feelings like a stranger.

921
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,700
It was like every episode of the show for me.

922
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,340
No, no, no.

923
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:51,340
You've never had your feelings hurt.

924
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,340
I've never hurt your feelings.

925
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,340
What are you talking about?

926
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:54,340
Shut up.

927
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:59,020
One time I was at a bar and a guy, I was at a bar in, I may have said this actually, I

928
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,100
was at a bar in California and this is when I had my fucked up stupid haircut and I sat

929
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:10,300
next to this guy trying to get a drink. And he's like this old fat trucker dude. And he

930
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:16,060
was like, very playfully, he was like, "Huh, your barber messed something up?" Said it

931
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:21,460
like that. And he laughed to himself. And I just looked at him and was like, "You're

932
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:32,300
really fat." I was in the mood to get into an argument or a fight with this guy. And

933
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:40,980
just looked like so sad he was like you took it too far man I think about that

934
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:48,500
guy a lot just like a guy like you think would be able to take that just just to

935
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,300
go for someone who looks psycho like you with the skull it specifically I like

936
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:56,460
that person to be like oh yeah we're gonna do like a playful ribbing here and

937
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:01,420
neither of us are gonna go too far yeah it's like did I look evil yeah you can't

938
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:07,740
do that to yeah I mean what he would kill me was bare hands but oh yeah yeah he was

939
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:12,260
a sensitive trucker he was a sensitive trucker dude yeah he listened like Dolly

940
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:16,780
Parton as he as he drove his truck yeah he's like damn dude you suck a sensitive

941
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:23,620
trucker yeah to make him playful again yeah dude 100% yeah you know truckers

942
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,900
suck - they're all babies I agree yeah truckers might be the

943
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,540
- He's the least heroic people in the world.

944
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,380
- Absolutely.

945
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,380
- You guys know about Trucker Sucker?

946
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,220
- No.

947
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:35,500
- It's a guy that, it's a guy online.

948
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,540
- Let me guess, he sucks truckers.

949
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:41,100
- Yeah, this guy's addicted to sucking off truckers.

950
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,220
- He's addicted?

951
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,520
- He's addicted to it.

952
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,340
(laughing)

953
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,380
He's addicted to sucking truckers off.

954
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,700
- No.

955
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,540
- That can't be true.

956
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,220
- He can't be addicted, there ain't no nicotine

957
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,060
in a trucker cock.

958
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,180
- There's nicotine, baby.

959
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,020
- God damn, you didn't say it ain't so.

960
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:59,740
Okay, so this one this list is longer than I thought because it starts with four

961
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,880
So I thought it would maybe be counting down from four, but the next one is five. Okay, interesting

962
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,400
It's like Star Wars number five not my type a

963
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,180
Friend of mine in first year university had never really dated any girls yet

964
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,780
Yeah

965
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:20,180
This dumb meathead who were kind of friends with him who were kind of friends with told him one day when you do get a girlfriend

966
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,180
I'm totally going to sleep with her the guy absolutely slayed him

967
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,520
He responded if I had a girlfriend who would sleep with you her cheating on me wouldn't be the issue

968
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,480
Dan that's actually fire if you're if your girlfriend folks your best friend you it's not an issue

969
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,180
I actually didn't ever care in the first place cuz yeah, he was to be that low

970
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:48,140
Doesn't bother me. Yeah, I wasn't supposed to be fucking this stupid whore, but he slayed him though that doesn't he did slay him

971
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:52,720
Yeah, I think all of these could be spiced up by saying I don't you're fat at the end. Yeah

972
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:59,460
No, all right. Well, maybe you'll get this one number six family. Oh you fucked my girlfriend

973
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,020
Yeah, actually that reflects poorly on her character. So yeah, that that's that's not oh

974
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:09,140
Not nice of her. Yeah, you throw a pokeball. Yeah

975
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:16,060
Maybe maybe you'll get this one though Patrick. This is number six family rude. Okay, this is this is like

976
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,660
Done like Star Wars. Why does it go four or five six? I

977
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:24,740
I still think about this comeback to this day. I have two little brothers and it was my dad's birthday

978
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,460
So the semi-extended family was all at a restaurant to celebrate

979
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,900
I just graduated from my dad's alma mater and my middle brother was currently a junior there

980
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,900
However, my youngest brother a friend. What is this a logic puzzle?

981
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,900
What?

982
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:42,780
Burn a freshman had opted to go to a state school at one point back. My uncle said so youngest brother

983
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,060
How does your dad feel about you breaking the trend?

984
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:55,220
My little brother thought about it for a moment and then said, "Well, he probably doesn't mind considering I also broke the trend of not being able to get higher than a 3.0."

985
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,220
The table absolutely exploded in laughter and whooping.

986
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:03,220
My other brother and I just stared at each other across the table like, "Oh my god, did we just get crushed?"

987
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:10,220
It's especially funny because my little brother is one of those shy high school kids who went off to college and then suddenly came back fun and socially confident.

988
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:15,220
I was hoping that development would happen. I just never expected it to stab me in the face.

989
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,700
3.0 is the blood alcohol content.

990
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,700
That's a BAC.

991
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
He blew a 3.0.

992
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,540
That would be impressive.

993
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:28,340
This is a kind of a baseline 3.0 BAC.

994
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,380
It's kind of sick.

995
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,140
If it dips below 2, you die.

996
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,140
Like fucking like that.

997
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:35,140
Like speed.

998
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,140
Like that statham.

999
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,140
Yeah.

1000
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:38,140
Hurt in a crank.

1001
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,140
Yeah, like crank.

1002
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,140
Yeah.

1003
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,140
Like heroin.

1004
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,140
If your blood alcohol content goes below 2.0.

1005
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:44,780
That would be a good movie.

1006
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:50,420
you're driving a bus like speed. That would be a sick move. And if he goes below 2.0 the bus explodes.

1007
00:44:50,420 --> 00:45:00,020
Doesn't matter how fast you go, you can go as fast as you want. You just have to do a normal route on a city bus in Cincinnati.

1008
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:04,960
You can't get caught drunk driving is the thing. Yeah exactly. Like everybody on the bus is old.

1009
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,460
Yeah. So they're always talking to you about the routes or whatever and they're

1010
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,780
like, "Oh I used to go over..." They're always like doing that old people thing where old people ask for a bus

1011
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,340
exception and they're like can you make up four stops for me that are actually

1012
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,300
between two stops? And the guy goes, "I don't fucking care."

1013
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:28,620
Yeah, "Man, I wasn't supposed to do this today. Somebody called out. I wasn't

1014
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:33,220
supposed to be here. I wasn't supposed to be driving. I was supposed to be at home."

1015
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,820
I think about becoming a bus driver sometime.

1016
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:36,940
Yeah, you could never.

1017
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:37,440
I could.

1018
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,820
A bus driver is a job--

1019
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,340
Neither of you can drive. I'm the driver.

1020
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,300
A bus driver is a job where you can be psycho and

1021
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,340
and there's nothing that anybody can do about it.

1022
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,180
- Yeah, what are you gonna do?

1023
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:48,060
- Because you are, that is one of the ultimate,

1024
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,500
like, you are in power.

1025
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:50,340
- Especially in Boston, yeah.

1026
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,660
- The crazier you are, also,

1027
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:52,500
the straighter you are, - Anywhere, anywhere.

1028
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,320
- the bus driver you are.

1029
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,360
- Who's gonna, who, if a bus driver's being psycho,

1030
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,340
what's the passenger gonna do?

1031
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,060
They're gonna get off the bus, that's literally it.

1032
00:45:59,060 --> 00:45:59,900
- You also, you have diplomatic immunity.

1033
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,100
- You can't touch a bus driver,

1034
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,940
yeah, you can't talk to them.

1035
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,640
- But what if they're so crazy they don't let you out?

1036
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,000
- That you could do that, that's what I'm saying.

1037
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:07,840
As a bus driver, you could literally do anything you want.

1038
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:09,540
- If someone touches you as a bus driver,

1039
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,380
you like immediately make $50,000.

1040
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,800
- Yeah, they get fined like a billion dollars.

1041
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,600
- Yeah. - No, it's like sick.

1042
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,440
- It's so cool.

1043
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,420
- It's the closest thing you can have to like

1044
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:20,920
the kind of protection that they give police officers.

1045
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,200
- It's like being the king's son in like a fantasy world.

1046
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,120
- Oh, I thought you meant if the bus driver hits you.

1047
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:28,780
- No, no. - If the bus driver hits you,

1048
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,360
you also get fined a billion dollars

1049
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,440
'cause you touched the bus driver and it's on camera.

1050
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,120
- It's literally a cootie situation.

1051
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:34,960
- Yeah.

1052
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:35,780
You know what's funny?

1053
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,260
I guess it's such a problem in New York,

1054
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,580
we're like moving here on the train

1055
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,100
where it says like assaulting,

1056
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,260
assaulting MTA employees is like a felony or whatever.

1057
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:47,100
- Yeah.

1058
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:47,940
- Man.

1059
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,760
- Dude, I mean those--

1060
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,740
- They had to put up a sign 'cause it kept happening.

1061
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:52,820
- Those signs have talked me down the ledge quite a few times.

1062
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,860
- Yeah.

1063
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,060
- Swear to God, dude, I've been in there--

1064
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:56,860
- Well, that's what I'm saying, maybe it used to be hard

1065
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:58,600
or bad to be a bus or train driver,

1066
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,700
but now that they have that stuff in place,

1067
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:02,700
even if you get the shippy out of you,

1068
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:04,180
you're gonna become rich.

1069
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,020
- True.

1070
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,620
That's literally the goal.

1071
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,740
That's why bus drivers are so cantankerous.

1072
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,220
Is because they're trying,

1073
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,500
and they tell you in the orientation.

1074
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,460
Basically, we'll give you a million dollars

1075
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,300
if anyone touches you.

1076
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:18,620
And so they sit there all day being like,

1077
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,180
"Fuck you, stupid fucking pussy."

1078
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,900
Skipping stops for no reason.

1079
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,740
Yeah, exactly.

1080
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,260
Skipping a stop, flipping the bird.

1081
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,820
Yeah, driving by truckers and doing this,

1082
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,020
trying to get them to honk their horn in everyone's face.

1083
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,140
Scare someone's dog on the bus.

1084
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,060
Just putting the AC all the way off

1085
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:33,900
in the middle of the summer,

1086
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,340
the heat on, right, just cranking it.

1087
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:38,500
They're all just like sweating, dying, trying to get to work,

1088
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
they're in such a bad mood.

1089
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,540
- Here's my idea.

1090
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,980
- And then when they leave, when you go,

1091
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,980
whenever you pull up to the stop,

1092
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:47,180
you stick your face out into the aisle

1093
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:48,620
and you say, like smile, then like,

1094
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,820
have a nice day, right?

1095
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:53,340
Just waiting to get just whopped.

1096
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,020
- Yeah, here's my idea.

1097
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:57,540
So Caleb does become a bus driver, right?

1098
00:47:57,540 --> 00:47:58,380
- Okay.

1099
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:03,380
- We hire somebody, beat the fucking shit out of him.

1100
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:04,380
- He's literally genius. - He's the bus driver.

1101
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,380
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1102
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:09,260
- Just fucking like broken body.

1103
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:12,020
- We don't even have to, we can just get a homeless guy.

1104
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,700
We just get like the, we pay him--

1105
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,540
- No, no, no.

1106
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,500
- We pay him in Seagram's Escapes.

1107
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,580
- Ric Flair.

1108
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:18,420
- Ric Flair?

1109
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,240
- Yeah.

1110
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,820
- And we still pay him in Seagram's Escapes?

1111
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,740
- Yeah, 'cause I want it to look real but not hurt.

1112
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:24,580
- Mm-hmm.

1113
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,400
- So I'll--

1114
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:26,940
- Oh, you'll keep like the, what's it called?

1115
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,780
The thing, it's like the little razor.

1116
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:29,620
- Oh, keep the blood packet, oh yeah.

1117
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:31,500
- The little razor and you cut like your,

1118
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:32,900
- Yeah, yeah. - Above your eyebrow.

1119
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:37,980
as soon as people get on you just have you have it already cut because you

1120
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:42,100
forgot it's just like blood dripping down your face like Wrestlemania just like

1121
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:47,340
good afternoon we hire a special-effects person to help them make help make the

1122
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:51,500
like fight look the fight look real on the on the bus cameras and they go way

1123
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:57,660
overboard by accident it's like your head blows up my head blew up is that

1124
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,980
what they do in wrestling they cut their own head yeah yeah they cut above there I

1125
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,100
I forget what it's called, but they cut above their eyebrow.

1126
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:04,940
- That's, okay, that's my, whenever people say

1127
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:07,060
wrestling's fake, it's like, dude, what's this?

1128
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:07,900
- Some of it's real.

1129
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:10,420
- The Undertaker still threw that fucker off that cage.

1130
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,260
- Yeah.

1131
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,540
- Like, they get fucked up sometimes.

1132
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:13,620
- Yeah, no, absolutely.

1133
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,940
- It's an honorable job.

1134
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,260
- Yeah. - Right.

1135
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:18,260
- Oh, like, people were complaining, it's like,

1136
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:21,300
oh, like, fucking, oh, this person didn't actually sleep

1137
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,460
with this person's wife or something like that.

1138
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:24,820
Like, who gives a shit about that?

1139
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,940
They're throwing each other,

1140
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,060
they're cutting each other's heads.

1141
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:29,580
- Yeah, like, this is, it's not, it's hard.

1142
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,420
They feel bad after it.

1143
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:31,500
- Oh, fuck.

1144
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,140
Rachel was telling me-- - I think they're like coal miners.

1145
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,460
- There's like some dude,

1146
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,980
his move is pulling out like a pizza cutter,

1147
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,820
and he cut Chris Jericho's head with a pizza cutter.

1148
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,660
- That's sick. - Yeah.

1149
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,580
- That's very cool.

1150
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,420
Oh my God.

1151
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:45,820
- She was telling me that we gotta go

1152
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:47,220
to like a wrestling tournament. - I would love to.

1153
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,060
Wrestling is one of those things

1154
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,460
I feel like I missed the boat on,

1155
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:51,740
but it would've been a good thing to be into.

1156
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,580
- I wanna go to like an underground one

1157
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:56,340
where they throw each other into like light bulbs and shit.

1158
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:57,980
- Yeah, that's good.

1159
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,980
I only like wrestling if they're dressed like monsters.

1160
00:50:01,980 --> 00:50:03,980
You missed the drag wrestling show the other day.

1161
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:04,980
Where they literally...

1162
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,980
Were they dressed like monsters?

1163
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:06,980
No, no.

1164
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:07,980
Janna tried to go but she couldn't.

1165
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,420
But at first I was like, "Oh, that sounds like fine."

1166
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,820
And then I saw a video of it.

1167
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,620
All of them have like five mouths on their face and shit.

1168
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:18,220
It's like this crazy like special effects makeup, pan-slappery shit.

1169
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,220
It looked pretty cool.

1170
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,220
Yeah, Jacques was trying to get us to go to that.

1171
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,220
Yeah, yeah.

1172
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,220
Yeah.

1173
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:25,220
Okay.

1174
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,220
Number seven.

1175
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:27,580
Do I know you?

1176
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:31,420
I witnessed this exchange between two of my friends when they were having a fight.

1177
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:34,060
My one friend yelled, "Everyone thinks you're a jerk!"

1178
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,160
Without batting an eyelash, the other one replied, "Well, you know what everyone thinks

1179
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:38,160
about you?

1180
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:39,160
Nothing.

1181
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,500
No one ever thinks about you.

1182
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,860
I know I don't."

1183
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,940
"Welp," points to my second friend.

1184
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,940
Whoa.

1185
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,620
Sounds like that guy is a jerk.

1186
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,620
Yeah.

1187
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,620
Yeah.

1188
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,620
That is not very kind.

1189
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,620
Yeah.

1190
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,220
He has three friends, and that's his second one.

1191
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,780
Number eight, "Belt it out, Granny."

1192
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:01,940
"My dear grandmother. She had a quick and savage wit. My fiancé and I held up 'meet

1193
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:04,700
the whole family, get together at my house.' It was the first time his father

1194
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,180
met my grandmother. His dad was a large physically--"

1195
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:09,180
That was a lady or a gay man writing.

1196
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,380
Huh?

1197
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:12,380
I didn't know. I thought this was a--

1198
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,380
What on earth are you even talking about?

1199
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,380
I thought the author of this was a fella.

1200
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,380
Why?

1201
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,380
I don't remember.

1202
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,380
You think women can't do burns?

1203
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:22,880
No.

1204
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,880
You think women can't have grandmothers?

1205
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,380
No.

1206
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:25,880
Are you kidding?

1207
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,560
- What are you talking about?

1208
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:32,760
- What is leading you to believe this is a woman?

1209
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:38,200
- Well, it's a fiance with one E, so it's a male fiance.

1210
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
What does it matter?

1211
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
- I thought that's it.

1212
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
Nevermind.

1213
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
- I'm so confused.

1214
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,960
- I'm shipping you off to Hawaii.

1215
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,280
- Yeah, dude, honestly, that time zone makes sense right now for me.

1216
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,280
- True.

1217
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,760
In Hawaii, dude, you would be like, "I'm gonna be jet lagged for three days."

1218
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:53,760
- The Hawaii time zone, it's 5 PM.

1219
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:54,760
- I'm gonna be jet lagged for three days.

1220
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:55,760
- I'm gonna be jet lagged for three days.

1221
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:03,080
all day. It's always sunset. Yeah right and they're like well we're not gonna work it's

1222
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,880

1223
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:14,360
Oh great. A Hawaiian beer. You guys are making fun of it. It sounds better and

1224
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,000
better every time you do that. Yeah it actually does sound pretty cool. Yeah

1225
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:23,280
yeah no no jobs. I think you're just jealous of Hawaii. I'm not jealous. Not

1226
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,560
really there's no jobs the men there somehow get 600 pounds eating only fruit

1227
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:35,880

1228
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:41,960
know their spirits in Hawaii yeah if you do I know there's elementals over there

00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:01,200
beautiful place yeah it was the first time his father and my grandmother his

1233
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,480
dad was a large physically intimidating man with a beer gut he began telling

1234
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,720
stories to my grandmother about how my fiance was a mischief maker when he was

1235
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:11,200
young he then told my grandmother how he would take off his belt and whip him for

1236
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,800
being bad my frail little grandmother still stares directly at my husband's

1245
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,880
something's fishy the cafeteria lunch lady got me in front my whole class

1246
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:03,880
I smelled her snitch. That day...

1247
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,880
[Laughter]

1248
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,880
Smelled like straight tuna.

1249
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,880
I got my daily dose of Omega-3s

1250
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,880
just from the smell of your pussy, lady.

1251
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:13,880
Wow, the lunch lady smells like tuna.

1252
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,880
God damn.

1253
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,880
That day we were having tuna fish for lunch.

1254
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,880
I was upset at this option and said,

1255
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,880
"Tuna fish? I'd rather have a poop sandwich."

1256
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,880
[Laughter] Without missing a beat, this 80-year-old

1257
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,880
lady fires back, "Wait right there.

1258
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,880
I'll go make you one in the back."

1259
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:29,880
Needless to say, I went with the tuna.

1260
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,720

1262
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,040

1263
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,080

1264
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:52,320

1267
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,680
Yeah, poop with sauce.

1268
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,680
Yeah, open face.

1269
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,680
Open face poop with sauce sandwich.

1270
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,680
I want sausage gravy on it.

1271
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,680
Cause I think some...

1272
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,680
Oh god.

1273
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,680
Poop with gravy on it.

1274
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,680
Something about eating poop is normal to me.

1275
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:19,680
Eating poop with like normal food condiments is disgusting to me.

1276
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:20,680
Mayo.

1277
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:21,680
Oh no.

1278
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,680
That's so gross dude.

1279
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:25,680
Like cause it's like trying to make it more palatable.

1280
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:30,080
palatable. Yeah, it's not just like a funny thing to eat. It's like

1281
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:37,040
Like if you ate a burger in the middle of it was poop. Yeah, like that is so much more disgusting Lucy

1282
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:41,960
Juicy Lucy with poop in it. Yeah. Oh

1283
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:46,160
God, well, I would probably probably get away with it cuz like you don't know what's in there till you take a bite

1284
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,960
Yeah, you know right yellow poop. Yeah

1285
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,600
this

1286
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:00,160
You ever taken a yellow poop? No. You're gonna make me vomit. Yeah, you ever taken an orange poop?

1287
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,080
Look how long it is. Look at this scroll bar. Somebody I knew had an orange poop on them. That's a really long scroll bar.

1288
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,780
Yeah, I'm on I scrolled down to number 27 and we're still like maybe a fifth of the way down this scroll bar

1289
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,960
So we're not gonna finish this. I messed this one up, but here's one

1290
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:19,640
This is a comeback that maybe Patrick would use it seems

1291
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,160
Number 27 this comeback gets an A.

1292
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,160
Another fucking thing for me to know.

1293
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:28,160
Piece of shit.

1294
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,160
Hey, you need to speak up idiot.

1295
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,160
Yeah, one day I'm going to snap.

1296
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,160
During my university days, he had university days, that's what I'm referring to.

1297
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,160
I ran into an acquaintance of mine as I was holding a Green Lantern graphic novel.

1298
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,160
This acquaintance was with his girlfriend and when he introduced me to her

1299
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,560
her the first thing she says to me while shaking my hand was aren't comic books

1300
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:56,160
for kids my instance was my instant response shocked even me I replied aren't

1301
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:02,760
those a cups for kids flabbergasted that someone I just met would say that to me

1302
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:07,640
that I replied on instinct still my greatest comeback ever shit dude a woman

1303
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:12,960
saying something not even Rudy and you say you have the boobs of a child you

00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:41,280

1307
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,780
Yeah, is there any more with like poop and tuna? Well if you guys keep talking I'll scroll through and yeah and find some

1308
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:55,400
Cut the hems of my pants somehow skating I think I think the grip tape is rubbing up against the hems of my pants

1309
00:57:55,400 --> 00:58:01,680
What do you have any you have anything to say about that Caleb Caleb we can't have dead air

1310
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:05,820
You realize that right? We can't just fucking sit here and let this guy scroll

1311
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,160
You should probably get some new pants.

1312
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,160
Yeah, I bought too many pants I think.

1313
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,160
Yeah, you did.

1314
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,160
Do you remember those gigantic pants I bought?

1315
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,160
Those big black pants?

1316
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:21,160
Oh yeah.

1317
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:23,160
I fucked those up pretty bad.

1318
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,160
I tried to fix the hem on them.

1319
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,160
I just ended up cutting them.

1320
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:30,160
And now one of the legs is shorter than the other.

1321
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,160
I think I have to turn them into shorts.

1322
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,160
Same with my white pants.

1323
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,160
I have to turn those into shorts too.

1324
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:36,160
Those are too short now.

1325
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,160
I washed them once and now they shrank.

1326
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,160
Oh, that's not right.

1327
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,160
Yeah.

1328
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:48,160
You know, it's crazy too, because a good pair of pants, you can't really beat that.

1329
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:50,160
You can't beat a pair of pants that fits great.

1330
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:52,160
Yeah.

1331
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,160
But I don't feel like getting them altered.

1332
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,160
I don't feel like going to a tailor or something.

1333
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,160
Do I work?

1334
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,160
Yeah. I mean, you're spending probably like $20 per pair or something.

1335
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:05,080
And it takes you a while to get them back.

1336
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,400
And it's just like, damn, I just want to wear those pants.

1337
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,400
I want banjo.

1338
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,600
Yeah, I just want to get the pants on.

1339
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
I want to--

1340
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,600
There's a hundred of these.

1341
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,600
Oh, fuck me.

1342
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
