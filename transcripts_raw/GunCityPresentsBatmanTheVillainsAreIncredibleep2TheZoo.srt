1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,320
So, uh, this way.

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,560
Uh,

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,240
see it like you were before.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,440
This sucks.

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:10,840
Yeah.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,000
No way.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,520
What?

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,120
I want to give up.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,720
I'm going to get there.

10
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,120
You're going to get it.

11
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,880
I think I'm going to do it.

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,920
Give it to a given your all.

13
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,440
Yeah.

14
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:27,640
Something in the way.

15
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,720
Yeah.

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,560
You look so fucking cool doing that right now. Hold your chain out.

17
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:43,680
You look like you're on, man, that's a thin chain.

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,840
That's gonna get snatched. You better tuck that. Be careful. I will snatch

19
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,800
that. We are all snatching chains now. So let's just, you know what, last

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,200
time,

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:08,700
You guys were broken out of Arkham by some kind of giant robot and then you were brought

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:19,260
to some kind of lair that kind of existed out of nowhere and were told by this villain

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:26,380
guy that he wants you guys to kill the Batman and to take over Gotham for him. His name

24
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:35,340
is Maisie Uptown. And he said the plan for you to do it was to first enter into the mayor's

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:43,220
manor and basically kill or dispose of somehow all of these very influential people, except

26
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,740
for the mayor, who you would then, the rambler would then torture by rambling. We're at that

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,220
point in the plan right now. Now, the plan, the rest of the plan then was to go eventually

28
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:00,340
go to the zoo and then go to the parade and then storm the thing. And now what the rambler

29
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,620
is going to do by torturing the mayor, at least what the plan was, was to get the mayor

30
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:15,420
to give you, Mayor Lionel Peach, to give you the emergency bat signal. The reason why was

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:21,520
to summon the Batman when Maisie Uptown tells you to so that you can trap him inside the

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,860
Mayor's mansion. Not sure how just yet. But, um...

33
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,860
That didn't happen though.

34
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,920
No, right now we're at the point where we had the gumbo, I believe it was Confusa gumbo

35
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,880
was what was used. I think it was confusing gumbo, right? Okay. And by

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,240
used by the chef and or the cook rather who is a chef,

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,400
everybody ate it except for the general, the

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,760
general who's visiting and Dylan, who is wearing a blue shirt and a gold star.

39
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,320
Right, we remember Dylan. Made of felt. Otherwise, Alfred ate it,

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,360
everybody else ate it. So now,

41
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,560
you also

42
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,280
So Mr. Wonderful, you took out all the security guards by making them soil

43
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
their own pants. No. Oh yeah. Or making them think they did. I soiled their

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,920
pants for them. You soiled them. Oh, and they all left one by one. Call me the

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,560
Soila. Yeah. I think your name is... Call me Soilin' Brown. What's his name?

46
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,320
Mr. Wonderful. It's Mark Cuban right now, though. He's been wonderful. I'm

47
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,300
disguised as Mark Cuban. You're disguised as Mark Cuban on the roof. No,

48
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:31,800
just as Mark Cuban, but I happen to be on the roof. Okay, got it. I'm not

49
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,820
the fastest mark Cuban on

50
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,780
yeah sorry. I've got the you got on the different kind of character yeah

51
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:43,220
and then meanwhile the rambler you and you the sorry the chef. I make sure I

52
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:43,780
round out

53
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,420
the cook who is a chef. Oh there it is yeah. The cook is my name fucking right

54
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,220
you yeah. You cook the meal. You cook the gumbo. You have some gumbo stored. I

55
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,460
believe to oh I cook at a meal. Say that hey come on. I don't think I'll say that

56
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,780
I have a good one

57
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:07,940
FF broth, any clue what that could mean? I fart face broth. I have speddy and

58
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,440
heel.

59
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,940
So FF broth was probably,

60
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,020
and I have no ingredients right now. I used only- It was probably fortifying

61
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:21,460
breath. Oh, fortifying broth, that's what it is, fortifying breath. If I remember

62
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:21,780
that.

63
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:28,380
Any guesses for speddy? That was probably speedy preparation. Speedy or spaghetti.

64
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,500
It's not very like me to omit an E.

65
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,060
- So, well, you did this time.

66
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,140
It was speedy preparation.

67
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,780
- So what, heel was heddle?

68
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:41,340
- I mean, what did you write down?

69
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,860
- Heel.

70
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,060
- Okay, yeah, it was heel.

71
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,700
Do you think it should add another letter

72
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,640
because you didn't?

73
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,900
- I'm just saying, if I wrote down speddy, I meant it.

74
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,940
- I mean, there's nothing on here that says speddy.

75
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,380
My glasses are gonna fall.

76
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,220
- Okay, so he can't even read it.

77
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:02,540
I can't read it. So there could be a speddy and you're just kind of glossing over it.

78
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,540
Stop it. I'm reading it all the way through now.

79
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:07,980
And you don't see S as in Samuel.

80
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,340
I'm familiar.

81
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:09,580
Okay.

82
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,660
How does Patches have his mic all the way up and you guys have it all the way down?

83
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:15,820
Because he's in a taller chair.

84
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,660
Any other mysteries you'd like for me to solve while I'm at it?

85
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,900
That's not our job. That's Batman's job.

86
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,540
Yeah.

87
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,420
What is the reason for the blueness of the sky?

88
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,180
Condensation.

89
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,300
from the blue water.

90
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,600
All right,

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,020
and could the rain how much of a grain of rice or if you doubled on a chess

92
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,700
board, a grain of rice, would you take that or

93
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,100
if I doubled on a chess

94
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,900
would you take would you take that or me?

95
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,460
You if you don't I would take you

96
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,900
if you double your Nintendo switch

97
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:02,260
Me or a PS5? Me or a Nintendo Switch 3. Definitely a Nintendo Switch 3, it hasn't come out yet.

98
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:09,600
They made a Switch 2? Yeah. Your turn. Imagine that. The mayor is terrified of you right

99
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,200
now. Terrified of what's going on. He doesn't know what happened. He's like, "What's..."

100
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,600
He's saying this, "What's happened?" And he's sort of cowering in his chair. You see the

101
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,300
general goes over and says, "Mayor Peach, I'll make sure I'll protect you from whatever

102
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,940
whatever is happening and Dylan, meanwhile, is sort of still enjoying his

103
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,780
quail eggs, kind of eating, his hands are on his hips up here, you know,

104
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,380
yeah,

105
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:35,740
shirting, he's Rodney, sure danger fielding, sure, sure thing, yeah, he's

106
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,020
doing a little bit of this,

107
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,140
he's doing

108
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,160
and when he stands and I, and I unleash ultimate locks his knees every time he

109
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,720
stands, yeah, second he's

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,060
bowed, locks his knees, hands in the front,

111
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,540
leans forward like this, yeah,

112
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,040
yeah

113
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:57,300
nodding. He nods when he's not talking. Yeah, yeah, no and also when he talks

114
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:01,940
goes like this, like he uses one hand yeah, yeah, and he puts his finger up

115
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,580
when he's entering a conversation. Yes,

116
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:10,980
it would be like a be like yeah, that's a good point and like a kind of like

117
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,300
solely he won't. He doesn't like fully owned and at times he farts and blames

118
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:20,580
it on others or never admits an animal in the room. Yeah, the dogs farting

119
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,740
just parted just now. I was like I couldn't hear it. He's like I heard it.

120
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:29,700
The dog is far right now, but before I say it, I'm the only one who heard it.

121
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,060
You guys, Oh my God, just right now the dog just farted. That just happened.

122
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,380
Did you hear the dog just for here's a dog?

123
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,340
So yeah, what do you want to do

124
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,780
right now? You are not suspected of colluding with whoever

125
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:53,020
these quail this quail egg broth into a uh uh confuse it what it was so it's the general

126
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,660
confuser yeah everybody that's what speddy means yeah everybody is right now like this i think it

127
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,340
means speedy they're going like this right now they're all confused except for the mayor

128
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,660
um the mayor isn't confused yeah and you have like i'm gonna here's what we're also gonna say

129
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:12,780
is that like let me see how long is this yeah you got about a minute of action right all right

130
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:18,360
So let's say like right now we're what's what's actually you roll initiative just so we have like a turn order established

131
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,560
What'd you get?

132
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,860
Our new camera box our new friendly, but I don't know what it says

133
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:38,600
Your feet it's a feat or what is what is initiative is I'm gonna build a box as your BAM where it is a

134
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,480
eleven. Okay, eleven. So you got eleven. Okay, and I'm just going to roll

135
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,660
initiative for the other characters in the room. It won't really dictate too

136
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,620
much. Probably mayor.

137
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:58,120
And then that was general and then Dylan. Dylan will be going last.

138
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:05,680
Good as usual. As usual. Well, I got picked last. I'm used to it. Save the

139
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,720
best for last. That's what he says. Yeah, the best for last. He says it as

140
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,520
if it's a reflex, it's before he's even processed what's happening. Yep,

141
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,820
all right, well best for last, I guess cool. So

142
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,520
yeah, I mean they kind of already did their turn, so it's really you're up.

143
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,320
This is like you're like six seconds of like kind of like figure out what you

144
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,020
want to do. How do you want to take advantage of this moment? Everybody's

145
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,520
confused. You have a chance to torment the mayor, but the general is also

146
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:38,320
there comforting him right now. So I should get the general away. You can get

147
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,840
general way, you can take out the general. What's the general's weakness? Peace.

148
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:48,320
Shack. Peace? Well there's technically peace right now. There's a lot of chaos actually.

149
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,920
Okay. Everybody's being poised. Are you crazy? There can be a chaotic peace. Yeah. There's

150
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,000
peace and chaos. Like Vietnam. Duh. Do I have a gun? It was chaotic. Did you guys listen

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,000
blowback? Do I have a gun? Your character? Yeah. Look at your sheet. Why are you asking

152
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,200
me? I have a ranged attack. Oh yeah, right. I forgot. I gave you sort of whatever you

153
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,440
wanted to put there. It could be a gun. Okay. I have a gun. Oh yeah, you chose fireball

154
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:22,120
to steal from mine. I remember now. Thanks for reminding me. Do you whip out the gun?

155
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,800
Yeah. I'd pull out a gun and I'd try to shoot the general. No, I think that was from some

156
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,520
some of the thing else. Okay, some of the thing else. Yeah. Do you say anything or

157
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,900
you just pull it out? You can. I have it. I'm just like, man, hold on. Let me go

158
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:37,120
get that my fucking gun. Once I just gotta get that thing over there. Dylan

159
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,000
sort of like, huh? Dylan, you're gonna wanna close your eyes, man, 'cause fuckin'

160
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,640
some bullshit's about to happen. I don't even remember even what I think I was

161
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,920
gonna do. I can see. There is some, you just, why don't you, so. That's perfect

162
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:58,280
Dylan body language right elbows away away right right yeah man, you better

163
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,920
just get the

164
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,720
maybe you should go on the roof or something, maybe get like

165
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,760
I don't see why it would be. Oh, you know it'd be fun. If you go up there and

166
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,960
you get a parachute and try and jump off with a little bit of his fingerless

167
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,600
gloves on for protection. Dylan, what you're going to want to do is put on

168
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,760
your cardigan, your fingerless gloves.

169
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:24,080
you're going to want to go all the way over to the bass. Do not do not come

170
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,340
back until your pocket watch says an hour has passed. He has a booger, but

171
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:30,800
he's trying really, really hard to pick his nose right now. Just go do that.

172
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:36,200
Roll persuasion with advantage. Dylan's like a lot cooler than Dylan. Nat 20.

173
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,080
Holy shit. Really? Yeah. Dylan. I should have rolled that into the dice thing,

174
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:43,640
but yeah, you've got to. Dylan's star starts to glow

175
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,000
and he floats up to the roof, just phases through the ceiling and like the

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,680
figure fully in his nose.

177
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,800
He appears on the roof. He doesn't see you yet. I just say I knew it yeah,

178
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,960
but Mr. Wonderful, but Dylan is on the roof with you right now and he's

179
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,280
looking to

180
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,000
stop

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,240
stop. All right, what does that accomplish? Why are you saying that

182
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,520
dress like that? What kind of joke do you think that is? What do you think

183
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,920
I don't even really remember which guy that is.

184
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:17,920
Me neither.

185
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,560
But Buddy, I know he was not one of the presidential candidates.

186
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,960
Yeah, he was a shooter, but I don't remember which one.

187
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Well, don't.

188
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,360
I remember, I can remember for all of us.

189
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Let's keep going.

190
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,360
What would he do?

191
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
He'd shut up the black church.

192
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Ah, rats.

193
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
Rats?

194
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,760
You call them rats?

195
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,760
What did you say?

196
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,280
I shouldn't have said that.

197
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,280
So here we go.

198
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,280
Yeah, so that's just like a free action. You can still pull out your gun.

199
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:49,280
Alright, so Dylan's gone. Obviously he's the ultimate powerer.

200
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:55,280
I'm just not going to be able to see.

201
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,280
I wish you got that.

202
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,280
I'm just not going to be able to see.

203
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,280
That was crazy.

204
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,280
I'm going to need to get them repaired.

205
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,280
Oh lord.

206
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,280
I can see perfect.

207
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:09,780
Can you?

208
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,280
No.

209
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,280
Oh, okay.

210
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Obviously, he's the most powerful person who could have stopped me or anything.

211
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,280
I think I have a very clear and open shot at the general.

212
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,280
Can I just walk over to the general and shoot him?

213
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,280
Why do you need to walk over to him?

214
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
You don't even need to walk over.

215
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
He's like the gun.

216
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Yeah, but I have terrible aim, but like walking up to him in his boondock style,

217
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,280
the back of the head

218
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,880
boondock

219
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,640
docks, a style

220
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,160
or

221
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,920
we're having a race

222
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,080
walking up to it. The

223
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,080
there's only in my mind there's only

224
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,360
and it's the same know where he's from. That's not fair. He knows when he says

225
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,440
boondocks. We know what he there's a one boondocks and it's two Irish guys.

226
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,240
That's true. You want that other show out of out of existence. I like one

227
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:10,840
character.

228
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:19,400
So you do you walk up to him boondock style? I walk up to him boondock saint

229
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,960
style.

230
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:24,400
He starts speaking in Latin. And instead of saying shepherds we shall be, I just

231
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:24,760
say,

232
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,200
"Well,

233
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:30,880
shit." Okay, yeah, the general... And when I have to kill people, I don't

234
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:37,160
that much. Yeah, roll intimidation. That's kind of bad. I've never killed. My character's never killed.

235
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,400
My character. Roll intimidation. Well, no, I'm like, oh, sorry, roll mouth or talking,

236
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,560
talking. Well, I'm shooting him in the head. Just roll talking. He's telling you to roll.

237
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,520
Well, here's you can either. OK, we get 16. That is a dirty 20. OK, yeah, he's really he's like,

238
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:10,240
the

239
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:31,960
of

240
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:46,960
of

241
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,880
the rest of the year. You're gonna get there. They're all they're all

242
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,720
confused. There are other don't shoot into the room. You can phase

243
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,080
through bullets. No, we don't know that. We don't know that. Well,

244
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,480
might have just been for the bit. Okay, then I'm shooting a painting.

245
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,320
Okay, don't one of the most expained, expanse of things. I mean, all right,

246
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,280
you use up all your ammo.

247
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:14,800
I can get more. No, I guess so. You're just at a jail. Yeah, but I can get

248
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,200
more ammo from anywhere, anywhere shopkeeper. Is there a shopkeeper around?

249
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,760
There is a, I mean, there's, there is a, like a, there's like a Duke style

250
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,240
boy. And it's not like a, it's not like the kind of, why not?

251
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,040
You know what? I don't let them do it. I'm not going to let them do it.

252
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,200
And we're in the middle of the city. Okay. There might be a place to get

253
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,160
to the next turn soon. Yeah. So anyway, moving on, the mayor's like,

254
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,600
What do you want? What do you want?

255
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,880
Can you hog tie yourself up and then put like,

256
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:51,640
just get in this bag or wait? No, you're not. I need,

257
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,800
hold on.

258
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:58,720
Cook was area would have told him about an apple in his mouth and get into a big

259
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,080
pot robot voice guy. What am I supposed to be doing? Hold on.

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:06,320
I gotta give me one second. Yes. I switched things around.

261
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,640
Is that it?

262
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:23,080
I have to F him?

263
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,280
You started with an F?

264
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,760
I don't know you were getting real close to that.

265
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,760
F word.

266
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:34,400
Get him to tell you where the emergency bath signal is.

267
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,480
Where is the emergency bath signal?

268
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:47,080
you're still talking in the voice. I know I you what well you're going like

269
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:53,240
being a mayor, because because I can't I when you hear yourself, you feel crazy,

270
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,560
okay, stop and a cheerful and a playful boy. I'll do that. I'll go okay, so

I don't know where it is

274
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,620

275
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:17,840

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,400

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,640
You know where the damn bat signal is, motherfucker.

286
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,280
You know that there's a goddamn bat signal somewhere around here, man.

You get the fucking...

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,960
There's one on the roof.

289
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,240
There's probably one on the building.

290
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,680
(whimpering)

291
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,120
All right, roll intimidation.

(laughing)

294
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,360
I can't read that.

295
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,280
Nine, plus whatever you're talking.

296
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
I mean, roll advantage.

297
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,120
Nine, oh yeah.

298
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:16,960
You have a gun in his mouth.

299
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,120
I now know, but that's scary.

300
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,240
And then, plus talking, so that is a 15.

301
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,600
Yeah, sorry, plus talking.

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,480
All right, he's going to come with you. I put the gun in the back of his head.

309
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:57,960
All right, you two now. Yeah. So let's start with the hell you doing adjusting

310
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,400
the chair. You're just in the table boy.

311
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
You got to tell me that

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,120
why what's wrong? Can't say that dressed up like a wizard. What's wrong with that?

313
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,720
Mr. Wonderful.

314
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,240
Mr. Wonderful. Yeah, you're on the roof. You're part of the plan is basically

315
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:29,240
done. Yeah, here give me the voice. So he just gets to chill now. Lucky. Now you and the cook go to the stew. Go to the stew?

316
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:39,640
Wait, what was my voice again for this? The stew. You did. You did this voice. What? Go where? Go to the stew. The stew? You said the stew?

317
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:46,240
I would like to go to a stew. He wants you to record a song. Yeah, kind of under, super

318
00:20:46,240 --> 00:21:01,240
underdeveloped. Go on Zoom! Go be my associate in the zoo. Meat. Meat? Stew?

319
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:07,320
meet from the zoo? I mean you can do what you want when you get there but first I need you

320
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,800
to get there and you know come to your place. Are you gonna call us a car or? No you have

321
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:20,760
to take a train I don't want any of this to be traceable. The train? The train! Or you

322
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,280
can walk out of the front. Wait, wait. I'll never take the train. Pardon criminals are

323
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,640
terrified of the train. Never taking the train. Why do they have to go to the zoo? Because

324
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,760
It's a backup plan.

325
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,160
In case the parade doesn't work, I want somebody to release the animals from the zoo.

326
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,560
Hey, uh, uh, Mr. Wonderful.

327
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,460
Yeah. Can you hold my hand?

328
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,060
Yeah. As we go to the train. Yeah.

329
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,540
OK, we start walking to it.

330
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,360
What's the nearest train stop?

331
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,360
Gotham Train Stop.

332
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,760
What? Why are you laughing?

333
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,000
What's so funny?

334
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,440
Wait, are we all on this call?

335
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,060
I don't know. Why is it always a call?

336
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,740
It's not, no you're not.

337
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,340
Then how are you talking to them?

338
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,440
I'm talking to them on the call.

339
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,340
Yes, I guess.

340
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,740
That's a call!

341
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,140
God damn it.

342
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,840
What do you want to say?

343
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,140
I don't know. I just wish I could be part of the conversation.

344
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
This is okay.

345
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,640
This is okay, yeah.

346
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,640
No, the nearest train station would be

347
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,540
Peach Station, named after the Peach family.

348
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Of Lionel Peach Fang.

349
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,380
so why'd you say Gotham station or

350
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,620
okay,

351
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,020
kind of a weird time to make a

352
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,780
twisted sense of humor, hang up on this. I'm hanging on

353
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:44,660
okay. You hung up on him. Damn, that's cool. You can actually hang up. Yeah,

354
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,900
okay, we start walking over to peach station. Okay, we go.

355
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,980
You guys are at the train station.

356
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,120
Okay, yeah, you see some people hanging around. Hey, okay, here, let me play the

357
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,940
ambient sound of the train station. Hold on.

358
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,240
It's true.

359
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,540
It's pandemonium at the train station.

360
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,240
Okay,

361
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,540
the guy,

362
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,640
the guy making all this noise, I put a dollar in his cup.

363
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,140
It's pretty good for a one man band. It's not too bad.

364
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,280
Okay, but first I mean I don't even I've never even ridden the train, but I

365
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,020
don't even know what to how to do this. We jump the turn stock because we're

366
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,540
criminals. Yeah. Do you guys jump to turn so blow up the

367
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,680
I duck under the turn style? I say okay, I go like yeah, I'm right behind you,

368
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:42,040
but I pay you pay. Yeah, the person does not look up for their where their

369
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,400
station is. No matter I cast a minor illusion of me paying for it.

370
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,480
That's bad ass. It works. It works. It looks like tokens, though. It looks like

371
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,640
for some reason, though, it's card now. Oh, it's all card now in Gotham. Damn.

372
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,120
Damn. They kind of fucked up. Gotham. That's how they trace you. Is it QR code

373
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,640
menus in Gotham now, too? Yep. Oh, yeah. And it's a you have to show your Vax to

374
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,080
get in. No. The bars. Wait, is that all still? Wow. They blame the pandemic on

375
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,200
Batman. Yeah. Oh, my word. He's going around getting everyone sick. He was

376
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:20,000
seat in bats. Oh true. Yeah, I guess everywhere they got selfie spots for

377
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,940
everyone to take selfies with on the walls. They've got painted weirdly in

378
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,760
design to stand in front of wings. Yep, they got wings painted on the brim.

379
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:33,340
Bro, an influencer in Gotham is probably the most dystopian thing I could ever

380
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,200
fucking think of.

381
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,640
Okay, so where do we go to the train? Are we going? Is there only one train or do

382
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,360
we have to figure out which train to take? No, no, no. Which direction? Do we

383
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,200
know which direction to go. There's only one train you said. Well, there's not

384
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,200
only one train, but you're out here at this station. What line are we on? You're

385
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,400
on the- oh man, I didn't map out Gotham this much. Well, you don't- I just even a

386
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,120
little bit, just what- just name a line. I got you this. Yeah, okay, you're on the

387
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,280
blue line. Okay, so that doesn't make much sense based on what I know about

388
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:01,760
Gotham.

389
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,520
I don't think we'd be near there at all. I think the blue line is like south to- I

390
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,480
think that goes to- no, this is going north. This is I- no, I'm- that goes from-

391
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,320
so we're on the Batman line. I'm doing the mind pal goes from blue village

392
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,800
north. Okay, I'm seeing it. Cut city cuts north. So I'm like spur it's

393
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,520
getting cold.

394
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:27,040
It is getting cold every as it goes as we go further, like like the window

395
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,440
start to freeze over. You go down to gothic becomes a desert. You go east to

396
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,240
becomes Asia.

397
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,400
Okay, how many stops are you ready? Five stops

398
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,320
and how long or too many for me. Yeah, how long does it take

399
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,620
excuse me like 30 minutes? Okay, we get on the train to express. Okay, we are on

400
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,920
the train on the train riding. Yeah, and

401
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,820
I get in the middle and I say, excuse me, excuse me, ladies and gentlemen of

402
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,120
the of got the of the blue line. We are going to do a little performance for you

403
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,420
today. If you'd like to support a youth basketball league, go ahead and give

404
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:08,320
whatever you can and then being him for doing like watch everyone get like a

405
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,020
little stiff. We start doing a lot of weird back flips. Yeah, and you maybe

406
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,380
you could beat box a little bit and take care of the beat box thing. I gave you

407
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:21,300
what play the beat box when I gave you you didn't give me a beat box one.

408
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,940
There's a beat box sound in there. Press it.

409
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:30,380
There we go, so I'm new doing back flip with the railing, your parking, but the

410
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,820
railing I'm sure I'm actually you're doing that and I'm trying to ignore you.

411
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,800
so I sit down. I take off my backpack that I'm wearing and I unzip it and I

412
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,640
take out

413
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,840
I take out Moby Dick and I sit down. I go

414
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,680
and I cross my legs and I open it to page one.

415
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,840
I put on my glasses and I flick my finger and turn past the title page.

416
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,360
I'm spinning on my head in the middle of the thing and then I and then I take

417
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,560
out my phone and I just scroll through. It's the you hide your phone in the

418
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,400
there. Yeah, you cut out a part of the book to put your phone in

419
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,880

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,640

426
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,960

God bless

435
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,420
and then you had a row. Everybody's like kind of cowering and they're like

436
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,140
giving them the money and they do that and they go to the next car and they do

437
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,740
the same exact thing. They just keep going from car to car robbing people.

438
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,380
You guys don't have to stop them.

439

Yeah, and I do that you plan paying the camera over to me and I just

457
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,800
in front of the zoo. No, no, you're like a couple blocks away.

458
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,500
What time is it?

459
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:28,600
It's midnight right? Yeah, it's pretty late. I'm calling an uber on midnight.

460
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:35,080
Okay, call it. I'd like to get in the uber with you. This is a dangerous

461
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,900
neighborhood. I hear there's animals

462
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:41,960
you wake

463
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,440
the voice for the way. What are you doing calling an uber? Stop your true

464
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,360
away. Don't call it. Can I use your card? No, I'm fucking tired. It's a business expense.

465
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,320
Yes, you can write it off. Disexpense it. No, just go to the zoo. We're going right

466
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,640
now. That cook saves the zoo. That cook saves the zoo. What do you see? That cook saves

467
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,160
the zoo. Pup putt saves the zoo. Never played that? No, I don't. Pup putt saves the zoo.

468
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,920
I've played pup putt, but not that one. Oh, okay. Was that one good? It's basically the

469
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:11,920
the main one.

470
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:15,920
No, there's like Papa goes to Mars, right? Or something, or the moon.

471
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,920
Shut the fuck up.

472
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,920
No, that's different. Stop, you tricked me. Let him walk his line.

473
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
What's up, y'all? How you doing?

474
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
Zach XA is the zoo.

475
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Okay, bye.

476
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,920
Hang up on him.

477
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,920
Just don't.

478
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,920
All right, yeah.

479
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,920
We're in the Uber.

480
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:31,920
The Uber pulls up.

481
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Be the Uber driver right now, Patches.

482
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
Okay.

483
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,920
How you guys doing?

484
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,920

00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,560
trivia? Oh yes, you of course you do. I love trivia. Can you go on the block?

490
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:07,440
Let me find some bad nature. I see the trivia and I go on my phone and I

491
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,880
change the route to be like I add a stop that's across the city and then the

492
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,180
second stop is this who okay? What super villain once broke Batman's back,

495
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:31,020
We turn my headphones down a little bit. They're so loud. You're correct.

00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:36,780
It's Mr. Wonderful. What those Bane who is credited with creating Batman?

498
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:44,740
wrong? It's Bob Kane. That must be as disputed, though

499
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:50,660
is it disputed? It is disputed. It's either Bob Kane or Bill Finger. Yeah,

500
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,380
is it true? Bill Finger,

501
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,060

Do you know all this shit about Batman?

508
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Yeah.

509
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:23,140
The original Batgirl was related to what familiar Batman character?

510
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:26,140
Fucking Commissioner Gordon.

511
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Yeah.

512
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,140
Which of these Batvillains were introduced first?

513
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:31,140

00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,140

537
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,560
Oh, then we can go through all the exhibits.

00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,560
Busted open.

Okay.

546
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,560
What's up?

547
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,560
My real -- the Rambler's real name is Manor.

548
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,560
Excuse me.

549
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,560
I should have talked, but I have to --

550
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
Manor Dilfrey.

551
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,560
The mayor, you're pointing the gun in the back of his head.

552
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Lionel Peach brings you to his daughter's room.

553
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,860
you there's fucking Barbies in here. She's an adult. There's a bar. She's an

554
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:41,840
adult. There's a Barbie from the back in the day. What's a measurements? I don't

555
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,520
know. Thirty you have. What do you mean? You don't know you're the dungeon

556
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:48,920
master. You have to have something. Thirty thousand one and thirty thousand

557
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,880
really? Did she feel like this?

558
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,080
All right, yeah, so his improbable daughter hair color blue,

559
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,880
like though not for me, but she's an SJW. Yeah, that makes it worse.

560
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:12,040
I don't want to be in this room. She vote probably. I bet she has a

561
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,640
freaking probably the penguin, probably her dad, Penguin Obama.

562
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,740
No, yeah, she's the worst one of the worst. You show me the signal.

563
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,780
Okay, okay, okay, fine.

564
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:35,780
And he goes under the bed, and he taps it, and out drops a like a, um, this like super,

565
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,260
super, this hyper power flashlight.

566
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:40,260
And it's got like a Batman symbol on it.

567
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,100
It's like, you just point this at the sky and that's how you get the Batman to show

568
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,100
up.

569
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,580
How bright is this damn flashlight, man?

570
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Is this fucking...

571
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,580
He's tricking you, man.

572
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:50,580
He's scamming you.

573
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,580
How bright is this man's fucking flashlight and shit, man?

574
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,580
It's fucking...

575
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,420
It's not just an ordinary flashlight.

576
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,300
How many lumens is this? Because one time I had got, went to the store for the

577
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,780
light bulb that had a billion lumens. I saw a light bulb with one billion lumens

578
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,780
and it was so bright, it lit up the whole store.

579
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,660
It would light up more of it a fucking store.

580
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,980
And I just flash it right in his eyes.

581
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:15,140
Oh man, a billion lumens? He's gonna go blind.

582
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,660
He's dead.

583
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,420
[laughter]

584
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,940
You're not supposed to kill him, bro.

585
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,460
That's the one guy you're not supposed to kill.

586
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:24,660
I don't know. You got the kind of got the thing you're supposed to get.

587
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,100
Raider lost Arctum.

588
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,500
That doesn't really matter again. Oh, wait, can I now?

589
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,220
That was 10 days. No, I don't. I don't just guys, right?

590
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:37,540
What? I can't disguise. Can I? You were already in a disguise.

591
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:41,300
I have a disguising ability is what I need to ask.

592
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,380
You're French. You don't have a disguising ability. You are in a disguise, though.

593
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,060
Can I change into the mayor? You can try to dress up like him. You're going to need some other.

594
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:55,540
I mean, like, are you, are you, uh, how are you rotund? No, man, are you round? I'm pretty

595
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:02,180
normal. I'm round. I basically look exactly when I take my mask off. It's string bean.

596
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,340
When I take my mask off, I don't have to become a string bean. When I take my mask off. Okay.

597
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:10,100
I look exactly like Lionel Peach, except I have a big mole.

598
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:16,420
That's what, that's what the rambler looks like under his, his mask. That's convenient.

599
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,520
Because we're twins and he doesn't know because we were separated at birth.

600
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Is that true?

601
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
What?

602
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
No.

603
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
I just made that up.

604
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,220
Well at least you whispered it so I wouldn't find out.

605
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,380
Hey, you can stuff your suit, you can try to put on a fucking little hattie hat if you

606
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
want to.

607
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,980
Okay, I'm going to take out my pen knife and cut the mayor's skin off of his head.

608
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,020
Crazy crazy crazy crazy.

609
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,020
From his neck.

610
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,020
Okay.

611
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,220
So you're going to do a fucked up like skin over your face.

612
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,500
We're going to do a skin over.

613
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,460
All right. We're going to roll a couple of things.

614
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:59,980
We're going to roll balance ball first to see how well can you put it in the

615
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,580
face? That doesn't count. Doesn't count. Doesn't count.

616
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,660
It has to be inside the camera zone. Six. Damn, dude.

617
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:09,900
Add balance ball. What's your balance ball? Plus my balance ball would be eight.

618
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:13,580
It's eight total. Yeah. Yeah. You don't do the best job.

619
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,980
you're going to look like Leatherface a bit for sure.

620
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,480
Okay.

621
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,780
But now you want to do the rest of your disguise.

622
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,580
That's talking.

623
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,380
Okay, Halloween.

624
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,280
It's not Halloween.

625
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,380
No, not this episode.

626
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:22,680
No.

627
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,980
What is it?

628
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,680
Can't see it.

629
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,480
I can't read it.

630
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,380
This has been a huge oversight by us.

631
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,980
It's been a normal sight by all.

632
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,280
It's a two.

633
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,680
What I see right here, it says it's a 20.

634
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
I'm just looking at the thing in physical space.

635
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,880
You don't need to look at the screen.

636
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,980
I just can't see this because it's so close to the...

637
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,380
You look the least like the mayor, maybe.

638
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,680
one of the least what I'm looking at the mirror and I'm just going like yeah.

639
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:52,580
The daughter comes into the room.

640
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:59,480
Because I'm actually shaped, but she's that a W is stack.

641
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,880
She sees her father triangle dead on the ground and she sees you got that

642
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,280
literal hourglass figure.

643
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,680
See if she notices.

644
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,380
Can I

645
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,840
I'll see if she noticed how you have you going to see me over her gigantic boobs.

646
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,680
That's a good point.

647
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:20,880
She has won 3000 size boobs.

648
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,280
30,000 30,000

649
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,780
one door and destroys Gotham

650
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:30,880
giant.

651
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,480
She can't see anything.

652
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,480
She's all boobs.

653
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:33,880
No, no, no.

654
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,080
Here's what we'll do to do.

655
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,680
It will give you a chance to try to convince her.

656
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,880
Okay, you're her dad.

657
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:45,040
she's coming in. She's normally a law school student. I can just turn the

658
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,100
flashlight on again.

659
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:50,240
Let me ask you a question. How come you felt the need to tell us her

660
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,580
measurements, but not that she was a law school student? I said the law school

661
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,220
student last episode and I didn't mention the measurements. Do not pound

662
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,180
it for that. I'm pounding it. Stop it and hold on.

663
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,860
You just wait.

664
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:08,500
You are a misogynist.

665
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:13,500
you are. No. Masogyny red alert. Maybe I am.

666
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:23,700
Yeah, maybe I fucking am. Okay, so why can't I just shine the flashlight at her

667
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,700
again? You definitely could do that. Yeah, I'm going to do it. Yeah, roll.

668
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,020
I'll roll for damage. That's going to hurt her. I got it. I got it. That

669
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,460
doesn't even do good because I mean, I think it was a good score. All right.

670
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,600
She is very injured.

671
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:43,400
Like she's just like, just like, just like it just like lights or fucking

672
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,240
shit on fire. She's in trouble. Wait, so I can light stuff on fire with

673
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:50,560
this. She's not literally, but she might as well be. Okay, wait, wait,

674
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,160
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. So then I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna...

675
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,320
So she's out of the doorway now? She's out of the doorway? She's...

676
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,200
Yeah, I mean she's in trouble. Okay, so I'm gonna turn and then just...

677
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,880
Whatever in this room is like a really like thin papery fabric material.

678
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,380
Okay.

679
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,880
Like if there's like a rayon curtain or something.

680
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,680
I'm just gonna shine it at that so it just burns up the house.

681
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,080
Okay.

682
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Yeah, you start doing that.

683
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,580
Okay.

684
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,480
Well, I got a roll.

685
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,280
Stop sucking off.

686
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Stop saying anything right now.

687
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,680
Okay.

688
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,780
I mean again, probably won't light anything on fire, but like

689
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,780
But what if I got a 19?

690
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:39,780
I don't know what we're rolling for, but I guess I did let you do that.

691
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,780
You let him have the most insanely powerful weapon of all time.

692
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,780
Also roll a lightsaber.

693
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,780
Luckily it's never going to run out of battery. Roll owl.

694
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,780
Roll my owl? Okay.

695
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:59,780
Oh. What did you get? Two.

696
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,980
Is that a three or that's a three? Okay, then it was a two. Okay.

697
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,880
All right, you don't notice anything.

698
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,380
Great. Yeah, and yeah, no, you that's the worst feeling in DND. Yeah, when he

699
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,480
says, roll up, roll an owl and you do and you don't know. It's not nothing.

700
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,580
Yeah, yeah, pretend. I never said that. It's a fun, fun little trick.

701
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,380
Okay, cool.

702
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:26,280
You're having fun over there. Batman is in here, isn't he? So, meanwhile,

703
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,880
go to the transition. You guys are blasting through the zoo. Do we have

704
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,800
music hold on

705
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:41,100
I love

706
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:46,660
your plastic through the zoo you're tearing up the place. It's like

707
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,240

708
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,280

709
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,900
There's no did they do this? The worst do ever

710
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,400
that's

711
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,940
the exhibit right next to it.

712
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:04,880
What are you doing? Which one's the people yelling?

713
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,980
That's the other

714
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,660
dogs and people who are scared of dogs, people who are scared of a way and the

715
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,420
other exhibit

716
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:20,200
one of the worst suits

717
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,500
where the fuck of the lion

718
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,000

719
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,980
but the kangaroos are also freaking out.

720
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:37,120
What else you got? Who else is in the zoo?

721
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:41,440
The guns

722
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,560

723
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,680

Wait.

That was amazing.

731
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:28,260
What?

732
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,960
These guys should not be in a zoo.

733
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,960
They could speak English and be on stage.

734
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,360
They're singing that and then we drive by.

735
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,360
[Gunshots]

736
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:38,360
Three.

00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:54,560
under it.

743
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,060
Money, the worst in terms of ethics, they

00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:01,560
had all their money on yeah, there's people protesting this every day.

745
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:06,460
Release the chip. They wear clothes. There are zoo guards there who are

746
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:11,040

748
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,200

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,000

I need you to we at the zoo mother fucker.

752
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:32,120
I can hear the dogs and the people. I just want to know where it's not. Oh,

753
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,860
Look back and watch me smack that, all on the floor, smack that,

754
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:37,880
banging his toes, smack that.

755
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,700
I just want to know where the animal release button is.

756
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:44,720
Can you guys find my contact?

757
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,540
Find your contact? Is he a fucking chipmunk?

758
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,560
Because if he is, he's six feet under.

759
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,080
You killed all the chipmunks.

760
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,100
All three.

761
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:54,720
Lonely, so lonely.

762
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,740
There should be a fourth one.

763
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,600
You kill him or no?

764
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,720
There's no fourth one.

765
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,340
There was only three that we heard.

766
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,480
Go back to the chipmunk cave and see if you can find a fourth one.

767
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,480
Chipmunk cave?

768
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:06,480
Cave.

769
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,480
I meant cage, but I said cave.

770
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,480
Well, we're launching here.

771
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,480
It says only three chipmunks can be famous.

772
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,480
It's not a famous one, it's the one who is...

773
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,480
Oh, we need to go to the non-famous chipmunks.

774
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,480
Wait, your friend's with a chipmunk?

775
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,480
I don't think he's a chipmunk.

776
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,480
Alex the chipmunk.

777
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,480
Oh wait, I just found the fourth chipmunk.

778
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,480
No, don't.

779
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,480
Fatality.

780
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,120
that that was Sullivan

781
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:43,080
tell you where for damage. We don't know if he's actually he's dead.

782
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,480
We didn't even get to

783
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,600
kill them before we even heard him. He was going to tell you where the animal

784
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,720
release. Okay, wait, I do want you really quick to do Sullivan right now to

785
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,400
Sullivan's voice and just what he would have said

786
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,240
right,

787
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,480
because he's a chipmunk yeah.

788
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,680
Oh, hi, you guys.

789
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,580
Yes,

790
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:16,180
it's what it would sound like as a chipmunk. Yeah, I guess so.

791
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:22,080
This is how he should have sounded the whole time. Oh my God.

792
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,380
Okay, but then we take Sullivan's consciousness and we upload. Okay,

793
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:31,100
Can we not kill Sullivan? I do, I want to hear, I want him.

794
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,100
I want to hear.

795
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,500
Okay, can we go back and undo that?

796
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
Yeah, yeah, why don't you go back and undo.

797
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,500
Just this one time.

798
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
Okay, so we're at the chipmunk exhibit.

799
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
Where the fuck is this fourth chipmunk, man?

800
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:45,500
You guys, oh damn.

801
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
No, no, no.

802
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,500
No, he's a chipmunk.

803
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,500
He's not a chipmunk.

804
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,500
No, no, he said he thinks he's in the chipmunk exhibit, but he's not a chipmunk.

805
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,500
Oh, so he thinks he's a chipmunk, but he's not.

806
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:59,540
he the zoo put him in the chipmunk yeah. What happened? Yeah, I mean he'll

807
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,700
explain okay, wait, who are you?

808
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:04,080
You guys here with

809
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:06,840
Mr. Uptown,

810
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,640
driver.

811
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:14,180
Oh, I see. Oh,

812
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,860
very funny. The guy you better watch out.

813
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,880
Please don't

814
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,260
you guys. You guys here with Mr. Uptown right? What's up to or who's uptown or

815
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,760
nothing much down with

816
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:31,860
yeah, we're with Mr uptown. He's like dressing like a little chipmunk outfit.

817
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,420
Can I real quickly while I'm while he's talking? Can I be scooping the chip

818
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:38,880
monks into my ingredients bag? Yeah, of course you can. So that's three

819
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:44,500
ingredients. There's no frog exhibit here, so I had to be a trip monk. I was

820
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,720
starting to get to know those. Wait, what do you mean there's frogs right

821
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,420

824
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,560

825
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:04,280

00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,340

00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:49,020
It's underneath the people exhibit.

Okay. Like what? They're fucking dicks and pussies.

855
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,820
No, it's just, it's just underground. There's no wonder what part of the

00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,140
ground, the part they poop on. Oh fuck. No. So there's like, Oh,

Yes he's fine.

864
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:25,020
Of course he's fucking fine.

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,960

888
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,160
Sullivan's able to open it for you. You go down there,

00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,280
hatch and you got me thinking about eggs and then

890
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,160

Okay, now, cook, you remain here with Solven.

head to the parade.

894
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,400
You can, I guess, take the card you have now.

895
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,280
- Oh yeah, all right, all right, yeah, yeah, yeah.

896
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:56,640
Got it.

897
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,440
I take the card.

898
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,480
- The card.

899
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,680
- The card.

900
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:03,000
- Come on, man.

901
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,680
You know what I'm saying?

902
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,680
I know now that you guys know what I'm saying.

903
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,680
What I'm saying.

904
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:14,680
I want to play with this voice, okay? I can't.

905
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,180
I was.

906
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,180
I'm not a smoker.

907
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:20,680
How dare you.

908
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:25,180
It's a little rude, no?

909
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,680
Can you say that again?

910
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,680
(Hawntek sounds)

911
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Oh my god!

912
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:34,680
That was actually beautiful. That was Hawntek like beautiful.

913
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,680
That sounds like a whale.

914
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,680
(Hawntek sounds)

915
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:40,680
(Hawntek sounds)

916
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Can you put that voice on all of us?

917
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,680
Nope.

918
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,680
I would love to do a chorus of that.

919
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:48,680
You can't do that. All of us do that.

920
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,680
It's not doable. I can't do it.

921
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,680
It's over for you Patrick. It's not your scene right now.

922
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,680
So why don't you go back to playing with your little gun.

923
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,000
I put the gun back together. Thanks. So do you leave you leave the hatch? You

924
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,200
have the car? I'm going to start burping. So I see now it's his scene. Now

925
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,640
real quickly to solve and spit up when I burp him

926
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:07,240
roll

927
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,960
roll,

928
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:09,920
talking

929
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,760
strength. Yeah, how hard you can

930
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,400
that is a ten. That's a perfect. The man you hit me my

931
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,620
you. Oh, he made himself burp so that so that it would stop

932
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:29,220
sounds like a lot more, but

933
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:33,860
that's like I need to burp you some more. It sounds like you're struggling to get

934
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,680
that out. Please don't okay

935
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:41,980
man. I got to be a lightsaber now. Okay, the fucking I got to do with the thing

936
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:46,200
man. Fuck it. Hey, what you doing bitch? What the fuck's up with you man? I had

937
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:51,220
Wait, I took a, I think I ate the food that the cook made or something.

938
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,220
I need you to just...

939
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:56,220
Man, there's so much bunches stuff in this fucking home.

940
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:01,220
So first of all, everybody who is downstairs is now, what, not confused anymore.

941
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,220
So you need to be on the lookout for that.

942
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,220
Alright, I'ma call an Uber.

943
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:08,220
Well hold on, don't. Wait. That's... Please.

944
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,220
I'ma call an Uber and I'ma get out of here.

945
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,220
Do not call an Uber.

946
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,180
Ring

947
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:20,780
I see a request pop up from T Rambler

948
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,180
window. What I want you to do is

949
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:38,860
yeah, I can do that for maneuver pretty comfortably.

950
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:43,860
Holy shit, no the whole point is that the bat goes to the manor.

951
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,860
So if you do it from an Uber, do you understand?

952
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,860
Unless the Uber's gonna be parked there.

953
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,860
Wait, no, you don't go to the manor.

954
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,860
Go to the parade.

955
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Well, I can't, man, man, I can't cancel it right now.

956
00:55:57,860 --> 00:55:58,860
I can't cancel it.

957
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:00,860
I, I, I just canceled Uber.

958
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,860
I don't cover the $5 cancellation fee.

959
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:05,860
Man, I don't even have a penny to my name.

960
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:07,860
I don't even know why I called an Uber.

961
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:11,060
Cause you're the worst person who's ever lived.

962
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:12,260
That's why.

963
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:17,860
Will you please use the bat signal?

964
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,060
Oh, that's...

965
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:24,260
[Laughter]

966
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:35,060
Okay, yes.

967
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:40,060
All right, cool. So yeah, you're shooting on the bat signal towards the sky.

968
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:44,140
I'm just pointed at stuff in the mansion. I'm trying to be I'm like being like

969
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,740
what we see some of the guests. They go, Hey, that is him. Get him. They're

970
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,860
French. Some of them you're shooting at them. Okay. They are normal people, so

971
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:54,740
they will just shooting light shooting light them.

972
00:56:54,740 --> 00:57:01,660
I wonder if in our lifetime, we'll have laser guns in the military. I hope

973
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:06,620
everybody. And do you energy weapons? We already have them.

974
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:09,660
They just don't tell us. I don't tell you. Yeah, they're

975
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,620
developing dues. We've had them for years. That's what they

976
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,460
call them. Two of them died.

977
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:20,700
How many? How many were there? There's 11 people. You killed

978
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:26,060
two. How many of us there's already dead. The rest the rest

979
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:29,260
are semi injured. One of them is badly injured. Who's that one

980
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:30,760
Senator is badly injured. What's his name?

981
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,900
I have to make sure I'm getting that right. Hold on. I'm just standing there

982
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:41,000
very nonchalant with the flashlight. The Senator is badly injured. Here's the

983
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,340
thing.

984
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,060
Dylan is still on the roof, so he doesn't know what's going on, but

985
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:47,620
security is no has now been like, hey,

986
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:54,060
we never pissed ourselves. Well, maybe we did. I don't know. Can I add lore to

987
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:57,620
Dylan? Dylan is Dylan Wayne and he's Bruce Wayne's brother.

988
00:57:57,620 --> 00:58:02,980
can I add lower as well, but he doesn't know anything about the bat. No

989
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:07,760
Dylan is one of those really flexible fat guys who can put their head in front

990
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,740
of their leg. No, he's got to be like a no, he's like a pace. He's he's pasty,

991
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,560
skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny, skinny,

997
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:18,780
He can like bring his fingers back and touch his arm.

998
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:20,780
He does double jointed, he says I'm double jointed and he does the thing where he does it.

999
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,780
Right, yeah.

1000
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:26,780
He does the least interesting double. He can't, he can almost put his foot behind his head.

1001
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:30,780
He like does the same magic trick whenever he's, I know magic because he's like

1002
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:36,780
He has one wallet, he has one wallet in his left back pocket and that's his regular wallet.

1003
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:38,780
Right.

1004
00:58:38,780 --> 00:58:42,780
Then his right back pocket, he has one that when you open it up it shoots a paper dove.

1005
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:47,280
super dove. That's his dummy wallet because he gets robbed.

1006
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,480
Yeah. Dylan Wayne. Blonde?

1007
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:56,480
Dirty blonde. Blonde, bowl cut. Dirty blonde, bowl cut. Is it bowl cut or is

1008
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,080
it like... It's not full bowl cut though. But it's accidentally a bowl cut.

1009
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,480
You got a great clips cut and then you grew it out. Right, it's like it

1010
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,440
could be side swept but then it like... Yeah, he has bangs and he

1011
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,380
does this. Yeah.

1012
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:11,620
He gets them out of his face. It's perfectly kind of swooped in the

1013
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:15,120
the front right. It's like it's only bangs under the same line, but there is

1014
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:15,240
a

1015
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,760
and he got braces last month.

1016
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:24,440
He just got his braces off yeah and his teeth hurt so bad. He can only use

1017
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,200
really soft so big though.

1018
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:31,620
When he smiles every time he's worth every time he smiles. He does this. I

1019
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,080
got my money's worth right yeah,

1020
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:35,780
he laughs like this

1021
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:39,700
and he keeps his keys on a lanyard.

1022
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:45,400
I don't show that he swings when he walks around around his neck. He puts it

1023
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,660
around his neck when he's sitting down.

1024
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:51,680
Anyway, I can't touch this

1025
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,820
yeah and he goes like this.

1026
00:59:53,820 --> 00:59:57,540
Oh my God, but he's the life of the party at weddings. Really is

1027
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:05,100
I want to be real so bad. He is basically real. No, you don't know if

1028
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:09,700
you are built like Dylan. If you look exactly like contact with us,

1029
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:14,020
Dylan Wayne. I know that there's probably fifty Dillons listen.

1030
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:19,360
You look like Dylan, please, please, please, you get us of any time. Yeah,

1031
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,300
please dress up like him and send us photos and villains always get. They

1032
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:26,820
always follow the trail of villains, always follow the trail of clues to try

1033
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,500
and find out who Batman is. They always mix it up and think it's Dylan and

1034
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,340
they're always like corner him and he's like whoa buddy. I don't know what

1035
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,260
you're talking about his name. His name is Dylan Wayne. They're following it

1036
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,220
from behind. I think it's Batman. They turn him around. It's Dylan with a

1037
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,760
I'm sure in the face. What's up

1038
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,560
his name's Dylan Wayne, but it's

1039
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:50,920
it's Dylan Wayne by like adoption or something adopted. He was adopted. No

1040
01:00:50,920 --> 01:00:53,960
Batman was adopted. Dylan was their actual child. Yeah,

1041
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:59,460
we need another kid yeah and we obviously can't. We obviously can't use

1042
01:00:59,460 --> 01:00:59,980
the same d

1043
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,940
anyway

1044
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,840
back to

1045
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:10,380
you going to the parade, a bare thigh is on the chair,

1046
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:16,380
but he's getting an uber ride right now, and I have I'm looking at all my uber

1047
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:16,620
my

1048
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:23,880
try to complete all the right, so I could go to the parade, but I'm like

1049
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:27,200
going all around every time about to finish. What I got like I see like

1050
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:27,700
another one

1051
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:35,040
stop the guys like saying stop at you who the the mother of the voice. I can't

1052
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:39,580
Oh, no, tell stop stop picking up people. I have somebody in my car. What I

1053
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,120
supposed to do

1054
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,820
oh

1055
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:47,000
I grab side of his head. I

1056
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:52,540
well, actually for I really slowly roll up the back when I try to do it and

1057
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:55,140
then there's no back window to slam his head against and I roll the back window

1058
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:56,220
up. It takes a long time.

1059
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:03,180
I'm turned around and I'm blessed and scary music, a day to remember type shit

1060
01:02:03,220 --> 01:02:07,380
only the break down you put your you put your phone on you put a

1061
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:14,400
you put a on to go to a day to remember, but then it accidentally it plays

1062
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:25,820
you're playing a punk by a punk a punk a bro. I don't know what you are talking

1063
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:30,260
about a punk and he's saying it. We went to he went to click a day to remember,

1064
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,260
but then he has a punk by...

1065
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:34,260
He clicked on songs.

1066
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:36,260
And then hit the first one and now

1067
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,260
A-Punk by Dinosaur Weekend.

1068
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:40,260
That would be a badass montage song.

1069
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:42,260
That would be killing motherfuckers too.

1070
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:44,260
I was gonna say, sort of like a singing in the rain.

1071
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,260
Like Steve McPubrick.

1072
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,260
Well me and Sullivan are listening to music too.

1073
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:50,260
We fly high.

1074
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:52,260
I'm not paralyzed but

1075
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,260
I seem to be struck by you.

1076
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,260
I wanna make you move.

1077
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,260
Because you're standing still.

1078
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:08,740
Okay, I burp him. Okay, now I stopped accepting the Uber request. I'm going to

1079
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,740
the parade and I'm also listening to music and I'm listening to that song

1080
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:15,560
that goes like, "When you see yourself in a crowded room..."

1081
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:22,060
I don't know how the rest of it goes. Cool, yeah. So you're at the...

1082
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:25,260
And they're playing the... They're playing the song from Titanic at the

1083
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,760
manner right now. So the parade is supposed to celebrate Gotham's uh...

1084
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:31,560
Medley mix with moves like Jagger. Yeah.

1085
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,560
Okay, then I turn the social network soundtrack.

1086
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,560
(laughter)

1087
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:37,560
(singing)

1088
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,560
(singing)

1089
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,560
(singing)

1090
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,560
Here, put on Batman voice, not scary guy voice.

1091
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:45,560
(screams)

1092
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,560
Oh my god, that was almost so fucking bad.

1093
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,560
It wasn't at all. It's a completely empty can.

1094
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:51,560
But if it was a full can, it would have...

1095
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,560
If it was a full can, it wouldn't have tipped over.

1096
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:54,840
It would have fried.

1097
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:55,640
What did that last one do?

1098
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:56,140
You got it!

1099
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:56,640
Okay.

1100
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:02,280
The parade is supposed to celebrate Gotham's living parents' day.

1101
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:09,080
Celebrate all the parents who are alive in honor of famous Gotham citizen Bruce Wade,

1102
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:10,360
whose parents are dead.

1103
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:17,640
All parents, good or bad, ugly or hot, ride on top of floats that celebrate,

1104
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:20,760
coaching little league games and helping you with your homework,

1105
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,880
Installing a latch key or having the talk anything that still living parents do

1106
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,760
The braid takes place at night

1107
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:36,040
Because that was when Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered and Gotham wants to show all the parents murderers

1108
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:42,140
Out there that the night does not fear them or wait, hold on I

1109
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:47,080
Wrote that completely wrong that the parents don't fear the night

1110
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:53,220
That's crazy how wrong that is and that parent murderers should instead fear

1111
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:57,620
the night wow okay cool dude okay, because that is when parents who are

1112
01:04:57,620 --> 01:04:59,900
still alive are at their most powerful

1113
01:04:59,900 --> 01:05:04,820
at night yeah night. Oh, because that's when they watch flight of the concords

1114
01:05:04,820 --> 01:05:06,740
and they close the attic door day

1115
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:07,240
Commissioner,

1116
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:19,760
I've not had a single thought about that

1117
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,900
into in like a long enough time. That's making me aware of my age

1118
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:31,060
Commissioner Gordon, who, if you remember, is Filipino watches over the

1119
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:36,260
proceedings intently. His ever visually Gotham City Police squad patrolling for

1120
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:37,600
many dubious villains.

1121
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,120
Yeah, and you see people as you're walking by, they're saying happy

1122
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:46,660
parenting to you and a wonderful Parents Day celebration to you. And yeah, it's

1123
01:05:46,660 --> 01:05:50,100
a whole parade and all those floats I described or Batman described are going

1124
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,820
on. And the scary guy voice, amazing.

1125
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,040
The uptown, oh that's me.

1126
01:05:55,040 --> 01:06:02,100
Now, it's too wonderful you should have a squirrel. A squa? I gave you a squirrel.

1127
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:10,220
Well that's going to be pretty confusing because I carry around a lot of scrolls so I don't

1128
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:11,220
know that I...

1129
01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:14,700
This story will continue in two weeks with our third and final installment of Gun City

1130
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,700
Presents.

1131
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,420
Batman, the villains are incredible.

1132
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:21,820
Thank you for watching and for your continued support.

1133
01:06:21,820 --> 01:06:24,460
You are not going to want to miss this thrilling conclusion.
