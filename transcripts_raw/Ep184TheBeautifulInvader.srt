1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,120
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,380
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,060
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:10,880
(laughing)

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,720
(explosion)

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,640
(imitating guitar)

8
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:22,400
- You can't go back to the--

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,760
- No, 'cause when the guitar starts,

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,200
like that's when the fucking,

11
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,040
they're still doing the,

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,200
(imitating guitar)

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,480
They're still doing that and that.

14
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,280
I don't think so. They are. I think you have the Halo some wrong song song wrong.

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,960
No. Yeah. They they it goes over it. It's like an accent or whatever. I'm gonna go

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,920
over you and I dunk on you. You did. I'm gonna I'm gonna get some hops. I'm gonna

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,400
accidentally drink soap this morning. You drank soap? Mm-hmm. Why? I didn't clean

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:52,840
out a cup enough. I'm so not used to having a dishwasher. He saw the blue color.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,000
He's like oh Mountain Dew. I saw the soap and I was like that could just be because I was

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,280
putting the cold brew in and I was like oh that could just be like a head yeah and

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,240
then I I mixed it with the milk then took one sip and immediately was just like oh

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,160
fuck spit it out you can have soap yeah it's normal yeah I know but my tummy

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,880
hurts now and I need you guys to rub that's just that's the coffee that's not

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,400
and I need you guys to rub me soap doesn't so makes your mouth I need you

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,400
to rub me soap has no effect on the stomach I'm a scientist I've researched

26
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,500
this and I need a rubbing a lot of different ways and soap debate

27
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,680
practically disappears by the time listen to the stomach it's not about it's

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,840
not about what you're talking about it's about my belly and how I need it rubbed

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,880
and I'm scientifically saying that's false I just polished facts are not

30
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,960
stealing yeah just a pinch of pussy I just polished off so I gotta buy the we

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,440
gotta buy the I think that that is a good first first mini fridge item yes we

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,780
get like a 64 pack of Pussy Energy. The same one Jack got with the

33
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,020
shirts. I think that's a good choice. I've never had it.

34
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,860
I wish you had. Wait there's at least one sip left in that. Yeah,

35
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,780
yeah, get that sip. Drink it like a genie. It's a genie flavor. Something might

36
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:18,700
come out. That was way too small a sip to tell anything about what this is. Nope, you

37
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,660
got it it feels like we're ordering a prickling my tongue well it's prickly

38
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,220
pear flavored so that makes perfect sense mm-hmm I think it's it's really

39
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,380
terribly area sparkling passion fruit and lychee flavored wrong that's way off

40
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,100
produced in the Netherlands mm-hmm you know same place as a Red Bull is that

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,100
true do they have like a Swedish zero grams of salt they do have a spring

42
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,580
though it's the friggin the way I jump around and bounce after I drink a little

43
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,380
- You're also bringing your stuff, that damn Red Bull.

44
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,220
- Yup.

45
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,060
- That's right.

46
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,840
- I was buying, I put on a bad pair of underwear today.

47
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,360
It's like, you know when you like put on a pair

48
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,200
of underwear and you're like,

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,660
"Oh, I gotta throw it out." - A rotten pair, oh my God.

50
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,980
The ones that have holes,

51
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,980
just your balls just pop out of the bottom of them.

52
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,020
- I had a pair of boxers where the elastic

53
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:08,140
has completely deteriorated and it makes that crunch sound.

54
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,980
And I was-- - Ugh.

55
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,820
- Yeah. - Okay, that's not--

56
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,540
- Yeah, I don't know about-- - No, no, that's--

57
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,700
- You've been nutting on those.

58
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,500
- No, it's not a nutting.

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,900
It's the elastic. - It is a nut.

60
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,500
the band has like completely deteriorated. You've been completely

61
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,800
nutting on to the thing. I can go get it for you it's in the trash right now it's in the

62
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,140
trash in the office. I'm gonna shatter the waistband when they do the math and break

63
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,820
your bed. Because I bought the underwear on the way here. I bought a new pack of underwear.

64
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,500
And you swapped? Yeah I swapped out here. You are a monster. Can we have a no shitty

65
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,340
underwear in the- It's not- I didn't shit in there. You literally said it was covered

66
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,140
with dried shit and that's why it's so dry that you shatter it you ate granola

67
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,500
bars into it and that's why it's crunchy. It does sound it sounds like uh when you

68
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,540
pull it it sounds like styrofoam. It probably tastes like styrofoam too.

69
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:01,540
It's that's so gross. Yeah. It cracks like a like a salt field.

70
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:05,140
Yeah pretty much. That looks bad. I bought I bought underwear on the way here

71
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,060
and I was in the store and uh there's like a little. Is there an

72
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,580
- Is there a Thunders outlet around here?

73
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:13,920
- No, I went to a place called Jimmy Jazz.

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,000
I bought some Nike dry fit underwears.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,840
- Damn.

76
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,660
- These things are nice as hell.

77
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,500
- That's sick.

78
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,860
- Yeah, but watched a kid just get smacked

79
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,060
in the face by his mom.

80
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,180
- You said that, what did he do though?

81
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,500
- He was sitting there and he was just moving around

82
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,860
and she said, "Stop moving."

83
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:33,140
And then he just got the shit smacked out of him.

84
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,380
- I mean, to me, that's a clear cut case.

85
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,220
- Yeah.

86
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,220
- Hey buddy, you moved.

87
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,980
- She said if you don't stop moving right now,

88
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,440
I'm gonna smack the shit out of you harder when we leave.

89
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,260
- So she gave him a warning. - When we leave the store.

90
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,300
- Yeah, she gave him a warning, that's right.

91
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,140
- And then the kid said to the mom, the kid said,

92
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,640
"We're not in a store, we're in a shoes store."

93
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,740
And I was like, "Oh, you are buying yourself."

94
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,080
He bought himself six more slaps.

95
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,560
- Oh my, I would've knocked his teeth out.

96
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,400
- Yeah.

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,000
- I can't believe that, dude.

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,340
- Yeah, crazy. - We're in a shoe store?

99
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:09,260
not in a store. We're in a shoes store. What a fucking brat. What

100
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,740
didn't you should have gotten some licks in dude? I honestly

101
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,580
I turned and I was like oh no dude. Hey, you need some help

102
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,100
over here. Yeah. Yeah. That kid's that kid's going to be in

103
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,180
a coffin to destroy him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on one second

104
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:28,140
man. It's a good idea. I did you should be able to phone a

105
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,460
friend to hit your kid. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I mean,

106
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,740
because then it's not if I were that if I were that mom, I

107
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,760
I'll be ackley I'd be I'd be dragging him from the the sneaker section of the

108
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,880
dress shoes section, because I'm dressing him for the cough and

109
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,720
that's right yeah, yeah, I'm getting fucking from aldehyde injected into his

110
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,940
skin, make him puff up a little bit yeah, yeah, give him a fake eye do that

111
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,640
was I mean I haven't seen a good good old fashioned. You should be able to

112
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,420
hire a hit man to punch your kid in the face, like you should like as a guy

113
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,440
walks up to your kid and just smacks him and goes, "That's for misbehaving at home."

114
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,440
And then you can be like, "What in the world?"

115
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
"I'll have to chase you away around this corner."

116
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,440
I guess that'll happen every time that you misbehave from now on.

117
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,440
And then the kid will be like, "Oh, I'm gonna get him."

118
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,440
"But it's not my mom or dad's fault."

119
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
"Yeah, well that wouldn't make any sense."

120
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,440
"I'm not gonna get a complex about this."

121
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,440
"She tried to chase him."

122
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,440
"It's a crazy bald guy."

123
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,440
"She chased him away around the corner with money and then he was gone."

124
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,080
hit your kid too much, they get too talented like Michael Jackson. I don't

125
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,200
want that bullshit. I don't need that life. Yeah, I know, but then they get too talented, but then they develop weird crap.

126
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,600
Exactly, and also, you know, the worst thing... Here's the only reason not

127
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,640
hit your kid, okay? It'll make them too talented at something, and then

128
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,080
eventually they'll become super famous and write a memoir where they talk

129
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,840
non-stop about how you hit them. And then they tell some weird

130
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,600
things like, "Yeah, my dad used to eat peanuts with the shell on." Yeah, they

131
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:00,380
definitely they'd latch on to something yeah. It's like man my dad was so my dad

132
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:04,600
was so weird growing up he would hit me and he would eat peanuts with the shell

133
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:09,200
on yeah. I don't need some kids on my fucking business. No way. Yeah no fuck

134
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,680
that. My dad used to put peanuts in the microwave and eat them. Well that's just

135
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,880
boiled. That's bold. No my dad didn't do that. I'm just saying this is a thing.

136
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,400
I'm saying that's what they would say in the memoir. That's what they would say in the memoir.

137
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,200
They would ruin your life. Yeah. You'd be in like a nursing home and they'd start to shun you.

138
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:30,840
because oh here comes mr. shell yeah mr. shells yeah mr. shells a better name

139
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,840
than Shelly unless it's mom who does it maybe they call you like mr. peanut like

140
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,920
after mr. peanut that was that's a pretty obvious name yeah why you wish it

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:46,120
but like you know mr. shell mr. shell mr. shells better than mr. peanut yeah what

142
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:52,720
mr. what as an insult mr. peanuts a distinguished man

143
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,920
Mr. Peanut's so rich, nothing embarrassing about that.

144
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,420
Mr. Peanut, also, you call someone Mr. Peanut and they're like, "Mr. Peanut, how's that an insult?"

145
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Mr. Peanut, you call someone Mr. Shell and they go, "Oh, he probably eats peanuts with a shell on."

146
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,920
Or he might eat shell.

147
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,920
Or he eats shell turtles, that guy.

148
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,920
That's from Mr. Peanut, so we know this has to do with peanuts, not like eggshells or something.

149
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,420
Immediately they're like, "Well, that's a... Yeah, that makes sense."

150
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,920
If they just called you Shell, they might get confused.

151
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,920
Exactly.

152
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,920
The Mr. helps a lot.

153
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,420
Mr. Yeah. It's kind of like a signifier. It's like a peanut-based insult.

154
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:29,420
Exactly. Yeah. You can't go anything other than Mr. though. Monsignor? No. Nope. Monsignor

155
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:36,420
show? Then it's a snail thing. Yeah. Are you guys on high alert? Oh yeah. So what DefCon

156
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,420
are we at? First of all, can we get a DefCon thing? Yeah. Oh, that's a good idea. Yeah.

157
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:47,300
Like a sliding scale. I would say we're 10 minutes to midnight. We're in, we haven't,

158
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,300
We got an office.

- I'm an old soul.

189
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,880
- No way.

190
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,420
- Old people see me and they know I'm wise beyond my years.

191
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,260
- Old people see you and they look at you--

192
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,460
- They can have a conversation on the--

193
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,580
- They look at you and think you're on their level

194
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,780
and that's why they don't like you.

195
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,340
- The thing is, I have inherited the worst old person traits

196
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,180
from my grandparents.

197
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,000

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,260
- You got that weird smell.

203
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:48,060
you know, just like like like hoarder, like just picks up like like books out

00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,400
and fifty yeah horrible horrible terrible. Yeah, really annoying to find

208
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,540
a deal. I was saying I would love to fast forward to be seventy years old,

209
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:09,260
because I think I'll be a really, really good seven year old. I'm a really

210
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,880
annoying twenty something year. Yeah, we hate you be the perfect grandpa of all

211
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,880
time. You would get so good. That's what I'm saying, right? And like this long hair

212
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,720
could be really wispy, right? And gray. You'd be so good at metal detecting.

213
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,640
Dude, I would be so good. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. You need to get into

214
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,680
that stuff, bird watching. Anyway, the... Anyway, yeah. So this lady, she's

215
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,440
talking to us, she's so excited, we're renting the place and she's like,

216
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,360
"Oh." And just so you know,

217
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,800
you'll see walking up and down this block, there's a beautiful 31 year old

218
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,200
white man. That's what she said. Yeah, those exact words and he is the

219
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,160
police description. He used to he used to live in this apartment. He used to

220
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,240
live here and he fell in love with the place, but then he lost the apartment

221
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,120
and now he tries to get back in because he loves it so much. So he broke that

222
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,140
window right there and he went in a broken. He went in there a few weeks

223
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,200
ago. He just he loves the place. He's beautiful by the way. Yeah, beautiful

224
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,540
and she's also like he's so she clever like

225
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:10,120
like he's a velociraptor. He's so smart that he figured out the

226
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,940
combination to the bill and we're just in a oh

227
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:17,540
great great news. Yeah, that's cool. That's really good.

228
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:21,700
So she's like we put a security camera down there and

229
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,420
like that's going to help us. He just he loves the apartment so

230
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,820
much he's trying to get back in. He just loves it. No, he has to

231
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,420
get home. He needs to go home. If he pays us rent,

232
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,100
I mean I'm done now with that's what I was sounds like we should if he shows up

233
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,980
if he's like trying to break in with a we'll give you a tour bro like you hang

234
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,800
out whenever if you really need to hang out that bad yeah just he's really that

235
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,180
beautiful also yeah if you're good look like we could probably use a like a good

236
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,460
looking guy in the crew like a really good looking guy yeah also he used to be

237
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,260
a construction worker he could help us set some stuff yeah also he used to be a

238
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,740
construction worker, but now he's into drugs. We could get some drugs. I love

239
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:08,100
drug like drugs. I love doing drugs. It's not pressed with fent yeah, and he

240
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,900
probably wouldn't he wouldn't have drugs that are pressed with friend fent

241
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,220
though. I don't know you would have drugs pressed with friend. Yeah, yeah,

242
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:17,660
after he's done with us friendship. That's right. He could live under the

243
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:20,660
stairs there, but so we're pretty much calling him the lovely invader, the

244
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,220
beautiful invader. Yeah, we have to deal with the beautiful invader now. Yeah,

245
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,200
the little the craziest part of it is like is not to me and some strangler

246
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,720
the home body is she told us this whole story about how he so he walks out. He

247
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,400
runs up and down. She said she also said she said oh the other day he was

248
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,360
running up and down trying to get in, but he saw me and he left

249
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,880
running up and down. She's so powerful. He ran by and tried to get in, but he

250
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,920
saw her and he was out of the he's trying to displace enough air that it

251
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,940
just pushes the doors open. Yeah, it's by fast running around the building and

252
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,860
trying to create a tornado. He's building up speed so that he can just run

253
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,260
through phase through the can try to dive kick through the way. Yeah, he's

254
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,980
running around to he's trying to run fast enough to spin Earth's rotation

255
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:10,100
backwards, so we can go back back in time to win. Yeah, he's trying to

256
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,300
Superman. Yeah, that's a really yeah. What what I the whole thing of the what

257
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:20,340
it felt like a though like a cruel joke is that he like he got into the unit

258
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,920
directly next to our like he tries to get he's not going to get in don't worry,

259
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,480
but by the way he broke the window right next to your window and he went in

260
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,880
there. Also, he must be a thin man because I was a small hole tiny tiny

261
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:38,040
drugs and he's good looking yeah yeah and thirty one. I bet he's white. I bet

262
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,600
he's shredded dude definitely. I bet he's like I can't stop writing. It just

263
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,440
like him yeah perfect. I want to I want to I want to show him. Can you imagine

264
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,420
that he can he can have a better life. Can you imagine his cum gutters? Oh, this is

265
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:57,220
his V. I bet he's so cut, dude. What if we see him? And he's got to have a small

266
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,820
cock to fit in that thing, too. Yeah, definitely. No, that was a tiny hole.

267
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:05,380
It's not a power thing, either. Maybe he can like squeeze his body like an

268
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:11,140
octopus. See, that really didn't look like a human-sized hole. Also, it was a very small hole and also there was

269
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,260
there was jagged glass pointing, like, surrounding the hole. Yeah.

270
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:21,260
and so he might be cut up to to have to nurse back to he literally is like a

271
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,500
dark souls NPCs, probably covered in scars and he he's chasing some long lost

272
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,540
like sorrowful spirit of his like past dwelling yeah yeah and he's called the

273
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,780
beautiful invader and then i heard i the when i was trying to figure out

274
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,580
something and i went into the lobby of the apartment building the other day and

275
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,780
i heard from the apartment that she pointed to is like that's where he lived.

276
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:46,300
I heard that one Spanish song is like

277
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:52,980
so maybe he's just trying to get back into the party. Oh true. Maybe he's got

278
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,980
a non stop party. I was up there. She also another detail. She told us that I

279
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:02,260
forgot about until the other day is that she after she said after he lost the

280
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,020
apartment, his roommate left to oh yeah. He probably doesn't even realize his

281
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:09,900
roommates gone. He's probably going to get back into the apartment teamed up.

282
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,300
They might have a team rocket kind of thing. Oh shit. The thing is we either

283
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,500
have a nemesis or a best friend and either way i'm like really happy about it.

284
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,340
Yeah, like it's cool. It's a big it's nice to finally have like a villain.

285
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,540
Dude, i've never had an actual like i've never had like it like an other world

286
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:29,020
really like a slasher villain. Yeah, it's fucking sick dude. We have to

287
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,940
defend ourselves. We've been talking about it just being five nights at

288
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:35,220
freddy's every time we're at the office. That's cool dude like i want that so

289
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:39,340
badly yeah playing like like maybe one and also the best part is he cuts the

290
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:44,980
power. Oh shit, well, I got the power and then we just start yeah, it's all dark

291
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,700
start hearing change just drag

292
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,740
down the hallway

293
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:52,500
be cool. So there's a grumble yeah.

294
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,060
Oh my God, that would be so sick open the door. He has one huge arm. Yeah,

295
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:03,500
yeah, I like it like a like a like a left for dead. Yeah, I'm the Popeye no

296
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,980
or like no, I mean pop. Maybe his roommate could be Popeye. Okay, so it's

297
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,620
charger it's the charger and pop I and then like which one I'm more scared of

298
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,140
maybe it's like a boss fight where like we had been like eating spinach so we

299
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,700
have to like hit the Popeye guy before he gets to the spinach we were eating or

300
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:23,240
else he'll get more we need you know we could we could poison the spinach by

301
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,140
putting soap in it you know we need to keep it around here some red barrels

302
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:30,220
yeah that we know that makes that makes the fight way harder if you're standing

303
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:33,620
right barrels at him though what if he uses a chain spinning attack and he

304
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,600
blows up all the red barrels at once. I'm not going to pretend that I know the game

305
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:42,740
faq on this guy. Well, red barrels respawn if they're needed. Exactly, yeah. And also,

306
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,380
you don't need to keep little floating cross. Little floating plus sign. Get some health.

307
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,300
Those will be good. Yeah, they're expensive, man. Little green floating holographic plus

308
00:17:52,300 --> 00:18:00,660
sign. Barbarian, rogue, wizard. Okay, can I have a bow and arrow? What did I say you

309
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,500
another rogue. You can be a ranger archer yeah or yeah, thank I was going to say I

310
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,780
think if we keep some chew jellies around, if we keep those in a bottle, we

311
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,820
can bring them to the hag and then she'll turn them into potions. If we get

312
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:17,780
some room we oh we got to get we got to turn this into a crafting table. Yeah,

313
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,060
oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because we're going to need to upgrade our stuff. You

314
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,020
know once we get the bone arrow and the sword in the

315
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,340
chain mail yeah, we're going to need and I'll probably buy the scar. This is I'm

316
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,560
- We're supposed to go to Medieval Times soon.

317
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,400
- You're supposed to?

318
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,440
- Yeah. - You have an appointment?

319
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,280
- I do.

320
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,100
- You have a portal opening soon?

321
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,440
- Yeah, my girlfriend has tickets to Medieval Times.

322
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,780
- Oh, we're gonna need a portal.

323
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,480
- Yeah, we definitely need a portal.

324
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,600
- We're gonna need a portal to our home.

325
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,440
- Yeah.

326
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,560
- Also, we're gonna need to invite,

327
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,080
maybe invite some other players.

328
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:45,920
- Yeah.

329
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,760
- Yeah, to defend our--

330
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,280
- Oh my God, we could do a raid.

331
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,120
What if he, what if--

332
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,960
- He's doing a raid.

333
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,240
- No, yeah, no, what if we're like,

334
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
we go home for the night, we come back in the morning,

335
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,760
he's in here, he's like terraformed it

336
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,280
and we like his layer and we have to do a raid we have to recruit the other people

337
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:04,640
from the apartments and stuff he terraforms our office into his plate do

338
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,400
so once we do when we kill when we defeat him it goes back to normal yeah

339
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:13,320
okay I was gonna say it mad or we have to use a converter shard that's true but

340
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,320
all of our stuff would be repurposed into new things right so it'd be like so like

341
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,120
this would probably be like this would be like a drug table the computer would be

342
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,960
like drugs.

343
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,160
The computer would have the Silk Road OS on it. That skateboard would probably be

344
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,800
a pile of drugs, too. It'd probably be a giant pile of crack. Yeah. Yeah. Alex

345
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,240
told me my room looks like a crack den. Your room? Yeah. He, Alex has never met

346
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,960
anybody who's ever done crack.

347
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,680
That is so funny. Your room is, like, full of, like, British comedy DVDs and

348
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:48,760
the beds on the floor. The beds on the floor right now, 'cause the bed frame

349
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,840
broke in the move.

350
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,640
- Okay.

351
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,920
- That's why it's on the floor.

352
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,760
- I guess, it's not even your bed,

353
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,860
it's a mattress on the ground.

354
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,700
- Yeah.

355
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,760
- You don't have a bed.

356
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,600
- No.

357
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,420
- You're a bedless man.

358
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,260
- Mm-hmm.

359
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,100
- Yeah, what's that like?

360
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,760
- Dude, it's been crazy.

361
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,000
- It's crazy, it's insane.

362
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,840
- It's like I moved--

363
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,680
- It's so hard to fall onto a mattress on the ground.

364
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,520
- Yeah.

365
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,460
- When you are really tired from a long day's work.

366
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,580
- 'Cause it's a bigger fall. - I love falling onto my bed.

367
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,420
- It's a what?

368
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,800
- It's a, you know, it's not like--

369
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,040
- Yeah, you gotta have a comfy mattress.

370
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,640
- Yeah, you go down, like if you go all the way down.

371
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,680
- Did either of you do that mattress scam?

372
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,520
- No.

373
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,640
- The purple mattress thing?

374
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,480
- What is it?

375
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,800
- You could, it is a, anybody can do this, I think.

376
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,040
- Yeah, there's someone like Chloe.

377
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,800
- A million people in New York did it.

378
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,760
You just order a purple mattress,

379
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,360
or maybe it doesn't work anymore 'cause,

380
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,720
but when like lockdown was real serious,

381
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,840
they wouldn't take returns on mattresses.

382
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,560
- 'Cause it would cost more money for them

383
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,400
to get the mattress back.

384
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,840
- And then clean it and everything.

385
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,840
- So you would, so you--

386
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,680
- You say it doesn't fold out correct.

387
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,120
- I think I know where this is going.

388
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,680
- So you just order it and then you say--

389
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,160
- You buy the mattress, you kill the delivery man.

390
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,520
(laughing)

391
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
- And then it's like, good luck trying to bring this back,

392
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,960
you fucking asshole. - Exactly, yeah.

393
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,080
- But yeah, you would just order it

394
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,520
and then you would say like, it's too weird.

395
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,360
- Yeah. - And then they would--

396
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,440
- It didn't fold correctly. - It's like a $2,000 mattress.

397
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,760
- I mean, that's a scam, that's not just mattresses,

398
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,400
that's a lot of-- - Nope, that's a lot of stuff.

399
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,240
- Well, but mattress-- - Frequently, yeah.

400
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
- It has to be something where they won't take returns.

401
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,120
Here's a crazy fact, maybe it's why, they know, Purple Mattress, big Mormon company, owned

402
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
by the Mormons.

403
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,440
Those stupid idiots.

404
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,040
Those stupid freaks.

405
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
I love Mormons actually.

406
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,960
You can do that on Amazon too though.

407
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,960
Really?

408
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,960
You get free shit?

409
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,240
Yeah, so you can get free shit, you can say it's stolen, but also you can also just like

410
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,640
if it's a thing that you only need to like, like if it's not something you need permanently,

411
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,680
it's just something you, like say you order like, this is a dumb example, like scissors

412
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
or something.

413
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Oh that's so fucking stupid dude.

414
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,380
that's a use in return of all. Oh, you idiot, why would you say that

415
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,060
returning eight dollars scissors, not scissors? Obviously, but you know what I

416
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:53,580
mean you can just return. You can open stuff and return it to it's a scam

417
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:57,860
ordering scissors and using them to cut one thing. Yeah, you're only going to

418
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,100
need them one time right.

419
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,860
That's what else you need them for sharp. Yeah, they had the the sharp it

420
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:08,700
was facing the wrong way. They sharp the wrong side of the so yeah, you could

421
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,660
order a full set of silverware, eat a bunch of meals and then return them.

422
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,540
That's a really good idea. It's a scam, but then what about the next time you

423
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:19,000
need to eat? Well, you do it again or you can just return a year's worth of

424
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,900
food. That's the best part about the scam is they don't get mad at you

425
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,940
because they still get the stuff back. It's true and you can do it all the

426
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,260
food. Leave all the food on it. Well, yeah, I mean it's not your job. I don't

427
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,940
want to clean. Well, that's you. You order dishes and then you get them all

428
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,660
dirty, but I don't want to do the damn dishes. So then you return them.

429
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,860
exactly. It's really smart or you can order food on Amazon like groceries

430
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,280
right and then, but then you eat you listen, you eat all that you eat all the

431
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,620
groceries. Then you go to another grocery store,

432
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,260
you buy the same groceries and you say you're returning those great and you

433
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:54,060
just little. They know it's completely different. Groceries are doing that

434
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:59,440
forever. Exactly yeah, and then you and then you're basic, you're saving a lot

435
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,520
of money. Every time thirty dollars, depending on yeah, well, no, because you

436
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:07,500
So if you buy the groceries expensive from Amazon and then you buy them cheap

437
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,380
from somewhere else, you return them, you make that's called a profit.

438
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,900
Exactly, it's a profit deal. That's how businesses are run. Yeah, profit and we

439
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,740
have a business. We need to start getting into drop shipping or something.

440
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:22,860
Yeah, while we have a space or maybe like scams or maybe we or maybe robbery.

441
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,020
Yeah, we should rob something or somebody and then we plan it all here.

442
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,500
- Yeah.

443
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,840
- Oh, 'cause then we can buy a whiteboard to plan it?

444
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,280
- Listen, it's subterranean.

445
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,660
This could be a crime den.

446
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,320
- This could be a really good crime den.

447
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,560
- I can't wait.

448
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,400
- Yeah.

449
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,220
- Let's soap start--

450
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,480
- We need to hire a kingpin.

451
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,320
- We're gonna need--

452
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,700
- Because let's be honest, I mean--

453
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,540
- None of us have--

454
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,560
- We're all criminals, but none of us have the build

455
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,280
that's required for a kingpin. - We have kingpin attributes.

456
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,120
I'm bald.

457
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:50,960
- Yeah.

458
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,140
- You're square.

459
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,320
I'm clever. - Square?

460
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,720
- You're just boxy.

461
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,540
- That's true.

462
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:56,980
- But we need to double your width.

463
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,820
- Exactly, yeah.

464
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,820
- If I got any wider with my shoulders and my belly.

465
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,820
- You see, that's why we need--

466
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,740
- I'm all torso, baby.

467
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,580
I'm built like a widow.

468
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,500
- That's why we need to get some cloning pods

469
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,180
or genetic modification stuff,

470
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,660
'cause if we combined all three of us--

471
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,860
- Oh, I should get into synthol.

472
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,100
- The combined width of all of us

473
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,100
would definitely be wide enough for a kingpin.

474
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,060
- I should get into synthol injections.

475
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,460
- Oh, yeah, that'd be good.

476
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,620
- Do you get my arms huge?

477
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,460
- Yeah.

478
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,740
- You could be the muscle.

479
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,460
- Uh-huh, yeah.

480
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,940
- You can be the muscle we call you the saline.

481
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,440
- I'm the muscle but like I'm, no I'm not working out.

482
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,420
- That's the funniest thing about the Synthol thing

483
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,500
is like you don't get any strength from it.

484
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
- Yeah, it's so funny.

485
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:38,020
- It looks so strong and then, or not even,

486
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
you just look like a mutant.

487
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,860
- You look like you were in the microwave,

488
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:44,180
like you look like a hot dog in the microwave.

489
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:47,020
- Yeah, it looks, yeah the weird bubbles and stuff.

490
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,220
Yeah, it's cool.

491
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,660
- But you know, that's what I should do.

492
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,620
I should get into Synthol,

493
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,420
I'll get some BK Bold shit going with me.

494
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:58,580
- If you run at someone with giant balls like that,

495
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,480
they're gonna cower immediately.

496
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,320
- You could do that.

497
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,220
I think I might get a beak.

498
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,060
- A beak?

499
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,880
- Yeah.

500
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:09,440
- 'Cause I think that might be really scary.

501
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,940
- You should get like a pelican beak.

502
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,780
- Yeah.

503
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,600
- It has a pocket.

504
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,440
- Really?

505
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,140
I was thinking maybe like a toucan beak.

506
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,340
- Oh, that would be so beautiful on you.

507
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,180
- That'd be really beautiful.

508
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,780
- Okay, well I don't really want it to be beautiful.

509
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,540
I'm kind of more looking to be intimidating.

510
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,460
you would need the other bird of paradise that you need like a plume okay I don't

511
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:30,580
want a plume because I'm not trying to be beautiful I'm trying to be scared so you

512
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:34,620
want to look like a like a car okay so what's a scary maybe a chicken's beak

513
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,900
could be possible speak no the area's thing about a condor is the fact that

514
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,060
they're like the wing that they're bald yeah maybe I'll get no beak and I'll

515
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:47,740
just get wings wings and black wings how do you fight with wings look at Sephiroth

516
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,980
my feet maybe I could kick oh we're gonna need claws on your feet and I could just

517
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,340
get like that. You know what we should do? You know what we should all do?

518
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,380
That's true. But he has arms. The sword is the scary part. I wouldn't have arms. I would be

519
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,640
turning my arms into wings. Here's what we do, okay? We all get an

520
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,860
extra... we all get an extra...

521
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:16,860
The two winged angel. They call him the two winged angel. He's the scariest villain.

522
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,100
(laughter)

523
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,000
- They call him the one haloed angel.

524
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,300
(laughter)

525
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,460
- That's the scariest part about him.

526
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,220
- I think the simplest way, the simplest body mod

527
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,580
we could do to make us all seem scarier

528
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,980
is get an extra toe right here like a dog.

529
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,820
- That could be brilliant.

530
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,660
- An extra toe halfway up our calves.

531
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,380
- I have an even simpler idea.

532
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,660
We could just get our eyebrows slanted so we look angry.

533
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,500
- Yeah.

534
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,340
- Oh that's good.

535
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,160
- Like henchmen.

536
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,700
- I got pretty good eyebrows for that already.

537
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,140
- I think that, no but it's not.

538
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,980
- That sucked.

539
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,180
- You have made-- - Might make a perfect M.

540
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,260
- That was a really--

541
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,100
- That, are you--

542
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,500
- No, that doesn't make you look angry.

543
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,400
What are you talking about? - M stands for mad.

544
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,060
- You look like a baby. - Oh, okay.

545
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,660
But you're not like,

546
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,500
this is not anything.

547
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,660
- That's a baby pooping diaper face.

548
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,420
- You do look like you're shitting yourself.

549
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:06,580
You look like you're doing like the,

550
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,940
no.

551
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,380
You do look like, just with the face,

552
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,540
you look like you're pretending to be an old Mexican guy.

553
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,140
(laughing)

554
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,260
- Chingate puto.

555
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,260
Yeah, exactly.

556
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:22,260
No, yeah, but I'm saying we need our eyebrows need to be rotated at a 45 degree angle.

557
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,580
They need to be slanted down.

558
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,860
No, that's your, you're raising them up, you're slanting them the wrong way.

559
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,860
Yeah, like that.

560
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,420
Exactly, like that but more.

561
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,820
That's not bad.

562
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,820
That's getting there.

563
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
Yeah.

564
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,940
Now imagine how scary if you saw that running at you.

565
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,940
Wait, wait, wait.

566
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,940
Out of a crime den.

567
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,940
Cherry on top, cherry on top.

568
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,940
Oh.

569
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,940
Oh, you know what we could all get is a rattler.

570
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,940
Oh shit.

571
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:48,540
Would we need to get a tail installed or what would we put the rattler on?

572
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,540
These are our penises.

573
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,540
Yeah.

574
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,540
Oh true.

575
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
Yeah.

576
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
It's like a little extra length and it's ribbed.

577
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Yeah.

578
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
Oh for my pleasure.

579
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,340
And we gotta start, I'm telling you now, strongest thing we could do is start hissing.

580
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,540
You sound like a tornado siren.

581
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:09,460
Yeah, I know.

582
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,380
- Tornado siren.

583
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,900
- Yeah, I know, I'm adding scarier things to it.

584
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,740
- We could get a--

585
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,460
- What's scarier than being in a tornado?

586
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,540
- This, boom!

587
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,780
(yells)

588
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,660
Also, century gun.

589
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,700
- Yeah, definitely.

590
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
- Century gun?

591
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,540
- Century.

592
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,360
- Century egg.

593
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,200
- Century egg gun.

594
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
- Century gun.

595
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
- Century egg gun.

596
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,820
Century eggs are probably pretty hard,

597
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,300
it would hurt if it shot out of a gun.

598
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,140
- Yeah, it's probably--

599
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:31,960
- And they smell.

600
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,800
- Really hard.

601
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:33,640
- Yeah. - They smell good.

602
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,460
- They probably smell--

603
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,300
- They don't smell good.

604
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,580
- Those don't actually take 100 years, do they?

605
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,420
- No. - Yes, they do.

606
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,260
- They don't. - They don't.

607
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,260
I think I take like a couple months

608
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,380
100 months it's called the century egg so yeah, but it's cuz it doesn't say I know I

609
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,820
I can tell you that it doesn't take a hundred years because I

610
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:55,740
Googled literally probably like 20 times does a century egg take a hundred years because I forget every time well

611
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:02,500
Then that means I can sue you can't sue China. Yes. I would love this is how we take them down

612
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,040
Finally you look badass right now. Yeah, do we all look we all look like some badass Don's

613
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,100
Why are you not letting Cameron use this chair right now? No, you can take it

614
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,560
Why are you letting me yelled at me when I tried to sit in?

615
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:13,940
Oh, yeah

616
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,720
This chairs and he yelled at me when I tried to sit in either of them

617
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,720
No, I yelled at you and tried to sit in this one

618
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:24,620
The only time that you should look at your ass to see if you have two chairs is just make sure that you have two

619
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,180
So your neighbor can have one for his ass and guess he yelled at me before

620
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:33,460
in this chair too because it squeaks. You're allowed to literally can't sit in

621
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,080
any chair at all. Whenever you want.

622
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,280
It's not what you said before. You're putting on airs because we're recording

623
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,700
and you don't want, you don't want the fight to be air, but I'm, I'm, I'm

624
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,760
making it public. You better fuck. No, everyone, everyone harassed Patrick about

625
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,580
this. No.

626
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:53,460
Take him down. Don't take him. Once and for all. You need to be taken down a

627
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:58,020
peg. You need to be taken down one. I can't move this chair. I can't move this

628
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:04,080
hair up or down at all. Look, it doesn't go up anymore. When I had to move it--

629
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,760
You will never fix that.

630
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
I will.

631
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,680
You will never in a million years fix that.

632
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,920
I will.

633
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,920
You will not.

634
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,680
Because I mean, I'm going to make money if I fix it.

635
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,680
What?

636
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
What?

637
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Because then I can flip it.

638
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,680
Is there money stuck in there?

639
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,320
Fuck you, dude. Thank you for giving me this chair.

640
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,640
The guy who you scammed for a free chair?

641
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
I didn't scam him. He was giving it to me.

642
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,640
You scammed him. You're a scammer.

643
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,640
Thank you, Will.

644
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,480
- Thank you.

645
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,000
- Getting free shit from him.

646
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,100
- All right, so here's a list for today.

647
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,800
Top 10 questions to ask male top tenners.

648
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,720
So this is kind of a top 10 community.

649
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,680
- We're three male top tenners in a major way.

650
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,320
I would say we're the three most high profile.

651
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,000
- Probably the most male, yeah, the most high profile.

00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,740
I can't see from over here. What does that say? Does that say PM?

725
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,180
Oh, that's PFTT. Okay.

726
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:30,140
You gotta move the laptop closer to me.

727
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,860
Okay. This is why we need a super extra large 50-inch TV.

728
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,180
If you have a 70-inch TV...

729
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,700
Then, first of all, congratulations. Second of all, can we have it?

730
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,660
It's ours now.

731
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,220
Question.

732
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:45,820
You don't ask if we can have it. It's ours now.

733
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,540
No, you gotta negotiate. See, this is a classic Omega Dog mistake that you're making right now.

734
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:53,820
you got to negotiate and then you tricked him into buying something out

735
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:58,220
of duct tape, maybe and then like a wallet trading it yeah duct tape

736
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:01,740
wallet. That's a that we need to go to tape wall tape wallets with the spit

737
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:06,540
fire logo on yes, so bad. It'll be sick number two question. Are you sexist?

738
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:11,340
Yes, here's the time. I would say definitely not and I'm honestly proud

739
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,160
of being socially acceptable to everyone, whether they're lgbtq or

740
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,900
anything like that. I don't judge unless you are either a hate sloths be have

741
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,520
murdered people see are a certain person called called Donald Trump D R

742
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,080
rapist or E are sexist or F are gay

743
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,720
the F stand for

744
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:35,520
never mind

745
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,320
no and I don't think anyone here really is Feminazis are quick to call men

746
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,760
sexist for the dumbest reasons. That's facts kind of I like talking to girls a

747
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,600
lot more than boys in some cases. So if that counts then yeah, did you did you

748
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:53,820
see the video where it's like it's like a hundred women with their tits out in

749
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,780
Paris yeah and they're sitting they have the Ukraine flag painted and it's like

750
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,340
stop the invasion of Ukraine once Mike's gone crazy keep someone has a crazy Mike

751
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:08,380
how's that mine probably Patrick's I was stuck under the chair I mean sorry

752
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:14,340
probably Omega dogs but the video is so funny cuz they're like they have on

753
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:19,580
their on their tits it's written like it's like a feminist against like Putin

754
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:26,180
I think it's so cool that they're like that's good yeah he's gonna be like

755
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:33,260
showing their tits in Paris. I will have to go see the women in Paris and we will

756
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,540
have a long talk with them. I will I will have to see them. I will have to see them in person.

757
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,260
I will have to I will do I need to understand their points. I will have to walk up and down

758
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,460
little rose and look at all of their boobs to make me finally decide no more war.

759
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:51,500
Women really think that boobs are gonna work against Putin. That's happened before.

760
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Remember there's that picture of some girl. Yeah the white lady. Who's like shows her tits to Putin.

761
00:37:55,500 --> 00:38:01,780
She's like frowns up. Oh that's because to Putin. I thought you meant the lady at the

762
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,340
fucking Chazz or whatever that like sat down with her damn pussy out at the police.

763
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:10,180
Her snatch. Yeah. Well it's because Putin has been known on occasion

764
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,740
on several occasions to be gay with Donald Trump.

765
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,700
- No. - And a gay guy who sees

766
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,180
boobs will become enraged.

767
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,460
- That's true.

768
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,580
That's a, actually, they're--

769
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,420
- It's like a thorn in a giant's foot.

770
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,660
They become, they chimp out.

771
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,500
- I didn't even think about that.

772
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,300
- They go crazy. - When a gay man sees

773
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,660
a boob in person, there's like a foam--

774
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,340
- That's what he's thinking. - Coming out of their ears.

775
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,820
They're whistling like a train.

776
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:33,900
- They say, "Why you little," like Homer Simpson.

777
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,300
- Yeah. - Chase the women around.

778
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,420
- Yeah, so that's what they're trying to get him

779
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,860
so angry that he kills himself.

780
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,260
yeah, because he's watching that video and the guy goes to his head loads like

781
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,500
scanners yeah, that would be the best like like somebody committing suicide,

782
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:54,160
because they're so angry is so funny. It's getting so mad yeah that they just

783
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,980
jump out the window. It's happened not even yeah. They love the way that's

784
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:02,000
not just like getting so mad and just just charges just smashing out the

785
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,940
window. I do want to jump out of a window. It would be sick. It'd be so I

786
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,500
- he was like a parachute you know it would be really disappointing I'm gonna

787
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,600
jump out of the window and the glass shatters in a way that it kills you

788
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,620
before you true oh yeah I met a guy who jumped out of a window and I he was like

789
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:25,920
on crutches did he live he lived yeah I wanted to ask him so bad if it was fun

790
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,060
but I feel like that was like yeah I didn't want to ask that's not hey it was

791
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,500
he sensitive I think it was a sensitive subject jumped out of the fucking window

792
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,300
- Yeah, nobody pushed him out of the window.

793
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,380
He did it on purpose.

794
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,220
That's, what an idiot.

795
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,040
- That's true, yeah.

796
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:39,880
- What am I, what's he doing?

797
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,180
- He didn't win an idiot, he survived.

798
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,180
- Oh, he's a god.

799
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,020
- There was a--

800
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,280
- Probably had a great time, too.

801
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,120
- There's like a--

802
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:45,960
- Not that you would know.

803
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,900
- It's like a tower of terror.

804
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,540
- I guess he's all sensitive about it.

805
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,740
- Well, what if I had asked him and he said no?

806
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,020
That would be really, like I wouldn't want to--

807
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:52,860
- Yeah, you don't want to do that.

808
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,680
- That would be more of a bummer.

809
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,300
- Yeah, that's secret knowledge.

810
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,140
That's not for us.

811
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:59,200
see that would be if you ask somebody if you ask them that instead of getting

812
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:00,680
mad, you're just like no

813
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,360
that's like that would break my heart. People they say that like if you like a

814
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,580
third degree burn actually feels like really good or something they say yeah

815
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:13,640
says that like if you if you burn all over your body, it feels really good.

816
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,900
The heat miser said that

817
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,800
it burns off all your

818
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,680
the heat miser said that

819
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,660
heat miser came into my elementary school. The presentation

820
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:30,260
fire safety. It was the devil, the decree, the degrees of burn is how good

821
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:30,840
they feel.

822
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,780
If you feel it, if you go, if you're trying to run away from a fire and you

823
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:37,720
hold your hand to the door and it's hot, that means it's a fun room. Now that I

824
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:42,040
think about it, that probably definitely is a little kid myth. Yeah, I just

825
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:46,900
know what a I've never heard first degree. First degree is the worst first

826
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,680
degree. Second is the best second yeah and there is the one with the treasure

827
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,420
chest. Yep, yep, absolutely yep.

847
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,800

848
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,600
races. I wish someone forced me to play piano and I was a kid. I got forced to

851
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,880
that somebody could have forced you to play piano as a kid forced me to play

852
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,680
piano. I feel like there's no way I tried to get me to play hockey too and I

875
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:43,340
you're you you're a fucking idiot don't have an imaginative mind number four do

876
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:48,100
you play video games no yeah yes Sam a bit of a video game player definitely

877
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:53,380
eight games now Omega games now Omega Omega you don't know what it's like to

878
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:57,540
fail your enemy in battle that's why the one of the skills of an alpha is putting

879
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:00,300
yourself in the shoes of others and understanding what it's like to lead the

880
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:05,880
pack yeah so when I play for example an RTS like Starcraft yep I become the

881
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,200
leader of the zerg and I know what's right for my people.

882
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,200
That's what makes me an alpha.

883
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,200
You play Starcraft and you're like, "I don't understand.

884
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:13,720
I'm this little guy in this unit.

885
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:14,720
I can't."

886
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,720
Yeah, I'm that little grunt who dies instantly.

887
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:16,720
Yeah, that's me.

888
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,800
It's like, no, you're supposed to be...

889
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,680
When I play Animal Crossing, I become a deer with a fancy suit on.

890
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,000
I just look at all the zergs dying and stuff and I just get sad because they have families

891
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,000
too.

892
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Omega.

893
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,560
Omega, dog.

894
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,040
Yeah, alphas are about commanding the pack, but they hate families.

895
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:37,880
we don't have anything to do with family. We would literally kill every family in America

896
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:43,400
instantly with one button. I hate families. The family unit, I think the family unit should

897
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,720
be a one by one cube that I compact them into in a machine. That's what the family unit

898
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:52,640
should be. A foot by a foot by a foot. I'm more interested in the family eunuch. That's

899
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,120
right. I'm going to be castrating every last one of them so they can't reproduce. No families

900
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,720
left. That's right. Fuck. And the girls. Yep. That you hate. I'm taking one cool guy from

901
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:05,000
from each family and I'm making the biggest pack the world has ever seen.

902
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,800
That's right and all the girls. I think we're doing female female castration,

903
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,920
which I'm pretty sure is when you put a cork up there.

904
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,400
She like a bottle of wine when they you get home in the family eunuch hasn't

905
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,720
taken the chicken out of the fridge to defrost.

906
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:21,820
It's his job. Yeah, my God, you got one job.

907
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,720
Take the other.

908
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,500
I did I yeah when I was in I was at the store the other day and I saw mom beat

909
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,820
the shit out of her eunuch.

910
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,220
That's fucked up.

911
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:30,620
Yeah.

912
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:30,920
Yeah,

913
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,300
she was like she was like saying a jaunty diddy right now remember we used to be

914
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:35,940
able to he's like

915
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:50,620
I wish I had a hunchback - oh yeah dude the hunchback I mean your church who

916
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:54,180
gets so clean every family should I'd use that hunchback like a lunch every

917
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,580
family should have a eunuch a hunchback a mutant and a slave yeah yeah that's

918
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:03,980
the real family unit yeah yeah that's right and they all live in the basement.

919
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:08,780
They party yeah they're having more fun than their owners definitely they

920
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:09,200
basically

921
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,580
all of them are slaves. They live like the Gorgons and small soldiers. Well

922
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,600
actually no the hunchback owes them a

923
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:23,960
life or death favor. He has a he has a he's a servant yeah. Oh and like a genie

924
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:25,800
or like a bound spirit. Yeah, okay.

925
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,920
does your does your hunchback be reanimating people? No, he's not unless

926
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,700
you're a man. I just family okay, no yeah, the hunchback doesn't do that on on

927
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,800
his own mad. So that's something he does. My side is American family. Sorry

928
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:41,560
yeah yeah

929
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:49,360
number five. Do you go to the gym? Hell no, the notes are my gym. Here's a

930
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,680
comment. No, these are perverted true facts. The gym is low key. Perverted is

931
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,820
- I'm gonna pervert it.

932
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,660
Here's a comment.

933
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,280
- There's nothing stopping someone

934
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,160
from smelling the machine after you use it.

935
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,340
- Me, that's my job.

936
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:05,600
- Your job is to smell the machines after people use them?

937
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,340
- Well, yeah, I get all the stench out

938
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,640
and then they can go in.

939
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,660
Like if a girl with a big ass does a bench press

940
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,800
and gets up off the bench.

941
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,640
- A bench press?

942
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,460
Oh, bench.

943
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:15,300
- Then I go and I smell the--

944
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,260
- You have to suck it all up.

945
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:17,700
- Yeah, I gotta suck up all the stench

946
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,360
so fucking Stanley doesn't smell it.

947
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,200
- Yeah, or--

948
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,540
- He's the gym smeller.

949
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,580
- Stanley Sniffer, the gym smeller, sucks.

950
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:28,160
I have a similar job, but instead of sucking up all the smell, they want me

951
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,640
to mask the smell, so I have to rub the smelliest part of my body all over the

952
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,060
machine after. Which is? When I'm done. My thing.

953
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:39,400
He's got patchouli on his thing. Yeah. I musk it up beforehand. I forgot your

954
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,540
thing has mushrooms growing off of it and stuff. Yeah. It's like, yeah, you

955
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,080
know, they say like... Your grandparents ever say you're growing potatoes behind

956
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,940
your ears? Yeah. Yeah. I got a... Growing potatoes behind my face. I got a

957
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,900
wood knot in my balls. You never heard that before? If you have dirt behind

958
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,740
ears. Old people say you're growing potatoes behind your ears. They're not,

959
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:01,140
they don't have very good eyes. Yeah, they can barely see anything.

960
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,820
And also they're from back in time when like

961
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:09,620
Jack and the Beanstalk was like real. Yeah, exactly. Jack and the Beanstalk was

962
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,860
like... They lived through this shit. My great-grandpa like hung out with them

963
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:16,900
actually. Yeah, apparently he was like way different. My grandpa would always talk about like

964
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:22,960
turning the TV on and seeing the giant falling from the beans. Yeah, I mean

965
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,500
here's a TV on the radio in the magic TV. Yeah, I mean the portal of the mirror

966
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,300
magic mirror. Yeah, I mean his window. He lived there. They used to call it. I mean

967
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,660
it's called PTSD now where they used to call it being shock. Yeah, my grandpa was

968
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:42,660
actually a prisoner of jar. He was stuck in one of the the Giants jars. Damn, are

969
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,600
Are you serious? Yeah, yeah, he's from crazy. That's crazy. I would love to sit

00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,260
on it. He would bang on the jar.

971
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:54,400
And people people make jokes now, but like if you do, if you live through it,

972
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:57,960
if you say fee five foe, from near an old person, some of them still just get

00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,620
flashbacks. Ptsd sit there and just go like yeah, no, it's really it's scary

974
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:07,720
because it's really yeah, yeah, we tried to bring my grandpa to the Redwoods,

975
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,300
the great redwoods. He's trying to convulse. He thought they were bean

976
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,140
- Beanstalks.

977
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:11,960
- Yeah.

978
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:12,800
- Yeah, it was like,

979
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,940
- It's good. - Not again, not again.

980
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,980
- It's like, you know, I mean,

981
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,380
it's good they got rid of beanstalks

982
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,260
that go to Giants' castles.

983
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:20,380
- Definitely. - But like,

984
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,700
- The thing is, and now people wanna be like,

985
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:23,140
"Oh, well if we don't have the beanstalks,

986
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,680
"we're being isolationists."

987
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,060
- I mean, yeah, it is kind of,

988
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,140
- There's a clear-- - The shit that's going on

989
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,880
with Giants right now is kind of our country's fault,

990
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:30,720
I feel like.

991
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,900
- Oh, absolutely. - I mean, I don't really

992
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:32,740
wanna get into it, honestly.

993
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:34,580
- I mean, yeah, but you have to--

994
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,420
- I don't wanna alienate anybody who's listening.

995
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,760
people know I'm like a libertarian.

996
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,380
So I just don't think that we should be involved

997
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,820
with giants, but whatever.

998
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,660

999
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,340
- Yeah, and I'm also,

1000
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,500

1002
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:54,020
- Well yeah, that's my whole problem is I'm a Rastafarian.

1003
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,280
I try to promote one love.

1004
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,200
- People know I'm like a cafeteria,

1005
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,620
so I only eat cafeteria food.

1006
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:00,460
- Food from a cafeteria.

1007
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:01,300
- Yeah.

1008
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,560
- I'm a cafeteria and my diet is all appetizer samplers

1009
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,700
and it's just like--

1010
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,500
yeah, just like tiny pieces of orange chicken. Yeah, my every every

1011
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:15,120
cafeteria and know the excitement when you wake up and you see it's pizza day.

1012
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:19,120
Yeah, my diet is tiny piece of cafeteria, orange chicken and then doing

1013
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,640
the backwards man back over to there and pretending to be another guy and

1014
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,660

00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,020
my head where I drew a mouth. Oh dude, but it doesn't taste very good in the

1016
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,620
back of my head. The day

1017
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:38,600

1018
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:43,380

1021
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:58,420
to like schedule your year where you convert to every religion in time to

1022
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:01,820
have every high holiday Ali I don't I think you can just do that I don't think

1023
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:05,780
you need to schedule anything. I don't I think that no, I think I guess you kind of

1024
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,340
have to soft seed it. You have to be like when the holidays coming you're like I

1025
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,360
don't know guys. I feel like

1026
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:16,220
I feel like I might be becoming a Muslim right now. I just don't I don't know. I've

1027
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:18,860
just been fucking with the Quran. I feel like you can kind of only do that for one

1028
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:22,780
year before they catch on. One year of you just being like an indecisive guy, but

1029
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:26,700
then like also every Christmas you just go back to Christianity. You're like I

1030
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,500

1031
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:32,920
just going to do them all that could work because then I mean you have that you

have you're like well I like I have proof I tried them all I like them all

1033
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:43,200

1034
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:49,480
religion that takes off every religious holiday yeah that is a good idea I mean

1035
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,960

It's scared the fuck out of the like the pizza place near my

1128
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:36,560
my house growing up where we go like a little dog beats. There was like it yeah.

1129
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,260
It was like an old Italian guy who like who ran it or whatever and whenever he

1130
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,860
saw me he would do the Donald Duck voice. We was like not good at it, so it just

1131
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:47,660
be like hello Cameron. It just feel like we'd like go in and he'd see me and

1132
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:48,180
expect

1133
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:53,580
like I'm right. It would just be him just like it like making a scary hissing

1134
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,000
noise.

1135
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I'll be like

1136
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,600
yeah, that's a scary voice. If you don't have it down, you know well,

1137
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:06,600
Favorite band? Shinedown. I'm a guy. I'm a male user.

1138
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,600
"All you'll ever be is a faded memory of a boy"

1139
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:10,600
Shinedown, sick.

1140
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:14,600
"I just saw Haley's come as she went"

1141
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,600
You know that Shinedown song from...

1142
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:17,600
I saw them live.

1143
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,600
Really?

1144
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,600
2013.

1145
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,600
Then you heard Bully?

1146
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,600
Of course, dude.

1147
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:22,600
Dude, that song is...

1148
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:26,600
They had a guy open for them who just had a 50-piece drum set.

1149
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,600
And he was just...

1150
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,600
Doing one man...

1151
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
Doing a white man group.

1152
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:36,780
that song "Bully" was in one of the NHL, I think it was NHL 12, I think, NHL 13, one of

1153
00:58:36,780 --> 00:58:42,560
them, and it's so funny to have like an anti-bullying song in a fucking game

1154
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,080
where like one of the, like you just, like one of the options is fighting another

1155
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,560
player. What are people saying their favorite band is? Well my username is

1156
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:58,600
Bon Jovi 117, so do you expect me to say Maroon 5, Bon Jovi 17? Oh yo, we got to go

1157
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:04,080
to the Bon Jovi rest stop. I'm down. You know that in New Jersey there's

1158
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:10,360
like a rest stop that is Bon Jovi like it's a tribute to Bon Jovi. It's named

1159
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:16,600
after Bon Jovi and is Bon Jovi themed. That's sick dude. New Jersey is like...

1160
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,120
New Jersey sucks. New Jersey is one of the sickest places on earth. You are

1161
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:27,360
from the worst state in the Union. What? New Hampshire? Yeah. It's not the worst. It is

1162
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:30,600
the worst state in the union. You're wrong I'm sorry. I'm right you don't even have

1163
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,560
like cool western stuff like we had the old man of the mountain.

1164
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,760
No New Hampshire is not. Old man of the mountain. I've been to more states than any of you

1165
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:42,400
guys I've trekked around this entire country. It doesn't matter. Yeah but New Jersey's sick

1166
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,680
because it's just stupid they got medieval times they have the Bon Jovi

1167
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:51,040
