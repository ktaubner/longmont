00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,800
I'm gonna suck Caleb's Jolly Rancher.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,500
I'm thinking about sucking on Caleb's Jolly Rancher.

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,100
Okay, you guys talk while I finish my Jolly Rancher, because according to Cameron, I'm the most disgusting fucking piece of shit who's ever lived.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,100
That's some true shit.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,100
Yeah, Caleb's got a disgusting blue thing in his mouth and it's not...

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,100
A blue penis.

12
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,100
A blue penis this time.

13
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,100
What is it then?

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,100
A Jolly Rancher we just talked...

15
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,100
No it's not.

16
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,100
What is it then?

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,100
It's a chocolate egg.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,100
It's my tongue.

19
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,100
It's a blue chocolate egg.

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,100
Yeah.

21
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,100
That's Hungry Hamster combo number four.

22
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,100
Hungry Hamster combo number four.

23
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,100
From the hotel.

24
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,100
From the Hungry Hamster hotel.

25
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,100
The Hungry Hamster hotel is one of the best hotels in the nation.

26
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,100
You can also, they have rates by the hour.

27
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,100
Yeah.

28
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,680
Yes, you can go in there you have sex in the hungry hamster hotel with a process ex hamster style. Yeah

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,140
Which is when you're both?

30
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,140
Hamster style. Yeah. Yeah

31
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,300
You go in it in and out. Yeah, can I get this shit hamster style?

32
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:12,700
And they go absolutely and they lead you into a back room and they fuck your ass

33
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:21,980
Hungry well feeding feeding you a burger. Yeah, what is the plot of the hungry hamster? We don't know yet. It's not out

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,420
It's not out. The trailer just dropped a few days ago. You should watch the trailer.

35
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:27,340
If you had to guess from the trailer.

36
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,700
Probably about the hungry hamster.

37
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,460
I know his enemy is in it.

38
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,500
What's his enemy?

39
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,460
The candy hamster.

40
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,980
The candy hamster?

41
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,220
Yeah.

42
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,980
Why? What?

43
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,980
I mean, just like, is there other animals too?

44
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,420
The snail with the tail.

45
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,380
Snail with the tail is in it.

46
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,580
Michael the crawler.

47
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,540
Michael the crawler.

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,380
I heard Michael the crawler is going to make a cameo.

49
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,820
The crapping crocodile.

50
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:57,340
That's in the adult remake. They remade it for adults.

51
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,740
Yeah, you know I think they should do that with more movies where they put out

52
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,220
one for the kids, one for the parents. They should have done that with the live action Scooby-Doo.

53
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:11,940
And we can see Velma's beautiful nipples when she turns into Shaggy. What? Yeah.

54
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,900
She turns into Shaggy? Remember when they body switch and then Shaggy's like

55
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:23,760
feeling Velma's tits with his hands. No. You don't remember that? No. They put

56
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,600
Shaggy's stoner weed brain into Velma's hot girl body and he's... They created the

57
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,680
ultimate organism. Yeah. The highest life form. The highest level life form. He starts

58
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,560
grabbing his pussy and his boobies and he goes like, "I like this. Yeah, this is my

59
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:46,520
favorite thing. That's what Shaggy sounds like. He's like yeah. That's not what Shaggy sounds like.

60
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Shaggy sounds a little something like this. Hey guys I'm Shaggy. I'm Norval. Imagine I'm doing

61
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,760
the voice. Man I don't want to go to the airport. Don't go to the airport. Yeah this is our last,

62
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,360
this is this will be our last episode hopefully ever recorded in the city of Los Angeles.

63
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:10,280
Yeah. Pretty excited. Yeah. Pretty cool. Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex. What is

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,280
that from? It's from California Love. Oh. That's why I've been saying it. California Girls by...

65
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,960
By the Beaching Boys. By Katy Perry. By the Beaching Boys. Okay, my finish... I haven't

66
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,880
finished it. It's actually stuck in my teeth. I'm pretty close to finishing my Jolly Rancher,

67
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,360
so then the podcast will start. Yeah. Yeah. We haven't started yet. No, we've just been

68
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,440
laying out our pitch for The Hungry Hamster. Yeah, so basically The Hungry Hamster

69
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:40,280
finds out that the candy hamster has stolen his family. The Hungry Hamster sounds like a movie

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,560
like when you would go to Woody Allen's IMDb page and just scroll all the way to the bottom,

71
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,960
one of those ones from the 60s that just nobody's seen. Yeah. You know, The Hungry Hamster. Well,

72
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:57,800
it's from 2020. Yeah, it's from 2020. Yeah, it's coming out next year. What the fuck? What? I

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,240
I thought it was a re-release. No. No? It's based on a book. I thought it was like

74
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,720
unfound or unfound. And then they made a game out of the book. Yeah. What was that

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,360
game called? The Hungry Hamster. And Nintendo DS. The Hungry Hamster and

76
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,800
Nintendo DS for Nintendo Wii. Yeah, they had a couple of games. They had

77
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,720
Hungry Hamster Ride Da Pony. Ride Da Pony, Hungry Hamster Off Da Wheel. Yeah.

78
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,080
They also made a spin-off for 3DS that was Candy Hamster. It was kind of like Shadow

79
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,680
the Hedgehog where you can play as Candy Hamster and be sort of the anti-hero type character.

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,720
It was the exact plot of Shadow the Hedgehog but with the Candy Hamster.

81
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,680
It was more like a fan-made mod.

82
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,640
But it did get an official release.

83
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,600
Yeah, they did the mod and then they actually got the people who made the mod to come onto

84
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,120
of the official hungry hamster team and those people actually made hungry

85
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,880
hamster guardians yeah yeah the MOBA yeah the League of Legends style yeah

86
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,120
hamster game where you can place all the different characters every hamster in

87
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,240
the game yeah it's hamsters versus crocodiles yeah and versus crocodiles

88
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,160
and snails yeah yeah yeah use your faction at the beginning yeah yeah

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
Hamsters are crocodiles and snails.

90
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
Yeah, yeah, and then there's play mode.

91
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,160
There's, yeah.

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,720
There's a, there's, you get to, there's the game, but then there's a bonus game section

93
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,720
where you can play.

94
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,720
Unlock different toys.

95
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Yeah.

96
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
Yeah, like.

97
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,720
Different hamster style toys.

98
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,680
Or, if you're playing as snail and crocodiles, there, you don't play, because you just.

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,680
Because snails and crocodiles.

100
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
You do, yeah, they don't work.

101
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Yeah, snails and crocodiles just do jobs.

102
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,680
They have work, work, work mode.

103
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,680
Exactly.

104
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,880
Yeah, you can unlock different pencils.

105
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:50,200
say that if you play crocodile mode it is actually harder because you're playing, I mean, you

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,320
don't have all of the other abilities.

107
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
That's true.

108
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Yeah.

109
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
So it's a more challenging experience.

110
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
You really do.

111
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,040
Crocodiles can only move in a straight line.

112
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Yeah.

113
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
Which makes it really hard on the MOBA.

114
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Yeah.

115
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,360
Because you can't ever turn, you just can walk on a straight line through the map.

116
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
Yeah.

117
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,600
really easy to be killed by the by the falling rocks that are in the center of

118
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:16,320
the stage. And the crocodile traps yeah that are everywhere. Yeah the

119
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,400
poison the crocodile poison. And crocodile dung. It's disguised to look

120
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,360
like a leg of chicken. Yeah. Which crocodiles love. Crocodiles adore chicken. It's

121
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,120
interesting because there aren't any real legs of chicken in the game they're all

122
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,720
poisoned so you would think the players would learn but since the crocodile can

123
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:34,640
only walk in a straight line if there is one in your path there's no possible way

124
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:38,260
to avoid it and you end up just eating it because the eat button is the same as

125
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,480
the walk button. Yeah well it's only played with one button it's a joystick

126
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:48,120
game. Yeah stop doing that Patrick. How did that sound? Just sounds like you quiet. Yeah.

127
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:55,580
It just is muffled. He has his microphone in his ass. Yeah. No. Yeah it's in his ass and he's

128
00:06:55,580 --> 00:07:00,080
sick. He's saying I don't know what just I just got so tired all of a sudden. Yeah

129
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,000
Come here. What? No. Come here. I'm not letting you do that. Letting me do what? I don't know.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,880
Come here. No. Come here. Go to him. Come here. Go to him. No. Dude, there's candy over here.

131
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:17,760

139
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,240
yourself that was hit the microphone there you know yeah I'm always like why

140
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,440
do the microphone so shitty why do they keep stopping working and it's because

141
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,320
Patrick tries to hit every microphone every time we record and it's kind of

142
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,240
his hobby you suck dude I'm glad you're leaving you hear that that was the noise

143
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,200
of all Patrick's teeth falling out. Yeah. Because he got so sad. Yeah. I just gave up on him.

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:31,280
Oh, the day that I was very hungover here, I don't know what happened. Like, I think

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,760
something was stuck in like, you know, I have the cracked teeth in the back. You got

146
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,400
the cracked teeth. I got the cracked teeth, but something was stuck in the back of my tooth

147
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,480
and I just like, it just hurt all day. Like, it felt like I was having like nerve pain.

148
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,880
No, it felt more like a migraine. I don't know. I was very hungover. I think you were having a migraine

149
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:00,000
And then I ate Cameron's salad. Yeah, I gave Patrick my salad salad. When's the last time you had a salad?

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,200
I used to get salads at work. That's true. So answer the question. So like a week ago

151
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,600
I don't eat salads. I almost never eat salads. Yeah, I eat I eat walgreens salad because I have that walgreens gift card

152
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,360
Oh, yeah, true

153
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,400
The thing is about making a salad is that you have to buy like 50 ingredients to make a good salad.

154
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,080
And then you have spent $50 for one salad and then you have to throw everything away.

155
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,640
I was at work, I probably said this on the pod before, but this guy ordered all the

156
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,880
protein additions to the salad, like the tofu, like the falafel and stuff. He added everything

157
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,440
to a Caesar salad and it ended up being $21.

158
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,400
God damn!

159
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:42,720
Wow.

160
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
A $21 salad, to me that's nothing.

161
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
That sounds delicious.

162
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,360
I spent more on a salad in my dream.

163
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,240
Yeah.

164
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,920
Yeah. And in my dream, I have no money.

165
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
Yeah. I'm famously poor in my dreams.

166
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,080
I famously only have $100, which is one of the poorest things you can be.

167
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
I mean, speaking from our perspective, at least.

168
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,120
Because we only have $90 on the Patreon right now.

169
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:01,280
Yeah.

170
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:06,960
Everybody get - everybody tell two friends to subscribe to the Patreon,

171
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,080
and we can get to $200 by midnight.

172
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,320
Yeah.

173
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
And we can finally buy - here's what we'll do.

174
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,680
We'll buy 16 tickets to The Hungry Hamster and we will raffle them off.

175
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,120
We won't buy out a whole theater.

176
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,160
Here, honestly, I'm not, okay, breaking it for a minute, we will make The Hungry Hamster.

177
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,240
I'm serious. We will make The Hungry Hamster, we'll make all the video games, we'll design

178
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,920
the lunchbox and produce it, we'll do like an AliExpress, or an Alibaba like order for all

179
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,920
that shit. We'll make merch for The Hungry Hamster and we will do a full-length movie.

180
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,240
What if we just make merch for The Hungry Hamster?

181
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
Yeah, I'm not going to make a Hungry Hamster movie. Because I mean, there's already one coming out in

182
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,360
2020. There's already a movie coming out.

183
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
But what if we beat them to the market?

184
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,280
No, no, we should make the merch.

185
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,320
Just the merch for the Hungry Hamster?

186
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,560
Yeah, we should just bootleg some Hungry Hamster merch.

187
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
Do you think we would make more money than on the movie?

188
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,840
Yes, absolutely.

189
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,960
Because I already have, I'm already casting this movie in my head.

190
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,760
Okay, who plays who?

191
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,520
They've already casted it in Hollywood.

192
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,600
Who plays the Hungry Hamster in Hollywood?

193
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,280
They haven't released that information yet.

194
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,960
Oh, well, then they haven't cast it.

195
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,640
No, they have. They've cast everyone else.

196
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,600
Lupita Nyong'o plays Hungry Hamster.

197
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,760
go play as Hungry Hamster in my version. No, no. That's terrible casting. Why is that terrible

198
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,600
casting? Because Hungry Hamster's a guy. So? It's a voice acting thing. No, girls don't

199
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,200
voice boys ever. Oh really? That's never happened. What about Barf Simpson? That's not a real

200
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,200
character. Barf Simpson? Yeah. What are you talking about? That's not on the show. Barf

201
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:35,160
Simpson. Who is that? That's the son. No, no, you're thinking of the son of the dad.

202
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,400
You're thinking of the son of the dad Simpson. Oh. The son of the dad Simpson. The son of

203
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,320
the dead. Yeah. I don't know. My personal fan theory is they're gonna get Tom

204
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:49,240
Holland's to voice the hungry hamster. Yeah. Why? Well, you know. He's Spider-Man. Yeah.

205
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,640
And you know those characters have a classic history with each other. He's popular right now. Yeah. I think they

206
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,880
would probably be better with like... Adam Driver. Adam Driver. Yeah. Or... I think

207
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,280
Adam Driver is playing the candy hamster. Yeah. You think so? I mean yeah.

208
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,320
He's Kylo Ren. Based on the trailer. He can... I mean also he's proven he can

209
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,920
can fulfill that kind of role in a movie. As a monster. A big ugly fucking dope.

210
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,960
You did that with Marriage Story. Yeah. Yeah the Marriage Story video game was really

211
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,720
good though. Yeah. That was really good. I liked, I really liked all the

212
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,580
quick time events. Yeah. That they put in there. Cheat code where you can see Adam

213
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,520
Driver's penis. Yeah. It was fun. They modeled it specifically for the cheat

214
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:38,680
code. Yeah. What are you doing? What's that face? I'm cracking my knuckles. Okay.

215
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:44,280
I think they should get Michael J Fox to voice the hungry hamster.

216
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,680
I think they should get Michael Scott to voice the hungry hamster. I think he'd be pretty funny.

217
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
Well, you know he's in the movie, right?

218
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
What?

219
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Yeah, he's live action.

220
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,680
But you can do...

221
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Oh, are they doing full CGI or full 3D animation or are they doing like a Who Framed Roger Rabbit style?

222
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,680
They're augmenting a real hamster with CGI facial features.

223
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Oh, like in the...

224
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
With cartoon eyes.

225
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Like Homeward Bound.

226
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,120
a big red kissy lips. Sullivan the frog is in it too but I don't know what they're doing

227
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,840
with Sullivan the frog. Yeah it might just be like a small role. Like a cameo just for

228
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:24,920
fan service? Yeah. Miranda Cosgrove is playing Sullivan the frog. Really? Yeah. I heard that

229
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:34,160
Michael the crawler doesn't have a voice. He speaks in spider-ese. That's how Michael the

230
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,440
crawler speaks he goes yeah he's kind of like that he's like he's like if hungry

231
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,120
hamster was a spider hmm which um which hungry hamster universe that which which

232
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:51,280
earth are they doing earth 3.0 earth 3.0 yeah gotcha so the cyborg atrons aren't

233
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:56,200
part of it okay yeah that was an earth 4.5 and what about hamster the girl is

234
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,840
she in it yeah she's the love interest on this one I think she's actually the

235
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,040
Susan. Oh, really? The mother love interest. Yeah. Mother love interest? Of Candy Hamster.

236
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,400
That's why he's so evil. Oh, because he wants to fuck his mom. Which is one of the most evil

237
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,960
things you can do for a hamster. I forgot about that plot in the comics. Yeah. Of the

238
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:16,560
Hungry Hamster comics. Yeah, I think Kevin Smith did a really good job with the Hungry Hamster

239
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,640
comics. Hamster comics 52 where you first see the Hungry Hamster. Yeah. Yeah, it's really good.

240
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:28,480
It blows your mind. It does blow your mind. You think, you never think of hamsters as all that

241
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,640
hungry I feel like. Absolutely. I see them as more, they're more concerned about

242
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:39,600
their wheel. Yeah, yeah. Really a revolutionary character. When I was a

243
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,840
kid I buried, I've talked about this, I feel like I buried a hamster that was

244
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:52,040
alive that I didn't realize was alive and then it died in the ground. I didn't

245
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,240
know that. That's pretty common I guess because hamsters have like, they will

246
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,880
like stiffen up sometimes but they're not actually dead. They're just pretending.

247
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,720
Yeah. So how did you find out the hamster was alive? You know I just kind of

248
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,880
guessed. So it could have been dead? But I'd like just gotten it. It was like I

249
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,880
guess like oh I think it was because their bodies don't like go stiff when

250
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,920
they die really. Not in the same way. This thing was like he was like stiff. Yeah.

251
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,040
And I guess he was like in shock. Oh, and I just put him in the kill.

252
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:36,960
Instantly. I would never do that to my hamsters. Yeah. Suffocate him with the earth. Mm-hmm. I kind of put the entire earth on him.

253
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:43,560
Yeah, kind of when you think about it. Kind of to drop the world. Yeah, I dropped the world on that bitch. Yeah, Kevin Rudolph style.

254
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:50,000
Yeah, I might drop the world if I change hands. Yeah, if I change hamsters. If I change hamsters. If I change hams.

255
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,120
If I change it, I wonder if hamsters are named after the ham

256
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,260
Yeah

257
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:03,400
They used to be the guys who would sell ham. Yeah, they called them hamsters and then they lost consciousness

258
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:10,240
They lost they lost their body. Yeah, they lost their bodies and became small little little little peanuts little penises

00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:51,220
You have three kids for Ferdpenis. This is a reality check. You have three kids and 20 hamsters

268
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,700
And you need to start providing for them. You got a whole series of hamster tubes in your house

269
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,700
And you're spending that shit on Fendoms?

270
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,740
Come on, man. You gotta buy hamster food, Ferdpenis. Playa, you fucking up. You gotta buy candy for your hamsters.

271
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:11,640
Mm-hmm. Hamsters love candy. Hamsters love eating dark chocolate. Yeah. Give them a bark-

272
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,720
Give them dark chocolate bark right now. Mm-hmm. Give them a hamster a butter finger and watch that shit gets stuck in its teeth

273
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,440
Yeah, now that's some funny shit. Do you guys brush your hamsters teeth? Never? I don't have I don't have I don't have a toothbrush

274
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,800
It's small enough. They don't make them. That's fair. You can use a regular toothbrush

275
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,360
You'll need the front of the you can use a regular toothbrush if your hamster is six feet tall

276
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,480
My hamster is pretty big not a big hamster. It wouldn't my hamster is like three feet tall

277
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,580
That's pretty big. I told you yeah, but still a regular toothbrush is to use a half-size toothbrush

278
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:51,720
They don't make even half size. I made it you made it from what is it to bark made out of dick and grass sticking grass

279
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,960
It's not a toothbrush. That's gonna make your that's gonna make your hamsters teeth even more. He's just gonna eat the grass

280
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,080
Yeah, that's why he likes it

281
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,840
Terrible terrible way to brush. Oh, he wouldn't he wouldn't let me brush his teeth if I used what what do you use a knife?

282
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,180
That's awful. No what I do you know what I do you listen

283
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:16,400
I don't brush his teeth, and so you just want his teeth to rot out, and he's gonna die like Patrick's gonna die

284
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,280
Yeah, I'm probably gonna die from some dental shit now that I think about it

285
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,660
You think you're gonna die from dental shit

286
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:25,920
I think that there's I'm gonna get an infection in one of my teeth

287
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,580
And it's gonna spread to my brain, and it's gonna brought my brain out well

288
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:35,440
In my eyes Patrick's brain is gonna suck his teeth inside. I'm gonna die of cancer

289
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,640
We had that too probably mouth cancer. I'll probably die of all

290
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,400
Everything everything at the same time probably I don't see why not

291
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,560
Yeah, that's a really good point. I don't really see why not either. I can't really you there's a 50% chance of anything

292
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:58,560
That's true. It's actually a 75% chance 75% chance of anything. There's actually a 100% chance of anything. Oh

293
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:06,480

303
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,080
That'd be pretty good. No, because I need to... no. Why don't we do a watch-along of...

304
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,440
When I went fishing the other day, I was like, "Yeah, you know, I could never watch the

305
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,640
Irishman. It's like three hours long." And they were like, "We just went fishing for three hours."

306
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,640
That's funny. Was Robert De Niro there?

307
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,960
The fishing joint? Yeah. That fishing joint?

308
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,400
Oh, did you? I sent you the...

309
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,200
Spike Lee Fishing Joint.

310
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,760
I sent you guys that place I found, right?

311
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,800
Yeah, what was it called?

312
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,000
The Poetry Studio.

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,800
That's sick.

314
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,840
Did you go there?

315
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,160
No.

316
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,640
Why not?

317
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
I went to the Supreme store today.

318
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,800
How was your solo campaign today in the name of Los Angeles?

319
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:47,200
It was... So I ran into somebody that I like a...

320
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,000
like somebody that I'm like mutuals with on Twitter but like

321
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,360
you ran into them?

322
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,280
they were um

323
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,840
crossing the street at um

324
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,560
I think it was like towards the tender greens

325
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,920
they're crossing the street there or

326
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,120
might have been closer might have been by united but

327
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,880
they're crossing the street they waved to me I waved back and then I was like

328
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
what the who the fuck was that and I turned around

329
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,400
and then they were waving again I went like I waved again and then I got a DM

330
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,360
from them they were like they were like oh yeah that was me I was like oh shit

331
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:30,360
okay I've never been noticed before who was it this is guy Reggie Reggie Fils-Aimé

332
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,040
Redman yeah from Wu-Tang Clan from Wu-Tang holy shit it was Wu-Tang Ted

333
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:40,840
Wu-Tang Ted oh my god but you didn't tell us that Wu-Tang Ted's been walking

334
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:47,380
around no walk around waving at people oh my god waving at motherfuckers but so

335
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,700
then from there I just kept skating down and then I think I think I got to the

336
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,840
Sunset Strip or whatever is that is the whole Sunset Strip is yeah is this whole

337
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,300
thing called Sunset Strip and not really Sunset Strip is like when when sunset

338
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,080
stops becoming just like a straight line uh-huh and it starts like that's where

339
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,560
the comedy store is and stuff oh I didn't get that far yeah that's like

340
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:14,600
just like four or five. I went to, I like skated by the big Guitar Center and like

341
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:18,280
I was skating and I accidentally skated through a little patch of glass and then

342
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,020
a very fat guy holding a guitar stared at me out the window of the Guitar Center.

343
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:30,920
Nice. And then I like... How could you tell he was fat? Yeah. His penis. Yeah.

344
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:36,200
Yeah it was a very, it was very foggy glass. There was only a space.

345
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
No, no, he was coming out of the store.

346
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
And then you could see his penis.

347
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Yeah, he was so fat that he took up every inch of the store.

348
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:49,200
And so you looked in and you were like, oh, they have like skin-tinted windows.

349
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,200
But then you saw a face.

350
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
And a penis.

351
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,200
A face and a penis right next to each other, coming off of this amorphous blob.

352
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,200
And you said, oh, it's just a very fat man.

353
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,200
And then you saw a guitar in his mouth.

354
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Yeah, Douglas Banila.

355
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Yeah, it was Douglas Banila who occupied.

356
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,460
They haven't been able to open the door to that guitar center for 20 years

357
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,460
because he's been stuck in there. You have to play the magic song. And he just keeps getting bigger and bigger.

358
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,520
Eddie Van Halen's guitar but it's a problem because Eddie Van Halen's guitar is in glass in the front of this door.

359
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:26,440
Exactly. They're selling his guitar. So I got towards the... so I skated past

360
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,040
the Guitar Center. I just kept going and like I just I had like the urge to just

361
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:34,160
ask people like hey where the fuck am I right now? Yeah. Because I was just in

362
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,560
West Hollywood I didn't know what the fuck to do and then I like realized I

363
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,920
was on like the intersection where Fairfax is and then I just went down

364
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,840
Fairfax Street and that is just the worst place on earth yeah yeah Fairfax

365
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,240
like there's like the the Hasidic part was nice but then like the hype beast

366
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:55,320
part is just like I hate them both yeah I'm being honest no I can't say what I

367
00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:02,200
was gonna say which is that you should nuke the Supreme Store yeah no the

368
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,680
the supreme store so it's all just yeah the whole thing that you walked by the

369
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:09,440
faze clan store oh no no I didn't know you have a store

370
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:15,720
I think they had a store in arcade oh shit pretty awesome I did see it we

371
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:20,400
should go yeah let's go right now fuck the podcast yeah fuck you guys fuck it

372
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,920
no I went to the golf Wang store cuz I wanted to cuz I was gonna get something

373
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,360
for Dom's brother nice cuz you were like oh my two favorite things mm-hmm

374
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:35,080
golf and wang. But I went in or I was at the door and I was like how the fuck do you get in here?

375
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:42,040
And it's like a slight it's like an automatic door right? But they have it so the sensor is

376
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:49,240
on the inside and the employee has to come up to the door and let you in. That's odd.

377
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,120
You have to convince them you're cool enough to get into the store.

378
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:02,920
And then they tell you you can't use your phone and you're basically not allowed to touch anything

379
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,640
on the racks. Like they have signs on everything. They're like, "Hey, do not touch this."

380
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,000
That's a genius idea for a store. The store that doesn't sell anything.

381
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,200
It sucked, dude. It was so bad.

382
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,440
Sounds cool to me. I would have enjoyed it. I would have made the best of it. Just saying.

383
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,160
I make the best of most situations, which is something I guess Patrick,

384
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,480
it's a skill that he doesn't really have anymore.

385
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,640
You guys know you would not like that.

386
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
I would have loved that.

387
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
I love not touching things.

388
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Break the thing.

389
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,800
I would have walked in and said, "Yeah, I'd like to...

390
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,800
You guys, let's do a stand-up comedy show in this store.

391
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,600
I'm gonna get all of my favorite comedians who are my friends, and we're gonna come in

392
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,120
here and we're gonna do stand-up comedy improv everywhere."

393
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,760
And they would have said, "You know what, buddy?

394
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,080
We could try to stop you, but we're not going to."

395
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,440
Yeah, and we'll have beer.

396
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,440
And we'll have...

397
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,440
And you know what?

398
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,520
We'll bring the beer, you bring the comedians, we'll bring the beer, we bring the music, you

399
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,360
You bring the fun.

400
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,200
- And we bring the beer.

401
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,020
- And we bring the beer.

402
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,240
And they would have said yes,

403
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,960
because I was, it would have charmed them.

404
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,800
- They would not have said that.

405
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,040
- No, they would have said yes.

406
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,200
You know what I would have said?

407
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,120
I would have walked in and said,

408
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,160
"Can I touch the clothes?"

409
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,000
And they would have said,

410
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,920
"For you, Caleb, you can touch anything."

411
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,760
And then the guy would have showed me--

412
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,580
- I would have gone out to the door

413
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,720
and it would have opened without the employee coming.

414
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,560
- No, it would--

415
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,480
- I have the remote in my pocket.

416
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,760
I have the remote in my pocket.

417
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,320
- You actually have to have a specific facial structure.

418
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,160
- Yeah.

419
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,840
- And it scans to see if you have it when you walk up.

420
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,840
It's based on your haplo group.

421
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,840
It does not let Irish people in.

422
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,340
That's true.

423
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,340
That's why it didn't open.

424
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:32,840
Yeah, but for me and Cameron, since we weren't cursed, we would have been let in.

425
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,840
Yeah, I don't know. I was very mad about this.

426
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:35,340
Yeah?

427
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:35,840
Yeah.

428
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
You still mad?

429
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:37,340
A little bit.

430
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,840
Are you madder now that you know that me and Cameron would have easily

431
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,340
entered, penetrated this door?

432
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,840
I am hopping mad.

433
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:43,840
Yeah?

434
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,840
I am hopping mad.

435
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,840
Did they put lasers?

436
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,840
That reminds me of Sullivan the Frog's famous catchphrase.

437
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,520
I saw Sullivan the Frog on top of the Jim Henson Studios today.

438
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,520
Is it a Jim Henson production?

439
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
Is that who's doing it?

440
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,520
Sullivan the Frog is on top.

441
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Dude, they put Sullivan up there?

442
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,200
Sullivan, he's got a big top hat.

443
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,200
Yeah, yeah.

444
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,200
Oh my God.

445
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,200
Yeah.

446
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,960
That was actually, that was really nice to just run into.

447
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,320
This the Jim Henson Studios?

448
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:13,960
Yeah, like I went down, I forget what way I went, but I was like down, I had to walk

449
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:20,400
up so I could skate that way and then I just kept going down I think it might

450
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,200
have been I was on Santa Monica and then I went somewhere else and then I ended

451
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,760
up near Kat Von D's tattoo studio and across the street there was like this

452
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,560
really good like ledge that I was skating and then like an old man was about to

453
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:39,720
yell at me so I had to leave. He went "I'm about to yell at you!" I'm getting so close!

454
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,720
charging up. He did. He lifted his bags at me. He went like...

455
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,780
I owned. I was like I'm not dealing with that. Seeing like the Jim Henson studio and stuff

456
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,860
my I would say the predominant feeling of like walking around Hollywood and like

457
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:57,400
most of Los Angeles is like how am I allowed to be this close to stuff? Yeah

458
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,920
no they had the gate wide open I was gonna walk in. But there's like just like

459
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,880
everywhere you go there will be like something that you remember from like

460
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,560
you being a kid and you're just like I didn't know that this actually ever

461
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,880
existed. Yeah. It was just like a fake thing in my brain. There's a lot of

462
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,080
strip clubs out here too, I didn't know that. Yeah and those are the

463
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:19,240
ones that I'm talking about. How do I, how do you let me this close to women? You

464
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:26,920
know? I saw just like a homeless guy just sitting in front of a strip

465
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,120
club and he was just like looking at the pictures and rocking back and forth. He

466
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,600
might have been jacking off. Yeah just jacking off. I like the smell. I like that guy. Yeah.

467
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:44,680
Have you had any good homeless encounters? No. No? Not that I can think of.

468
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:48,200
You're missing out. We're gonna get you one tonight. I'm gonna pay for that.

469
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,320
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm gonna get sucked off by the homeless guy. I think I said it, did I

470
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,880
already say it on the pod? The guy that attacked the skateboarders? Yeah. Yeah I did.

471
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,680
Yeah. Yeah I saw that guy. You saw the clown woman? Yeah the clown lady who

472
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:08,920
times. Who eats Blaze Pizza. Yeah, eats Blaze Pizza and cigarettes. Mm-hmm. Yum. You're

473
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:12,360
allowed to smoke in the in in the seats outside of restaurants? You can smoke wherever

474
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,320
the fuck you want. Really? Yeah. That's crazy. There was a lot of people just

475
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,880
like in restaurant like patios just just smoking. You can smoke in the hospital.

476
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:27,040
You can smoke inside your baby's room. Los Angeles is a smokers

477
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:34,320
paradise. That's true. In every way. Yeah, they'll let you smoke inside your own

478
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,840
shirt. Yeah. You can blow the smoke down into your shirt. You're not allowed to

479
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,400
smoke in one of the forest fires though. Because then they don't know which

480
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,920
smoke to put out. Yeah. It confuses the prisoners who were fighting the fires.

481
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:55,960
Yeah. Whoa, whoa, Caleb. Yeah. No, no, I think it's good. I was walking, I forgot

482
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:03,520
that LA is like this, but I saw like a... I think Ryan made this comment about like

483
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:11,120
we saw a sign on us that said like a something something a woke Japanese game

484
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:16,320
show and he was like oh that's like the first time I've seen woke not used in

485
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,920
like a derogatory context. Woke Japanese game show is super funny. Yeah. I like

486
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:26,960
that term. What is it? Woke Japanese Game Show. What do you think you do on it? You

487
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,720
just don't like molest women on it? You don't put women in a plastic cube. Like a

488
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,960
squid costume where the boobies are cut out? Yeah and you don't put it you don't

489
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,240
put them in a plastic cube. And then you drop them down a 100-foot hole. Yeah. You don't cover

490
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,040
them in you don't cover them in sashimi and make a Komodo dragon lick it off.

491
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:49,520
Yeah I would do that. I think that's a thing. I think that's a real clip. There's

492
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,240
Ripley's Believe It or Not episode where they show you about or they show you

493
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,600
like the sushi that you eat off of a human body. Yeah. And he said jack my

494
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,320
fucking raw dick to that shit when I was a kid. Yeah. You're skinless. A guy's body.

495
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:10,720
Skinless fucking bone. It was a girl's body dude. It was a girl's body dude.

496
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,640
No no no. On a guy there would be no place to put the sushi. What do you mean?

497
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,120
Caleb jacked off to a guy, a naked guy swimming in an aquarium. No, that's not true.

498
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,880
And he said, wow, this is just like, this is, this is like if a girl was covered in sushi.

499
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,200
Do they, do they actually put sushi on nude women? Yeah. Really? I do.

500
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,360
I don't. Do they actually drop women down holes? Yeah. Okay.

501
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:43,280
You never know. I've seen a woman in a hole. Yeah, what hole?

502
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
The whole damn country.

503
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,240
The whole damn enchilada.

504
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Mm-hmm.

505
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
Yeah.

506
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Yeah.

507
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,240
So Patrick, what's your top five?

508
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,240
Do a little

509
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
list. Top five things I've eaten here.

510
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Top five restaurants here.

511
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Okay. So the castle

512
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
was pretty good, but it doesn't make the list.

513
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
The castle? What's the castle?

514
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,240
The Korean barbecue place we went today.

515
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,240
I was telling him they made such a

516
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:20,040
mistake designing the place by putting the troughs of marinating meat that you

517
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:24,680
eat like the beef bulgogi and shit was just like brown shitty meat they put it

518
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:29,960
in giant bins like next to the entrance of the store so it's the first thing you

519
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,320
see when you come in but then you get it then your heart tummy gets hungry for

520
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,440
that meat but then you get a little hungry also when you walk by it and you

521
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,080
go can I have can I give me the whole can I give me the whole trash can yeah but

522
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,080
But it was pretty, it was alright.

523
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,480
Yeah, they just had like very weird rules there, like, oh, the kids 1 to 2 eat free.

524
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,200
Children 3 to 10 get 10% off.

525
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
That's so funny.

526
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
10% off.

527
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,680
That's so strange, like are they gonna check?

528
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,400
Yeah, let me see your kid's ID.

529
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,400
I am 1.

530
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,400
Yeah.

531
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,720
Yeah, you could, I mean you could go in with your one year old kid and be like, yeah, my

532
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,920
son would like everything on the menu.

533
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
Yeah.

534
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
Yeah.

535
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:17,360
anything but my kids really hungry yeah oh it says that they charge you per

536
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,440
person it doesn't matter if they're eating or not yeah that is and then any

537
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,800
meat that you don't eat you pay for by the pound what yeah so we six bucks a

538
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,840
pound for the so Caleb and I like realize that midway through the meal and

539
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,800
then had to eat everything we fucking guy yeah we got probably a pound each so

540
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:40,320
it's more expensive if you don't finish if you don't yeah yeah what the heck can

541
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,820
you can't like take it home? No, no it's a Korean barbecue place. Well I mean you

542
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,660
could cook it and then cook it yourself. Oh okay. But they also don't let you take

543
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,400
stuff home. I see what you're saying. Yeah, yeah I gotcha.

544
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,240
Yeah so if you if you can't finish it you're fucked. You gotta go there very hungry.

545
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:01,620
You're totally fucked if you can't finish it. Okay so the castle doesn't make the list.

546
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:06,960
Doesn't make the list. We're gonna do top five right? We're gonna do top five I guess.

547
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:13,600
In-N-Out the burger was good but the fries weren't. So in and out, okay.

548
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,920
But the peppers were good. And the milk. Let me let me figure out, okay, where do we go?

549
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:29,480
In-N-Out, Del Taco, Roscoe's. Roscoe's is number one. Yeah? Roscoe's was good.

550
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,040
Roscoe's is... Jollibee. I think it might have been just because I woke up and I

551
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,240
was still very drunk. We're eating the Roscoe's in that state. The waffle was

552
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,240
really good. Oh my god. The best waffle I've ever had. I think Jollibee chicken was

553
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,520
better than Roscoe's chicken. Yeah, that's... if you get... here's the meal. Yeah.

554
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:55,160
Here's the meal. Here's the meal. Here's the da meal. Da meal. You go to Jollibee

555
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,800
Drive-Thru, you get two chicken... Spicy. You get the spicy chicken. Yum. It's called

556
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,520
Spicy chicken yum. Spicy chicken yum. You get two of those. You get two drumsticks.

557
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:09,560
Isn't it chicken joy? Chicken joy. You get two chicken joys.

558
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:15,480
Drums only. Yeah. Then you go to Roscoe's you get one waffle. Okay. With a side of

559
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,840
syrup. Yeah. And then you go home. Then you go to In-N-Out and you get those peppers.

560
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,140
And you go to In-N-Out you get the peppers. Then you go to the

561
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,680
grocery store get some milk. Then you go to Castle Korean BBQ. You fill up there

562
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,680
so you don't have to eat what you just got.

563
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,520
- Mm-hmm.

564
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,360
- It's true.

565
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,440
- And you can put it in the fridge for tomorrow.

566
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,760
- Put it in the fridge for tomorrow.

567
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,280
Then you go to Del Taco, you get the beans.

568
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,120
- Mm-hmm.

569
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,960
And you spread them all the way down your hallway

570
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,440
and you use them like a slip and slide.

571
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,280
- Yeah. - Yeah.

572
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,680
- Okay, so Roscoe's number one.

573
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,560
Jollibee is number three.

574
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,400
- That's an interesting way of--

575
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,220
- The chicken was good,

576
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:52,040
but I don't think the pasta was very good.

577
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,120
- You didn't like the Paul Bak surprise.

578
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,120
- The shrimp dissolved in my mouth.

579
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,700
That's such a good thing to say about meat.

580
00:35:58,700 --> 00:35:59,700
Yeah.

581
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,700
That means that it's good.

582
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,700
Actually, you know, if it didn't have the shrimp on there, I like the, if it was spicier,

583
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,080
if it was spicier, it would have been very good.

584
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:12,000
Number two, or in and out is number four.

585
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Okay.

586
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,620
And I can't, where else did we go?

587
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,760
We went to Del Taco.

588
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Millie's.

589
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Millie's Cafe.

590
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Oh.

591
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
The Hawaiian place.

592
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Oh yeah, the Hawaiian place.

593
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760
Got some shrimp.

594
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,840
Hawaiian place? Oh yeah, the Hawaiian place got some spam. Yeah, the Hawaiian place was

595
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:34,200
good, but I don't think they make the list. Where else do we go? Anywhere? It's funny

596
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:38,280
that you... Oh, Chick-fil-A is number five. Chick-fil-A is number five, so you have an

597
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:45,280
empty spot at number two. Yeah. Okay. So we could figure this out later when we go get

598
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,600
food. I guess we could. Yeah, we have to find a place that is really good, but it's not

599
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,440
- It's not as good as Roscoe's.

600
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,260
- Better than Roscoe's.

601
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,100
- But it is better than--

602
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,560
- So if anybody has any suggestions,

603
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,480
while we're recording this right now,

604
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,000
in the past for you,

605
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,240
send it to Patrick, text him right now.

606
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,560
I'm gonna let three seconds pass

607
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,640
to see if anyone texts any time travelers.

608
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,600
- Wouldn't I go anywhere by myself again?

609
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,800
- You went to that one,

610
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,240
that place where you got the hot chicken

611
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,480
that made you fart.

612
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,300
- Oh, Crawford's.

613
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,560
- Oh, Crawford's was good.

614
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,800
- And you filled my room with your farts.

615
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,720
- Yeah.

616
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,920
- The Nashville hot.

617
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,760
- Okay, I think--

618
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,580
- The Nashville fart.

619
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:21,320
Crawfords is number five and then you push everything else up one

620
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:26,940
Okay, okay, so now we don't have to eat dinner. Yeah, yeah, you don't gotta eat now

621
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:32,880
I finally don't you can skip dinner again. Yeah, I love to skip dinner now. This is my top five places

622
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,880
I've eaten since you've been here

623
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:42,220
It's pretty much the same list I would say except instead of Crawfords is a ramen place I had yesterday. Yeah

624
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,240
Yeah

625
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,560
Yeah

626
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,560
What about you?

627
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,560
I don't know.

628
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,560
Cameron doesn't like food.

629
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,560
That's smart.

630
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Yeah, I will like, I like a lot of the food we ate.

631
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,060
I like eating peanuts.

632
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:58,560
I like picking the corn out of the poop I find in public toilets.

633
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,560
Yeah.

634
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
Poop you found on the street.

635
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,560
Yeah.

636
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:02,560
On Sunset.

637
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,960
And I put it into my, and I grind up the corn and make it into a tortilla and I eat the

638
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,960
tortilla plain.

639
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Tortilla.

640
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,560
I feel like that could be like a food trend.

641
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
Like pooped corn.

642
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,080
- Or pooped corn that you pick out and turn into,

643
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,760
you wash it really well.

644
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,600
- Yeah.

645
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,360
- But like, I feel like it has changed it a little bit.

646
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,000
- That's what good coffee is like,

647
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
has been digested by some kind of animal, right?

648
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,640
- You're saying the best coffee beans?

649
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,480
- I don't know.

650
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,520
- People, yeah, that's what they do for like fancy coffee.

651
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,400
They have animals eat it and shit it out.

652
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,560
I'm pretty sure. - What the fuck?

653
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,440
- I'm pretty sure.

654
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,720
You have your favorite--

655
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,560
- I don't disbelieve you.

656
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,800
- Yeah, I don't remember what animal it is.

657
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,640
I'm gonna look it up.

658
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,360
- You guys keep talking about pooped corn.

659
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,200
- Yeah.

660
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,020
- I just feel like pooped corn,

661
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:50,040
make like a cheese corn what what about it we could have got it today oh we

662
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,980
could have got some elote we can go we can still get some of the

663
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:58,580
get some elote yeah I don't know of a restaurant that sells it around here we

664
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:02,820
would have to probably go to a street but we would need cash

665
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:07,340
kopi luwak it's a spur it's a specific it's the world's most expensive coffee

666
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,500
but I think it's I guess it's like a tourist trap yeah and it's been digested

667
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,660
buy a civet which is kind of like a raccoon type animal.

668
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,660
Interesting.

669
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Yeah.

670
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,660
Could I sell this?

671
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,300
In the west, Kopi Luwak has become known as cat poop coffee.

672
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Oh, okay.

673
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,700
So, if you've ever had any cat poop coffee, that's what it is.

674
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:26,700
Yeah.

675
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,380
I don't think I've ever ordered a cat poop coffee.

676
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,740
I try to order every time at Starbucks and every time they say, "Sir, please scowl."

677
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,460
I think I got it as a prank.

678
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:36,860
Yeah, I pranked myself by drinking cat poop coffee.

679
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,300
You smell my hat.

680
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,580
I feel like this is going to suck because I see the grease on your hair.

681
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,580
You look like Neil Hamburger.

682
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,580
Yeah.

683
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,580
Is it gross?

684
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,580
What did it smell like?

685
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,580
It smelled like hair sweat.

686
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,580
It smells like Hat Ultimo.

687
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,580
Yeah.

688
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
The ultimate hat.

734
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,100

743
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:12,340
younger than three years old that's one of the rules I don't special I kind of

744
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,800
feel like that's maybe true what I think you can't you the transformers have to

745
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,160
at least three. Otherwise they wouldn't have names yet. Actually you know what I

746
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,200
just realized the castle charges you by the letter. By the letter?

747
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,000
Yeah by A, B, or C. Oh yeah there's three different letters that you can eat.

748
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:42,920
Yeah that's true there's menu A, menu B, menu C. Menu A is $13.99 and menu C is $18.99.

749
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:49,720
yeah that's insane imagine menu B doesn't exist imagine imagine oh god

00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:55,360
menu menu a was pretty pretty bare-bones yeah that's a I just look you know what

751
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,800
I think it must have been I don't know what the other tables got but they

752
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:04,080
walked up to their tables and then just immediately threw a bunch of meat on the

753
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,760
thing yeah I think they said please oh my god we didn't say please we didn't say

754
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,320
please for anything. What is that white gooey thing you get at Korean BBQ?

755
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,440
White gooey thing? Yeah remember that it was like the little like...

756
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,040
Oh that was some sort of... no not cum. Hush the Korean adults are talking.

Listen we got it's like a weird it's like a tortilla. It's a tortilla. It's not a

758
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,720
tortilla. It's not cum, it's a tortilla. It's some sort of like doughy thing though.

759
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:36,560
Yeah. It's probably a rice. Some sort of white goo. Oh maybe it's just like they boil some rice paper.

760
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Maybe those were napkins that we ate.

761
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,560
Yeah, we ate the napkins.

762
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,560
Yeah, it was alright.

763
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,060
I liked the bean sprouts there were really good.

764
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,060
And the sweet pickles.

765
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,060
I could have gone five things with those pickles.

766
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,060
Five rounds of those.

767
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
I didn't even think of that shit.

768
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,060
You know what? I was focused on the meat.

769
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,060
Arby's style.

770
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,060

00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,620
That proves we're going on a date. Yeah, dude

800
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,460
Why else would I have a photo of a woman if I wasn't going on a date with her?

801
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,740
What if it's- You're so stupid dude. You're in 1th grade, man. Yeah

802
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:52,500
Dumbass. You're a 1th grader. You're a 1th grader, and you'll never go to sunken grade

803
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:55,660
I'll never go to what grade? Sunken grade. Seeking

804
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:00,740
Seeking grade I don't even know what that is cuz I'm too young. Yeah, cuz you're in 1th grade

805
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:08,340
Yeah, you learn about seeking grade when you in stunking grade. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and then you go to fourth then just regular fourth grade

806
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:14,480
Right. Yeah. Yeah, and then you go to sixth grade and then you go back to fifth grade

807
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,480
So you learn how to be in sixth grade?

808
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,860
And then you go to college and then you go to college get more knowledge

809
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:25,080
And if you're a girl you go to stupider to get more you more stupider get more Jupiter. No

810
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,060
drops of Jupiter

811
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:31,860
Drops of Jupiter. If you're a girl you go to the plastic surgeon

812
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:37,820
Yeah to learn how to make your face look all fucking beautiful for the boys when they get out of college

813
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:42,380
Yeah, they spend a week in college. You go to bring them and then you go to bring them to work

814
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:45,720
University you look for a husband you look for a husband there. Wait what?

815
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,300
That's what?

816
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:53,500
What? That's what Mormons do. No. Mormon women. Mormons never. No, no Mormon women. Oh my god

817
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,260
Thank you for saying women. I was going on a... my brain was in the gutter.

818
00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:03,020
Mormon women go to Brigham Young to find their husbands there and then they get married once

819
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:08,060
the men graduate and they drop out. Yeah. That's what a Mormon girl I went to high school with.

820
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:11,660
That's what most, I would say most like religious women, I think that's what

821
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,500
my girlfriend's parents did. Yeah? Yeah.

822
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,940
That's what your girlfriend's gonna do. Yeah. She's gonna do that too.

823
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,980
Yeah. She's gonna... I'm gonna do that.

824
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,220
Yeah. I'm gonna do it too.

825
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,220
What was it again?

826
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:28,140
When, okay, so what we're saying is you get, you're gonna go to jail.

827
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,700
You go to Jupiter to get more stupid.

828
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:33,180
I go to, I could go to jail. I would, I probably do really well.

829
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,180
You go to Jupiter to get more stupid.

830
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,300
I probably will. I probably do really well in jail. I feel like I would be able to make

831
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,140
friends with most of the people in there. Cause I'm just like kind of a charming guy

832
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,260
and I, you know, I can just kind of like talk to people.

833
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:44,260
Charming.

834
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:47,860
They really get me. Yeah, I could tell them about like all the different games I've played

835
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,220
and like, kind of like I could explain to them sort of the differences between

836
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:55,340
Pokemon Ruby and Omega Ruby. I feel like they would really like, I mean just a lot

837
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,300
of them I feel like I've never like looked at Pokemon in the way that I have.

838
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:03,460
They could use, you know what, I bet they would love to you basically say every

839
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:06,420
action that's happening in a Pokemon game that you're playing in your brain

840
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,660
and they control it with your penis and your balls are the two buttons. Yeah

841
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,500
that'd be fun. So you would be like, they would crank it left and

842
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,060
you would be like left, left, left, encounter. You have come across a coughing.

843
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:22,740
Yeah. And then like what attack would you like to use? And I would teach

844
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:25,900
them all the different attacks. I feel like I could also you know kind of

845
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,580
bring them together and maybe like I bet like I could teach them like a few songs.

846
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:34,140
Everybody in prison is so, they're so nice. They're really angry all

847
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:38,020
the time I think and I feel like I could probably just calm them down just by you

848
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:40,900
know being like hey guys you know what why don't we just make the best of this?

849
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,400
this is I mean why don't we just have the best summer of our lives? I mean I

850
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,400
don't know how long you guys are here, but I'm here for the summer camp.

851
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,400
I'm here for the summer camp.

852
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,400
I'm doing more of the work.

853
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,400
I'm doing more of the work.

854
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:55,100
And he doesn't want to take care of me. He doesn't want to. So he put me in

855
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,700
jail for the summer. And I feel like we could just have a good time. And you

856
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,500
know I'm I know I'm a lot longer than you guys, but I feel like you know we

857
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,800
can we can connect on kind of like a deeper level than just across like you

858
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,040
know it's like it's like it what's your favorite guy what's your guys favorite

859
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,880
comic book that's what I would do first thing I do when I get into prison guys

860
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,440
we don't have to fight and be racist well who's it was everyone's favorite movie

861
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:22,520
yeah you know I bet my life that it's a matrix do you guys see the new Funko

862
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:28,080
drop yeah you guys see the new Funko drop you know we're all in jail I see

863
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,440
the new hungry hamster trailer just like you guys see the new hungry hamster in

864
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,200
here they do they show you it on the TV okay you know what that's it that's the

865
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,640
last straw I am cannot believe how terrible the way these these guards do

866
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,800
not let the inmates watch the hungry hamster trailer when it drops it's

867
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:48,600
fucked up man you know I was okay when they were forcing the prisoners to do

868
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,180
labor and you know letting them kill each other wherever but this this is the

869
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,760
last straw this is where it is I bet most of these people don't even know who

870
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:00,960
Michael the crawler is and how he sounds and for the record he sounds like this

871
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:07,560
it's fucked cuz he's a spider who's hungry mm-hmm is every character hungry

872
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,200
no some candy hamsters not hungry I'm in jail and I'm just twiddling my thumbs

873
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:19,200
just waiting for Jeff Ross to come roast me yeah you know yeah yeah you're in

874
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:26,800
jail I have a heart attack and that's how you get out of jail help him having a

875
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:31,080
heart attack I need to be let out of jail and sent home. We're in this this is a real

876
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,880
prisoners dilemma. We either keep him in jail or we bring him to the hospital. Can I go

877
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,320
home and grab my medication? Yeah. Can I go home and grab my switch? Do you guys

880
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:55,000
I don't know why I just. I'm sick can I go home? Can I go to Best Buy? I'm really

881
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:59,720

882
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:06,720
love candy beans. Candy beans? Like Boston baked beans? Like Arrested Development. I

883
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:13,720
don't know. They say candy beans on it. Patrick sing the song that you wrote yesterday. It

was a protest chant. Yeah sing it. I forget it. I want candy, I want food, I want to be

885
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:28,280
in the Christmas mood where are you protesting front of Sears yeah Sears

886
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:32,360
that doesn't exist anymore oh wait we think we drove past one there's like a

887
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,840
very big Sears over like very big this means nothing to me it was huge I don't

888
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,000
care what are the biggest doors I've seen and it's gone and does that make

889
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:46,320
you profoundly sad no I think he learned about death I wanted to go inside of it

890
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:52,120
yeah but it's dead mm-hmm I wanted to get yelled at that is sad to think about I

891
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:56,680
bet if I went to jail I'd have like ten boyfriends because of how like sexy I am

892
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:00,520
that's true yeah I feel I feel like everyone want to fuck you just cuz I'm

893
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,200
like so yellow jumpsuit into a bikini yeah cuz I'm just like hot and yeah

894
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:08,320
would like really want you sure we should do is you should draw even I feel

895
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:13,240
like yeah even the guy t-shirt on your yeah I'm just saying they should allow

896
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:17,200
women to be in men jail so that everybody can have sex with each other

897
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:23,200
because then the guys won't have sex with each other. Yeah. Right? I feel yeah I

898
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,920
just I feel like you know people just don't know how to be in jail and I can

899
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:29,960
like kind of just turn it around and start a new era. They should install

900
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,800
pussies in the walls that you could fuck. Yeah. Right? Because then nobody's

901
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,320
gonna have you know nobody's gonna. Nobody's gonna yeah exactly it's like

902
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:44,120
and it's like that's the most obvious fucking thing and these stupid people in

903
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,960
charge who isn't even in charge the what is it president president Jordan the

904
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,720
Jordan Jordan Michael Jordan Michael Jordan Michael Jordan Bob Michael Jordan

905
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,320
doesn't even care about these inmates you know it's like I care more than I

906
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,240
care probably more than even the average person care about eating dinner I'm the

907
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,400
ultimate activist in the way that I go into prisons and let every single man

908
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,920
there fuck me in the ass that they won't fuck each other in the ass yeah right

909
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,880
and then I needs to stop and then I leave and then I have one gnarly white shit

910
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,480
this has to end yeah yeah I'm have a big flag yeah guy fucking my butt and I'm

911
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:26,280
saying this yeah put pussies in the wall I'll be the last one yeah so and you

912
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,360
guys promise after I leave you're not gonna have sex with each other anymore

913
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:35,720
right but what it we but what did they cross their fingers well that's yeah

914
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,400
Yeah, that is another thing in prison. They should probably be put tape around

915
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,200
everyone's fingers and they can't cross. Yeah, because the thing is if somebody

916
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,680
crosses their fingers in jail, you have to make an example out of them and be

917
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,000
like this is why you were here in the first place. Yeah.

918
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:55,720
Somebody, that's what the warden does. He shoots. He shoots. What does he shoot?

919
00:53:55,720 --> 00:54:01,560
The inmates. Oh, that's really kind of not cool. I feel like if I was in jail,

920
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,000
I'd just become the warden. I'd be the warden, but I'd be the chill warden and

921
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,140
I let everybody smoke weed. I let everyone watch The Longest Yard and be like I would never do this to you

922
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:16,360
But we can play football. Every warden started off as an inmate. It's like because you work your way to the top of the company

923
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,680
It's like the mailroom. Exactly. Start as a mailroom, start as a dishwasher, start as an inmate and then eventually you're the warden

924
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:27,300
You're the CEO, you know. Yeah, so basically what you want to do if you want to become the warden of prison is commit a terrible

925
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,800
Crime so you're in there as long as possible. Give yourself the best possible chance

926
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,960
Yeah, and you want to just go around and start canvassing. Yeah

927
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:38,540
Yeah, meet me the warden me for warden me for warden me for warden me me

928
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:46,160
Yeah, I want food. I want to be in the Christmas mood and I like you elect me as warden

929
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,200
I'll put a Christmas tree

930
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:52,600
I'll be in the machine in the vending machine and I'll put water on the floor so you can play in

931
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,920
Mm-hmm Caleb for warden my ass is on the menu

932
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,760
That's what I would say. Yeah, my tag

933
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,840
We can watch every movie trailer that comes out, but I don't want to spend money on the movie Caleb for warden

934
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:08,000
I'll be your boyfriend forever. Yeah. And I can have multiple boyfriends, but you can't.

935
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:15,360
Solved. Problem solved. Problem solved. I just Vox explained solving prison. Solving problems.

936
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:21,120
Vox explains. Vox solves problems. Cameron for Warden, I'll put a CD switcher in the bathroom.

937
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,960
Yeah. I'll put a subwoofer in the toilet. I'll put a subwoofer in the toilet so your shit jumps.

938
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,320
I'll put, yeah. And make your shit jump after you shit. Why don't they just sell drugs? Make that

939
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:31,640
- I think that shit jumps out.

940
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:32,540
- That's what I would actually do.

941
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,760
I would probably sell drugs.

942
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:34,600
- Yeah.

943
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,280
- In all realistic honesty.

944
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,040
- I'll put fish on the ceiling.

945
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,880
- Yeah.

946
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,700
- That just makes no sense.

947
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:40,540
- I would put--

948
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:41,380
- You can look at them when you're trying to go to sleep.

949
00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:42,960
- He's the crazy warden with a K.

950
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,800
- No, like aquarium ceilings.

951
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,080
Like you know those tunnels?

952
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:46,920
You know like a tunnel where--

953
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,320
- You'd make all of the ceilings.

954
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,680
- But what if they got a hold of the fish

955
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,560
and used its bones as a weapon?

956
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:53,040
- That's fine.

957
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:55,960
I mean in my jail people wouldn't be fighting.

958
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,280
They would all be too occupied

959
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,080
thinking about all the Pokemon assignments I give them.

960
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,620
I would install video games because then they would not have any time to do to

961
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:08,880
work out. Yeah. Then they would never be able to do a violent revolt. Yeah. I

962
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,700
probably replace the bars with bigger bars. Honestly I would, I'm not kidding

963
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:17,600
though, I would probably forget to lock the door a couple times. Yeah, I'd forget

964
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:21,120
to throw away the key. People would walk in. You have to throw away the key every

965
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:25,880
day or else the inmate... People would walk out and just leave, you know, and I would just

966
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,400
be like... That's your prerogative I guess. Yeah. That's what I would say. Does the

967
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,640
warden, is the warden like God and they can just decide who lives and dies?

968
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:43,760
Pretty much. He's like Bob God. Bob God salad? Bob God salad. Yeah. Oh. And yeah I'd

969
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,960
probably just be the god of the place then. And also I'd create new versions of

970
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:52,800
me. Yeah. And then I'd have... You'd have two? I'd actually let all the prisoners free and

971
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,920
create a bunch of little me's and then create a little society of myselves and

972
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:02,160
we would all we'd all have we would we all share one bathroom though which would

973
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,680
be that'd be a nightmare yeah I probably tried and capture grew and bring him in

974
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:11,640
to the prison to increase morality that's a funny that's a big get I was

975
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,400
the warden the first move I'd make is I put the Grinch in jail you know that the

976
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,720
cops have been trying to get the Grinch for so long if I dude if I got my

977
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:24,120
fucking hands on the Grinch. I would grab him, I would push my thumbs into his fucking

978
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:28,840
into his fucking butthole and I would rip him in half from the bottom. I would grab his

979
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,600
hairy finger, I would swing him around and slam him against the wall so hard he turns

980
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,640
into a flat paper. The thing is, the Grinch is so fucked up in his brain that if you grabbed

981
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,920
his finger he'd probably fart as a prank to you. He'd let out a big Grinch gasp. He'd

982
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:46,120
Grinch get you with his big gun. You don't even want to know what I would do if I was

983
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:52,760
in the same room as the Grinch. Yeah. You'd have to kill me. Yeah. Because if I'm mad at

984
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:59,760
the Grinch. Two bullets. One in the Grinch's head and one in the wall because I missed.

985
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:05,600
Yeah. I would probably grab the Grinch by his fur and shake him around until all his

986
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:11,720
bones came out. Yeah. And then I'd take his skin and I'd wear it as pants. As a Grinch

987
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:17,600
shirt I would take the the Grinch right uh-huh and then I would pluck all of his

988
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,760
hairs out one by one oh my god you should be the saw moving then I would

989
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:26,720
keep all of the hair what the fuck I would make my own Grinch suit and then

990
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:30,360
now I'm the Grinch I would take I'm a good Grinch no you there's no such

991
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,400
things a good Grinch he's green you'd have to be blue you could be the smart

992
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,080
out of blue Grinch no he's good

993
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:43,720
a blue grinch. Have you seen the trailer for the blue grinch? No. What happened?

994
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:48,920

995
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,960
grinch trailer and something very bad happened. Really? Yeah. What happened?

996
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:58,520
Look up the blue grinch trailer. Okay. Oh my god his heart is so big. Something

997
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:04,600

999
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,080

and a carton of orange juice yeah it looks like about two cups of jasmine rice

1017
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,520
and then three extremely dark shrimp

1018
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,080

(Distorted voice)

1031
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:08,320
That is really really weird y'all

1032
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:12,320
Could it be the blue Grinch knocking on the door?

1033
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,320
(Laughter)

1034
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,320
Could it be the blue Grinch?

1035
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:26,320
Oh no

1036
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:28,320
It can't be the blue Grinch right?

1037
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,320
It's gonna be the blue Grinch

1038
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:49,920
Nobody's there.

1039
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:53,680
This is scary.

1040
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:59,720
So apparently the door is not supposed to be closed in this hallway.

1041
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:19,080

1042
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:23,080

1043
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:27,080
He goes back into his apartment? Yeah.

1044
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:31,080
And... some shit is about to happen. Something bad happened here.

1045
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:35,080
