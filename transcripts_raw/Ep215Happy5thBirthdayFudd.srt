1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
I

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:13,760
all right, Caleb, go sing your song. No, no, no, no, no, fuck. I'm not my God.

3
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:17,720
You're going to knock. I never did this before. No, do not get the get the

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,940
Caleb camera. No, get the Caleb camera right now. I'm so scared. I never did

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:24,800
this before. No, okay, so loosen it first.

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,680
don't listen to the case. Don't take the cage off, but then just kind of nudge

7
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:29,840
the

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,140
now just you could use your thumb. We've just gradually twist it.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:40,060
Did you loosen the cage and you twist the key thing? Yes, shut up, please.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,880
I'm really focused.

11
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,920
You're gonna hit one of us.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,700
See

13
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:49,560
not my heart. My heart is fucking pounding. It's not that big a deal. My

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,440
heart is pounding. I wanted you to do it. So you would see it's actually

15
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:57,660
nobody's ever made me do it and I really appreciate it. It's fun. I thought you

16
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,280
were doing the thumb. I thought you were doing the one thumb. It's like

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,760
one thumb challenge. It's like popping the biscuits can. I like that. Yeah,

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,140
it's the same thing. I like when that happens. Yeah, so you like this too.

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,280
All right, let me... And now... You guys, what time is it right now? It is

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,360
12.25 PM and we are drinking. Well, they didn't have champagne, but we needed

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,200
a cork popped. Prosecco. Prosecco. You guys, we're not drinking a lot. Let's

22
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,940
you're going to be crazy. Yeah, just a just a few it's a cup. You know this is

23
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,240
a couple of me. I have to go to the dentist immediately after this. Just a

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,380
single flu. They're not going to know man in the dentist office, grabbing his

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,440
thigh, the dentist,

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,600
you better not fuck my teeth. God, that is so funny to have a dentist

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,040
appointment like one thirty PM and you walk in your mouth. It smells like

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,560
shambler

29
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,060
were you just drinking? Did you just celebrate something? I just had a

30
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,240
Thursday

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,080
guys. Cheers to five years and fifty more. Yep to the pot, baby fud.

32
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:04,640
That's good champagne. Yeah, well, I have a dentist appointment. Why'd I do

33
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:04,880
that?

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,880
Well, why

35
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,840
what

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,680
you thought we were shooting champagne?

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,760
a per seco a per seco of sparkling wine.

38
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,800
Who the hell shoots champagne man

39
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,800
me apparently that was fucking psycho. I apparently oh my God. Oh, there's a

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,320
little left

41
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:34,820
guys. It's a fifth anniversary of the podcast. Wow, and it's Christmas and

42
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,980
it's yeah, exactly. It's holiday season. We were so go to for planning. What is

43
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,420
the where you guys were? I wasn't here at the time. We're so what you guys were

44
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,240
so go to for planning the anniversary to be on Christmas. Is that Christmas Eve?

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,780
Oh, it's Christmas Eve, yeah, December twenty fourth, twenty eighteen yeah, but

46
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,640
the episode comes out today, a day that we may live in infamy. So this is pal

47
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,020
pal. I remember so vividly being like oh, I want after we had been doing it for a

48
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,460
while being like oh, I wonder what the anniversary is. So maybe it matter we've

49
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:05,280
been doing for a while. I think it was like the second time. It's crazy that we

50
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,440
didn't think of that when we did the first episode. What the fuck it's

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,860
twenty fourth. We thought why would we think that people would want to listen

52
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,660
to the first episode? Well, maybe at home, maybe it set us up for success

53
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:23,660
because you people are at home, they're back with their pet with the rents

54
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,300
right. They're going to be taking long drives. Exactly, it's actually a bar.

55
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,980
Well, here's another thing too that I thought of

56
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,600
now we get to say we started in twenty eighteen instead of twenty nineteen. I

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,740
know it's like a week,

58
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:39,220
eight days away from twenty nine. True basically it was twenty nineteen that it

59
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,540
started, but it did start, but it was

60
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:45,820
founded twenty eighteen founded twenty eighteen. That gives us kind of an extra

61
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,740
you guys ever do you ever feel you ever see a restaurant or something and you

62
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,400
walk by it and it says established like twenty twenty one or yeah. Why do they

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,300
do that? That's a very optimistic. They should know because it's always it's

64
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:02,020
always a restaurant that's called like sumac and it's like the most fire

65
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,800
about that to a restaurant. That's all that's a super, super optimistic thing

66
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,540
to do, because even assuming that they're doing that being like okay, our

67
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,760
restaurant's going to be around for two hundred years, you know in two thousand,

68
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,400
two hundred and twenty one, there's still going to be the restaurants that

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,940
say established like exactly twenty five. They have to be hoping that we're

70
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,800
going to get to the year like thirty thousand yeah to the point, because

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,560
that's the only time we have to they have to get far enough away that the

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,160
year seventeen hundred and two thousand seem close to yeah. Yeah, though you

73
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,840
you guys know that cozy corner was established in nine yeah, nineteen

74
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,680
thirty years. I had the literature on the hundred years. I have a big

75
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,880
billboard that says that that's the bar is over a fresh pond. The bar we like is

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,120
almost a hundred years old. Well, and you know, the bar we like we see people

77
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,680
there all the time. That's true. Imagine how many other trio alternative comedy

78
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,400
trios throughout the last hundred years have frequented this bar and made it

79
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:01,220
their watering hole. Stooges could have been the Stooges have been Laurel. I mean, could

80
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:07,020
have been Tom, Jerry and Spike Alvin, Laurel, Hardy and Blarty. The third guy that died

81
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,760
Grace and Frankie and and their friend Abbott Costello and Abbott Junior. Yeah, any of these

82
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:18,660
could have been drinking at the same Harold, Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin. They all had $10

83
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,220
Miller Highlife at Cozy Corner. That is amazing, man. What are you kicking at? Bit? Sorry,

84
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:28,820
my foot got tangled and all guys ask me about my beef. What's your be your beef?

85
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:33,940
Oh, your beef, how was it? Oh, I thought you were doing Jay Leno on letterman

86
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,780
thing, but no

87
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:39,060
tell us about what's my beef last night,

88
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,780
the night before last he overcooked it. I'm not my Patrick's prediction now did

89
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,340
not if anything I under cooked Cameron's. We're going to show you undercooked

90
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,340
if anything, nope, complete left turn ball curve.

91
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,420
it was perfect. No well, it was perfect. It was obviously perfect, but I wouldn't

92
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,460
know because

93
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,380
as I'm okay, so set it up, I'm going to know I'm already know where this is

94
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,820
going. I'm already no, you don't know where it's going. I'm about to cry

95
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:11,100
when I went to the all you can eat wagyu place. They cook the wagyu right and

96
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:15,060
then they take these cubes of bread and they put it in the wagyu fat that's left

97
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,660
over in the pan and they make like croutons okay, and this becomes one of

98
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,140
a banchan, which is a Korean word for a side salad.

99
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,020
Or a chicken place.

100
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,280
Or a chicken place.

101
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,100
Chicken chain.

102
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,120
Banchan chicken.

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,060
Remember that place?

104
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,820
I did a copycat. I had a little bit of bright on the edge, stale sourdough bread,

105
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,600
and I cut it up into different sized cubes, and I put it in the Wagyu fat,

106
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,240
and I started cooking it.

107
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:44,560
And I had already cooked the steak. I was letting it rest one minute before I served it,

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,580
and then

109
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,200
I decided to eat one of the croutons right out of the really hot cast iron pan,

110
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,280
and I burned my tongue to the point where I couldn't taste any of the meat when I

111
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,900
ate it. Oh, my God, I thought Phil was going to eat it. Me too, but I did give

112
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,960
Phil a little piece. Okay, and he freaked the fuck out. I'm not. I thought that

113
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,700
dogs couldn't tell the difference between good things and bad things. He ate. I

114
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,700
gave him a little piece of wag of I rendered down the wag you fat. I gave him

115
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,640
a little piece of it, and then he ran into the kitchen and started and knocked

116
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,480
over the trash can and started trying to eat the rest of it out of the

117
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,220
and then I put him in his crate and he was like growling like a like a like a

118
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:29,060
wolf. He was like wanted to kill me to get one more. That's awesome. I could I

119
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,060
think I ruined his life. Yeah, no, he's never going to be able to eat like

120
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,940
cable again. I did the same shit to Mo Mo can't eat a specific

121
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:40,780
like can of his food. If anyone needs any

122
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:47,700
eaten food or cat full grown cat food. I have a bunch of this pink can from

123
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,700
where Ruva because Mo can't eat anymore because I used it for his medicine and

124
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,660
now he hates that. So this is the exact opposite, but this is the kind of a

125
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,060
yin and yang situation.

126
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,020
But the point is I

127
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:04,540
basically just had to sit there while my wife ate the steak and I had like two

128
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,980
pieces. I didn't want to waste it, but I didn't want to tell her and I was so

129
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,740
hungry. I hadn't eaten anything all day and I was just and she was like you

130
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,560
don't want any of this. It's so good and I was like yeah, I'm not that hungry

131
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,600
damn and how much was that steak was a hundred and thirty. Oh, you you ruined

132
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,360
your steak. No, I you know, it's no it was it was you. I ate some stuff. I had

133
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:27,500
some

134
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,940
keepers. I can take the direction out of the pan. That's the what the hubris was.

135
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:35,380
I didn't even consider the fact that things that were so hot that they were

136
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,040
recurring brown. No, you don't blow on food. You don't blow on food because

137
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:43,080
it's gay. Yeah, exactly. You don't blow on food because that is gay. Especially,

138
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,740
and also probably it was the same oil that I'd just been essentially deep

139
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,960
frying a steak in. Yeah. It was the hottest thing ever, and I put bread in

140
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,120
it, which is just a sponge, so it was completely saturated. Do you reverse

141
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,320
sear it? You don't need to, no. The steak's like this big, you don't need

142
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,840
to reverse sear it. I don't know, I'm just, I know that word.

143
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,040
I was curious. You're just throwing that out there? Yeah. It's like a half

144
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,060
I didn't know I thought it was a bigger one. You cut it into very small pieces

145
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,380
bite size pieces. Okay, so you're doing it. You see them like fifteen seconds

146
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,000
either side and then you put them some put them over some rice. Well, now you

147
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,240
put them over some rice a little bit sushi style. They serve it at sushi

148
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,160
places sometimes and then you put some salt on it and guys. I mean it was

149
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,960
amazing. I'm sure it was, but I wouldn't know it must have been. Yeah, they gave

150
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,240
me a certificate. It had to have been. They gave me a certificate on the wall.

151
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
I got to put that right here.

152
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Wait, can we put that in here?

153
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,260
Yeah, sure.

154
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,140
It's sitting on my fridge and my wife asked me to move it, so yeah.

155
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,180
I covered up her family's Christmas car photo with the thing.

156
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,820
And she woke up this morning, she was like, "You got to, we can't have that covering the

157
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
whole fridge."

158
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,820
That's awesome.

159
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,180
But yeah, that's about how my yesterday went.

160
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,180
How about you guys?

161
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,860
I have to go to the dentist, so I'm not having a good time.

162
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:58,140
I have to pay for wisdom tooth removal with no insurance, which is awesome.

163
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,860
But that's not what I'm thinking about.

164
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,460
Today I'm thinking about five years of podcast about list.

165
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,760
Well, it's pretty unbelievable.

166
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,060
You're kind of not even really celebrating anything because you

167
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,360
weren't there.

168
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,960
I was here for four years, but

169
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,260
well, I guess I could just do this now.

170
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:13,860
I am you guys

171
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:20,360
as a gift to the fans for five years of podcast about list.

172
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,360
I have unearthed something amazing.

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,960
What is that?

174
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,160
We thought they were lost to the sands of time forever.

175
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,560
but you guys, holy crap, you're kidding. I found some snippets from the dark

176
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,200
thirty one, which are the episodes that we took off because they sucked really

177
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,480
bad.

178
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,080
There was just me and you guys as a kind of a like you saying they sucked

179
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,240
really bad. Well, all right, but as a retrospective on to see how far we've

180
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,120
come, let's listen to episode two. I don't want to do this explosion. It was

181
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,640
called Fantasy Explosion. Is that true? It's a really good name. That's can't be

182
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,000
true.

183
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:07,520
I am just gonna say it avatar pussy probably tastes so good.

184
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Dude!

185
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,400
You can't start the episode like that.

186
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Ha ha ha.

187
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
What's up y'all?

188
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Welcome back to Potabout List.

189
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,680
We're here recording in the library at our college.

190
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,360
Yep, our college located at 120 Boyles.

191
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,360
I'm just kidding.

192
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,640
I'm not gonna dox us.

193
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,960
Dude, do you know what I saw today?

194
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,440
I saw the fattest guy riding a skateboard around campus.

195
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,840
He was like, and I'm not even kidding.

196
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:32,280
He had to be like 200,000,000,000 pounds, but he was taller than me and he had a Mario mustache.

197
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,360
Hahaha, oh yeah, I saw him too.

198
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,720
Honestly, dude, I wish that I was him.

199
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,840
He looked so awesome.

200
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,400
I hope I see that guy again.

201
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,680
I want to make him jiggle like a jello bowl.

202
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,720
He was really good at skateboarding though, especially given his height and weight.

203
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
God, it made me so jealous.

204
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,960
You have no idea how jealous I am of that guy.

205
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,200
I want to sniff his stinky shoes after he skates.

206
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,600
I want to turn him into a bubble and make him squirt bubbles.

207
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,960
God, I'm feeling so sexual.

208
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,620
I wish the bubble was my boyfriend.

209
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,080
- I would take the bubble out to dinner

210
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,920
and drink wine with him.

211
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,060
Oh, I love wine.

212
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,300
I love red wine and white wine.

213
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,500
- Yeah, and I wish I had to make the bubble squirt

214
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,840
every day as my job.

215
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,260
Oh, and the bubble looks like Mario.

216
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,860
- Dude, me too.

217
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,620
I wish I could make love to a bubble

218
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,340
and achieve mutual orgasm.

219
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,740
I wish the bubble I am imagining

220
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,580
was the third host of this podcast.

221
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,900
- I hope one day he becomes the third host of the podcast.

222
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,660
I bet he would be the funniest podcast host of all time.

223
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:23,300
Aight motherfuckers, this honky finna sing.

224
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,540
- I'm in love with your singing.

225
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,580
I'm gonna sing too.

226
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:28,520

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,280
I'm asleep, 'cause everything is never as it seems.

239
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:15,420
How did you find me? That's crazy. I thought we destroyed those. It's weird,

240
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,040
I had them saved on my phone 'cause I was just a listener back then.

241
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,880
so I was just somebody that was listening.

242
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,720
- I was expecting you were a fan.

243
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,540
- Yeah, and you know, I think you would remember--

244
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,600
- You would like to go from fan--

245
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,440
- Fan to host?

246
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,280
- Fan to host, I don't know.

247
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,720
- One of the first people to cross that boundary.

248
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,720
- One of the few times ever, dude.

249
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,560
- Oh yeah, which--

250
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,380
- Fan to fan favorite.

251
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,220
- I heard that's gonna start happening

252
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,280
more in the next year.

253
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,400
- It will, it definitely will.

254
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,680
Maybe it'll happen with this next guest that you had.

255
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,360
- Maybe it'll happen to somebody listening right now.

256
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,360
- Or this next guest, Julio, play the next clip.

257
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,200
- There's more?

258
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,020
- Oh yeah.

259
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,860
- You found more of this?

260
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,680
- Yeah.

261
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,880
- What the hell?

262
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,480
- Podcast about lists.

263
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,760
Remember the old theme?

264
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,160
This old theme banged.

265
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
It banged hard.

266
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,840
(screeching)

267
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,920
Greetings everyone, and welcome back to Podcast About List.

268
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,240
I'm Caleb Pitts, alongside my co-host Cameron Fetter.

269
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,080
And guess what?

270
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,640
We've got a special guest today,

271
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,480
none other than the one and only Drake.

272
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,200
Yo, yo, what's good fellas?

273
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,560
I'm happy to be here on Podcast About List.

274
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,720
Big ups, Drake.

275
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,320
We're stoked to have you.

276
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,920
Today's episode is a bit out of the ordinary.

277
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,300
We're chatting about how we wish we were pregnant.

278
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,880
What are your thoughts on that, man?

279
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:26,760
Yo, I really fuck with the LGBTQ community, but I'm not fucking with the male pregnancy

280
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,400
fantasy stuff. Sorry, but I'm going to leave.

281
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,880
Okay, so that was awkward as fuck.

282
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,680
Yeah, maybe he could come back.

283
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,320
I remember there was like the first big bump that we had.

284
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Oh, yeah.

285
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,360
Was that we were the first podcast to have Drake.

286
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,680
And then Bobby Althoff stole our whole flow.

287
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Yeah, well, and I wasn't on for that long.

288
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,680
She stole our whole flow in a huge way.

289
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,680
Oh, absolutely. In a huge fucking way. The awkwardness.

290
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Dude, I'm awkward as fuck.

291
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,680
Talking about pregnancy.

292
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
Talking about motherfucking being pregnant.

293
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

294
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,680
And do you guys remember when I was just a guest

295
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
before I was the host? I remember that too, man.

296
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Julio, pull up the clip. You have a clip of this?

297
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,680
Oh, yeah. Episode 29.

298
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
We are sorry featuring Patrick Doran.

299
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,680
Okay.

300
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Again, that theme song, man.

301
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,600
What's up everybody? Welcome back to Podcast About List. I'm your host Caleb Pitts. And

302
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,520
I'm Cameron Fetter and today we're here with Patrick Doran.

303
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,280
I got an issue.

304
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

305
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,280
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

306
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,280
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

307
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,320
you know that what you just said comes across as anti-semitic and it's not cool.

308
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,080
We should steer clear of such topics.

309
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,480
Also, let's avoid talking about skateboarding if it's going to head in a similar direction.

310
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
[Skateboarding]

311
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:58,320
"Okay, we have to end the episode here."

312
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,480
You really have come so far.

313
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I know you really have.

314
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,760
Yeah, I used to be a lot bigger.

315
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:02,760
I used to be fat.

316
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,000
You did used to be big and fat.

317
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I did.

318
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What do I remember about you?

319
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,800
I remember thinking that you maybe had an IQ of 68 the first couple of times I hung out

320
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,120
with you. And not the kind of person with a low IQ where they are like stupid.

321
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Special needs, yeah.

322
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,440
It was like you almost couldn't talk at all.

323
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,400
Yeah, right. Maybe it was because of my massive weight.

324
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,560
I think your massive weight was weighing your brain down. You had so much upper fat on your

325
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
head.

326
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:36,120
I was mostly fat up top, but my legs were good. My legs were buff.

327
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:39,400
Your legs are still buff. My legs were one big kind of tail. Everybody was talking about

328
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,000
your calves the other night. That's true. They're big, man. They're huge. Everybody at the Girl

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,320
God show was saying that I have gigantic ass calves and legs and quads and stuff. Do you

330
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,120
have a big rod? I don't know. What's your shaft? I don't even know. I don't know. Do

331
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,280
when you shoot... When I shoot loads, it's not good. Is it big or is it not that big?

332
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,440
It's pretty minuscule. I'm trying to get the size. If you were trying to fill a Dayquil

333
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,840
serving cup. I could how many you can have a whole thing. Okay, probably twelve twelve

334
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:15,200
milliliters twelve milliliters twelve nuts twelve nuts. Well, that thing up

335
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,120
maybe twelve loads. I think that with me it would be how big is it? It's thirty

336
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,520
milliliters. I believe how big is that with your hand that big thirty loads

337
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,720
you're doing one milliliter loads.

338
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,880
That's really not healthy man. What's unhealthy about it? Well, the size size

339
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,200
in the volume. Since when does size have anything to do with health? Healthy at every size, you're

340
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,720
saying? Yeah. Okay, that's fair too. Next you'll be telling me the color of my load also

341
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,520
has to do with the health of my body. What color is your load? Ghoulish yellow. Wallpaper

342
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:56,980
color. It looks like this? School uniform shirt. Okay. Yep. But I'm glad that you're

343
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,080
on the podcast now, even though you were such a disgusting fatso when we first met you.

344
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,080
like big frog type things. We got well. I remember we got you and we

345
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,740
you were I hate to say it. You were a fixer upper

346
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,900
okay. You were a run down piece of shit auction house and me and camera got in

347
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,160
there and we got in there. I said we'd really like took all the floorboards up

348
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,680
and concept yeah and we want them to break up with his girlfriend and we did

349
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:23,920
that.

350
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,120
We did that and then we got you skinny

351
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
and

352
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,460
that's

353
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,400
the

354
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,520
so

355
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,480
about her.

356
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,720
And then we

357
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:54,420
and then we got you into cool stuff like rap and we got you got you doing stand

358
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,140
that comedy and we got you up. We got you a house for your computer. Yep, we got

359
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,420
you an office just so you could have your computer here. Well, it's because I

360
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,820
don't, I don't have room in my apartment. Do you? That's what I'm saying. We

361
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:08,540
helped you out. Would you say that me and Cameron, my current girlfriend,

362
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,480
doesn't want me to have my computer at home? And that's respect. No, it's I

363
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,560
don't want to have my computer at home because it took up too much space in my

364
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,220
room. Because it also, it's nice to have your computer at the office, because

365
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:23,260
then you can come here every day at nine in the morning and then you play Skater

366
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,500
XL or obsession or whatever for five hours, and then you can go home and she

367
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,860
goes, "Can you do the dishes?" You say, "I just got off work."

368
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:36,060
Are you fucking kidding me? You know my whole plan. I literally just got off

369
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,140
work.

370
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,980
I know you do that. I know for a fact you do that.

371
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,140
You come in, you look at, you put four clips into Adobe Premiere and then

372
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,620
minimize it and then open obsession. I literally was just working for five

373
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,420
hours straight. You're kidding me. No, I think that well that used to be the case. But then

374
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:58,140
once I started making the OJ the alien beats, I would come here for you. Yeah, I would be

375
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:03,800
here for eight hours at a time making music. It's so incredible what this podcast has done

376
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,940
for my life. I'm trying to think of I mean, I think we did this last year, but where would

377
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:11,180
we be if we weren't doing this man? Can I tell you something guys last night? I was

378
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:15,660
thinking about how how lazy I am. I'm probably one. I think one of the laziest guys in the

379
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,340
world and I was thinking that if literally I think if I wasn't doing this podcast, I'd

380
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,700
I would probably just die, because I just just if I if left my own devices, yeah,

381
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,220
I just the mouth yeah. I would just be sitting in my. I would literally rather

382
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:35,300
sit on my couch yeah, then I was I was thinking about this, how this happened

383
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:39,620
to be multiple times where I've been sitting on the couch. The TV is off. I

384
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:44,220
want to watch TV. The remote is at the other end of the couch to the Roku, so I

385
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:46,660
pick up my phone. I download the Roku remote

386
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:54,260
I try to I try to turn on the TV with my phone. It won't connect, so I just

387
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,940
don't watch wow one in and people

388
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,980
you have a mile long couch. So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's a hundred

389
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,580
cushions, but that's literally something that that's an experience

390
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,700
that I've had often enough that it's happened to me probably four or five

391
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:12,500
times. God, well, I guess I'm not going to watch TV today because I can't sit

392
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,060
I rather sit down.

393
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,580
that is next level. I literally think if I didn't have to come in here and do

394
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,960
this, I would be at worm. Okay, do you do the thing where like you're in the

395
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,220
kitchen and like

396
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:30,980
maybe your girlfriend is like sitting at the table waiting for you to like like

397
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:35,800
be finished with dinner and you ask her to get something that is directly next

398
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,420
to you. I don't do that. Oh, I do that all the time. I got that's how I am.

399
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:44,580
Well, actually, no, because I'm in my head. I'm doing so in my head. I can ask

400
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,420
first I can ask to be brought or handed something maybe once a month and I get

401
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,200
I get so excited. I'm like when I'm sitting on the couch, I'm fine. Can you

402
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,640
bring me my water bottle? Yeah, I'm like I bring my I do that. I barely ever do

403
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,980
that, but when I do I feel so good. I bring my girl everything and then I will

404
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,260
ask her. Can you bring me something? She she says no. Yep, what the hell is that?

405
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,180
That's how it is. Why are men the most abused man are coming in the world? Every

406
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,780
single woman were stepped on and stomped on. That's why we started a podcast like

407
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:14,860
this because you make double the amount of money that I make and I'm

408
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,860
practically unemployed. You think that you can not be my slave?

409
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:23,680
I was having a long, dark night of thinking about laziness while I was

410
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,020
trying to fall asleep, and I think the reason that I am not fat. I live next

411
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:32,460
to a pizza place. Yep, too far at literally. I would rather eat a slice

412
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,620
of bread for lunch than put on crocks.

413
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:40,660
That's why you're so good at saving money. Yeah, because you don't don't

414
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:45,740
You don't want to do anything. Yeah, it's too much. That's crazy. I respect that man. I do.

415
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,280
That's my strategy for life. That's how you save so much. That's why I spend so much.

416
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,500
It really is. I think that I'm too energetic. You're too much of a grinder to not spend

417
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,740
hundreds of dollars every single day. I know. It's fucked up. I think if we didn't do this

418
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:04,120
podcast I would almost certainly be working under my stepdad at Waffle House. Yeah. And

419
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:09,960
I would be in probably some kind of paradise. I think that I would be. I mean I would definitely

420
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,320
I cannot be living in New York. No, no, no chance. I don't know possible. I

421
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,800
wouldn't be doing I mean yeah, I'd be a waffle house. I'd probably be making

422
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:22,840
video essays. Yeah, yeah, I probably would have moved into video. I probably

423
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,880
would I was in Manchester, but I don't know what I would be doing. I was making

424
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,480
about a hundred dollars a week at the liquor store. Oh, I'd still be doing

425
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,920
Amazon M Turk. Yes, yeah, doing surveys for money

426
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,800
I probably would have worked. I almost worked like in the mail room at my ex's dad's mortgage

427
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,300
company while we were doing this show. That would have been awesome. And then we broke

428
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,320
up and then that didn't, well I mean obviously that didn't happen. You missed the bag dude.

429
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,660
But that would have been, I would have had so many crazy work stories to come on the

430
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,740
podcast. Well the mail room is also how you start supposedly. Yeah. You kind of, a little

431
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,960
bit you started in the mail room of this show. Did I ever tell you that her dad paid for

432
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,160
You literally did. You used to run our Twitter account. That's true. You

433
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,000
started in the mail room. That is true.

434
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,720
I ever tell you I, I, her dad paid for

435
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,960
me to do like real estate classes. No, did you do one? Yeah, I did like

436
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,480
the whole course. Are you, are you

437
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,000
licensed? No, I failed the test.

438
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,800
Wait, that's over, that's your New Year's resolution. Yeah, we're gonna get

439
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,720
you licensed, bro. In New Hampshire? Me and Caleb, we're gonna train you. We

440
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:35,960
got you here. That was he wanted me to work for him so much. You're going to

441
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:40,160
work for us. I'm going to work for me and my personal life right now. I'm

442
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:44,280
going to reel back a little bit. Why don't we remember that? I just I think

443
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,880
that you would look so amazing on a real estate. Could you imagine like one of

444
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,360
those shitty like airbrush photos and me and just like the shittiest like

445
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,600
haggar suit? Yeah. And I'm like this like dude, I mean, having balding balding,

446
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:00,380
but I like I'm still like you fill it with the wrong color. The number one

447
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,920
experience of going home for the holidays is is you go home and you see

448
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,080
someone you went to high school with on one of those real estate. So yeah, and

449
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:08,420
you go

450
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:14,500
when you're when you are literally just talking a story, a boy did tell us about

451
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,120
how you'd rather

452
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,160
sit on the couch. Yeah, somebody's like doing something with their life and

453
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:19,720
you're just like

454
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,760
fucking

455
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,640
loser.

456
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,240
he's on a billboard. I had that experience. It was I have that every time

457
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,580
I had that experience, but it was weirder because the kid was running for

458
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:36,060
like state office. Well, he was running for state office because his only

459
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:40,400
platform was weed legalization. The last time that I saw somebody in twenty

460
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,560
sixteen, the last time that I saw like what somebody from my high school was

461
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,120
doing was do you remember that it might have just been a video or might have

462
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,920
been a tick tock that went viral where it was in Boston and the guys were

463
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,660
harassing the

464
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,840
the oh the antiserts yeah yeah that those guys went to my there like there's a

465
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,380
guy. You know the guys who walk around with the big blood stain pants and they

466
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,760
have the sign that's like you know don't don't circumcise kids yeah, whatever

467
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,760
you never seen that they were in Boston heavy. I'm sure you did see them, but

468
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,600
they're the video where there it's a bunch of guys making fun of really yo

469
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,000
look at

470
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,760
you need to get laid. Oh yeah, that's all you got to get laid. You knew the

471
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,900
making funners yeah that's awesome. Those guys rule, because I watched the video

472
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:25,200
like two times. I was like wait is that fucking Antonio? What the fuck

473
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,100
dude that's my dream is to pull up

474
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,480
a gas station shooting video and it's just like a homie to friends that I knew

475
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,320
yeah, that's their old friend yeah. I just I just look at mug shots every

476
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,260
time I go home. I look at all the mug shots every single year. There's

477
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,440
somebody that I know and it's always except for one time where it was

478
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,480
a robbery, it's always some kind of like

479
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,580
perverted, disgusting sex thing. Yeah, same same with my like I did sex with an

480
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,140
animal. I added the blue found out that somebody I went to high school with lost

481
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:07,240
their leg and is now like on survivor. Well, I was just like damn that's a

482
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,400
that's guys. This guy's going to win as a woman. This guy is going to win. The

483
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
guy is going to win. Yeah,

484
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,240
one legged woman.

485
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:21,600
Yeah, this like girl I went to high school with like lost her leg and is now

486
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,100
like a survivor like superstar. I was just like Jesus fucking Christ. That is

487
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,600
that is the biggest example I've ever heard of karma

488
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,820
balance in the universe. You lose your life. She probably doesn't have such

489
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:37,840
good balance in this universe anymore. All right, well, that's not very nice.

490
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,300
Yeah, it is not nice, but that's true. I mean that's a fact. She was nice to me

491
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,380
sometimes. It's not nice to say that. You have to really your all sense of

492
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,860
balance. If you lose your toe, what do you think happens if you lose your leg?

493
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,900
You probably fall over if you're falling on the stairs a bunch. It's that simple,

494
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:53,820
Patrick. Stop making it emotional. It's not emotional at all. There's I think

495
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,860
there's two notable alumni from my high school. It's that girl and then the

496
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:02,220
other girl who was in some Netflix movie about being a lesbian and then and then

497
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,300
me. Yeah, Mama Brooklyn podcast. Yeah, I don't know if there's been any

498
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,140
since I went there.

499
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,380
the crown princess of Japan went to my high school in like. Whoa really yeah,

500
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:22,900
that's cool and terrible. My as a home schooler, I had my brother who ran a

501
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,420
paintball field for some time and then my other brother is really good at magic

502
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,980
the gathering. So where do you fall in the middle? You're just like in the I

503

504
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,420

507
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,380
new hall california and I think for sure no he's starting a new hall a new hall

508
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,460

509
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,580
for sure going. We like saw him at this like event where they were doing like

510
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,500
face painting and stuff and he was like out there. My brother has like head

511
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,860
tattoos and looks weird and he was like shaking people's hands and being like

512
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,920
very

513
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,620
gregarious, not gregarious, very

514
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,220
gregarious, charismatic and weird and me and Gus are talking. He's definitely

515
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:19,700
going to run for city council and change his last name, change his last name to

516
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:25,260
like Torres. Yeah, he's going to be, he's going to be Josh,

517
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,860
Josh Tiny Torres running for city council.

518
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,380
We should run for city, we should move somewhere that we have a shot. Dude,

519
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:37,960
Manchester, New Hampshire, because here it's a it's a crap shoot. We could move

520
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,100
to many. I think I lived in I think we did a popcorn ceiling yeah, but the

521
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,160
ceiling, we should we should that would be okay. Oh my God, oh my God, guys, we

522
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:51,020
should us us and all of our friends move to a small town smaller than Manchester

523
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:57,080
and completely for what New Hampshire flood the the government. We just all

524
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,300
run for board of select men or whatever the fuck they have. They're completely

525
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,620
kill the entire government of the town with just us and our friends and take

526
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:08,140
over the town and it's our town. It'll be the we should. Why is that? We don't

527
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:11,900
want to move to Humboldt, California. Somebody has done this in New Hampshire

528
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,660
specifically

529
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:18,340
crew there was it was like there's a the free state project is like a thing where

530
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:21,220
all these libertarians want to move to New Hampshire and turn it into the like

531
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,460
the true live, free or die state and they fucking I think it's grafting. I

532
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,100
don't remember where I think it starts with a G. You'd have to look this up,

533
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:33,320
but they privatized everything, even trash pickup.

534
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:36,120
And then there was an infestation of bears in the town

535
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,620
and it's so fucking crazy.

536
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,820
They ruined the whole town by making trash not public.

537
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:46,120
And then there was just like, oh yeah, there's a bear.

538
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,320
There's a bear in the...

539
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,520
Yeah, I think so.

540
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:49,220
I bet they had no debt.

541
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,820
But we would not, we wouldn't, we wouldn't...

542
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:54,120
We would make everything the government's problem.

543
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,420
We would do a good job.

544
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,920
Yeah, we would do the exact opposite.

545
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,840
Right, we would keep everything the same except parties every day.

546
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,640
Block parties, four day work week, Friday's pizza movie night.

547
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,480
Arcade, bigger than Fun Spot.

548
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Yep.

549
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,120
Oh my god, wait, no, we just go to Laconia, we just flood the Laconia city government.

550
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,280
We could do it anywhere, man.

551
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
Yeah, but then we make Fun Spot our headquarters.

552
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
I don't want to live in New Hampshire.

553
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
New Hampshire sucks.

554
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
Let's do it in Texas or something.

555
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:16,760
It does, yeah, it sucks fucking shit.

556
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
It sucks ass.

557
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,600
You're the only person of us three who has zero pride with their hometown.

558
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,560
Oh, fuck all that shit.

559
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Yeah.

560
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,640
New Hampshire fucking sucks ass.

561
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,860
it's lame to say your hometown sucks. I know it's late. I go say that it sucks

562
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:34,600

00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,000
The beach here isn't as good. The beaches here suck. Yeah, well, that's

I need the sea man?

587
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,400

I love the sea man.

593
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Dude, stop bitch.

00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,080
need to be near the seamen so badly not on our anniversary don't say that yeah,

597
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,180
you can't say that our anniversary our podcast and versus our anniversary

598
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,060
our anniversary. We have not really done that much to celebrate it. It's well

599
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:35,040
reminiscing. We have baby foot here. What are you supposed to do? That's what

600
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,120
it is. It's for reminiscing. Oh, his head just fell off. He's dead. We have

601
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,880
the five. We got a balloon. So I bought a balloon and it's a helium only one.

602
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,240
so you can't fill it with your breath. We're going to make Pat pass out by

603
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,560
blowing it up, but apparently he gave up instantly. I personally open the

604
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,820
champagne bottle. I didn't probably would have been bad to have a big balloon

605
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,980
here. Yeah, why just would have been all sorts of mischief would have. Oh yeah,

606
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,080
you well, we would have had a funny helium segment. Oh my God. Oh my God.

607
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,680
Well, we can we can fake it actually yeah here. Wait

608
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,500
Okay, go ahead and pretend you're breathing in the helium rail.

609
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,600
Hey,

610
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,640
can you turn the go ahead? I'm not turning the

611
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:30,000
yo what's up? Can you just press the oh sorry yeah, I do it against it.

612
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,940
I sound like the I sound like the chipmunks. Can you hit the

613
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,520
you haven't pressed it once I pressed it, you press it, you haven't pressed it,

614
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,540
I prestige

615
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:51,060
okay. You didn't press it long enough. It will you didn't have a big enough hit

616
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,300
of helium. You just

617
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,660
have any helium to send yeah. So this is your normal voice.

618
00:34:56,660 --> 00:35:00,060
Your voice is so high.

619
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,780
What's the other gas reverse one?

620
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:10,740
You're a bore. Yeah, it's some compound of some some long name hex or something.

621
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:16,340
I thought it was nitrous. Nitrous does that too, but there's one that specifically doesn't.

622
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:20,140
There's one that doesn't get you high. Yeah, yeah. I think it's some type of thing. What

623
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:25,300
are you doing, bitch? Stop waving this shit around. Wait, you actually look like the king

624
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:29,300
of Egypt. Do I look like Elton John right now? A little bit. I mean, you always kind of do.

625
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,500
All right, well, do you guys want to see my slideshow? I would love to see your slideshow.

626
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:37,500
Of our memories together? Yes. Is that what it is? It's a slideshow of our memories over

627
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:44,500
for the past five years that I made. So guys, I bought a one-month subscription to CapCut.

628
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:53,380
I spent hours on this video. I like this already. I guess just take it away, Julio.

629
00:35:53,380 --> 00:36:05,380
I'm not sure. Okay, we'll just watch it.

630
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
I'm wearing a shirt that says Young Thug.

631
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,380
Me using an umbrella?

632
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:11,380
No, a vacuum.

633
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,380
The original cover.

634
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,380
That's in my closet.

635
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,380
I forgot about if you see something inappropriate.

636
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:23,380
An apropos camera.

637
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Oh my god.

638
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Yeah.

639
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,380
Do you have the original one with the Ben Margera photos?

640
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,380
We'll be friends forever

641
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:40,380
First up to the girl in my math class

642
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,380
I'm rich and you broke, bitch, I had the last laugh

643
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:46,380
This is a dumb nigga in my science lab

644
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,380
Had it feel when we fought and you called it jackpot

645
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,380
Fuck this shit, it was always talking on the aircraft

646
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:56,380
This tournament I was always gonna bring in a bomb

647
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,380
And all of the girls, wow, them bitches was too foul

648
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:02,380
They all on my dick now

649
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:09,380
Our first trip to New York.

650
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:14,380
Me in a towel.

651
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:15,380
First live show.

652
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,380
First live show, second live show.

653
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,380
That was my show at Atlantic City.

654
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,380
That was Robin's show.

655
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,380
That's my older partner.

656
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,380
Oh my god, the riverboat casinos.

657
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:35,380
Yay!

658
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,380
Merry Christmas!

659
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,380
Aww.

660
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,380
That hat is really cool.

661
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:40,380
Something happened.

662
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,380
Oh, is that baby Bill?

663
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,380
Gratitude.

664
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,380
Oh, that's Tor.

665
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:54,380
That's when I died.

666
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,380
Caleb's hair.

667
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,380
This is someone's house.

668
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:00,380
Oh, wait, what?

669
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:03,380
[LAUGHTER]

670
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,380
Team Liquid.

671
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:14,380
Oh, they have set the drawing of the gentlemen brothers.

672
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:20,380
That's me on strength.

673
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:25,380
Oh, that's rehearsing my outfits.

674
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:35,500
That's my slideshow guys. That's my photo. Four hours. That was a photo. Was I

675
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,180
holding dress like Dracula? You're holding some ladies boobs. There's some

676
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:43,260
ladies big booze. Instagram that you had found. I guess I don't know. You were in

677
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,460
character. Wasn't my camera. I guess I was in character. Can you cut back to

678
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,860
that photo? I just want to see. Why do you want to see his bitches boobs again?

679
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,820
No reason why it's just kind of

680
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
one.

681
00:38:52,820 --> 00:39:09,740
We had so many memories together that we had an incredible journey, man. What's

682
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:14,060
our lowest possible point we've ever been in? Got to be chicken brain. Chicken

683
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,940
brain is definitely I wish we kept that. I might have it. I have it. I have it.

684
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,940
might be the 10 year anniversary we released the chicken brain episode.

685
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,900
I have everything. Everything that we've ever recorded and not released I have it.

686
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:30,300
Yeah. For those who don't remember, we one time everybody came to my house and

687
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,660
I think it was your first time having KFC? Yes, it was his first time. Oh yeah. We got

688
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:38,140
a big bucket and we were gonna eat it on the episode and talk about it with him.

689
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:43,060
And we ate one piece each and then recorded probably the worst 28 minutes

690
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,900
of podcasting ever recorded. We used to not even do an hour. There were some, there

691
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,060
there were some we did thirty minute episode, whatever the opposite of

692
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:55,480
whatever the opposite of a banger is there were some real that that

693
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,140
apartment yeah yeah that was in that room specifically there was a lot of

694
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,340
lot of pain on your bed yeah. That's the thing for me. I was just too

695
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:07,520
comfortable. I was in my bit. You should never do that's why work from home is

696
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,220
such a bad idea. Yeah, you should never be in the most comfortable place in

697
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,820
your entire life. The only place where you can fall asleep yeah where and

698
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:20,140
doing work. Especially not podcasting, which is the most mentally taxing work ever created.

699
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:23,660
Your roommate had a bug trap that smelled so bad.

700
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,660
I don't even remember that.

701
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:29,140
I remember we would go there and then we would shut your door. We would shut your door, but

702
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,900
then we would go hang out in the living room, which was barely, it was like the tiniest

703
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,900
living room in the world.

704
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,900
It was so funny.

705
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,900
It wasn't a living room.

706
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:36,900
It was a hallway.

707
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,580
We had a hallway that had an indention, or a cut out area.

708
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,340
You put a bed or a couch there.

709
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:49,580
not even a couch. We got a free my way. There was this promotion for this like

710
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:54,140
sectional couch that was modular, where every single cushion was like one

711
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,220
section of the couch, and the whole thing was like come get one for free,

712
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:02,180
and then you can buy the rest of them. Yeah, and my wife just picked up one

713
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:06,980
that was free, one tiny section of a couch, and then we put an ottoman next

714
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,380
to it, and then that was our couch. I remember that, and then we put pillows

715
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,620
behind it. And I played a lot of Grand Theft Auto in that ottoman couch.

716
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:17,060
Yeah, but we would sit there and it would be so hot in that room. Yeah,

717
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,140
there'd be... It would just smell like apple cider vinegar. Seven people right

718
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:23,620
there. Yeah. Yeah. In a pension size. Oh, yes, it was apple cider vinegar.

719
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,820
Yeah, we had... When you say bug trap, I didn't know what you meant. The

720
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,500
homemade fruit fly trap. Yeah, fruit fly. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that entire apartment

721
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:34,080
smelled like vinegar all the time. I would stay there till like two in the

722
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,500
morning, have to call an Uber home to Revere, where I was living,

723
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,980
and I would drink 17 beers there.

724
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:47,180
Yeah, I would. I wasn't even a like I was just the first time you guys hung out

725
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:52,380
with me outside of like school. I went to your house. I drank 17 beers that I

726
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:56,080
brought from a 30 rack. You brought a 30 rack of PBR like it was a briefcase.

727
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:00,080
I drank all of them out of it like Patrick Star. It was insane of me. It was

728
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,080
completely insane of me and I would just sit there in the kitchen just talking

729
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:07,780
like, "Yeah, there well, I'm sort of having some fun there." No, it was better

730
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,080
and that you that's why I liked you is that you drank seventeen beers and you

731
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,700
did not seem like you had even had one

732
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:18,300
interesting. I was in my brain. I was so drunk that I was speaking like like

733
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,780
no, you were not doing blah. I was talking like a senator

734
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,700
after seventeen beers like you were and what we need to do.

735
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:32,140
That's how you were man. It was it was amazing. It was one of those brilliant

736
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:35,780
things I've ever seen. It was performance in a way. Well, the only thing I think I

737
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,940
I don't slur my speech. I think if I'm drunk, I just get louder.

738
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,720
That is true. The other night when we were at Noah's surprise party, my

739
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,580
girlfriend was telling me to be quiet because Noah was turning the corner and

740
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:55,360
she said to me, Sam picked up on this, she said to me, she was about to say,

741
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,700
she was gonna say, "Your voice is too loud. You need to stop. You need to

742
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:03,600
speak in a whisper." She didn't say loud. She said, "You need to be quieter.

743
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,820
Your voice is too strong."

744
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:12,860
that is a keeper man. I was like, oh strong. That is strong. That is litter.

745
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:17,220
If a woman talks to you like that, dude, that's rare. That is rare. I could not

746
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,300
believe. I was like, yes, I have a very strong voice.

747
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,820
You're being loud and you look fat. It has nothing to do with me being loud,

748
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,500
but she was said it anyway.

749
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,100
So

750
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,780
that's good news.

751
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:34,260
Let's see other memories that we have of our beautiful. Well, we were supposed

752
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,980
go in the infancy of the show, we were supposed to drop acid and go. I think

753
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,260
we've talked about it, but go see Mr. Wonderful at the Chevalier Theatre.

754
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:44,620
I found that. Apparently, I didn't remember that. I guess I got a letter

755
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:48,980
about it. Yeah, because we had to register online. We were gonna put on big,

756
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:54,100
like, David Byrne-style suits and sit in a hot room. I have a feeling he wasn't even there, man. No. No way. He was definitely there.

757
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,140
He was there? He was there. Why is he wasting his time? He's from Kevin O'Leary Live, man. He's a billionaire.

758
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:02,380
Well, yeah, but that's how he makes his money is doing shitty tours. But I think it was free. I think it was the only reason we were gonna do it.

759
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:05,740
Oh yeah, that's right. It was free. We were supposed to take a...

760
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,980
He's looking, scouting the next generation of money makers.

761
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,380
We were going to sit there, scared as shit.

762
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,380
Yeah, I don't do well on drugs.

763
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:17,100
No, you left. You said that you weren't going to go and then me and Cameron were about to

764
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,300
do it and then we were like, yeah, we shouldn't do that. That's a bad idea.

765
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,100
You didn't have your brave leader there.

766
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:23,740
That's a very bad idea.

767
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:26,780
I mean our cowardly leader who dropped out first.

768
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:31,980
Well, because I got scared of doing drugs, man, which is a perfectly Christian thing to do.

769
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,880
That's a good reason to not go to see Mr. Wonderful. I'm scared of drugs. I'm

770
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,780
scared of Mr. Wonderful. He killed people with his boat. Yeah, I thought his

771
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:42,480
wife did that. That's what we were going to go there and say. We're going to

772
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,980
ask him about the boat a bunch. Had he already done that at that point? Or

773
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,680
had his wife? Or no, no, no, no. We, I think we, if I'm remembering correctly,

774
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:56,580
early on in the show, we issued a fatwa against him and then he killed someone

775
00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,580
with a boat. Because he got so scared. He thought it was one of our sleeper

776
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:04,960
their agents. Yes, that's what happened. That's how I remember it. Do you

777
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,880
remember our first big guest? Of course, dude. How could you forget? Jake the

778
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:10,400
legend.

779
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,200
He's in the vid, man. He's in the vid and we redded him out, and not out of

780
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,240
disrespect. No. We redded out of pure respect. That just happened in the

781
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,560
camera 'cause he was emanating pure energy. Pure, beautiful light out of his

782
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,260
amazing body. Our first number one big guest, when we called him from the

783
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:32,860
library or whatever at our school and he was delivering Uber Eats the whole time.

784
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:37,860
Who was our second guest that wasn't just a college friend, I'm trying to think?

785
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,860
Oh, God, that's a good question.

786
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:43,860
Well, Tom. But that doesn't really... He's a college friend, technically.

787
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,860
Who wasn't a friend? Someone we didn't know.

788
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,860
Someone we didn't know is probably Felix.

789
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:50,860
I mean, someone we didn't know in person.

790
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:54,860
Oh, Thomas. Yeah, Thomas was our first over-the-phone guest.

791
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,860
And that's when you ate a bite out of an onion.

792
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:01,460
was so drunk that night because he got the timing wrong or something and I

793
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:02,300
would party

794
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:09,160
I think no he or we blaming him for how drunk you got. No, we got the time

795
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,400
around thousand miles away. We got the time wrong and we were waiting for him

796
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,220
and while we were waiting, I had nothing I was I had nothing to do. So I drank

797
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:19,940
like six beers. Yeah, it sounds like Thomas's fault. Yeah, there's no it's

798
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:25,820
completely my fault, but we were no because we were up at like 10 PM and

799
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,700
and he had to, he was still living at home,

800
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,020
and he had to record at like two in the morning.

801
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:31,380
And if you listen to that episode, he's like--

802
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,540
- So he lives in the ocean.

803
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,540
- Yeah, man, I gotta be real quiet

804
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:37,260
'cause my dad's asleep in the other room.

805
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,780
- He lives one time zone into the Atlantic Ocean.

806
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:41,140
It was 10 p.m.

807
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:43,460
- No, he was recording at two in the morning,

808
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:45,220
if I remember correctly, I don't know.

809
00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:46,260
- Then it would have been midnight.

810
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,900
- I had one million beers and said my real

811
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,640
social security number.

812
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:51,480
- Did we bleep it?

813
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,060
- We bleeped it, but I said my real social--

814
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,820
- I used to think that was so funny to do back in the day.

815
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:59,260
Oh, my God, it was so funny. I was a class now, dude. I try to get I tried

816
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,300
to get car insurance. I don't like telling it to people if they need it. I

817
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,740
tried to yeah. I tried to get car insurance the other day, though, and I

818
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:09,980
put in the the VIN for my car and was like who would you like to

819
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:15,780
get insured and it was like Jorge Ramirez and it had like a list of fifteen

820
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:19,420
names that were not my name. Oh, no, oh yeah, I've made some really bad

821
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,620
mistakes in my life. Yeah,

822
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:21,860
well,

823
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,100
it was all for this show. A guy stole my identity when I was a kid, yeah, and got

824
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,840
like some kind of foot surgery and said that he was, he was, yeah, I've never

825
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,980
told you about this. I went to go get my, 'cause I didn't get,

826
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,840
I didn't get vaccinated that much when I was a kid. It didn't happen that often,

827
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:45,860
but then I went to go to college and I had to get vaccines for college,

828
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:48,880
though I wasn't immunized with the normal stuff that a lot of people were,

829
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:54,020
and because I was home schooled, so there wasn't like a requirement and I went to

830
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,440
go get my vaccines and they were like,

831
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,080
how was your foot surgery and I was like what and the lady's like looking at my

832
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:06,180
paper. She's like you got foot surgery five years ago. I know I didn't and she

833
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,140
turns out it was a grown man that stole my little boy identity. I got yeah, as

834
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:15,620
insane good for him. I got surgery under my name. He got foot surgery. Yeah, and

835
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:18,380
they just they sent the bill to the wrong. I mean, I think he had the bill

836
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,580
sent to his place. So we didn't even ever get the bill damn yeah, that's crazy. I

837
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,540
don't even know what ever happened with that yeah. My doctor keeps trying to

838
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:26,080
schedule

839
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:30,380
strange tests on me that you won't explain. Oh yeah, you're still having

840
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:36,180
this beef with your doctor of a huge box. It was it was it was the beef. I mean I

841
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,060
still hate my doctor, but there was no conflict between us until yesterday. I

842
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:45,820
get so that last time I was there, I get home and I are like weeks later after I

843
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:51,520
get done with my checkup or whatever it was. She I get an email. It's like your

844
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,160
appointment is tomorrow for the like cardio stress test, like the like test

845
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,340
we have to run on a treadmill. It does not sound very pleasant. No, I'm like I

846
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:02,000
don't I'm not fucking doing this. They never said I needed it. They're going to

847
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,360
charge me like a thousand dollars for it. Why would I do this? Why do I need

848
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,360
this? And I sent them a message. I was like I did nobody told me about this.

849
00:49:08,360 --> 00:49:11,480
Why am I? I'm not going to pay for this. Why are you scheduling me for this? They

850
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,120
just cancelled it and didn't reply. No explanation or anything, and then

851
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,960
yesterday, I got a letter in the mail that said your appointments coming up

852
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,160
soon and they just had re re scheduled it. So I have to you know what they're

853
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,480
doing. Why are you trying to what's wrong with my heart? They're testing you

854
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,720
for dementia and you're failing dude. It's making me so mad because it's also

855
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:31,140
getting in my head like what if there's something what if there's something

856
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,840
wrong with my heart that they saw they're just not communicating it and

857
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:37,840
that's why they're trying so hard to schedule a heart test. Oh boy, that I

858
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,440
think that's crazy. They're not they're not saying anything. I feel bad and be

859
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,280
like why are you doing this? What's wrong with me? I feel bad for these

860
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:48,020
doctors, first of all, because they have to work with nurses, but then second of

861
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:50,000
all, because they have so many...

862
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,400
Think about how hard it is to remember, you know what, a hundred people,

863
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,040
everybody knows a hundred people. Well, that's why they got the clipboard.

864
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:00,640
Yeah, but still, like, you have to go and read all this shit. Every doctor

865
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:02,400
should just have one... That's why they have to write their computer notes.

866
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,160
They should just have one patient. Every doctor should have one patient, and

867
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,760
they should be... That's how it used to be. And they should live in their

868
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,040
house. Yeah. And they should take care of this person, and they should be in

869
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:14,040
charge of making them dinner as well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

870
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:21,560
What? I have to call the electrician again. That's in another amazing podcast moment.

871
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:25,720
Yeah. Remember when you had all this electrician trouble? Remember when we had to scrap a whole

872
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:30,120
episode because I was so stressed out about this guy being in my apartment? I do remember

873
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:33,600
that. That's why I've been very hesitant to let you talk about him. I don't want to talk

874
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,600
about him anymore. Because time is money, man. Time is money in a major way. But also I have

875
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:45,960
to send a video to my landlord because the dance challenge that thing faucet shower.

876
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:54,560
What's the word the knob in the shower is leaking? It's okay. Water. My sinks been my sink. My

877
00:50:54,560 --> 00:51:01,840
brother who is an HVAC dropping probably thousands of gallons a day. He's an HVAC technician.

878
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:07,360
He's a plumber. He does plumbing stuff. I don't fucking know what he does. HVAC is heating

879
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,560
and cooling. I sent it to my plumber brother and he said, "You need to send that to your

880
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:17,040
landlord right now because that could be symptomatic of a bigger problem." And I said, "Shit."

881
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,140
Not a bigger problem. A bigger problem. A bigger problem never matters unless you own

882
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:25,580
the house. Yeah, but I don't want mold to grow in my bathroom again. I want mold to

883
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,560
grow in your bathroom again. No. Also, remember how broken my toilet was all the time and

884
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,520
me and my old roommate would fight all the time because you'd have to wait for it to

885
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:41,280
like refill. No, you're not a flusher. We know this. Yeah, I know, but I could have

886
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,400
fixed that. I could have fixed that whole thing. I could have fixed the whole thing

887
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:49,920
on my own. I showed, I FaceTimed my brother because I had the same problem in my new apartment,

888
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:55,400
FaceTimed him and he said, "Oh yeah, that's a $3 part you can get at any hardware store.

889
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:59,240
It's draining as it fills." I should have just been a plumber with him. That's probably

890
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,560
what I would be doing and probably just be a plumber with him. Mario vice. I

891
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,400
would be a plumber. Oh, my God is actually go to again back to being

892
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,400
Mario. Back to being Mario. I should have. You know what had I should have

893
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,960
fucking war today? The P hat. God damn it. I've never worn it on the show. I

894
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:17,720
should have done it as a gift. Maybe not a video episode. No, I should have

895
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,560
done it as a I'm surprised you still have that hat. The brown hat with the

896
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:24,560
with the white P on it. That Mario brother named Poop. That hat is really

897
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:28,920
good. Also, no, it's not. It makes you look like you're a poop Mario. Well,

898
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:33,480
doesn't matter. I like it. It's fine if you like it, but it is a cosplay of an

899
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:37,880
amazing. Did I tell you about the time two weeks ago when? Yeah, I think I said

900
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,800
this on, I mean, all the episodes we've were we're all backlog and they're all

901
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,720
blending together. I was wearing that hat and a group of yes, I saw a black

902
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,520
squirrel, a group of teenagers pointed at me and said that dude looked like

903
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:55,680
Mario. Yeah, you do look like Mario. Yeah. You know who thinks I look like Mario?

904
00:52:55,680 --> 00:53:01,040
of my nephews. I'm sure they do that. They love that movie. Yeah, the movie was okay.

905
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:05,920
I didn't like how they treated Donkey Kong in the movie. I did not like how

906
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,660
they voiced Mario. Donkey Kong, that guy, Charles Martinet. Who's that? The guy who

907
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:10,960
goes

908
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,680
the voice actor for Mario should have voiced Mario. Yeah, no, the guy who goes

909
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:17,960
Mario. That's my opinion. It's a me Mario.

910
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,560
Okay,

911
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,780
Man fuck Chris Pratt because he's Christian. Yep,

912
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:28,380
but I love Christmas. We actually that's it. We can reveal this now that

913
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,300
we're five years and we have you already hook line and sinkered. We're

914
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:34,980
gonna do we're doing an I C P. We are a reverse. We

915
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:39,300
hate Christianity. We are three atheistic,

916
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:43,920
whenever we've talked about whenever we've mentioned God, we've been talking

917
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,240
about the devil. Whenever we mentioned Jesus, we've been talking about Damien

918
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,720
from the omen and devil. So whenever we talk about having whenever we say that

919
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,400
we have halos and angel wings, we actually have double horns and tails,

920
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,000
all these things all along. We tricked you reversed you. We've been worshipping

921
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,760
idols. Oh, what do you think this is for example? This is a this is a fud baby.

922
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:07,620
Yeah, and if you look back into ancient Egyptian tablets, there will be a

923
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,960
yeah, there's a an outlet on a

924
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:18,280
the spiller, the spiller has has shifted body. My God, the spiller has moved

925
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:23,820
the spiller. The spiller has officially moved. I'm free. Oh my God, oh and he

926
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,580
spilled on my phone. That's perfect.

927
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,700
I

928
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,680
well, I'm going to clean this up right now. Yeah, I mean why

929
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:35,920
it's not that much it's a lot. Okay, your spiller tendencies are coming back.

930
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,120
I don't think it's fully left your body. Well, I'm more of a podcaster than a

931
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:43,240
spiller at the end of the day at the end of the show must go on. There's no

932
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,440
cracked my phone the other day. I'm sorry man. It really is devastating.

933
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,380
It's really is. What do you guys think we can expect for the for year six

934
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:52,760
year six?

935
00:54:52,760 --> 00:55:00,520
I think that one of us will have nude photos leak. Okay, and I'm really hoping

936
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:04,440
it's one of you, but I haven't taken a photo. I haven't taken a nude photo

937
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:08,920
since I was four years old. Really you took one or someone took one. I took one

938
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:15,420
with what I posted on Facebook at four yeah, bitch as illegal. I made a special

939
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:15,860
account

940
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,060
called

941
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:22,220
a novelty account.

942
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:29,600
I made a mean page called naked, naked, naked Cameron pics that had me had my

943
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,320
sides in orbit.

944
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:35,300
I know when the last time I took a nude pick of myself was man mean either. I

945
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:39,520
don't like I take nude pics every day in the gym with my brain yeah. When I try

946
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,840
I X ray my own body in the mirror. Well, yeah, sure. I look at my nude body,

947
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:47,580
but when it comes to pics, not for a long time. I'm not crazy. Seven,

948
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,440
eight minutes. Someone's here with beers. Who is that? Oh, I think we should.

949
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,740
Hello. Hello.

950
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:56,100
Hi.

951
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,940
Good. How are you?

952
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,280
Yeah.

953
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:05,300
Oh, thank you. Appreciate you.

954
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:11,220
What the fuck just happened?

955
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,220
What the fuck was that?

956
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,220
Who is that?

957
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:17,220
What?

958
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,220
Wait, bring that over here. What the hell was that?

959
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:21,220
Who the hell is that guy?

960
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,220
What the fuck?

961
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,220
What the fuck was that man?

962
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,220
Bring the whole thing.

963
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,220
Is he still here? Spiller!

964
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:33,220
Is he still here?

965
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,220
What the hell?

966
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,220
I think he meant to go next door.

967
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:40,720
I store. I think that he thinks we're boot boys,

968
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,480
whatever

969
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:50,680
okay, some guy for people who are not in the room right now. Some guy just

970
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:55,260
walked into the office, opened the door and was like sup guys, you're filming

971
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:58,920
right now. Well, I got some year but my day for you and then just put he got

972
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:03,100
in a car and left he got in a car and left. I'll have one.

973
00:57:03,940 --> 00:57:07,980
I'm not drinking this too much caffeine for me right now. I think I should

974
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,660
probably give this neck to the people next door. I'm taking one bitch. I love

975
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:17,460
your BAMAT. That was crazy. So why did he just walk in? He didn't knock. He

976
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,420
just didn't say anything walks in and it's a twist off.

977
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,400
Oh, that's cringe of me. Yeah, all right, well, let's see how it is. I've

978
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:27,940
actually had this. You were not a good. It's a good. This is like a good

979
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:28,740
yerba mate.

980
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,820
he must have he must have thought that

981
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:37,160
for the people next door. I don't give a fuck. They ain't getting this shit. I'm

982
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,620
liking this taste. No, no, we got to give them. Well, now we can't. Now that one's

983
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,700
missing, we can't. He knew, okay, you know what it was? He knew it's a fifth

984
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:48,680
anniversary. He must have. And he wanted to give us a birthday present. He knew

985
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,220
that we were recording the fifth anniversary episode today, weeks before

986
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:56,340
the fifth anniversary. He knew he could smell it. Why didn't we ask him who he

987
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:01,820
was I know I was giving you because I kind of it kind of felt like I he was so

988
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:06,120
familiar with he did coming in here. I knew he was supposed to be yeah. I felt

989
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:06,740
like he was

990
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:10,160
he had been here before any of us right.

991
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:16,100
What the fuck just happened? Yeah, it was really the way that he acted that

992
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:19,800
made me not ask. He was so non. She was not very confident. He wasn't shy about

993
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,580
walking in here. I walked straight in, walked in, you guys film something

994
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:24,040
that's cool. Here's all right, six by

995
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,660
all right. Well, no way there's no way that this isn't supposed to be for the

996
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,280
guys next door. Well, we'll give it okay. Here's what we do. I keep two and we

997
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,280
give them four because there's four in a whole no no. I already opened this one.

998
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,520
You want me to hand it to him? You're in trouble. You're in trouble for that.

999
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,520
We're going to tell there are friends. They don't care. I'll give them five

1000
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:47,640
bucks. That's overpaying for this, but white label yerba mate. If you just

1001
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,120
sent, if you just sent an agent,

1002
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:55,200
sending us, you just sent a promotional man dude. We're finally it's the CIA,

1003
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,060
sit down. We should have asked him to come sit down and talk to us. We could have

1004
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:01,320
learned about him. I didn't want to talk to that guy. He was weird. He wasn't

1005
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,980
weird. He was, he was a little weird, man. He was a little weird, just a little

1006
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:08,400
bit. I hope that he wasn't a crazy fan who learned our address.

1007
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,500
Listen, if they come bearing gifts, yeah, if you come bearing gifts, I got a

1008
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:20,000
hard time saying no, man. Food. I like food, man. Pizza. Pizza. Pizza is amazing.

1009
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,700
pizza is amazing. I do love pizza. Well, that was

1010
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:28,300
very strange. I mean, I guess this is also supposed to be the Christmas episode.

1011
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:32,560
Yeah. Oh, my God, he was Santa. That's a wise man. That was Santa. That was a

1012
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:37,040
white guy was the opposite of here and record another hour because yeah, that's

1013
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,440
one of the wise men. There's gonna be two more that come.

1014
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:45,040
There's gonna be two more men that come here and give us gifts for the

1015
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:50,360
so we got here and wait, wait the mad guys gifts in in twenty twenty three is

1016
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,520
yerba mate. Oh God, wait,

1017
00:59:52,520 --> 01:00:00,400
so we got woke, Magi and pre rolled joint pre rolled fucking Delta eight

1018
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,120
joint. Yeah, what that means is that we got to start locking the fucking the one

1019
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:08,600
day. This was the one day we didn't lock it. We immediately got and you know

1020
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,800
what gifts have we missed out on?

1021
01:00:11,960 --> 01:00:14,960
six guys. The reason it's not locked is because I went out to get that

1022
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,760
Prosecco for us and I didn't lock it. When I come back, I come back in is

1023
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:23,860
literally all cascades from and if I we had wouldn't have got this, if we if I

1024
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:27,560
wouldn't have gone to get this, if we hadn't lasted five years, yeah, this is

1025
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:32,120
literally for the five years. So if you there's a decision that you that we made

1026
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,860
five years ago that led to me drinking, we wouldn't be in here right now. If

1027
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:39,500
Patrick didn't have to go to the dentist, we would have been here later. Oh yeah,

1028
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,800
this guy would have missed us. He would have come seen this down and he would

1029
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,920
have given it to some other. He would have walked into someone's apartment and

1030
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,640
given it to that or he probably apparently that's what he does. He was

1031
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,500
so hell bent on giving us this Montez guys. When you it's a butterfly effect

1032
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,400
type vibe to the note in here, he was the note he was that I wish we had

1033
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,860
interviewed him. I think that maybe he was grub hub.

1034
01:00:59,860 --> 01:01:04,940
No, he was not. I think that maybe he was grub of anything. He was getter. I

1035
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:09,240
mean yeah, he the way he behaved a door dash or a grub hub or someone says hey,

1036
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:13,860
next door dash. Hey, you guys order this. Hey, you guys filming something cool. I

1037
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:14,500
brought this. I

1038
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,100
if it is door dash and we drank the guys next doors, it's fine man. We'll give

1039
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:19,420
them your

1040
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:23,460
it's okay. I guess one bottle you think they're going to kill me. They're not

1041
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,100
going to kill you, but we have to say explain it. We pay for the trash pick up

1042
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:31,180
yeah, that's true. So I'll say we do yeah, because they don't have oh and this

1043
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:35,220
is our gift for they have like they have like we got you this walk over

1044
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:35,940
surprise.

1045
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,540
We got you five

1046
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,040
guys.

1047
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,080
No, it's fun to say. Oh, he drank one, then he realized it's probably for you,

1048
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:44,520
and now that I said that

1049
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:49,640
erase that so we don't they don't hear us manipulate. I knew it the entire time

1050
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:54,800
boot boys. I do not care. I'll drink anything that is delivered to me. It's

1051
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:59,560
really it's none. It's not a good pick a better delivery driver who doesn't

1052
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:03,620
weird. It's on you guys. You picked a fucking idiot. It just walks in and

1053
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:06,400
or it could be a good friend of yours, which if that's the case, then I'm

1054
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:10,840
sorry, you guys filming right now cool, not even what are you like cool? You

1055
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:11,080
guys,

1056
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:17,540
so just the weirdest possible thing to walk into to yeah, it was completely he

1057
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:17,760
was

1058
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,720
covered in toys.

1059
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:26,200
He was doing yeah again, it's like he's been here before right. Well, he was

1060
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:30,240
probably here at the old one. This used to be the half. You think you they have

1061
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:34,680
him on retainer. He's a regular. Yes, the regular, I think he's the man. Well, it

1062
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:39,520
be. What I know is that I'm too filled with shame to walk this over to the other aisle,

1063
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:41,040
so it's going to be Patrick.

1064
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,040
I'll do it.

1065
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,040
Here, will you hold Fudd for a second?

1066
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,040
Yeah.

1067
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,440
So, guys, it's Fudd's fifth birthday.

1068
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:46,440
That is true.

1069
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:48,640
So I got him a gift.

1070
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:49,640
You're kidding.

1071
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,640
Aww.

1072
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:57,400
So, little Fudd, you're five years old now, and I think we all know what that means. You're

1073
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:02,760
finally ready for your first one of these. I know you've been begging for one for a long

1074
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,760
time.

1075
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:10,760
man five years old. I remember when I got mine. Oh my God, a Glock. Yeah,

1076
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:17,560
19 man. Yeah. So now he could do anything he wants. You're going to run

1077
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,280
the world one day. Future president

1078
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:25,320
Joe is shooting it everywhere. Put the gun down. You crazy bastard. Where a

1079
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,360
where were you when we just got reverse robbed with your Vermont?

1080
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:34,160
that is one of the craziest things that's happened. That's why that's why

1081
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:37,620
I carry it. Today is such a magical episode. Don't try to give me. It really

1082
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:37,960
is.

1083
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,280
Oh, this thing is totally broke. We gotta get a new one.

1084
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,380
Yeah. Oh, that's where you put the CO two.

1085
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:48,220
No, it's a real gun. Oh, you know, it's a yeah.

1086
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:52,380
Okay. I guess that's the end of the episode. Pointing at the camera. Guys,

1087
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,900
yerba mate and champagne. Pointing all the way at the camera. And

1088
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:01,240
I feel like a myth buster because this is making me feel the most insane of

1089
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:04,240
ever felt in my life. All right. Thank you. Happy five years, everybody.

1090
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,240
Cheers to 500 more and we're going to destroy the camera right now.

1091
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:19,240
Happy birthday to you.

1092
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:26,040
The other day, my neighbor rang the doorbell. She's like, I forgot my keys.

1093
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,240
That's not similar to this at all.

1094
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,240
Get out of my house you crazy bitch.

1095
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,240
Bye.

1096
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,240
You crazy psyche.

1097
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:37,240
I was walking with my girlfriend somewhere and I cut through that big

1098
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,240
that park where we

1099
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:41,240
shot the Underworld's Biggest

1100
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,240
Mummy thing. We were taking a short cut

1101
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:45,240
through there and this group of

1102
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:47,240
teenagers pointed at me and said

1103
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,240
"Yo, don't he look like

1104
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:51,240
Mario?"

1105
01:04:51,240 --> 01:04:53,240
Way. You got cooked man.

1106
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,240
The worst part was

1107
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:58,240
I was wearing the poop hat.

1108
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,240
You were wearing the pee hat.

1109
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:00,240
I was wearing the pee.

1110
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:07,240
And you guys, if that happens to you, your girlfriend is not going to look at you the same that day.

1111
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,240
No, no.

1112
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:15,240
You have to, I honestly, I should have just broke off and went into just like a bodega and just hid there.

1113
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:22,240
I think a lot of these teenagers are very well aware of the fact that they can ruin any relationship.

1114
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,280
if there's three or more of them, they can ruin every relationship.

1115
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:26,240
It's like fucking

1116
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:31,520
Nocturnal Animals, that movie with Jake Gyllenhaal.

1117
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:36,400
It's like that. Zootopia? Zootopia. Are you talking about Zootopia? No,

1118
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,320
bitch. Is this a documentary? It's a movie that I saw probably 10 years

1119
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:45,680
ago that is about Jake Gyllenhaal being such a loser that his wife and

1120
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,560
daughter get murdered.

1121
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,520
But it's the same kind of scenario, basically. Right, he's getting roasted.

1122
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,600
yeah where he's like just going along with stuff. The bartender roasted me last night.

1123
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,560
You're kidding. What happened? You were there. He called me mustache. Oh dude this guy was

1124
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:03,200
on one. He was on one. I turned and handed him a drink ticket and I was like hey does

1125
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:09,560
this cover a June Shine? Ok and before you say gay. Oh the bartender at the bell house.

1126
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:15,240
Oh that guy likes me. I think he likes everybody. He must like like me in camera because he

1127
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:19,560
was bullying us. Yeah. Can he give you a shot? Well I said can I have a June Shine? Can this

1128
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:39,340
get a

1129
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,920
Leatherneck.
