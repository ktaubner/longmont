Well, is my audio loud right now?

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,600
It's normal.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,000
Sounds like shit, dude.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,400
Yeah, I think you plugged in the microphone and made a poop.

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
Is that...

12
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,200
Yeah, dude, you're talking...

13
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,840
Pat, you're talking into the toilet again.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,080
Is that what that sound is?

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,720
Yeah, you're speaking into the toilet.

16
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,400
The amp sound is too quiet to even, it's probably, you won't be able to hear it.

17
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,280
Pat, get your head out of the toilet.

18
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,080
Oh God, he got stuck in the toilet.

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,080
Oh my God.

20
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,080
Oh my God.

21
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,080
Alright, I'll shut up.

22
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,680
Yeah, I mean, if you were gonna do that bit, you should have done it louder.

23
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,000
We couldn't really tell what you were doing.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You know what, Cameron?

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There are a lot of things I could do different in my life.

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright, let's go through it.

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is today's list.

28
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,960
Alright, if we could, if you could redo your life.

29
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,960
What changes are you making?

30
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,360
I don't know, probably wouldn't get this haircut.

31
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
Really?

32
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
Yeah.

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
What haircut would you have done?

34
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I don't know, one that doesn't make me...

35
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Cool afro?

36
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:11,560
You would have gotten one hair sticking straight up like a cartoon baby.

37
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,840
Yeah, exactly.

38
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,160
I would have gotten one that doesn't...

39
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
One spiral hair.

40
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,560
Pat would have gotten...

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,280
He would have grown his hair out and then every night he would wear like a velvet robe

42
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
and have like curlers in his hair like an old lady.

43
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,440
And he would walk around asking people if they wanted a midnight snack.

44
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,760
He would go everywhere in a shower cap.

45
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,760
So?

46
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,160
Yeah, you would.

47
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
You would do that.

48
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,160
Who cares?

49
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,160
Yeah.

50
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,160
I care, because I'm-- Why would you care about that?

51
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,720
You would wear a shower cap and have like six foot long hair taped onto it and pretend

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
to act like it's your real hair and you're like, "What are you talking about?"

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,720
Yeah, just clear double-sided tape on his skull.

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Yeah, yeah.

55
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,240
Should I get-- With like a puffy shower cap.

56
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,240
Should you get a toupee?

57
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,240
That'd be pretty funny.

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Yeah, that would be good.

59
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,240
Yeah.

60
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,960
Just have like a just an absolute beast of a hairline.

61
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,760
Yeah, I mean look at my hairline now.

62
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,720
But yeah, if you just had just like a, if you had like a 13 year old like Chinese kid hairline.

63
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,360
Yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,240
That'd be next level.

65
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,040
That'd be sick.

66
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,720
That'd be so sick.

67
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,520
Yeah, it'd look great.

68
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,680
Yeah, we'd look like a Lego man.

69
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,080
A completely straight bowl cut, dude.

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,880
Yeah, you could have a nice bowl cut.

71
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,960
I kind of look like a Lego man now.

72
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Yeah, you just, well that's because you just have a, you have a square circle head.

73
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,280
Yeah, you have the shape of a Lego, Lego head.

74
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,080
That's true.

75
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,520
That's true, I do look like a Lego.

76
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,880
Yeah, and you kind of have the, you have like the brain of a Lego too.

77
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,560
Oh my god, you're giving the Reddit ammo.

78
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,760
There's like five people on the subreddit, I don't think they should worry about it.

79
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
Yeah, someone's gonna post-

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,520
And they just post like a picture of like a fucked up monkey and they're like, "This is Caleb."

81
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:45,760
Yeah.

82
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,920

83
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,800

88
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:26,960
bottom half of your face? He always does. I don't have my, here I'll move this, I don't have

89
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,240
my self view on it because I don't like looking at my big red head so I turn it

90
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:38,720
off and I can't tell. We got him on tape saying he's red. It's official. I do not.

91
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,640
Is that better? Today I just went to the gym and on my way to the gym I lost my

92
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,800
I had my headphones that plug into my phone.

93
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,640
- Yeah.

94
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,460
- And so I was like,

95
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,360
"Oh, I'll just pick up some Bluetooth headphones somewhere."

96
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,400
So the only place that I thought would sell them

97
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,560
between my house and the gym is a Boost Mobile.

98
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,760
And so I walked in.

99
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,120
I walked in, yeah, I thought so.

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,940
And they did.

101
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,040
I walked in and I was like,

102
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,320
"Hey, do you guys have Bluetooth headphones?"

103
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
And then the guy was just like Eastern block dude.

104
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,720
He's like, "Bro, I tell you, we have not just headphone,

105
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,200
"greatest headphone all time."

106
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
(laughing)

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,600
I was like, "Greatest headphone of all time?

108
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,880
"All right, let's fucking see these," he says.

109
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,280
Made by Samsung, same guy make TV.

110
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,240
Greatest TV in world, okay?

111
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,680
I was like, "Dude, awesome, man."

112
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,760
And he handed them to me, and I was like,

113
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,760
he was like, "Waterproof, extremely strong.

114
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,160
"You should bullet it is, bounce off.

115
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,920
"Greatest headphone in world."

116
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,820
I was like, "Okay, cool, how much are these?"

117
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,600
And he's like, "Little pricey."

118
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,600
Samsung, best TVs, made of same material as TVs.

119
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
(laughing)

120
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
And I was like, "All right, just tell me how much they are."

121
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
He says, "$270."

122
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
(laughing)

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
And I was like, "Dude, I can't buy these."

124
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,600
And he's like, "Just for you, $220."

125
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,600
And I just walked out and I looked it up on my phone

126
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
and they were $60 online.

127
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
(laughing)

128
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,600
- That's so fucking sick. - Completely fucked up, dude.

129
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,040
I hate Russians so much. People need to do that more and like we need to see that in

130
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:22,400
convenient stores and stuff like people trying to rip you off on like Pepsi or like just be like

131
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:31,280
yeah this is the best soda in the world. It was 11 a.m. Moscow time and he was trying to sell me

132
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:37,600
wireless headphones. Yeah it's true. These Lay's chips, same people who make Fritos okay.

133
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,520
I do wish you could haggle on every single item.

134
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,020
Yeah.

135
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,920
Well, no, it's not haggling, just like a guy who will try to sell your things.

136
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,120
Yeah, like he's like a salesman.

137
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,840
The way you do that is everything is sold on commission.

138
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,340
Yeah.

139
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:56,400
So like every carton of eggs, every gallon of milk, people only get paid if they sell it to you

140
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,360
and you like mention their name at the register.

141
00:05:59,360 --> 00:05:59,920
Yeah.

142
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,680
Just Russian guys, just like the best eggs in the world.

143
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
Extra large eggs, 12 eggs.

144
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,240
Check.

145
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,760
They come from the biggest chicken.

146
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,040
None come from biggest craziest toughest chicken in chicken prison so this watch

147
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,680
Same chicken that makes chicken breast

148
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,200
This is breast come from your like

149
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:27,880
In on farm come from farm farm with biggest Pamela Anderson chickens all over the place

150
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,760
all over the place

151
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,400
Look at these chickens

152
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,880
By this chicken around wow that should be like in the service industry too like if you're getting a haircut

153
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,340
You should have to convince the guy to give you a good haircut instead of a bad one

154
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,660
Yeah talked about this recently but like yeah, we didn't talk about it well

155
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:55,040
No, we talked about how it's like people act like it's it's art, but it should be like you know clipping toenails

156
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,480
But I think it'd be fun if you had to like if you had to like haggle for your haircuts

157
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,320
I like not in like a price sense, but they're like all right listen it all costs. Yeah, it's all

158
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,940
But you just have to try and convince them to give you one good haircut.

159
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:18,300
Yeah, alright listen, I'll give you a fade for $100 and for $120 I won't shave a slur

160
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,020
into the back of your head.

161
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:28,340
I'm not going to put the Puerto Rican flag in the back of your head.

162
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,660
It's going to cost you.

163
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,540
It's going to cost me not to do that.

164
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,340
- Yeah, it's gonna cost, the thing is,

165
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,540
Puerto Rico's paying me to put these flags

166
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,940
in people's heads like billboards.

167
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,260
It's sponsorship for tourism.

168
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,100
'Cause they see a white guy with a Puerto Rican flag

169
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,460
shaved into their head, all the other fuckin' people

170
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,820
in the suburbs are gonna be like,

171
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,060
you know what, maybe Christmas in Puerto Rico this year.

172
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,900
- Yeah.

173
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:50,740
- Mm-hmm.

174
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:51,580
- Yeah, bring the economy.

175
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,960
- I saw Daniel with that Puerto Rican flag

176
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,220
shaved into his head, I think--

177
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,900
- Maybe we should consider Puerto Rico for the wedding.

178
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,180
- Maybe we should go.

179
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:05,220
Yeah, and yeah, and then they go they get to Puerto Rico. It's all just kids with fucking

180
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,580
AK-47s for legs and

181
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:16,420
We fucked up is that we were no Puerto Rico is a pretty normal place

182
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:27,420
Puerto Rico and there's a giant 300 foot ape attacking the city. Yeah, you need a Puerto Rico find King Kong

183
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:35,200
Hey, you have to think of some kind of funny joke where we go is skull island pretty much as far as yeah

184
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,500
Yeah, yeah, that's why that's why we need to add it as the 51st state cuz then we can add a skull to the flag

185
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,480
Cuz then we can make a punisher. You all citizen. Yeah, we could use King Kong instead of the nuke

186
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,140
We could use King Kong instead of the Statue of Liberty. Just pay him hourly to just yeah, you know

187
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Dude, Statue of Liberty is not doing anything for anybody.

188
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,800
Conspiracy theory, that's already what's happening.

189
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,800
Oh my god, that's the worst conspiracy theory of all time.

190
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,800
It's like that video that was like top 10 times that the Statue of Liberty was spotted moving.

191
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Oh yeah.

192
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
And it's just like...

193
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,800
It's just like videos of like, like those like iPhone app special effects of like the Statue of Liberty, like doing the hula.

194
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Putting Statue of Liberty on elfyourself.com.

195
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
Yeah, exactly.

196
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800
It's like look, he's singing a Christmas song.

197
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:30,380
song we've stat the Statue of Liberty is elfed itself in the Statue of Liberty has

198
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:38,040
elfed itself it's somewhere in the North Pole this is not good news yeah this is

199
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,720
doing a news it's Santa Claus it's doing a dance with my uncle and my estranged

200
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,720
grandfather who lives in Ecuador for some reason with a younger woman that's

201
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,960
That's the only experience I have with elf yourself.

202
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,120
That's the only elf yourselves I ever get.

203
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
- Really?

204
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,800
- From that guy. - From your grandpa?

205
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
- Yeah, from my crazy grandpa.

206
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,240
- Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

207
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,840
You guys both have crazy grandpas.

208
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,280
- I have two crazy grandpas.

209
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,040
- You guys both have bad grandpas.

210
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,400
- We do. - Oh yeah.

211
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,000
- Oh yeah. - Dirty grandpas.

212
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,800
- See, the thing about being a bad grandpa

213
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,280
is you also have to be a bad father.

214
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,860
- Wow, I don't think so.

215
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,800
- Yeah, you can be a, well, I think usually,

216
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,160
if you're a bad father, you will be a bad grandpa.

217
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,240
But I feel like it's almost--

218
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,240
I think you can change. You can change and become a bad guy.

219
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Here's how all men work. You're born, you have sex when you're 14, okay?

220
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:33,240
It ruins your life for 50 years. For 50 years, you're a piece of shit.

221
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:38,240
You hit your son with a belt. You ban candy in your house.

222
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,240
But then, you have grandkids. Again, you don't really give a fuck.

223
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,240
But then, you get cancer. And then, for some reason, you turn into

224
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,480
into like a kind of like an okay guy because of cancer yeah that's how it

225
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,020
goes that's yeah okay listen here's the here's how you be here's it's the way

226
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,740
that you be a bad father but a good grandfather is you know you have your

227
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:04,140
son you beat your son because he looks half like your wife and you don't like

228
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,220
your wife okay and then your wife has sex are you then you're then your son as

229
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,940
grows up and has sex and as a kid and you're nice to that kid because he looks

230
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,260
like your son's really hot wife that you always always try and Amanda and hit on

231
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,220
and family reunions that's a really weird point make weird comments exactly yeah

232
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,500
you you try and you try and you you cut a people into the wall on the wedding day

233
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,580
with a with a drill from a Tom and Jerry cartoon my my granddad he's like five

234
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,300
seven and like three or four years ago my older brother his but he brought his ex

235
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:42,240
girlfriend and his ex-girlfriend's sister over and they have like it's like a

236
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,960
family of tall girls like she was like she's like 6'2" and she's like a big fat

237
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:52,520
bitch 6'2" and she walks into Christmas and my granddad's like oh hey hey kids

238
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:58,760
hey hey you hello beautiful and then just spent the rest of the night in front of

239
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,200
his wife just like basically trying to convince a 19 year old to like go to the

240
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,320
bedroom and fuck him. Shit, this is so insane. I love him dude. That's pretty cool. I love him so much. I think that would I think it

241
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,120
would have worked. I mean he she you know she probably probably her best option in

242
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,840
life honestly. I think she became like one of those one of those nurses who

243
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,360
makes like less than minimum wage somehow. Yeah it's so funny how that's a

244
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,560
huge industry in America. It's funny that yeah the dumbest people in the world

245
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:33,880
become nurses yeah the nurses they're like yeah it's like a last option it's

246
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,200
like yeah I'm a garbage man or a nurse yeah they're like oh I don't I want to I

247
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,680
want to save lives and they become a nurse and they just it's like oh no

248
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,560
you're you're licking bloodstains off of off of the sheets in the basement for

249
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,680
four hours a day yeah yeah you're not defending nurses I'm gonna take a hard

250
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,040
stance that's cuz you're from New Hampshire because you are a male nurse

251
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,360
It's like New Hampshire's main export.

252
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,360
Yeah, exactly.

253
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,560
It's like nurses, like nurses who are 20 and look 50.

254
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,160
There's a very specific type of person who becomes a nurse.

255
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,160
Yeah.

256
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,160
A woman.

257
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,800
I would say, yeah, that's true.

258
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,720
A very specific type of person.

259
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
That's a very good point.

260
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
Yeah.

261
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,880
No, but like I think of everyone I went to high school with who went on to like nursing

262
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,360
school and I'm like, oh yeah, these are all like the same type of person.

263
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
- No, they're not Grey's Anatomy's people, dude.

264
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,800
They're McDonald's people.

265
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,640
- Yeah. - No, like,

266
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,280
there's the type of person who went to nursing school

267
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,920
because of Grey's Anatomy.

268
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,360
- And they were too stupid to become a doctor.

269
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,360
So they were like, I'm gonna go be a nurse.

270
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,280
- Yeah, I would say, I would say, like--

271
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,480
- Why do you keep calling nurses stupid?

272
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,360
- 'Cause they are.

273
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,080
- Nurses, like, the person who becomes a nurse

274
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,080
is like the second rank of UGGs wearing.

275
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
You know what I mean?

276
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,440
Like, not the popular UGGs wearing.

277
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,480
No, no, no, there's like the nurses on like the nurses on TikTok. I know what you mean.

278
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,280
Like the TikTok nurses who were like, "I don't believe anything my patients say."

279
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
Yeah, yeah.

280
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
Yeah.

281
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
Yeah, the ones who are like, "Oh, you have a fever."

282
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,180
I just forgot about that. That's a big subsection of nurses.

283
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:13,800
Every person I know in North Carolina who's a nurse had like a kid at 15 and is like 35

284
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:22,360
acne and has like a husband who like basically does what Patrick does and just

285
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:25,600
goes and plays video games with a briefcase full of ice cream. All the

286
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,520
nurses in my town are like vineyard vines girls which I think is kind of

287
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,480
close to the equivalent of that for this area of Massachusetts. Yeah.

288
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,680
Yeah. If you ever had a nurse, if you ever had a male nurse. It's like if you reflect it through the money

289
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,820
mirror that's like if I had a male nurse version of that lifestyle I would say

290
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,600
excuse me sir there must have been some mistake you're supposed to be a woman

291
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,300
great two doctors that's what I'm sorry listen I don't want to blow your cover

292
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,760
you're obviously a spy pretending to be a nurse you're an undercover boss right

293
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,500
now way yeah yeah you're the boss of the hospital who's pretending to be a nurse a

294
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,360
girl so that you can figure out what they're doing yeah why do they have a

295
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,760
- Excuse me, a confused patient wandered into my room.

296
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,320
- Yeah.

297
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,160
Why does this patient have on scrubs?

298
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,080
- I think a guy came over from the asylum

299
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,220
'cause he thinks he's a nurse.

300
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,080
He must have broken out.

301
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,560
- Yeah, that was the whole concept of Scrubs,

302
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,720
was like, what if there was a male nurse?

303
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,560
And it was pretty funny when you think about it.

304
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,960
- They did a lot of blackface on that show too.

305
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,880
- Oh yeah, there was two black characters.

306
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,520
Yeah, JD and Turk.

307
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,360
Yeah.

308
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,760
To the two black characters.

309
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,280
The two black guys from Turks.

310
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,320
Turk Scrubs.

311
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,560
(laughing)

312
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,400
Turks.

313
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,440
Turk Scrubs.

314
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,560
I've been watching Succession,

315
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,560
have you guys seen that show?

316
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,400
No.

317
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,840
No, I've not seen that.

318
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,880
I haven't seen that,

319
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,360
but I've seen your mom in a succession with me.

320
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,840
Oh my God.

321
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:03,100
Anybody else have anything to add?

322
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,400
Yeah, I also, I was successful with your mom.

323
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,240
Cameron was in the--

324
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,060
You were successful?

325
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,820
Cameron was also at the succession.

326
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,580
- Okay, okay, all right, anything else?

327
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,900
- Yeah, and we had a sex session as well.

328
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,740
- Yep. - Okay, all right.

329
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,780
- And we were on a sex mission, actually.

330
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,620
- Uh-huh. - Yeah, I--

331
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,860
- And we watched the Sex Sense with her.

332
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,460
- And Sex and the City.

333
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,300
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,140
(laughing)

335
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,940
She wouldn't let us do anything

336
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,420

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,660
'cause she needed to catch up.

338
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,020
- Is there anything else?

339
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,240
- And then she said,

340
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,580
"Caleb is my least favorite son."

341
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:41,260

343
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,300

350
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:46,200

00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,060
little for young for kids I watch

355
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,180
older people cartoons like Spongebob

356
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,520
Rennes Rennes Stimpy yeah Angry Beavers

357
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,420
yeah you know as a guy who made Ren and

358
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,120
Stimpy kind of messed up I'm making it

359
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,680
so gross and creepy because he was a

360
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,880
pedophile right so yeah he was all the

361
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,880
talking about yourself here yeah you yeah you are a pedophile

362
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,500
that's why Ren and Stimpy was so fucked up it came from the most disgusting

363
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:28,340
depraved mind. From the twisted mind of a pedophile. That should have been a red flag.

364
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:34,400
That was the tagline for Ren and Stimpy. Imagine seeing that at the beginning of

365
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:42,800
like any Woody Allen movie. From the twisted mind of a rampage. Annie Hall.

366
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:51,200
genius dude oh man well now they can all of those like Hollywood like rapists

367
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,080
they can just kind of they can release like they can re-release those movies as

368
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,880
horror movies with a recut trailers you know yeah so if they have if they have

369
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:06,120
the word twisted mind in their in their trailer like from their their director

370
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,560
intro I think that that kind of I think they could use that I don't fucking know

371
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,000
man this is another it's another fucking me complaining about how tired I am I

372
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,840
woke up at like 8 today me too I want pretty high is that a crazy time for you

373
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,720
to wake up I feel like you're up at 8 pretty much every day I always I'm next

374
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:27,960

376
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,800
fatigue I think you have fibromyalgia yeah and I could just say that and then

377
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,720
for the rest of my life say it and no one would not believe me.

378
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Yeah.

379
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,800

380
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Yeah.

381
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:54,280

"Someone on here got the stanky pussy!"

400
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
And you sit, you raise your hand.

Yeah, I have to raise my hand.

402
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,560
The bus driver turns around, "Whose pussy do I smell?"

403
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
It's me.

404
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560

00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,560
Sorry.

407
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,560
It sucks that every time I go to, like, the bus stop...

408
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Not again!

409
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Yeah, I'm at the bus stop and I hear a guy going "Yee dokey!"

410
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,560
A green stink line emanates from your pussy, hits the bus driver, and he immediately grabs

411
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,560
flowers, brings them to his chest, and floats up to heaven.

412
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:16,560

417
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:27,560

418
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,560
That's the, that's the sex sense.

419
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,560
"My Pussy Kills People"

420
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,560
That would be a game for like a sex-

421
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,560
That's a good shirt for women. That's a good t-shirt.

422
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
That would be a good punk band, like an

423
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Alston punk band with

424
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,560

Kills People" with a picture of a

429
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,560
gun. That would not be funny, that would be scary.

430
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,560

00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,560

I know.

599
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:48,900
People, a lot of people say that COVID lasts one morning.

601
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,900

You're really a brave soul and a good guy.

You need to detox your mind and your soul.

I'm smoking a can of beans, it comes from the earth.

00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,500
Well, look, who are you?

Tings will be Tings.

630
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,780
Ain't that the damn truth.

631
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,560
I'm gonna bring you all, I mean, it is kind of the same,

632
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,700
like, they both say law man.

633
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,780
Yeah, no, they're exactly the same thing.

634
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,540
They're exactly the same thing.

635
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,820
Yeah. Yeah.

636
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,260
Cowboys and Jamaican guys are exactly the same.

637
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,260
Cowboys and Jamaican guys as like a shoots and ladders re-skill?

638
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:19,500
(laughter)

639
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,340
That's what kids played.

640
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,660
Oh no, I hit a Jamaican guy and I went back

641
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,160
to that first cowboy.

642
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,500
(laughter)

643
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,180
That's what kids played growing up.

644
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:29,660
Kids, once people thought cowboys and Indians

645
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,860
was offensive, they started playing cowboys

646
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,620
and Jamaican guys.

647
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,140
Yeah.

648
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,860
Or they just completely didn't realize,

649
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,780
they thought cowboys was the offensive part,

650
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,980
So it's Indians and Chibokites.

651
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:43,220
(laughing)

652
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:48,700
- I would know which part was the offensive part.

653
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,780
- No you wouldn't.

654
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,620
- I would know.

655
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,660
- No. - Which part is it then?

656
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,980
- I can't tell you guys.

657
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,880
- Why? - Exactly, you don't know?

658
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,860
- Nah, I just can't tell you guys.

659
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,700
I would tell you if I could.

660
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,500
- Nah, you guys wouldn't be able to handle it.

661
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,520
- No, you guys would get upset.

662
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,460
You guys would just get upset at the mere mention

663
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:07,100
of which one it was.

664
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,780
I'm gonna mention you, buddy.

665
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,620

666
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,440
- Yeah.

667
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,280
- Do it.

668
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,660
- Patrick eats poop for breakfast.

669
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,860
- Mention me to the devil who gets scared.

670
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,700
- Why do you eat, why do you run, he won't, he won't.

671
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,660
Why do you run, explain this to me.

672
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:23,060
Why do you run poop through a pasta maker

673
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,740
and then boil it and eat it with a crab sauce?

674
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,580
- You have to ask Cameron that.

675
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,220
- I'm gonna, no, I'm asking you that, Pat.

676
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,620
- Oh no, ask me, ask me, no, ask me that.

677
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,340
- Okay, Pat, or Cam.

678
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,980
- I don't know why Patrick does it, that's my answer.

679
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,980
Oh yeah, there we go.

680
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
That's the angle.

681
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:41,820
I don't get why you guys, I don't get why I'm always the punching bag.

682
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,100
We have to bully you so that you wake up.

683
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,660
More like the pooping bag.

684
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,660
Yeah.

685
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,180
I'm never gonna wake up then.

686
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,920
Okay, then I'm gonna kick you off the call and then me and Cam will have a podcast.

687
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,920
You guys don't have a podcast together.

688
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,920
Yeah, we do.

689
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,500
We have a new podcast, it's called Two Brothers.

690
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,820
I was thinking this morning, I forgot about it.

691
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:58,820
I was, I think...

692
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,820
Oh, that woke me up.

693
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:05,020
It'd be really funny if we just changed the name officially, permanently to Patrick's Podcast.

694
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,020
Yeah.

695
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,520
just so everyone could get mad at me when I underperform like this. No, just because it's a

696
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,100
funny name. Yeah, that's true. It's called Patrick's podcast. We're gonna get Pat going.

697
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:21,140
Just trying to, trying to, we may, we, we picked a name that is impossible to gain

698
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,380
any SEO on. We did it. It shows up in search engines now. We got to go to

699
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:31,060
the next level. We have to have something called the podcast. Yeah. We have to have something that's completely impossible to Google.

700
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:38,700
yeah we need the what if we call it cream of the cream of the crop no no what if

701
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:43,380
we call it no we need something that is like the number one search money

702
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:53,700
Suzuki Suzuki Ebony is perfect how about yeah new name of the podcast interracial

703
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,100
Google that might be okay that would be like we just need something that like

704
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,580
people will just find not even looking for a podcast.

705
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,580
How about YouTube?

706
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:04,700
YouTube is a great idea.

707
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,180
Yeah. Yeah.

708
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,780
Yeah, that's a really good idea.

709
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,860
Yeah.

710
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:10,460
Yeah.

711
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,900
YouTube, the podcast.

712
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,980
What about, yeah, the official YouTube podcast?

713
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,820
Upskirt Stimulus Check.

714
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,740
I feel like that would boost our listeners so much.

715
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,020
It would be huge, dude.

716
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,980
We'd be 50K on Patreon.

717
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,540
Yeah. Step sister COVID.

718
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:33,780

731
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:52,100
spend the whole time until dad comes home watching porn and immediately before

732
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,780

eBay yeah like not like not like actually like Hasbro I was looking at like

734

figurines like I was looking at like the ones you get at the comic book shops I

735
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,540
was looking at the Mad Hatter one and then I switched from Mad Hatter figurine

736
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:16,300
into porno.com.

737
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,500
- Porno.com, one of the best ones.

738
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,500
- Of course, yeah, yeah.

739
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,460
- Yeah. - Naturally.

740
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,300
- I didn't realize,

741
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:28,300
like, my sister came home early from school or whatever

742
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:32,240
and then I was in the basement within the computer room

743
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,780
and then she opened the door

744
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,820
and I immediately closed the browser

745
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,820
and turned the monitor off.

746
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,580
And then she went, "Oh, I need to use the computer

747
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,420
"for a second."

748
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,260
I said, "Yeah, go ahead."

749
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,460
And then I went outside for an hour and I sat in the woods.

750
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,300
- 'Cause you just knew it was happening.

751
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,140
- Yeah, I sat in the woods.

752
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,340
- Did you consider running away in that moment?

753
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,300
- I did, I ran away to the woods.

754
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,140
Like I--

755
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,100
- You guys ever decide to run away as a kid?

756
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,620
- Yeah, a bunch of times.

757
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,260
Oh, I couldn't go trick or treating when I was five

758
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,700
'cause I ran away.

759
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,700
- Nice.

760
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,740
- I ran away and then I hid in like a bush behind,

761
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,700
like you saw my old, the fans,

762
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't know if they know, 'cause it was a fucking shot of us,

763
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,180
but my old neighborhood in Londonderry,

764
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,460
there was like all those bushes in front of the houses.

765
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,420
I squatted in a bush for two hours.

766
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,380
(laughing)

767
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:29,380
It just sat there like squat position for an hour

768
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,820
until one of my uncles found me,

769
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,440
because like my mom was about to call the cops

770
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:37,300
'cause she thought like I ran away like down the street,

771
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,140
but no, I was like just--

772
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:39,980
- Right outside.

773
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,040
Squatting in a bush behind the house for two hours.

774
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,080
- I did, when I was like nine or so,

775
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,120
I did a hobo sack.

776
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:48,960
- Yeah.

777
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,320
- And yeah, I just put like my fucking Game Boy in it.

778
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,440
- Yeah, a candy and a shirt.

779
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,700
- And I couldn't figure out how to tie it,

780
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:59,400
so I actually had to get my mom to tie the,

781
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,440
my mom tied the bandana on the stick that I had,

782
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:06,160
and then I walked like two houses down the street,

783
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,680
and then I just started crying,

784
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,140
I was like I can't do this. I can't do it. I'm nine years old. I can't I can't do this to my family

785
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,700
Yeah, that is how I was like

786
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:20,000
They're gonna be so heartbroken when I leave and I become the president and they're gonna they're gonna wish

787
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,360
They're always gonna ask me for money and to be the president after me

788
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:29,480
How many days do you think you would have lasted as a kid if you had ran away me?

life-saving bills

00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,820
in cages things oh my god yeah they put all of them in their own crates they're

840
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,320
We're trying to make them look like Minecraft Steve.

841
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:08,820
Yeah.

842
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,320
Okay.

843
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:10,320
That's what I'm doing.

844
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:10,820
Oh my god.

845
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,820
I have a kid, I'm gonna put a box on his head so he's a perfectly square head.

846
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,820
Yeah.

847
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,320
This is just an iron box.

848
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:17,820
You can do that.

849
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,820
Mm-hmm.

850
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,820
I am doing it.

851
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:20,820
I just said that I'm doing it.

852
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:21,320
You can do it.

853
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,820
Hi, SNL.

854
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,320
Thanks for hearing my pitch.

855
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:30,320
My idea is what if an invisible kid was playing on top of a shed at his family's cookout?

856
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:31,820
Wow.

857
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,320
And then Mr. Wonderful is like, "Yeah, that idea sucks.

858
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,160
still never make it.

859
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,000
- Mr. Wonderful is who you pitched.

860
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,560
- To his surprise.

861
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,560
- You pitched to Shark Tank at SNL.

862
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,400
- Yeah.

863
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,200
- All of the, everything gets pitched to them.

864
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,680
Every TV show.

865
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,000
- Every pitch, just.

866
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:46,840
- Every pitch.

867
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:47,680
- Yeah.

868
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,520
- Just goes straight to the Shark Tank.

869
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,000
- 'Cause they're the masters.

870
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:50,840
They know exactly what they're doing.

871
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,600
- Aren't they instructed not to laugh?

872
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,320
- Aren't you?

873
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,140
- Shark Tank people?

874
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,140
- No, SNL.

875
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,200
Isn't it like a whole thing like,

876
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,440
oh, well you know, Lorne doesn't laugh in the auditions.

877
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,200
It's like, yeah, 'cause he hasn't

878
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,840
fucking picked anyone funny in years.

879
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,260
- Yeah, I don't know that they're instructed not to laugh,

880
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:09,760
but I do think there's a thing where like,

881
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,200
when people don't get SNL and they've auditioned,

882
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:16,040
they did laugh, and then when they didn't laugh at all,

883
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,680
a lot of people get SNL.

884
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,520
- Right.

885
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:20,080
- It's all like these weird mind games.

886
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,160
It's really funny.

887
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,600
It's funny to jump through all those hoops.

888
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,080
- It's the stupidest gatekeeping shit, yeah.

889
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,560
- Lorne Michaels makes you sit for like four hours

890
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,400
outside his office just to see if you do it.

891
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,740
- It's like, yeah dude, it's a guy from fucking

892
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:36,060
Improv Olympics making $22,000 a year

893
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,840
on the fucking main stage company.

894
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,200
He'll sit outside your office for three hours.

895
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,620
- Obviously.

896
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,880
- And it's like, isn't it like if you,

897
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,440
all the sketches in your packet,

898
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,780
if you audition, like they can just use them?

899
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:48,620
- Yeah.

900
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,440
- Yeah.

901
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,200
- And jokes from your Twitter account now.

902
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,040
- Yeah, but I mean like even if you don't get it,

903
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,160
they can use your packet?

904
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,540
- Yep, yeah.

905
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:57,720
- Yeah, it's pretty funny.

906
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:58,720
- It's pretty awesome, dude.

907
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,560
- Yeah.

908
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:14,240
stupid. They started using Zane Gillis' material. SNL under fire for neuter sketch. SNL controversial but

909
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:24,940
powerful Chinatown sketch. You guys were so brave. Did you see yeah they just

910
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:30,900

never okay oh let me look at the list they got Barney and Rick and Morty yeah

914
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:54,900
really round I think they could play off each other really well yeah

915
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:58,380
looking at the cast photo and he's like, God, I we need a kid.

916
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,580
We need Barney. We need a kid.

917
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,980
10 year old kid.

918
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,460
SNL kid cast member. Wow.

919
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,900
They had a Michael Hall. He was 17.

920
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:11,060
No, they need a 10 year old kid. That'd be so

921
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:11,460
funny.

922
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:16,100
10 year old kid. 10 year old kid sensibility on SNL would, it

923
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,780
would be funny.

924
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:19,900
It would be better. No, but the type of kid they would get would

925
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,060
be a child actor.

926
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,540
It would be they would get one of the TikTok kids who goes,

927
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,500
Actually, it's proven that Biden has never touched a woman in his life.

928
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,300
One of the things I like and they're like 14 years old.

929
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:31,800
Yeah.

930
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,300
Yeah.

931
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,400
Actually, if you think about it, Biden has never actually touched anything.

932
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,500
Where did that come from?

933
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:38,500
What?

934
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,400
Like a cartoon?

935
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,400
Why do TikTok kids move like they're cartoon characters?

936
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,500
Yeah, they watch Ted Talks all day and then they do that.

937
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:48,000
It's Ted Talks or like cartoons.

938
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,500
It's not that they watch Ted Talks.

939
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:53,100
It's like their parents are really rich and they say that they got rich by

940
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:57,740
watching TED talks and so then the kids. Right, so the kid has to become rich.

941
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:03,300
Yeah, secret to business. Yeah, the only way that I was able to access my

942
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,100
late father's gigantic inheritance was actually by watching a TED talk called

943
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,820
How to Access Your Late Father's Gigantic Inheritance. If I was, if I was, I've been

944
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,500
I've been thinking about just like if I had been born crazy rich because I'm

945
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,180
watching Succession and yeah I think I would just like like if I had like a

946
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,560
billionaire dad I think I just sell his phone and then just like never talk to

947
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:26,800

00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,340
The lock the lock the only key that fits in the lock is is a seven-year-old child's pinky finger bone

954
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:59,040
I've missed those those commercials for those diaries

955
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:03,240
I feel like maybe we've talked about this before but it's always so funny cuz like the little brother just

956
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:13,980
The opening scene in fucking the

957
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:20,600
2004 Freaky Friday remake is the younger brother and his friends going into Lindsay Lohan's room to try on her bras

Yeah

968
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,200
Yeah, I'd like to see my dad's dick and balls

969
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,480
Yeah, I think I did one time and I thought I thought it looked like a skull you've seen a little dad's dick and balls

970
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,620
Yeah, what they look like they look exactly like yours

But then if he takes off his like his shirt and his shorts, he's like invisibly white

973
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:39,180
Yes, my dad is like a like the whitest dick in the world. Yeah, no and probably some really hot red balls

974
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,200
He's got to see mine. I

975
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:47,240
Don't see I just but he's got a smoldering coals. Yeah, just like I mean, I like that definitely some steamy balls

976
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:52,640
Yeah, you know your dad has like a sauna stone. I think it cooked his arms in his face

977
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:57,160
Yeah, so he's so dark. Yeah, they beat like hearts

978
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,920

979
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:09,000
Absolutely my dad has I think my dad's thoughts are stored in his balls. Yeah. Oh for sure, you know

980
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:15,780
That's why it's just smart. Yeah, you can has two brains and plastic surgery. So your balls heck looks exactly like a brain

981
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:21,800
Mine kind of does if I'm like no, that's why your Twitter handle is brain getter

982
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:28,400
Cuz you're like a brain not kind of like a brain exactly like a brain just pink and like just weird

983
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,400
Well, think of a brain.

984
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,400
I can't think of one.

985
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,400
It's impossible to think of a brain with a brain.

986
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,400
Because you don't have one.

987
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,400
It's a hat on a hat.

988
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,400
You can put a hat on a hat.

989
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,400
Try.

990
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,400
Don't do it, seriously. Don't do it.

991
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,400
You'll tear a rift in the universe.

992
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Pat, I've never seen you look more mentally disabled.

993
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Yeah.

994
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Yeah, you just look, mouth agape, drooling,

995
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:03,400
ruling

996
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:04,400
This is an imposter.

997
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,400
Is they're both hats?

998
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,400
This is impossible.

999
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,400
No.

1000
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:08,400
They're both hats.

1001
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,320
And I'm wearing my headphones under the hat.

1002
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:11,840
So this is technically three hats.

1003
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:12,840
No.

1004
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:13,840
A headphone is not a hat.

1005
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,840
A headphones is a hat.

1006
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:15,840
Oh, I'm sorry.

1007
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:16,840
Is hair a hat?

1008

Holocaust happened where like nobody really knows about it that much and then

1125
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:52,820

1155
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:39,780
penis gets repurposed for whatever the correct size and shape. You want them to use your penis like a

1156
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,720
parachute in like a gym class so a bunch of children are gonna sit inside of it and you

1157

01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,560
stupidest guy I know. No but you think it's called a parachute and that's why you said

1159
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:56,620
that. I don't think that. No you clearly think it's called a parachute. It's called the circus tent.

1160
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:01,820
No they called it the parachute. They'll probably use your penis as a molecule when you die.

1161
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:06,860
That's very possible. You're gonna turn your penis into dust. Yeah when I die I want my penis to be used as a molecule.

1162
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:13,420
Yeah the biggest molecule ever. Yeah. I want them to split my penis like an atom when I die. Yeah.

1163
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:19,180
yeah I want my penis to be used for fission it's a really good idea yeah

1164
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:25,380
donating your penis to science and they just blow it up what are you guys
