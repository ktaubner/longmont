00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
*intro*

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Yep, yep. Today we're a fucking on one. Telling it like it is.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Can I tell it like it is real quick? Real quick?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Real quick. Really really quickly though? I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Yep. So that's real shit that I just fucking said.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm gonna tell it like it is really quick. Okay.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,840
me to say for the Patreon subscribers, me and Patrick, we packed all the T shirts

8
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,840
that you guys ordered, we packed them up in packages and let me tell it like it

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,880
is. If you

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,520
were a male and you ordered a small, we noticed.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,040
We noticed that. And I'm not afraid anymore to tell it like it is.

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,240
Nine of you. We have your address. We have your address. We have your email.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,440
We have your phone number. We gonna kill you, dog.

14
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,400
You better grow. You better go get that surgery.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:05,280
You know what? We're going to put a timer on this. If you were a male and you

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,600
ordered, or you at least had a masculine name, and you ordered a small, you have

17
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,400
90 days to grow either horizontally or vertically.

18
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,920
You have 90 days to put on 30 to 60 pounds.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,440
No, no. They got to grow vertically.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,120
That's not that hard. That's one pound.

21
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,840
Well, no. That's unreasonable.

22
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,580
get some lifts in your shoes. It's not growing, man. You have the 30 day

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,300
vertical, the 30 day vertical challenge. No, and also you need to grow width

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,100
wise and you need to grow personally because you are a broken person. If

25
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,240
you're that thin as a man. At the very least, if you're a fucking small shirt

26
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:48,500
size as a man, order a large and wear it as a baggy sleep shirt. Yes. Wear it

27
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,980
like where the sleeves go over your wrist. Don't admit to people who aren't

28
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:56,680
we're afraid to tell it like it is, that you are small, yes, because we'll tell

29
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,680
it like it is. We're going to we're not afraid to tell it and don't say, oh, I

30
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,300
ordered it for my dog. I ordered it for my baby pet turtle. We know,

31
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,600
motherfucker, yeah, are you not dropping twenty bucks on a you're not dropping

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,960
twenty bucks on a gift for a girl. If you are wearing a swag, nineteen shirt,

33
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,940
you are not ordering a shirt for your girlfriend. No, no girl wants to wear

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,900
that terrible. I sure know girls don't like us. Let's tell like it is.

35
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,660
let's tell it like it is now that all the shirts are sold, accounted for and

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:30,060
gone out of our lives. That's gotta be the worst shirt I've ever seen in my

37
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,940
fucking life. I cannot believe you're wearing this shirt. Who the fuck? What

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,320
is wrong with you people? We did this as a joke. You're on notice, Noah. Noah

39
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,900
made that one as a prank. The point of this, this shirt is supposed to be a

40
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,820
spacer in your dresser door. Yeah, yeah. It's just to separate the color and the

41
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,420
shirt. You pick that shirt up, it's paper thin. You're going to put your finger in it.

42
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,420
All the shirts come with dry rot.

43
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,420
It's shit.

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,420
These are the worst shirts.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,580
We got the cheapest brand in the world.

46
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,180
We're telling it like it is. The logo on the back, they made it too small.

47
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,180
It's tiny.

48
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,180
They made it way too small.

49
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,340
And while we're telling it like it is, T-shirt printing company, I don't think we can say

50
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,340
their name.

51
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,340
Don't remember their name.

52
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:14,300
Don't remember their name, but if I did, you know what? You made us pay too much.

53
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:19,800
But also, and also, I well, you know, if we're telling it like it is, I did pay

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:24,600
that bill probably four times, eight, no, about eight months late.

55
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:32,500
All right. Yeah, so that's fine actually. Yeah, so it's okay. Also, I, when they

56
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,040
were making the shirts, they posted it on their Instagram story and they posted a

57
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,240
post of it and it said the one and only shirt and then I said, "Fuck these guys

58
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:46,880
we're stealing our design and then found out it was the t shirt printing. Are

59
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,400
you for real? I remember that

60
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,980
talking about bro and I was like, oh whoops, but that was the night that was

61
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,760
the night as if also like show, I think as if anybody would fucking steal that

62
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,800
design. No, was it like a design? No, yeah, they would it's got to be the

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,940
worst shirt ever man. Well, it's you know, literally the worst shirt of all

64
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,120
time, keeping it real. The next one, it's going to be even worse.

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,260
we're not a clothing for all or no less funny, no you were colors also to be

66
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,200
white on why two years after the after the pandemic happened, we're making this

67
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,100
shirt. What's wrong with us? Millions of people died. Let's go, let's go. It's

68
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,460
not funny to joke about. I would never joke about this shit. Let's go even

69
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,060
let's make an even more dated reference shirt. Somehow, let's make a shirt about

70
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:38,640
Obama's second term. Yeah, something like that. Let's make sure about my

71
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,480
residents black by Lambos blue. Yeah, let's send out that sure and charge

72
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,080
people thirty dollars thirty thousand dollars. Yeah, no thirty bucks. Yeah,

73
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,920
wow and no international shipping. We're going to try to fuck you guys over at

74
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,920
every single Canada, Canada and Mexico. We have to do that. We still have to

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:00,640
ship those shirts. They're sitting right at Canadians. I'm not shipping the

76
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,480
fucking Canadian

77
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:07,040
and always since we're keeping it real. You guys in Canada. I dare you to try to

78
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:11,480
come over. You have no legal recourse. We're in a different country. Do something.

79
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,800
What are you gonna do? Fuck off. Yeah. Yeah. We actually love all of you.

80
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,920
Nah. No. You're not telling it like it is. You fucking fell for it. You are not.

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,500
See, but that's not... Sarcasm and lying is not telling it like it is,

82
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:27,080
even if you're trying to be funny. You gotta be straight up. It's to bolster

83
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,680
a point

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,880
that I made. Well, it didn't work. The point, you didn't make a point.

85
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,200
Well, I'm keeping it real. You're no point at all. He has been mean to me

86
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:41,040
lately. I've been mean to you. Wow. What did I do today? I don't want to even get

87
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,560
into it.

88
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,240
What did I do today? It's not even today. It's every day this week. You made me

89
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,680
your slave yesterday. What did I do yesterday? I saw you for 30 seconds

90
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,840
yesterday. That's actually true. I had to stay in here. You're like, "I paid

91
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,640
you." You have to wait. I paid you to walk my dog and you think that's

92
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,520
It was 15 minutes, you made $20?

93
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,340
Indentured servitude.

94
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,820
I thought I was doing you a favor.

95
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:11,200
You're always like, "I'm so broke, I can't even afford a fucking sandwich."

96
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Rudeness right now.

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
You started saying that I slaved you.

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,640
Rudeness is okay on the telling it like it is.

99
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,840
Rudeness, also, you said I slaved you.

100
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,760
That is too much, man.

101
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,760
That's too fucking far.

102
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
I actually had a good time with Phil.

103
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,520
I know, and you got paid for it.

104
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,000
So I made your day better.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,880
It was better.

106
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,200
I didn't have to do any bull crap.

107
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,700
Oh wait, I just thought of something to tell it like it is actually.

108
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,700
It just happened to me right before we started recording.

109
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,200
What happened?

110
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Went to the bodega to buy this Gatorade.

111
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,700
It said $3 on the thing.

112
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,200
Yeah, don't tell me.

113
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,700
I gave him $3 cash.

114
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,200
The guy said, "You have 50 cents?"

115
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,700
I said, "No, I don't have 50 cents."

116
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,700
He charged you tax on the cash?

117
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,700
I said, "No, I don't have 50 cents."

118
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,700
And he said, "Okay."

119
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,700
And he let me pay $3 for it.

120
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,200
But I still don't like him.

121
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,280
Yeah, because he tried to charge me fifty cents. Buddy, if you're, if you need

122
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,560
fifty cents, if you want fifty cents from me, how about you walk outside on

123
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,800
the corner and dingle jangle a cup around? That's right. I'm not carrying

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,640
quarters to the store. No, I'm not like, "Oh, this guy probably needs quarters."

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,920
You're the one who gives me quarters. And he's grumpy all the time and he

126
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,280
has a bad attitude in general. Dude, these... I hate that. I hate when

127
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,220
they're not jolly and they don't give me stuff for free. And doesn't call me

128
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,760
boss, he barely talks. Here's all you boss. No. Here's the... Not Bobby,

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:29,440
I have the different store. They call me boss. There's two things that I'd like

130
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,280
to say. Number one, I hate when they're grumpy. Number two, I hate when they're

131
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,620
too happy. No, I like the worst job in the world. What are you doing? Like it?

132
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,440
Yeah, act accordingly. The guy today I put on my prime energy drink and he

133
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,080
goes, I love prime. I was like, what? And he's like, I love prime. I've tried

134
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,800
every flavor. Oh, that is weird. Dude, that's not happy though. That's that's

135
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,320
weird. He gave me this weird sexual smile. Yeah, that's he was like I love

136
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,320
prime. If it's sexual, it is weird. And I said, I don't even like this shit

137
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:05,620
buddy. Yeah, I fucking hate this shit. I hate, but I have to drink it. I

138
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,780
hate bulgogi. I'm buying it to stimulate the local economy. That's the only

139
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,720
reason I'm buying it. You bought bulgogi at the bodega? No, I ate bulgogi

140
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,420
and had a fruited sour ale last night. That's why I need this prime right

141
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,220
now, because my body is hating every part of myself. Yeah.

142
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,160
I pooped massively. You know what I did? I made a pretty good meal last night.

143
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,280
What'd you make? Probably worms. Yeah, it was worms and dirt. That doesn't

144
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:29,960
sound good.

145
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,100
That sounds like... No, no, no. You think that it comes out on the...

146
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:39,560
Like I pulled the... Whatever it's called. The top? Yeah. Yeah. I pulled

147
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,660
that open and it's worms and dirt, but then you look closely,

148
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,360
Oreo crumbs, chocolate pudding. Brown gummy worms. Sour gummy worm, yep.

149
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,420
You see, but that I hate when people do that kind of shit because gummy worms

150
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:55,180
do not belong with chocolate. No, they don't. No, they really don't. You don't

151
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,740
it's just that they have to make what they have to do. Chocolate worm,

152
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,100
chocolate worm. They gotta make a chocolate worm or a frosting worm. Leave

153
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,700
the Oreos, leave Oreos intact. Stop crushing these. No, no, no, no. Ice

154
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,420
cream. What about ice cream? Just fucking make a normal ice cream. I do not

155
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,220
want the little white parts of Oreos. He's wearing the glasses today because

156
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,300
doesn't want anyone to see him cry. I'm hungover and these are my... You had one

157
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:26,380
beer and you're hungover? Buddy, if you think I had one beer, then you are wrong.

158
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:34,700
You had two, three? I had three beers. And I'm so hungover I can barely even speak.

159
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:39,460
That is light work. Damn. I do like it. For an alcoholic like me, that's light work.

160
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,980
We're getting kind of drunk AF yesterday, all of us maybe. Yeah, me and Cam had...

161
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,420
I had a beer and I had a margarita and I had some champagne.

162
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,860
Whoa, celebration time.

163
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,020
You were having a celebration.

164
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,500
I was basically having a little celebration.

165
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:00,420
I had champagne and I bought a pack of GVICs because they're $8 and me and Noah have them.

166
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,880
I'm going to tell it like it is.

167
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,740
You like saying GVIC more than you like drinking it.

168
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,180
It's a good enough beer.

169
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:11,220
I'm sorry to tell it like it is, but I had to right then.

170
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,080
it's good enough that to justify the fact that you get you would never you would

171
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,920
never you would never say you would never get the name of another pack of

172
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,220
beer. You were buying you would never be like yeah. I bought a six pack of

173
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,420
Miller Highlight. I would say that I would say the brand every time. No, you

174
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,520
wouldn't I would say it now. It's a in a cute way.

175
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:34,420
I guess I mean I got some parties.

176
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:43,220
would say I got my Modellies. My Gansets. Gansets you would also say that. My Pacificos. You

177
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:52,280
sounded Jamaican. Pacificos. That's not Jamaican. That doesn't sound, it sounded more like a

178
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,100
cinnamon stick. Do you think I even know where Jamaica is? It's on the plain of existence.

179
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,700
Is it an island? Barely. It makes some good ass, fire ass music. Let's go in on Jamaica

180
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,580
real quick. Okay. Jamaica, your jerk chicken is too good and your music's awesome.

181
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:10,220
Yeah, Jamaica, stop jerking these chickens around.

182
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,420
Yep. And maybe jerk your political leaders around to get some stability in your country.

183
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,220
And let's... And enough with the ganja. Let's... And let's get the music...

184
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,980
Drop the weed, man.

185
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,620
Enough with the ganja. Let's get the music to be a little more... Let's get the rhythm

186
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,620
a little more regular. I don't want to hear any of that dun, da, da, dun, any like swingy stuff,

187
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:31,580
just, you know, four, four. Yeah. And stop making drums out of metal.

188
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,580
Yeah, nobody wants to hear about a metal drum. That drum should be a bowl.

189
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,380
That drum should be beating out of that drum. That is what you should be.

190
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:43,020
Yeah, stick to the good. You guys make good food. Put the food in the metal drum.

191
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:48,300
Steel drums. I'm going to steal your drum and give you a normal one with a sheepskin thing on it.

192
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:54,540
The steel drum should be a place where you can steal drumsticks from. It should be where

193
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,180
they put a bunch of bowl of different chicken. Drumsticks of jerk chicken.

194
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,540
Yeah, dude. Dude, just so much shit is pissing me off, man.

195
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,100
Yeah, I'm effed.

196
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:07,180
I'm effed in my pee.

197
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,860
I'm effed in my pee right now.

198
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,180
I'm effed right in my pee.

199
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:13,260
And I'm speaking of being pissed off,

200
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:18,620
the landlord keeps yelling at me because I don't like to lock up the gate

201
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,020
because the kids are going to come in here and do graffiti.

202
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,260
Apparently, I ain't Mark Maron, motherfucker.

203
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,860
Leave me alone.

204
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,420
We're a different podcast.

205
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,420
We're not locking the gates.

206
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,740
That's what he's getting so mad he's saying.

207
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,740
I see you do a podcast.

208
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Lock that gate.

209
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,820
Yeah, you're doing WTM with Mark Maron, you're not locking the gate.

210
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,820
Nobody's going to know.

211
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:41,300
Honestly, they think that I'm Mark Maron because of my attitude and my musical tastes.

212
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,860
I don't want to lock the gate because I like to look out and see when the kids go into

213
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:47,700
our little area and I want to go out with a baseball bat.

214
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,700
You like to shake the broom at them.

215
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,020
With a bunch of nails nailed into it.

216
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,820
We've got to get your corn broom here.

217
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,540
Oh, so we can shoo him away?

218
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
We can shoo him away.

219
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,540
Shoo!

220
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:56,540
Oh my God.

221
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:04,040
God, they get off the bus, they go stand. I don't know why they stand there. It's a sidewalk and then they just stand inside the fence.

222
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:11,240
It's always also a sidewalk. It's a VIP section. They think they're in the VIP section. We should bring out some sparklers and some champagne.

223
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:17,040
I want to hiss at them through the window. I want to buy them beer. They seem cool. You know what we should do is put an alarm on the gate.

224
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,040
So whenever it opens it goes "doot doot doot". Yeah, but we can't shut off the alarm. Just hop the fence whenever we need to get in.

225
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,040
I was saying that fancy is hoppable. If someone's going to do graffiti, they're going to fucking do it.

226
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,040
If someone wants to write, they're going to fucking write.

227
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
And who are we to stop them?

228
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,040
I think we should lay down turf in here.

229
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
That's a good idea.

230
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
I honestly have thought about that three or four times.

231
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Anytime I'm at Home Depot and I see that big roll of turf, I say, "Buddy, how much for the whole thing?"

232
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
At least a quarter of it.

233
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,040
Let's just do a half mini golf thing.

234
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,040
Yeah, Patches got you that for Christmas last year.

235
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,080
set up a mini golf, a mini golf, that is a good idea,

236
00:13:54,080 --> 00:14:00,240
black light mini golf in here. Why can't we put turf in here? You completely

237
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,720
can't. There's no reason. It's just a rug. It's just a rug. There's no reason

238
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,240
we can't.

239
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,580
We could put turf everywhere in here. Let's put turf on the walls too. Yeah,

240
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:14,620
oh my God. Let's make this a green room. Box. Green box. Green box and then

241
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,040
we sell, I mean I don't condone it, but I would sell it to make

242
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,040
2020. You know we need to get we need to get a big green turf backdrop here and

243
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,540
we need to get podcasts about list and a pink neon right there. Oh my God,

244
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:31,940
switch these out for SM seven bees. The sure Mike's. Yeah, I need to. We do

245
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,540
need some of those. We need to and then we need to talk. We need to have a

246
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,240
bunch of women on here. Only fans. Yeah, I'd ask them what they think about if

247
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,640
you think food goes bad. Yeah, and they're like, I don't really know. I

248
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,180
felt is it if a woman gets ripped in half? Yeah, that's what I asked. Is it

249
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:53,220
the rippers fault and all the girls are like the rippers father ever and one of

250
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:53,720
the girls,

251
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:00,220
the girls fault actually, yeah, she knows what's like that's that's a bit

252
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,080
that's a good friends with the ripper and I know that he's actually do it on

253
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,340
purpose, but when the cameras are off there, Jack, the rippers actually a

254
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:11,980
really nice guy. He actually he subs to my only fans. Whoa,

255
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:18,300
what jack the rib on shell these days, jack the ripper probably would be

256
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,580
and he'd probably instead of he'd been only fans model, he'd be ripping his

257
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:28,140
fucking dick off. Exactly. He'd be jacking and ripping his own cock off

258
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:31,620
because he'd be jackling so much of the a ripper. They didn't have any

259
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:35,180
pornography back then. Do you ever think about how in this in the did

260
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:39,540
nineteen? It was all wood carvings. They've had pornography for all of

261
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,560
human or not. He has probably they've had drawings. They've had it since the

262
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,060
cave time. You're being a you're being very obtuse. Right? They had pornography

263
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,060
in cave times. And back then it was why I'm just because you can't nobody's

264
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,740
coming to a stick figure. Well, yeah, they are. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

265
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,140
no. Just stick figures with two boobs or just a red blot. And that was for

266
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,500
stability. Idols that people made in like Mesopotamia. That's like the

267
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,180
earliest human civilization. They're making fucking. They're making masses of

268
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,980
of their pantomime is little like things like this. Nobody's jacking off to

269
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,860
that. That was just that was an homage to the beauty of the female form.

270
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,220
That's a hundred percent. No, no, no, no, no, you have a dirty mind.

271
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,100
That's what all hundred thousand years. That's what you're someone like you

272
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,940
was going to say that about only fans. So you're going to say that

273
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,740
wasn't for jacking off. I won't exist asshole. I said someone like you,

274
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,300
dickhead. I will die. There will never be another person like you. You have

275
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,740
no listening comprehension. Nope, I do. No, you don't. You're a hypocrite.

276
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,780
You ruined my point. You ruined my point because you wanted to be. No,

277
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,020
no, I didn't have a point. That wasn't the point I was trying to make.

278
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,060
that wasn't the point I was trying to make you are. Honestly, you belong in a

279
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,420
high school debate team. That's like the level of annoying. You are you do do

280
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,340
some debate stuff. Yeah, you do have that kind of talking. You told me I was

281
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:51,620
wrong, so I told you I was right. No, see that's a high school debate team.

282
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,020
Yeah, I'm telling it and I have to be the moderator. Here's a point. I was

283
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:57,700
trying to always have to be the moderator. Here's what you do. Here's

284
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,220
the point I was trying to make. I don't even get to debate before you were

285
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:06,080
statues yeah is that if it was the eighteen hundreds and you had no porn

286
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,080
who among us wouldn't start just randomly killing women and eating their

287
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,200
breasts and their asses.

288
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:19,140
You see what I was trying to get at it's a it is a good point yeah, because if

289
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:22,360
you didn't have yeah, who's to say I don't know I don't know if I would have

290
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:25,280
read honestly tell you that the reason I wanted to argue with you so much is

291
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,920
because of those glasses yeah, it's making me mad to look at you. Well, it is

292
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,640
You have a Bud Light hat on, so. He does not have a Bud Light hat on.

293
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,640
You're the one with the Bud Light hat. He has a Mexico hat on.

294
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,640
Oh, it's the colors.

295
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,640
(laughter)

296
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,640
It kind of looks like Bud Light.

297
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,640
If we're keeping it real right now,

298
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,640
still, he got mad at me

299
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
for my new hat that I'm wearing.

300
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
This hat pisses me off. He called me a poser,

301
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
but I just want to point out, for a whole year,

302
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
he wore a Frog Skateboards

303
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,640
beanie. I thought it was for that.

304
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,640
You have never

305
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,640
I have a skateboard right over there.

306
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's break this down. Hold on. Let's break this down. What did you just say? Frog, skateboards,

307
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,720
beanie. I don't skateboard, but I like frogs and I wear beanies. So how's that me being a poser?

308
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,640
Two out of three. This is a golfing hat. Yeah. I like hats. I don't golf. 50% is more.

309
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:29,160
I don't golf and I do like old English fonts, which is on here. That's 52%. That's 52. You

310
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,200
don't go. You know what? How about right now? I have I have a skateboard right

311
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,880
over there. I have a skateboard right over there. We're going to turn the

312
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,600
camera. We're going to see if you can Ollie right now. Fuck you, man. I'll do

313
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,160
this right now.

314
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,040
All right.

315
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,440
No, he's doing the camera. No, no, you have to point. He has to point the

316
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,120
camera at you.

317
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:56,120
Yeah, so Caleb is getting the skateboard. He's standing next to it.

318
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,320
Okay, put one foot onto it. He's bending down as if he's winded.

319
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,520
He looks like he's going to throw up. Maybe his hands are above just above

320
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,820
his knee. Okay, second foot on. He's wobbling a lot. He's really wobbling.

321
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,120
He looks like a snow angel.

322
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,820
He's got a beautiful stance.

323
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,620
He is falling off the skateboard without trying to do a trick.

324
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:22,620
I'm just narrating here. No, no, no, no.

325
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,200
Okay, so he's still, he's doing again a star type pose.

326
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,520
All right.

327
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,360
- No.

328
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,880
- No, I don't know really.

329
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,880
- You didn't even leave the ground.

330
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
- Okay, so he's getting back on.

331
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,400
Okay, he's almost destroyed our printer.

332
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,560
You should move that, fix the printer.

333
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,720
Fix the printer before you sit down.

334
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,840
- Oh my God, he knocked the printer over.

335
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,040
- The printer completely almost fell over.

336
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,960
- Yeah, we almost lost the fucking printer.

337
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,100
the printer. I just spent a hundred dollars on yeah. We almost just lost

338
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,320
the printer, but okay, can you imagine I guess Caleb,

339
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,820
Caleb did the most eleven year old.

340
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:06,740
I'm saying

341
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,360
I had to do it at I'm not saying no, I'm to see you read at an

342
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,480
eleven year old. I'm saying I'm saying you did it. I'm saying you did it. I

343
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,520
know, but you had to add all these qualifiers to make me feel

344
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,340
obtuse. I didn't make you feel obtuse.

345
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,280
Eleven year old, maybe

346
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,760
maybe I learned a new word what it's so wrong to learn new words. Yeah, you

347
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,440
really like this. I'm being sexually harassed today by you to know because I

348
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,160
decided that I want to have three D glasses on it really is so terrible.

349
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:40,360
It's genuinely is. I don't want to look at you. You again are out of frame. You

350
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,800
need to move in. It's hurting

351
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,720
the vibe.

352
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,280
There is a divide. You are so with you

353
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:59,880
right now. So see, I'd like to see you hit a 90-yard drive. I could maybe hit a 30-yard

354
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,080
drive. No, no, no, no. You would hit the golf ball five inches behind the ball. You'd hit

355
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,640
the ground so hard you'd break your hand. I actually, for my brother's bachelor party,

356
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,040
I did, we just like went to one of those like drive, like it was a,

357
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,920
I guess a driving range, but it was, it was just a fucking piece of wood that

358
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,680
everyone stood on and hit balls towards the field. That's a driving, that's a

359
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,000
driving, that's what a driving range is. That is exactly a driving range. Yeah.

360
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,080
Well, it wasn't. You're thinking Topgolf. Yeah, it wasn't in like a place, so I

361
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,440
was like, oh, okay. Like there weren't, there wasn't any. That's basically what a

362
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,440
driving range is. Yeah, you can set one up yourself. Well, then I've been to a

363
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,760
driving range and I've done an adequate job there.

364
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,440
I would love to work at a driving range. I'd be the guy that collects the balls.

365
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,080
You're in that armored, you're in the kill dozer driving around collecting the balls,

366
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,080
listening to classic rock.

367
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,760
You are basically a gopher if that is your job.

368
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,880
What? You're thinking, you're doing Caddyshack?

369
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,360
Oh yeah. I've actually never seen Caddyshack.

370
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
You've never seen Caddyshack?

371
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
No.

372
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,360
They were playing it at the dentist one time.

373
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,600
very funny. It's one of those things like the Blues Brothers where it's like your

374
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,400
dad's like, "Oh, this is the funniest thing in the world." And you watch it and it's

375
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,440
just two fucking guys just like... Yeah, blades of glory. Yeah, blades of glory is

376
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,120
funny though. My dad was like, "This is the funniest movie ever." That's good. But I

377
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
watched it and I was like, "This is a little bit lowbrow maybe." Yeah. Don't you

378
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,720
think? I was never too big a fan of lowbrow humor. I don't like lowbrow stuff.

379
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,080
Until I found out about poop jokes. Yep. Everything changed for me. Until I found

380
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,240
about British accents and then I was like okay that's I like that quite a bit more.

381
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,720
Yeah the Blues Brothers is I guess the movie is good but the sketch on SNL one

382
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,680
of those brothers turned blue. Yep. Yeah. From a speedball. Is that what happened

383
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,040
to him? Yeah he did a speedball and just fucking farted. Farted to death. That's a

384
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:01,600
bad way to go. John Belushi farted to death. That's so awful. Yeah. I hate hearing that.

385
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:08,300
Uh-huh. And when he farted, it was so loud that it clapped his stomach to his skin.

386
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,300
You're kidding.

387
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,300
No, and it popped like a balloon.

388
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,300
Oh, God.

389
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,300
Yeah.

390
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Oh, my Lord.

391
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,300
You know, the sound it made was exactly like a whip cracking.

392
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,000
Can you imagine if you farted really loud and you looked in the mirror and your butt

393
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
was red?

394
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
[laughter]

395
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,700
Yeah, like a, just around your, like getting a little less red as it goes far away from

396
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,800
on your ass cheeks like oh my God, like a chemical like you just got spanked

397
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,840
like yeah, yeah, yeah, spanked by your own fart

398
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,920
and it's it's your pants slap against your

399
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:51,140
do this fucking like that's that's why I don't think I'd ever wear leather

400
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,600
pants,

401
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,400
not because I don't think I wouldn't look good in them, but no, like you'd

402
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,860
look so good and leather farting in a pair of leather pants. I bet sounds one

403
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,260
sounds insane and two is like I don't know it like you're already your nuts

404
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:09,340
and your penis or in a sous vide in there in the summer time. I bet if the leather

405
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,900
pants are tight enough too, you could see the entire fart travel all the way down

406
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,620
the pant leg to your shoe. Definitely. I don't get why these rock stars wear them.

407
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:22,040
They're probably, you know, with a rock star's diet, they eat fucking heart

408
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:27,980
dargs and beer all the time. It's because it's cow sacrifice. Oh yeah, that makes

409
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,040
complete and total. They want to sacrifice animals. I want to see a movie like

410
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,080
Inside Out about a bunch of farts trapped in some pants like that. Yeah. Yeah. And

411
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,680
they have to work together to get down the leg to go back in the butt. Better out

412
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,840
than in. That would also maybe be a good Shrek reference. Maybe be a good video

413
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,080
game where it's like you have to travel down the leg and it's an alternate path

414
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,560
where you can either go down the leg and get out of the cuff down there or maybe

415
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:54,760
you can go find like a key and you can unlock the fly. You can like come back

416
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:00,660
like a metroidvania. Okay, the fly. Yes. Yeah, you want to go, but then but then

417
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:04,260
people, oh, that's kind of a prank, though. What is people think that you

418
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,860
got your dick and balls smell like a fart if it comes out of your fly? Yeah,

419
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:13,760
I guess that is a little key turn and then the why unzip from the inside.

420
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,460
That is one of the worst putting those on pants. The worst things that your

421
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:24,660
penis and balls could smell like is a fart and mine do pretty much because of

422
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:29,600
just the way I sit. I would pay money to have a corrective surgery that points my

423
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:37,360
asshole like 15 degrees further towards my back so that farts would not feed below

424
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,640
my balls and make my balls go up. What are these for right here? Your butt cheeks?

425
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,820
No, the two dimples that you get in your back. I've never had that because I've

426
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:50,520
never been skinny. I had those. I had those. But the thing about it, those could

427
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,280
be rerouted. Yeah, you could reroute all your so you have three holes while you

428
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,720
have your two fart holes like it's a car exhaust. Okay, and then that is like

429
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,240
your like your

430
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,040
yeah, now that I'm thinking about it goes your butthole is where the dipstick

431
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:09,600
comes. It would be nice for it would be nice and for farting that put your butt

432
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,640
further up on your back when you had to shit. It would be really bad. Well, no,

433
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,960
no, no, no, no, no, but hold the butthole is still for poop. It's just these are

434
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,160
now exhaust. All right, I'd like to read it on the human body right now. Yeah, I

435
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,260
I think it's time we do it again. Yeah, we've done that before. I don't think so,

436
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,740
but okay, so if I was evolution or God, depending on if you ask a dumb person or

437
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,260
a smart person, yeah, I would put the asshole directly in the middle of the

438
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,400
center of the palm like Iron Man. Okay, and you would yeah, you can because then

439
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,900
it becomes twofold. Number one, it's a built in defense mechanism. You can shit

440
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,800
and fart in people's faces and you could literally control cover somebody's mouth

441
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
and shit into their

442
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
like

443
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:51,760
like that as you shit into their mouth or sleepovers would be so bad growing up.

444
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,200
Oh, my God, and imagine if you're about to if you have like a huge shit coming

445
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,800
up, you could see it coming down your arm. That'd be so awesome. Like a vein

446
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,960
we were adding out, we're adding like a transparent window that goes up. Yeah,

447
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,400
forearm. Well, it'd be like those videos of like body builders or they flex on

448
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,840
their veins pop, but you just you see blood, but then also you see one big

449
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:16,240
kind of log of do do one turd. Yeah, yeah, and then I think the if you like

450
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
eating poop, it would be a lot easier to sneak that.

451
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Penis probably in the fingertip like Scary Movie 3.

452
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,280
That honestly, when I saw that as a kid,

453
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,280
when I saw that guy with Leslie Nielsen pee out of his finger,

454
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,280
I thought to myself, that would make life so much easier.

455
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
Here's my argument against that. Penis in the finger.

456
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:38,280
Number one, it's too exposed.

457
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,280
Yeah, I think you'll hurt your whole point of view.

458
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:43,280
No, no, it's still the finger. Just the urethra is rerouted too.

459
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Oh, so just peeing?

460
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,580
you're just paying yeah. So peeing goes through the finger, but then why does

461
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,320
might as well just make it one hole like girls have and just shoot all your

462
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,600
shows. That's the guys have the urethra on the finger. Girls just shoot it all

463
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,120
out of their palm, pussy, but

464
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,000
okay, their pussies on their hand urethra for guys guys. Guys have a

465
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
normal. No, their balls are their their

466
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,080
hanging below their wrists. Yeah, no balls should be inside your body in the

467
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,760
middle of your chest, like a resident evil, but the ball should be on the

468
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:16,800
opposite side of your heart. It should be mirror. One is your heart and one is your two balls.

469
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,840
Oh yeah, so then like people can, if your finger is really long and your balls are here,

470
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:27,880
people can, you know, you can brag about how close your balls are to your arm. So like

471
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:35,000
having a short arm would be like a flex. What are you saying? A flex would be I have a short

472
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,160
arm yeah, why in this world, because that means you're

473
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:44,240
that means that it's closer to your your finger is close to your balls. Is

474
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,760
that something you think people brag about is my people people now no, so my

475
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:53,500
my logic here is that people brag about how big their dicks are now do so in

476
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:59,000
this world in this world. It's people are bragging about how short their arm

477
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,240
is, but why

478
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,820
so they can when they brag about how big their finger is no, no, because

479
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,160
fingers are all the same size and also another thing that I would say is that

480
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,340
smaller would be better. Exactly, the smaller it is, the better it is, but

481
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,320
then if you have like a little like arm like this, it's like damn, you think

482
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,000
guys would get surgery to just have their hands sitting on their tiny arm.

483
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,840
He's got that little chicken and he walking around that tiny. He got that

484
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,080
would it be like way? I was supposed to be like how you know, someone says, oh,

485
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,240
you have big feet, you have a big dick. Yeah. So is it like that? Maybe you have

486
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,960
a short arm. It means you have strong balls or something. Yeah, exactly.

487
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,680
Exactly. It means your balls are so strong. That's what you should have said

488
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:43,360
exactly, too. Yeah, it seems like you just wanted to do just anything he said

489
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,920
that would have justified that you were gonna go. Yeah, exactly that. Well,

490
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,000
think of another reason.

491
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,840
I mean, there is almost no reason. There's no... That was random. What I

492
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,120
said made no sense. Think of one other... Think of another thing, then. Short

493
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,620
arm is cool because

494
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:01,480
because you can wear different shirts. Yeah, actually, you know exactly I've

495
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:01,980
been thinking about

496
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:04,340
sometime.

497
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:09,120
What'd you say? I've been thinking about a one side tank top for a while. Yeah,

498
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,080
maybe that would be a real style.

499
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:16,560
What does that mean? She wears like a half of a tank top. I thought that other

500
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,560
part of her arm. I forgot about her. Yeah, I think that's

501
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,960
And they're not casting her because she was so hard to work with.

502
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
Anya Taylor-Joy.

503
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,800
Charlie's Throne was hard to work with.

504
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:32,040
Yeah, if you ask Tom Hardy and a bunch of fucking mutant fuckers in the desert,

505
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,480
yeah, she's a bitch.

506
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,440
That was the that was the message of that movie.

507
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,840
So basically she's a bitch.

508
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,520
Yeah. Even in the desert, women are going to nag you.

509
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,280
They want water and a fucking bitch.

510
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:49,200
They want to have babies or something.

511
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:53,240
Yeah, they want to escape from sex slavery. Yeah, well,

512
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:59,940
yeah, simple is as simple does I get that movie. I like mix up what that

513
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,940
movie was about with

514
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,840
what's that movie City of God? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's Brazil,

515
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,440
Brazil. What's the one that I'm thinking of you think live?

516
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:16,440
Children of men, children of men, children of men. I get what the point

517
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,520
of their children of man. Yeah, that that kind of that is to me the least

518
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:25,600
interesting, least terrifying apocalypse thing. Children of men is like, oh, no,

519
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,800
we can't have a baby's. I don't give a fuck. You got a lot of time left to

520
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:33,240
fuck around. Yeah, I did like that movie, though. I saw for the first time

521
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,800
when I lived with Neil. Also, no, never have to use a condom ever again. Oh,

522
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:42,560
never have to pull out. All right, never. And also let's go. Plan. Parenthood

523
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,800
it goes away to this is perfect. This is ideal. This is utopia. What's the

524
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:51,440
scariest apocalypse? Scariest apocalypse is probably come out of the earth.

525
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,800
Yeah, or bad.

526
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:59,880
Honestly, the scariest one to me is that we, this entire planet is a single

527
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,880
molecule and then one day somebody in the

528
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,120
four realities, a big finger is the scariest one. Galactus. A big finger

529
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,620
because you don't even think it's a finger. Yeah, dragons dragons dragons

530
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,820
don't scare dragons. What about black skeleton? We've beaten dragons before

531
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,320
and we'll beat him again. That's what I said. That's what the 1400s is. We'll

532
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,420
send those fuckers back to their caves. I wonder if every dinosaur that ever

533
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:29,120
lived came back to the earth. If we could defeat them, if every dinosaur

534
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,820
came back to earth for defeating the dry, they come back out of the earth.

535
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,120
Oh, wait, so it's dinosaurs versus dragons. That's not what I was saying,

536
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:40,660
but that's thank you so much for defeating dragon. No, that's what

537
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:44,280
happened. That's a velociraptor. Now we can get normal job. That's what

538
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,120
happened when we get rid of Planned Parenthood. They come on and be like,

539
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,080
thank you. Thank you. We have to hide away.

540
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:55,320
Thank you. You destroy our eggs. We're finally back. You defeated evil.

541
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,720
We're back and we're all vegetarian.

542
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,160
It's a new and guess what now we can fossil fuels no more. You can write us

543
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,600
Now we can go back to doing what we've always wanted to do, lay eggs inside of human women.

544
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,680
I want to fuck a white woman.

545
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
Where the white women at?

546
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Where are they?

547
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:15,680
Popping out of Loch Ness.

548
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,680
Oh there goes my watch.

549
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,680
Oh it's 101.

550
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,680
Whoa.

551
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,680
You have an alarm set for 101?

552
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
I fucking guess so.

553
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
I don't know these are.

554
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Big fan of Zoey.

555
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,680
This guy.

556
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Big fan of Zoey 101.

557
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
No I don't.

558
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Dan Schneider fan.

559
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
I don't give a shit about Zoey 101.

560
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,680
You give a shit about Dan Schneider.

561
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,680
I don't give a shit about Zoey 101.

562
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
I don't give a shit about Zoey 101.

563
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
I don't give a shit about Zoey 101.

564
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
I don't give a shit about Zoey 101.

565
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:38,600
Dan Schneider. You don't care? I mean I care. I care about her as a person. She went through a lot.

566
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,040
Everyone hates her because she was trying to keep Britney Spears in a conservatorship or whatever

567
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,760
and then like Britney Spears started posting just like pictures of her like full butthole.

568
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,600
What? And everyone was like all right. There's pictures of Britney Spears's butthole? No she's

569
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,160
just posting weird stuff. Oh. You can't. Your full butthole is a pretty good example of a weird thing

570
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,800
thing to do, even though it is a I'm blowing it. I haven't seen I have tried

571
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,440
so hard to avoid seeing my asshole the last couple of years, yeah, and I have

572
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:11,960
not seen it in a long time. What if there's a pretty easy not to see it?

573
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:15,960
There's a video that my wife showed me the other day. You have me in college

574
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,000
where she's videoing me like cooking something and she's like try it. She's

575
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,760
like, yeah, I'm going to send this to my parents or something like, yeah, here's

576
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,080
us in the new apartment and I just bend over and I spread my ass.

577
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,820
know it and it's got to be one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen.

578
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,000
Why were your pants off? They weren't I pulled my pants down and moon it at the

579
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
camera and you have to do that. She can't show it to her parents.

580
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,560
Everyone's one you have to show. Yeah, you have to assert dominance over your

581
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,920
wife by showing

582
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:48,640
your brown asshole. I think that's what I got a brown dude. That's what I got to

583
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,360
do. My girlfriend's addicted to the new Zelda game. You're just going to walk

584
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:55,640
right in front of the camera in front of the drop it, drop the drop the and you

585
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:59,000
have to do it in front of the TV. The TV, that's the funniest place to do it.

586
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,040
The funniest place to do it. And also, they don't look away.

587
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,560
They like it.

588
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,460
They look into it like it's the... They look into it, they see their future.

589
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:12,000
It's the Ark of the Covenant. The Eye of Sauron. Yeah. They look in and

590
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,480
they get a better example. That's a better example, yeah. For weeks afterward,

591
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,720
they close their eyes and they see it staring at them. Their eyes roll back

592
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:22,760
in their heads. They orgasm instantly, I'll say. That's a trick. Yeah, my

593
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,160
girlfriend's so addicted to that new Zelda game that it's literally like,

594
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,260
like if they were trying to make a commercial in the 90s about video game

595
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:34,260
addiction, I've just been lying to her. I've just been telling her,

596
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,060
I was like, my mom was just an extra in a movie.

597
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:39,560
She's just like, oh, yeah.

598
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:45,760
Yeah, this has been the year where girls have started playing video games.

599
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:51,160
Hogwarts. Hogwarts. I know somebody whose girlfriend played Hogwarts.

600
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,660
he woke up at five in the morning and he walked into his living room and she was playing Hogwarts.

601
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,900
She had been up until five in the morning.

602
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:02,220
Dude, I've been going to bed so early and then I wake up because she's coming to bed

603
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,420
at like two in the morning because she's like, "Yeah, I just got the fucking, I just built

604
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,460
like some weird shit."

605
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,460
You know what she would love?

606
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,460
She loves the Zelda games.

607
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,460
You know what she would love?

608
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,500
Like a baby bottle with some warm milk in it.

609
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,460
I think maybe a leap pad might be really fun.

610
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,900
I'm going to go into the YouTube app. One of those spinner things that teaches you what

611
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,580
animals say. Cocoa Melon. Oh, she would love Cocoa Melon if she likes that game. Yeah.

612
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:31,700
You need to get her on Doom Eternal. I've been trying to get her into, what's that,

613
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:39,220
Manhunt Twisted Metal. Yeah, Manhunt. Your girlfriend's staying up every night. That

614
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:43,460
would honestly worry me. What is that? If I can play Manhunt all day or if a friend

615
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:49,040
of mine plays manhunt or what's the postal or the mass shooting game from a couple

616
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,820
years ago where it's like top-down hotline miami style yeah if so if I'm

617
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:56,420
playing that I'm like oh yeah it's just cool there's a bunch of people my

618
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:59,660
girlfriend's playing my girlfriend plays that I serious I would think about

619
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:03,220
breaking up with her and I'm like I'm like trying to get like good photos of

620
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:09,220
me for like the the a&e documentary yeah it's about me you know trying to just

621
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,980
like look like deleting every single bad photo of me of an in existence. Yeah,

622
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,240
so when they use like they go back, they use, you know, it would also be, you

623
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,840
know, it would also be a scary one to walk in and your girlfriend's playing

624
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,040
area simulator would be

625
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,900
if you walk in late at night, your girlfriend's been playing for seven

626
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,460
hours of

627
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,880
trouble in terrorist town, just

628
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,160
public

629
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:33,000
nobody

630
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:39,180
whole game, open mic, not even push to talk to everybody's hearing everything

631
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,960
she's saying. If my wife played any game where they had a microphone, I would

632
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,180
shut that down fast.

633
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:51,280
I would say no, no, no, because I in my brain, I was like she's going to get

634
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,180
tricked like a little kid and like getting kidnapped. Hey, Donald Trump,

635
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:55,620
yeah,

636
00:37:55,620 --> 00:38:00,600
can you help me out? I need someone to help me or worse. She'll end up in an

637
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:04,620
Instagram video where some guys like they're pushing me and she's like,

638
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:07,500
Oh my God, is that Donald Trump? He has no idea.

639
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,220
Or that dude who pretends to be a little kid and he's trying to,

640
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:13,980
trying to rizz her up. Yeah. And it would definitely work. You know that guy?

641
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:16,700
Yeah, it would work. Yeah. He's like, come on guy. It would work.

642
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:20,740
My wife is not faithful. She's trying to jump every single part,

643
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,940
every single guy she's trying to. That's why she's playing all these video games.

644
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,780
She wants to fuck Lizzo.

645
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
Which one is Lizzo?

646
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,540
She's a fucking Lizzo.

647
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,540
The legend of Zilzo.

648
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,540
She's playing Saints Row 4

649
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,540
and she's just sliding the girth thing

650
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,540
on the penis. Yeah.

651
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:40,540
You remember that? I remember that.

652
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,540
Sliding that back and forth making it

653
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:44,540
gigantic. Cyberpunk.

654
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,540
Oh yeah.

655
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Hey Cyberpunk, if you can make

656
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,540
the penises big, why can't I

657
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,540
destroy the vaginas? Yeah.

658
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,540
Yeah. It's basically the same thing.

659
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:00,780
mutilate all that. I want to put beagle ears down there. I literally just want to

660
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:08,420
fucking I want to I want to twist it. You know how sometimes Japanese cooks take

661
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,580
scrambled eggs and they take two chopsticks and then like turn it like

662
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,460
this? Yeah. I want to do that. Oh is it called omakase? No I don't know.

663
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,820
That is a dude I don't even think that's right. That's a bunch of sushi. That's a

664
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:21,500
completely different thing. Yeah that's when you eat a bunch of sushi. Yeah.

665
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:25,660
I don't think that's true, man. I think so. I think that's like that when you go and you

666
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:31,300
get like twelve different sushi dishes. Maybe I've just been thinking about that a lot.

667
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:35,200
I think what you're thinking of is swirl. I'm thinking of swirled eggs. I want to make

668
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,900
omu rice. Yeah. What's that? It is rice with an egg on top that you slice the top and then

669
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,580
you pour something called demi-glace. Oh yeah. Demi-glace? But it's way too hard to make

670
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:49,940
demi-glace so I'll never make it. What's demi-glace? You can buy demi-glace. Yeah, but I would

671
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,940
want to make it. It's like a broth, a bone broth. It's really, really thick. You take

672
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,180
all the fat off and you boil it and boil it and boil it and simmer it until it's really,

673
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,460
really thick and brown. It's basically beef syrup. It looks like paint. Yeah. Okay. And

674
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:12,460
it looks good. Alright. Yeah. I made something last night. What'd you make? I made, it was

675
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,540
like a, I basically made Marsala with red wine instead of Marsala because I didn't have

676
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,900
70 left and it was pretty good. I just let it simmer for way longer, made like the red

677
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,460
wine sauce super thick and now I'm thinking maybe I'd do that again but I'd do it with

678
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:32,300
a skirt steak, make a steak marsala like a fat fucking idiot.

679
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,020
Do you guys, when you guys order, get beer from places, do you still get nervous when

680
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,980
they ask to see your ID?

681
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:42,340
No, I've been getting carded at the grocery store and honestly I just, I think to just

682
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,380
take off my hat and just show them my hairline.

683
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:51,660
I did that one time at a bar in L.A. The guy did and he did let me in. He thought I had

684
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:58,020
a fake ID until I did that. Wow. Yeah. I don't get nervous, but I do. I am like, "What if

685
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:05,260
somebody just takes my ID for no reason? I have to get another one." It's more of like

686
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,820
a logistical fear of like, "Oh, great. I don't want to have to get a new ID." That's why

687
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,620
it made me so mad when I was in L.A. because I was like, "Oh, I have to fly." This guy

688
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:18,060
I snaps my D. I know that I will have to fight this guy and he would have

689
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,900
beaten me to death. I'm just glad the New Hampshire ID is

690
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,680
it looks very official. It's crazy that people who's okay, I'm gonna tell it

691
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,340
we're going back to telling you like it is. Okay, quick. Yeah, it is insane

692
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:34,020
to me that people whose job it is to look at 10,000 IDs a day

693
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:38,200
can't figure out how to look find out where the date is on a

694
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,220
fucking ID. Yeah,

695
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,460
are you should have every single one look at the eyes, but where is it? I'm

696
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,140
not going to fucking tell you where it is. Look at it. It's this big. Yeah,

697
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,020
where else can it be? It's there. Remember that time? Yeah, it's on the

698
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,660
what it's over there. Yeah, we're in San Francisco.

699
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,660
You're in San Francisco. After our show, we're going to that. I think we're

700
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,940
going to Dan show and I accidentally showed the bouncer my Peter Griffin. I

701
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:08,060
think really did it work. He looked down. He went. Is that Peter Griffin

702
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,340
only in San Francisco, man. No,

703
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:17,380
oh my God, is that Peter Griffin? Yeah, it does look like a real ID. I've

704
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,860
been talking about it for a long time, but getting an ID

705
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:24,560
just to check if it would work where it just says that I'm

706
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,060
15 years old and trying to buy beer with it. Man, I don't

707
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:31,240
think that would work. And I already had that joke so many times.

708
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,940
Yeah, I showed it to you a trillion times. No, your idea is that

709
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:37,520
you're as an elf. It says I'm 14 years old on it. That's the

710
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:42,660
That's just that's stealer. The joke on that thing is that it's got the

711
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,820
Nintendo seal of approval. Keeping it real in two ways. Number one, you

712
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,900
copied. Number two, you mocked. You just did mocking. I did do mocking,

713
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,500
but I was in my room. You did like parenting mocking. Yeah. I don't think

714
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,980
an eye for an eye is how we do the things around here. I think that

715
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:58,900
yours is chock full. You're fake idea... You're blue, you're red. You're

716
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:03,020
blue, you're red. Sorry. What? Your fake idea is chock full of little ass

717
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,440
Easter eggs, whereas I want to get a real actual fake ID that scans for you.

718
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,200
Just want to copy my ideas. It's not a copying. It's directly a copy. It's not

719
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,440
copying. It's not even directly copying because you have an elf.

720
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,000
for those listening at home. I just put my feet on Patrick as a sign of

721
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,040
disrespect and he took my shoe off and started giving me a pretty good

722
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:45,920
my God, but I don't think that that's copying. I think that yours is the

723
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,280
absurdity of yours is I think maybe yes, the joke is the same,

724
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,440
which is copy. No, that's not copying. No, but there's yours is more. Can you

725
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:03,080
pull it out right now. Okay, because there's a clear and and very danger.

726
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,900
There's more jokes. There's it's not the only joke, but it is

727
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,740
the joke like if a bouncer looked at that, they would know it was fake

728
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,620
immediately. I want the bouncer. I don't know.

729
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,100
No, they wouldn't. They would say, you know, I think what state is this from

730
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:21,160
this? It says Massachusetts on it. This must be it's kind of like our

731
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:25,500
McLovin. Id yeah, a lot of our McLean. Yeah, I think I think you should start

732
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,380
using it, though.

733
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,540
I should you should start using it or like get it actually camera. Let's get

734
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:34,240
it up to the camera because this

735
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,440
this is still one of the funniest things I've ever seen,

736
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:43,040
but the 15 year old thing is not the main

737
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,040
thing here. Just show it

738
00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:50,240
for a second, then come back and talk about it. People can pause it if they

739
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,240
need to say that's a gift card that it's taped to

740
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
I

741
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
forgot about that.

742
00:44:55,240 --> 00:45:03,960
All right, let's see. So this says, this says Massachusetts identification card. In the top

743
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:10,660
right it says official Nintendo. It has a bunch of some kind of...

744
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,660
Cam, you need to like actually...

745
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,660
I'm pulling up Google Translate.

746
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:13,660
You need to get like a...

747
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,660
I was going to print like a hundred of these.

748
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,740
An ID printer. It says that you are... First of all, the picture's an elf. The signature

749
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:26,740
picture says John Hancock, sex, female height, five foot, four organ donor. It

750
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,140
says

751
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:34,940
D. D. And Rev are in twenty sixteen. So you're born in twenty fourteen and then

752
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:38,940
it was translated with this. All right, let's twenty fourteen. That's not fifteen

753
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,740
years old. Is that fifteen years old? Okay, it says someone born. I wanted

754
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,340
years old, but then wait and listen. Okay, so this is oh wait, it's it's

755
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:52,420
trying again hold on it's so the Chinese text translates, but whatever that other

756
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,920
Texas, I don't remember what it is and it changes every time you translate it.

757
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,620
It says I completely differ. So the Chinese says I am a child don't sell

758
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:06,140
sex. Give me love. I drink poisonous alcohol. I have twelve years old.

759
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:09,900
Let's see

760
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,100
like I'm going to try to translate the top again. Yeah, the Arabic defeat

761
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:16,380
the thief

762
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:20,880
literally every time it will say something different. I wanted thief to

763
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,120
stay in Angie on the sixth of the shocking twenty fourteen.

764
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,680
Wow,

765
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,740
the ID protects the identify of the identity of the hall. I want to

766
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,360
download images

767
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,800
every single that is a

768
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,720
shape shifting language,

769
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,060
but yeah, I do need to finally do something with that yeah yeah. Well,

770
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,280
he just kind of did it's been three years. This is the long. This is the

771
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,640
payoff. Yeah, it was people get to see it. Finally, it's just been sitting in

772
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,400
your ID. Only five people have seen it for years.

773
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,040
You've never

774
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,000
tried it at a bar. I'm gonna do something real with it. No, I wanted to

775
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,000
make a bunch of them before I tried it at a bar. Yeah. I don't know if...

776
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,520
I think what you should do is get

777
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,880
that laminated or something or printed, like an actual ID. Yeah, I think I

778
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,440
will. You need to hire a fake ID person to make it. Yeah. Well, yeah,

779
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,840
That's what I want. I wanted a fake ID person to make it say like actual New Hampshire, like

780
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,440
all of my actual information. So it's like a full felony. And then it just says I'm 15.

781
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,080
One you say you're one year old. Just yeah. Something like that. Yeah. And you say it's

782
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,920
a misprint. Yeah. And they'll be like, Yeah, I guess it is probably a misprint. Yeah, I

783
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,200
guess it's not as funny as that. And I'm sorry for saying that an ID where I'm a very young

784
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,120
boy. That's okay. You could come up with you. The thing is, you're smarter than that. What?

785
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:50,000
You're just smarter than Cameron. You can come up with a better idea than you can do. He

786
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,480
knows math stuff. I don't know. It's okay. Listen, it's okay if you're good at math.

787
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,880
I'm not even good at math. I don't know why you guys think I'm good at math. You're basically

788
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,960
the math person. Well, because you're just like a nerd. Yeah. You just think that I am

789
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,900
just based on how I look and act. I'm not at all. Although today you became the jock

790
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,280
of the group because you went on a run. That's true. It's true. So now maybe me and Patrick

791
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,160
are the ones about maths. Yeah, the ones with good. Well, actually, I guess I'm still the

792
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,280
maths one because I basically calculated my pace for my run. I think I had to do it with

793
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:29,640
a calculator. The only time that math ever made sense to me was when my fourth grade

794
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:36,040
nerd teachers said, "You probably deal with a lot of, like, with, you know,

795
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:41,040
360s, 180s. You probably deal with a lot of that." Oh, yeah. She did that to you?

796
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,520
And then I went, "Oh, my God." It's all... You did the opposite... That was a

797
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:48,280
full movie moment. Yeah, you did the opposite of the nerd who realizes

798
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:52,880
something is all math. You said, "It's all skateboarding." Yep. Wow.

799
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,480
That is how you have to get through life. You have to pick one thing and

800
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,840
then you have to make everything that thing. I watched a video today. That's

801
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:02,040
I've gotten through pretty much everything. I watched a video today that was a guy, one

802
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:08,680
of these fucking like, it was just a short, a YouTube short of these dudes talking about

803
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:15,440
how he said every man picks something when they're in their teens and then works really,

804
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:20,320
really hard at it, gets really good at it, and then in their late 20s or early 30s realizes

805
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:25,640
that it was not what they were supposed to be doing. Yeah. And so now I'm trying to find

806
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,040
in my exit. Yeah, and I think that it will be

807
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,320
makeup artist. Yeah, okay. I think I mean no, 'cause then you'd really get

808
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,000
mistaken for Trixie Mattel. You can't do that. I'm not gonna do it on

809
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,720
myself.

810
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:43,200
You have to practice. I'm gonna do it on the most beautiful women on television.

811
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,160
Yeah, you're gonna be like Chaz Dean? No, I'm gonna make them... I'm gonna

812
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,840
take the most beautiful women... That is actually such a... If you are a

813
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,640
makeup artist, you just find women who naturally look so beautiful,

814
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,940
like they're wearing makeup and you do maybe like a pencil on their eyebrow a

815
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:59,620
tiny bit and then you go, "That's it. I look, I did a makeup job."

816
00:49:59,620 --> 00:50:01,240
He made them beautiful.

817
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:03,960
I made him, I made her beautiful.

818
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:04,600
Yes.

819
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:09,320
She has Dean's mostly hair though. I don't know why I used him as a... I think

820
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:14,120
I only know one. I would get Jenny Slate and give her a unibrow and say,

821
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:18,440
"Look at this beauty. Look at how beautiful this is." You get your voice

822
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:21,960
deepened with surgery. "Look at this beauty." I've also been thinking a lot

823
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,160
about just really hoping that my voice gets a little more normal as I get older.

824
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:27,460
Yeah.

825
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:32,460
Because I think that you can have a funny weird voice until you're like,

826
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:34,960
I don't think your voice is weird or funny.

827
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,160
It is weird and very funny.

828
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,260
It's funny.

829
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:41,860
I don't have a weird voice.

830
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:47,660
No, but I mean like I think I just want such a default basic old man voice.

831
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,360
I want an AI voice.

832
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:53,760
When you hear your own voice, do you think like, oh, I maybe it's just you

833
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,400
because you grew up with your voice your whole life? Well, just think like that.

834
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,080
I that's it for a second. Yeah, it's not true.

835
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,320
Well, no, because in my head, I that's

836
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:10,160
classically the thing that changes about you. No, in my head, I still sound

837
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,880
that like I'm like, oh yeah, I still sound the same as I did when I was like

838
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:17,440
18. But I know that I sound definitely very different thing about me. I learned

839
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,680
slang and it changed my life. Slang will change your life man. Slang will change how you hang.

840
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:28,120
Slang will change your friends too. People around you start moving different when you

841
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:33,360
have that slang. Yep. You start saying "Hundo P". "Hundo P" I'm going to keep it a stack.

842
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:37,680
I'm going to keep it three thou wow with you. People start acting different to you. They

843
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,160
start saying "What are you talking? Is that even English? What are you saying?" "I'm going

844
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,960
to ride you". Yeah and you say "I'm going to ride you all the way into town". "Let me

845
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,160
hit that that's not too shabby. Let me hit that. Let me hit that. They don't

846
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:53,960
realize that means I'd like my change, please. Yeah. Can you break a 20? Can you

847
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:59,860
break? Let me break. Can you break? Can you break a 15? That's what you should

848
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:04,040
do. Your version of the I. D. Prank that he's been plotting for years. Oh, my

849
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:11,240
God. Money. A weird dollar or even a weird ass check. You can do the my my I.

850
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:15,180
D. Prank is I'm basically I'm the my it's the equivalent of when someone buys

851
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:19,980
like Google.com and sits on it for five years and hope someone else wants to

852
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:23,480
buy it. By the way, whoever bought Google probably made a lot of money. A huge

853
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:30,180
amount of money. Oh, I loved El Gug. I told you about how I got pranked into

854
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,080
you. I got pranked by El Gug. Don't tell me you searched El Gug. No, the same kid that showed me

855
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,880
like two guys, one hammer was like if you go on El Gug and look up nip steam

856
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:43,580
and click I'm feeling lucky. Wow. It brings you to a cool website. You got meat spun.

857
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,220
you, which that's not even that bad of a video.

858
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:52,720
It's not, it's normal. We've talked about that. Those old shock videos,

859
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:54,880
they're very tame. They're these days you,

860
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,000
I wish that shock sites were around in like the 1920s and it'll be like they'd

861
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,820
be like yeah, go to like go to like whatever dot com and it's

862
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:07,100
any farthing. Yeah, it's a picture of rotten food. Yeah, like

863
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,020
a man's ankle. Yeah,

864
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,900
I'm not gay.

865
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:17,440
what is hell, what the bloody hell, why would you show me this blasted to

866
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,420
smithereens, just a shock newspaper

867
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,200
took this newspaper out.

868
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:28,640
The thing is they probably saw people back then literally probably saw two

869
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,180
guys, one hammer in real life every day, gangs of New York, yeah, and they get

870
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:36,780
home and they say they're just finding dead bodies on the street. Yeah, they

871
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:36,980
see

872
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:39,400
their pants. They see two guys.

873
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:46,040
A woman in pants, no a table leg yeah, yeah, the legs on the table leg

874
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,180
thing up no

875
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,900
yeah, vomiting looking back and forth to say like

876
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,260
one guy likes it. He's kind of being performative yeah, because you know

877
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,620
that there was people who saw meat spin and it unlocked the gay gene that was

878
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:06,100
sitting in their body. Yeah, laying dormant my my my waiting for they say

879
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:11,720
like my my my when they see it. Yeah. Oh me oh my I mean oh me oh my that's the

880
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:11,940
worst.

881
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:18,160
The meat spin counter and it was how many spins you sat through. I could I could

882
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,920
have sat there all day. It's just a fucking penis. Just a penis going into a

883
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:27,560
butt that's spinning another penis. Yeah and the song is great. Yeah. I love that

884
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:32,760
song. What was the song? I forget. You spin me. Oh yeah. I love that band. I

885
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,320
thought meat spin had

886
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:44,600
that. That's Leakspin. Oh yes, yes you're right. But Meatspin had Dead or Alive and then I think

887
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:50,280
I did find out that I liked the band Dead or Alive through Meatspin so pretty cool. We

888
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:54,720
used to go to ShoopDaWhoop.com. ShoopDaWhoop was good. ShoopDaWhoop.com where you would

889
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,000
refresh the page and sometimes it would be a funny video and sometimes it would be the

890
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,480
most racist thing ever and then sometimes it would be somebody getting killed. Yeah.

891
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,680
Yeah, because I didn't know how to type man. Yeah, and I didn't know what I don't

892
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,680
think I think I was late to YouTube.

893
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:13,480
I was early. I was one of the earliest adopters of YouTube. I didn't really use

894
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:17,180
my computer much my neighbor. I think my neighbor Shara showed me YouTube and

895
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:17,680
then

896
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,380
she didn't realize what she did. She does not realize what she did. She used to

897
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,680
buy snow cones at her house.

898
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,980
You to buy them smartest kid in the neighborhood. She was like selling snow

899
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:31,780
cones every single day for a dollar 50. Holy shit. That's like a Jay-Z song.

900
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:38,880
Mm-hmm. They probably made so much money that Joseph's my neighbor. Yeah, probably they would sell honestly probably hundreds of thousands of dollars

901
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,880
Yeah, hundreds of thousands. They would sell

902
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:47,340
Snow cones a day for me a good day. I would go there with all the quarters that my mom was trying to save up for

903
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:49,340
I coin star and I

904
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:53,740
Had a snow cone shara not that long ago

905
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:58,920
That was honestly probably the best one of the better desserts I've ever had in my life snow cone can be good

906
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:04,340
good. They used to have at Canobie Lake, I think they used to have the Hawaiian shaved

907
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,940
ice and I never had that before and I was like this is the most incredible thing I've

908
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,340
ever had in my life. I used to...

909
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,340
Hollow, hollow.

910
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,340
I don't know that.

911
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,340
From Jollibee.

912
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,820
Okay, I don't know it.

913
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,540
I love shaved ice. There's a Thai shaved ice.

914
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:23,020
Me and my friends in elementary school, we were obsessed with slushes with the, what's

915
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,020
the brand name?

916
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,020
Slush puppy?

917
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,020
No, what's the brand name?

918
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,020
Icy.

919
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,020
I'm more into push pops.

920
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:35,540
Luigi's. I'll figure it out. Luigi's, the ice cream. The little popped ones. The

921
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:41,540
hollow hollow is like a shaved ice. I was wondering about halo halo too. Ube.

922
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:46,940
It's like a... Oh, I discovered... They put like beans in it. I have a new

923
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:52,740
favorite fruit. What is it? Papaya. Papaya is great. I did not know... I don't

924
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,540
think I can imagine what papaya tastes like. I used to get papaya in the little...

925
00:56:56,540 --> 00:57:00,940
basically, but it's got a fun juiciness. Del Monte little fucking fruit cups. See, I'd

926
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,860
never had it before. I don't think we have it down south. I don't think it exists. You

927
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:09,300
can get it canned. Yeah, I didn't eat canned fruit. Actually, that's not true. I ate the

928
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:12,420
canned peaches so much. I ate a lot of canned fruit. Or the little cup of the peaches. Canned

929
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:18,940
mandarins. I never had a canned fruit. You never had canned peaches? Oh, they're so good.

930
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:24,900
I love canned pineapple. It's so bad for you, but it's so good. I love the metallic taste

931
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:29,140
that all of the fruit gets. When the corn syrup mixes with the metal, I'm going to

932
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:33,860
have Alzheimer's when I'm older. I don't care. I love when things taste like

933
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,260
metal. I might have pica.

934
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:42,900
Do you guys think that... I had a thought yesterday that terrified me to my core.

935
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,700
Yeah.

936
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,980
Which is that I think that one... Everybody's always like, "What is the

937
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:49,540
thing that we're going to be like, 'Oh shit, I can't believe that we did... We

938
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:50,340
thought that was good.'"

939
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,460
Yeah, what is it?

940
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,460
What if it's like microwaves?

941
00:57:53,460 --> 00:58:00,460
Oh, it's absolutely, it is absolutely, microwaves are the worst thing you can have in your home.

942
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,660
I refuse to have one.

943
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:05,420
But it's just basically just heat going like this.

944
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:10,060
But I think that it would scare me a little bit if that was a killer.

945
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,740
It's definitely a killer, are you fucking kidding me?

946
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:16,580
I mean, I think, I honestly think the unfortunate thing is that they're going to look back and

947
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,540
it's going to be like, oh, it was everything.

948
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,420
It was all of the things that we ever invented.

949
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:26,820
It was all added up and they made it made us all die. You look back at like the

950
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,320
70s when they like first like when they started making like polyester fucking

951
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:36,720
clothes and shit and it's like the amount of like plastic that they had to

952
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:42,820
use to make just like the worst flare pants of all time has now decimated the

953
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,620
planet. Oh wait speaking of the planet, we haven't even talked about how New York

954
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:50,120
City is sinking. Oh yeah, I heard that from you. I've been talking about this

955
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:54,820
us every I know so tell me what's happening with New York City. So what

956
00:58:54,820 --> 00:59:01,380
happened is a tidal wave is going to hit that's not what the thing is that's not

957
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:07,120
it at all. No you said it was because the buildings are too heavy. Oh is that

958
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,320
why I thought we were talking about the tidal wave. What tidal wave are you

959
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:16,060
talking about right? I guess you didn't read about that. What what tidal wave is

960
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:18,460
this is it coming the master tsunami

961
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:28,740
what is that

962
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:37,660
there is a

963
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:40,780
has been talking about the master

964
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:47,240
game for a long time. That is so it's not real exactly what your friend would

965
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,100
tell you in school. The master soon.

966
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,800
No, dude, the fucking the day the buildings are too heavy and man has

967
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,160
gonna be underwater in eighty years. No, no, no, it's gonna be underwater

968
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,560
because of the master. I mean, that's gonna hit in twenty twenty five twenty

969
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,100
twenty five. How has it started already? How do you know it's it's off the

970
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,300
coast of Great Britain?

971
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:10,180
It's not that far away. Yeah, I know, but it's a slow Nami.

972
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:21,180
It's a slow tsunami. It's a slow tsunami? It's building up over time. So right now it's really small. Right now it's tiny. It's like a snowball.

973
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:31,180
It's going to exactly. It's going to take two years to get over to the pond as they say. It might go across the pond and come all the way around and then keep going.

974
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:35,680
It could have a Christopher Columbus style expedition where you think it's going to go to New York.

975
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,680
It accidentally goes past and comes around.

976
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,180
It could actually go to the West Indies this time.

977
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,180
Oh, God.

978
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,680
Another British problem over there.

979
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:52,680
I did hear that there is going to be a two mile high wave that comes from the West Coast and destroys the entire country.

980
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,680
No.

981
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:54,680
I hate to say it.

982
01:00:54,680 --> 01:00:56,680
The master tsunami is the same thing.

983
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,180
Well, but it's coming from the other side.

984
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,680
Maybe they'll meet in the middle.

985
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:07,560
Yeah. Oh my God. And fight. I hate the tsunami. I hate natural disasters. I

986
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:12,520
fucking hate the master tsunami. I hate the volcano at Yellowstone. What's the

987
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:18,520
scariest natural disaster to you guys? Probably, I mean again, I don't want to

988
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:22,220
keep saying it. You know, I think it's an earthquake while I'm in a big

989
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:26,000
building. Earthquake while you're in San Francisco. And I've never had it. I've

990
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,080
never experienced it. We never experienced one when we lived in LA,

991
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:31,360
right? I think maybe like one or two like my crew, tiny, tiny ones, but

992
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:35,600
nothing that like nothing real. That is so stupid that earthquakes happen. I

993
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,520
don't know. I think that an earthquake because for me it's it's the fear of

994
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,040
heights where you're you're are. I'm already scared of being tall up in a

995
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,320
building in jail and then it's like oh, then the earth is going to open up and

996
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:52,040
it's even taller. San Francisco is so fucked. Yeah, or when the master tsunami

997
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:55,920
hits a master tsunami would scare me pretty bad too. I'm more. I'm most

998
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,760
just afraid of a master tornado. Yeah, yeah, a tornado is such a scary

999
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:05,580
could be fun for a little bit or a bolt of lightning. That's the size of an

1000
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:06,580
entire city.

1001
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:13,120
I would hate that shit. If it just was like in an instant, everything is

1002
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:18,160
lightning. No, that's not that. That's not that scary, though, 'cause it's so

1003
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:20,000
fast. I think it has to be

1004
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:25,380
that's a scary idea. The thunder would scare you way more than the bolt.

1005
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:27,100
The thunder would be really much scarier. I'd see the thing and go,

1006
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:31,020
"Oh, that's cool. It just destroyed all of Chicago." And then it would be

1007
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:34,880
really, really loud. Yeah, but you'd have to count a lot Mississippi if it

1008
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:39,060
was in Chicago. It might come many, many seconds later. But I would definitely

1009
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:41,240
hear it. Many, many, many, many seconds. You would hear it for sure.

1010
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:46,200
Maybe also a volcano would be scary if the ash blotted out the sky. Yellowstone.

1011
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,800
Yeah, a caldera. Chicken bone, Yellowstone. Doesn't that feel like a

1012
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,040
thing is if doesn't doesn't make you mad when people are like you know

1013
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:57,400
Yellowstone actually the whole thing is one volcano yeah

1014
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,560
because it's true, but

1015
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:04,800
well, how much cork is left in the world just plug the thing yeah,

1016
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:09,080
plug that makes it a war up with. Have you ever seen a cartoon? No, if you

1017
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:12,840
plug something, it explodes. You've never seen a cartoon.

1018
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:21,480
No! Of course not! I don't watch that. I watch films. No you don't. I watch documentaries.

1019
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:28,480
Adam Curtis, my neighbors, Adam and Curtis made a documentary about bang bros. Wow, that'd

1020
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:37,480
be cool. Where are the sluts now is what it's called. Where are they now? Where are these

1021
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:44,240
sluts? Where are the sluts at? It's like that guy before they were famous, but he's talking

1022
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:49,640
about hoes and pornos before they were famous. What were hoes doing before they got all that

1023
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:53,280
dicks and all? Are you guys excited for one day when we are doing a before they were famous

1024
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:58,600
and they use this exact clip of me talking right now? They'll use the ollie clip for

1025
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,880
sure. I think we're already too famous. Before I'm famous for being a skateboarder. Yeah.

1026
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:05,640
Yeah. They'll be like look at how fucking shitty he was. Look at how bad he was. He

1027
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,120
didn't even. Well part of it is that I have these shoes on, these clogs. You know? So

1028
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:11,400
So if I had maybe some, what's a skate shoe?

1029
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:14,560
Like a Michael Jordan 3 or Michael Jordan 6.

1030
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:15,560
Asics skateboarding.

1031
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,440
I found them at the Greenpoint Beacons Closet.

1032
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,440
They don't only-

1033
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,960
Wilson and I were giving around shopping tips for free.

1034
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,560
Well, Deals Corner, there's somebody who rides for Asics skateboarding who keeps dropping

1035
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:31,360
off their stuff at the Beacons Closet in Greenpoint and I got a pair.

1036
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:34,040
They don't come to the States until June.

1037
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:35,960
I found these at the end of April.

1038
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:36,960
Oh, that's cool.

1039
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,960
Yeah.

1040
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:40,460
you know, that was actually a pretty cool little anecdote.

1041
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:40,960
Uh-huh.

1042
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,660
About skate, I mean it was all stuff that I usually hate that you talk about, but you kind of made it work.

1043
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:47,260
Well, what's, what shoe size are you?

1044
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:48,260
11.

1045
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,660
Buddy, you are in for a fucking treat if you like.

1046
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:52,660
I'm in for some shoes.

1047
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,660
If you like a shoe that looks like this, that has good arch support.

1048
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:57,660
Okay.

1049
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:00,660
They have some more there, I think.

1050
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:01,160
Alright.

1051
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
If you look around.

1052
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
Well, I got homework.

1053
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:03,660
Uh-huh.

1054
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:08,660
And I wish we, I wish Dubio was here to do the Deals Corner logo.

1055
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:14,660
I have been slacking on that. No one has kept me to it.

1056
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:17,660
Yeah. I don't think anybody liked it. I'm going to be honest with you.

1057
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:18,660
What?

1058
01:05:18,660 --> 01:05:19,660
Yeah.

1059
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:20,660
Are we out on time?

1060
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:23,660
Serbs sent me a message the other day with a deal I should do.

1061
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:25,660
Well, what was the deal? Real quick.

1062
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:28,660
I already did the deal today. I can't do it. I will wait until the next episode.

1063
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:29,660
I don't want to.

1064
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:32,660
All right. You know what? All right.

1065
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,660
Alright, goodbye.
