And we're back.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We had to take a week off.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,440
We took a week off.

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:51,840
Our excuse is that Caleb, he just left the country and we haven't been able to find him.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,920
So instead of missing a second week, because he's still missing and we still don't know

18
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,520
where he is. We decided to bring on three of our closest friends.

Noah, who's been on before, Brian, who we have talked about before on here,

and Mike, who is a complete journalist.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,240
So he turned his face off so no one can see him.

22
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,480
He's in danger. He is in danger.

23
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,120
Someone just cracked open a beer.

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,600
Usually how this goes is we crack open our beers at the top.

25
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,800
At the start. I'm sorry.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:33,160
No, it seems to be halfway through his beer, but I guess you can just talk about your beer.

27
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
I guess it's talk about my beer.

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,060
Yeah, I got a penis modelo at the deli.

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:46,420
It's lukewarm because for the podcast, I completely yeah, I have a lukewarm penis modelo.

30
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,500
It still tastes pretty good.

31
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,820
I was swimming Pikmin and he just like joins is like, Yo, what's up?

32
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,460
I'm like, What the fuck are you?

33
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,460
I'll see you in an hour. I thought you were

34
00:01:54,460 --> 00:02:00,620
You're waiting for everyone. I take the time. I was like, oh wait, it's completely 5 p.m. And I got it wrong

35
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,860
Brian what are you drinking?

36
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,180
Classy Colorado Kool-Aid. That's right

37
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,180
Yeah

38
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,100
Rex you got a completely green drink. I have a

39
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,220
have a

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,260
Ex-brewery Baja boy

41
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,140
So you're actually drinking?

42
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:25,140
I thought you weren't drinking. You have a very important business meeting.

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,140
I was going to drink a little bit.

44
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:40,140
So I was talking to Rex about recording today and he was like, "Yeah, that's fine. I'm just going to have to miss Premiere and also I can't drink because I need to do an important business thing."

45
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,140
I was like, "Okay, that's fine." And he was like, "But you can just record one modello. It'll be fine."

46
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,900
fun. He's like, no man, it's like a public thing. I can't show bust.

47
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,500
And first thing he does is sure enough, he cracks open another crazy,

48
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,340
insane beer.

49
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,060
Well, I know that if I didn't, you know, crack open the beer, you'd be like,

50
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,860
Oh, why don't you crack open the beer?

51
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,660
Three other people here so they can crack beers and drink them and talk about

52
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:06,700
them.

53
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,260
I'm going to drink this really fast and then I will drink the monster right

54
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,700
after as my second beer.

55
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,300
It might even look like a normal beer, but you're so big, it's actually a 40 ounce can.

56
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:20,980
It's a 20 ounce can.

57
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,060
No, that's 40 ounces.

58
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,940
I've seen no business meetings are the best time to be.

59
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,220
Not a business meeting.

60
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,220
It's like a presentation.

61
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,380
It's like a yeah, it's a presentation.

62
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,820
Even more of the reason that was my presentation cheat code.

63
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,580
Two shots, half a bar is annex.

64
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,540
Well, you're you're an insane person.

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,160
You're completely crazy.

00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,980

67
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,700
And he could.

68
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,700
I am.

69
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,100
Whoa.

70
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:52,420
Yeah.

71
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,820
So I have, I completely have COVID.

72
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:01,660
Um, and I'm never going to have an edit.

73
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,380
I had it before and I was surprised.

74
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,100
I like, didn't believe my girlfriend.

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,980
She, I did the nose swabs and she took it in the other room.

76
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:13,140
And like the second she put it into the sample machine, it was

77
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,300
just like you have COVID.

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,460
Like completely red. And I didn't believe her and she had to

79
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,700
take a photo and show me.

80
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,820
Not to sound offensive or anything. Do you feel like a

81
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,580
complete idiot for getting COVID so so so late?

82
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:29,980
Yeah.

83
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,940
I feel like I've been like I've been playing the you know, the

84
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,180
Google Browser T-Rex jumping game and I've kept it going for

85
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,580
four years somehow. Yeah, I feel great.

86
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,900
But you also not bad.

87
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,620
I feel bad right now.

88
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,620
However many years COVID has existed, I felt really good.

89
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,460
I thought they turned it off like four months ago.

90
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:57,740
But they just know what they turned it off with the switchback.

91
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,740
Yeah. Were you you got in Miami, right?

92
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:02,460
I must have. Yeah.

93
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,300
Either on the bus to New York or on the plane from New York to Miami.

94
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,480

96
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
I got it.

97
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,480
Barbenheimer will definitely give it

98
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,480
to you.

99
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,460
I feel like you get it pretty like

100
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,360
when I got it, it was like two days

101
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
after I

102
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,020
not even to like a day and a half

103
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,200
after I came in contact

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
with it. I got it.

105
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,560
What do you get it?

106
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,640
I got it like two years ago

107
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,920
on my birthday

108
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,680
from my girlfriend.

109
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:50,080
I was so on my own last night that I during COVID during the height of COVID, I was the

110
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,080
brave person that kept traveling and moving across countries during COVID.

111
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,600
And never once did I get any sick.

112
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,520
But one like New Year's party, my dad just went and he came back and he just was completely

113
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,120
sick. And he stayed like he quarantined himself in his room

114
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
for a single day. And then after that, he was just like hanging

115
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,920
out in the house. I was like, Oh, I guess I just go kill

116
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:22,280
myself. And I just completely had got COVID in my own home,

117
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,040
instead of all the airports that I've been in.

118
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,960
Yeah, you were flying a lot.

119
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,560
I was kind of pissed. I was I was flying. But my excuse was

120
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,140
that I got one of my shots in Chicago.

121
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,140
Yeah.

122
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,680
And it doesn't it doesn't matter that you're flying.

123
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,180
I flew a plane.

124
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,080
It doesn't matter.

125
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,280
It's going to be funny when Mike can't do his job.

126
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,920
Hello, especially all.

127
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
Let's go.

Got a long coding.

129

That's right. That's right.

131
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:55,620
I have the American version of Modelo, which is the court.

132

The court banquet, baby.

133
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,480
Now I'm going to get one COVID.

134
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
Yeah, I hope so.

135
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,200
I have immunocompromised, but I, yeah, I hope I don't get it.

136
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,560
Are you going to feel bad?

137
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,760
Are you immunocompromised?

138
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,000
What does that mean?

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,080
Uh, dude, if I knew, uh, I honestly,

140
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,720
You have an autoimmune disease, right?

141
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,640
Yeah.

142
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:16,840
Yeah.

143
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,280
Yeah.

144
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,280
Um, this is not a fun topic for beers we drink, but yeah, when I was a kid, my

145
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,280
parents like took me to a bunch of doctors and they were like, you're like too tall

146
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,120
at this age.

147
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,200
You're like way too big.

148
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,320
You have more fans and then they ruled that out.

149
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
This is so boring.

150
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,660
All of you guys are like looking at other stuff.

151
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,820
No, I mean, I'm cleaning my beard.

152
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,700
I'm not going to have a sticky beard.

153
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,360
I'm not going to lie.

154
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,740
I was about to ask if that's the reason why you were so tall,

155
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,920
because you your body just didn't know when to stop growing.

156
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,000
And I think that is I think that is no, it's not true.

157
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,540
I got this all by myself.

158
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,460
I put in the work I put in the hours.

159
00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:01,600
There was a kid I went to school with who did have Marfan's and that's the point of what

160
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,580
your body is just like we're going to keep going for as long as we can until you die.

161
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,500
Yeah, can you get like Marfan syndrome of the penis?

162
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,500
Yeah, I have that.

163
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:24,820
Yeah, no, it would suck to be like, you know, 68 or whatever, like, and then no fucking dick

164
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,820
is like normal size.

165
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
What is normal size then?

166
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,820
Yeah, that would be...

167
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,820
Is it a five inch?

168
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Yeah, like two, three inches.

169
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,820
Two, three?

170
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:31,820
Poor guy.

171
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,820
That's really bad.

172
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:33,820
Yeah, but it's like one or two.

173
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:40,820
Look like the little tiny button they put on like the bottom of a shirt.

174
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,820
Yeah, that's normal for serial killers, man.

175
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,460
That's not normal for anybody else.

176
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,340
There's got to be a basketball player who has that problem.

177
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,140
- Yes, it's your man. - A pro in the history

178
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,900
of all professional basketball,

179
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,100
one of them has had a very small penis.

180
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,940
- Ton of them have had small penises.

181
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,020
- It's been exceedingly many.

182
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,860
All right, you went next.

183
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,140
- I feel like that's why they have that whole world

184
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,440
of lawyers who just keep every single woman

185
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,080
that they sleep with completely hush hush,

186
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,820
so that info never gets out.

187
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,980
- Do you remember that post,

188
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,020
that was like an Instagram post about Drake

189
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,940
putting Frank's Red Hot in a condom?

190
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,420
Oh yeah, burning his cone.

191
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,820
That's crazy.

192
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,660
When I first read that, I didn't get the context.

193
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,340
I thought it was before he used it.

194
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:35,540
If you want to get fucking hot sauce in your dick, there's probably a better way.

195
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,900
He's getting in there with a hot cock.

196
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,020
Didn't she find out because she used it?

197
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:49,460
Yeah, she was trying to lock him up and get herself pregnant with Drake's

198
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:56,180
Drake's a sploosh, but he, I guess he just carries hot sauce somewhere in like in his

199
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,180
ass.

200
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
I don't know.

201
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,180
I don't know how he got hot sauce.

202
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
He keeps it in his purse.

203
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,180
What do you mean?

204
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
He keeps it in his purse.

205
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
Does he have a purse?

206
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,180
Yes, he has a purse.

207
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,380
I'm going to Google Drake purse right now and if he doesn't have a purse, you owe me

208
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,380
$20.

209
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,180
Sure, Drake has a purse.

210
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:16,060
Drake should have every item in the world.

211
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,060
He should have like a brand.

212
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:19,780
Oh, yeah, like a Donald Trump style brand

213
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:24,880
He's buying Birkin bags for his future wife. Okay, he's got a

214
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:31,660
Forum there's at least like a guy who works for him who carries his purse

215
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,260
You'll never see a picture of Drake. Of course. He's a guy whose job title is like carrier

216
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,820
With Khalifa weed roller job

217
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,100
Carrier

218
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,600
He's just waiting that's how the room like a dog. Yeah, he's in the room

219
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,420
The entirety of Drake

220
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,740
20 guys standing around your bed new scenario. What do you mean?

221
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,360
Ten thousand dollars or watching Drake fuck

222
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,100
$10,000

223
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,380
I wouldn't watch anyone.

224
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,380
Well, hold on, hold on.

225
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,380
Can I film it?

226
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,380
Yes.

227
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,380
Okay.

228
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,940
Because then you can make more than $10,000.

229
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,620
To be totally honest, to take the kind of outsider's perspective on this, I might just

230
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,740
take the second option.

231
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,540
I might just watch because there are not that many people on earth who can say that they've

232
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,180
seen Drake fuck.

233
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,860
And $10,000 is like, in the grand scheme of things, not that much money.

234
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,860
It's like two months of a paid-

235
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Rich guy, rich guy.

236
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,560
Come on, come on.

237
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,700
My house in the context of like

238
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,800
a paycheck, you get like two or three paychecks and that's $10,000.

239
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,500
Yeah. So you're you're a complete landlord, right?

240
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,600
And you yeah, you really understand.

241
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,460
You hate poor people.

242
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:59,860
Yeah. Most of the listeners of beers we drink, I think, live in favelas.

243
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,060
Yeah. $10,000.

244
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,300
What's that like one week of work?

245
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,460
Yeah. Yeah.

246
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:11,120
Couple hours working a construction job.

247
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,000
Yeah, it's a single day that I collect on all my rent.

248
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,420
I work in the...

249
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,300
I don't think I would want to tell people that I saw Drake Fuck.

250
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,000
What if he had a fucking...

251
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,100
I feel like there would be too many questions to answer.

252
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,600
Then you'd have to say like, "Oh, I turned down 10k."

253
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
You would want to talk.

254
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,460
So I can fucking bang somebody.

255
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,200
You would want to tell people though.

256
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
That's the whole thing.

257
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,860
You get to...

258
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,620
I would not.

259
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,520
I really wouldn't.

260
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,720
Why would you see Drake Fuck?

261
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:42,020
I kind of understand this because $10,000 is not enough money to materially change your life if you're not like...

262
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
Me?

263
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,020
You know, broke.

264
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,520
That's a much safer way of phrasing it.

265
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Um, because like, I've been trying to sell my car, and it's like the shittiest car in the world, and it's like $11,000.

266
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,020
And I'm like, okay, so $10,000 is like literally nothing now.

267
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:00,520
I've never had an $11,000 car in my life for sure.

268
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Only the cheapest cars.

269
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,520
I paid $6,000 for it.

270
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,520
Straight beaters, right?

271
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Oh, shit.

272
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:10,440
God damn. I do think that you you you asking $11,000 for that car is a complete scam

273
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,960
I think that car should go for like 200 bucks

274
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:19,600
11k I

275
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,480
Looked it up online. That's what you what you haven't talked about your car. I love I love this about Rex

276
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,480
His car is so insane. It has nothing in it. It barely has wheels

277
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,440
It doesn't have a cruise control. You know, I think it has a radio and that's it

278
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:39,560
It has air conditioning it does it is it bad does it suck?

279
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,480
It's a shitty. Yeah, is it a midsuit? It's a Kia Kia

280
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,840
Kia-ria drive a Kia so I'm gonna oh, it's a fucking

281
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,280
Car yeah, it's literally the shitty whose cars are

282
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:59,800
$15,000 brand-new. I know why is it? Why are you selling it for $11,000? I'm not that's what it's like the KBB is

283
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:07,040
So I was like so like a good job sell it for five grand and ball out. I don't know do a Vegas trip or something crazy

284
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,520
But I have to move any instance

285
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:15,980
Do you think if you drove it to New York from LA that it would it would even make it I

286
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:22,880
Think it would I was thinking about driving it back to Arizona and even that I was like I need to

287
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,580
think definitely like blows up and just

288
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,480
melts

289
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,960
So there's a point in between Arizona and California where you're like going up a mountain and it's like a hundred and twenty degrees and it's

290
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Where everyone's car brings you?

291
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,480
Yeah, I drove a fucking

292
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:48,280
Honda Odyssey like the mom minivan through that and about like ten minutes in our AC went out. Yeah

293
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:52,520
Yeah, you got it. Turn your AC off and it's 120 degrees and I was thinking about it was like, you know

294
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,520
I'm just not gonna do that. I was just gonna sell it

295
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:02,520
When I drove to LA, I thankfully, like you just go down it if you're going into California,

296
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:07,960
right, from Arizona. Which is perfect, it's so perfect. Because that car actually like

297
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:14,720
exploded like six months later, the engine did, on the highway. I do not think I would

298
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,480
have made it. That car had no AC, the windows didn't roll down, the radio didn't work, I

299
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,880
I don't know that car was a piece of shit.

300
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,360
It was constantly leaking oil.

301
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,340
Yeah.

302
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,360
What brand?

303
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,640
It was a Ford Focus piece of shit.

304
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,920
Complete piece of shit.

305
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,560
Like horrible, horrible.

306
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:39,600
I had a, I had a car I paid two grand for and uh, it fucking the engine block

307
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,920
cracked, so I would just carry around in like the back seat, like 10 quarts of oil,

308
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,040
just like any one quart of oil.

309
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:54,120
And anytime I had to drive, I would just put in a quart of oil and it would be gone the next time I had to drive.

310
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:54,620
Mm-hmm.

311
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,320
So I would just fucking leak oil like 30 miles.

312
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,720
You were playing the long drive in real life.

313
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,520
Yeah.

314
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,720
You have like the little jalopy that you're like putting together with your hands.

315
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,420
I just had like a fucking funnel and oil in my backseat.

316
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,920
I just did not give a fuck.

317
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:18,220
Can you tell a story about the pig that your dad put in the truck of your car?

318
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:20,220
What?

319
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,220
You told me this story about someone like just leaving like meat in the back of your car.

320
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Oh, I don't know what you're talking about.

321
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:34,220
But I did leave a giant gummy bear in the back of my car, my first car.

322
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:36,220
And it got all melted.

323
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,220
Yeah, like one of those like five pound gummy bears.

324
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,220
And I fucking left it in the trunk of the car in the middle of the summer when I was at work.

325
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:52,720
And it fucking melted and turned into just got puddle of like hardened gum worm and like laminated the inside of the truck.

326
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,920
Was it in a wrapper or was it you just had it?

327
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,020
So it was in a wrapper, but I opened it.

328
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:04,220
So it was in the box in the wrapper and then I like put it in the trunk of my car.

329
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,720
Because I used to like, I worked at Krispy Kreme at the time and I worked the drive-thru

330
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,380
window and I used to fuck with people a lot because like you couldn't get fired there.

331
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,300
So I would just have it sitting on the counter near the window and just like go over and

332
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,780
like gnaw on it like a dog.

333
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,140
And they were like, you have to stop doing this.

334
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,140
So I was like, okay, okay.

335
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,540
But it was in the middle of the summer so I put it in the trunk of my car.

336
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
It was 115 degrees out.

337
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
And I was like, well, it's fine.

338
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,540
It's in the trunk.

339
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
It's like dark in there.

340
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
It's not going to get fired.

341
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:36,740
I can get out and then I got out.

342
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,140
No, I opened it up.

343
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:43,620
It was just a puddle of like like this big, you know,

344
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,820
of gummy bear just leaking out of the box and everything.

345
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,540
And it's like, no, no, no.

346
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:52,840
And I like went inside and got like a scraper, like a dough scraper.

347
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,480
And I started just like doing that really fast and like pouring soap on it.

348
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,980
And it just made it worse.

349
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,540
And I was like,

350
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:00,620
my hands are cold.

351
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:04,300
The car when you sold the car was it still there? Oh, yeah

352
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:09,140
He didn't get it you didn't think to go get a

353
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:21,140
Good question, how far do you get in into the the gummy bear by knowing it and the

354
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,700
Krispy Kreme I think

355
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,940
Yeah, like we started the ear yeah, you start to hear that's a very impactful like not to do right

356
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:50,940
No hands no hands

357
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:59,100
on it just yeah just mouth just like this other half hanging out doing doing the

358
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,260
lady in the tramp just fucking just I think it's really kind of them to let

359
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:11,180
you get 20% into the bear before they're like okay you have to stop yeah they

360
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:16,700
let me do anything at that job I and then I would just I remember like the

361
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:22,540
last thing I did was I sent like a bunch of money and an apology for stealing and

362
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,140
but then like because these managers were trying to get me fired but I wanted to

363
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,540
quit so I just wrote a letter saying that they told me to steal this money

364
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,260
and they devised a scheme and I returned it and said I felt bad and then I quit

365
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:44,380
and they all got fired. Damn, that is crazy. That's incredible. You're an actual supervillain, you're insane.

366
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,680
No, I'm a regular villain.

367
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,380
Yeah, true.

368
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,980
See, I had the same thing happen to me, but I actually did steal the money and then didn't pay back.

369
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,480
I didn't actually return as much as I saw.

370
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,280
I returned like 200 bucks and I took like...

371
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,080
Oh, you actually did?

372
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,880
Oh, okay.

373
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,680
I thought you just made it up and then gave them money to get them fired.

374
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,380
No, no, I did that.

375
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,380
I came up with the scheme.

376
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,180
They were all too stupid.

377
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:05,680
Oh, nice.

378
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,480
I was 17 and they were like, you know, mid-20s, 30s.

379
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:24,580
No, I got got fired for my first job at a grocery store because I found out they had a store coupon button, which just meant that you could hit that button and then type in an amount and it would take that off of the bill.

380
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,300
Yeah.

381
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:34,260
So I started fucking just abusing the hell out of that. Okay, now this guy gets $20 off. Like, Oh, this guy looks sure he gets $30 off like whatever.

382
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,060
Random people.

383
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:43,940
Yeah, literally anybody like how I got fucking caught was this bitch ass fat mom on wick who was like a

384
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:49,020
Super couponer came in and fucking gave her $20 off. She's using fucking wick

385
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,940
That's like a women and children like food stamp shit. Yeah, and

386
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,640
then

387
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,180
Like I noticed her like because she's so hyper focused on how much all this shit cost

388
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:06,860
Checks the receipt afterwards and then takes it right to fucking customer service like goes and tells people that like I

389
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,420
Gave her $20 off

390
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,180
Do you give her less?

391
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:17,380
She knew I I act like I've seen you did a nice shit. I did a fucking nice

392
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,900
Dollars off and then she boom went and read it on me

393
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:24,820
Fuck what I would do is I remember

394
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,520
Like they didn't have like a key card system

395
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,120
There's really no authentication for like a manager code except for a password

396
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,260
So I would just watch them enter their code one time memorize it and then use that

397
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,140
So anytime someone paid with cash

398
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,820
I would just void their ticket and put on the cheapest item and then take the cash

399
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,080
Whenever someone came through after we close the register

400
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,060
I would just be like yeah, just give me like five bucks or give me ten bucks and just like still sell them shit

401
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:54,460
it. So, and then I would split, you know, tip out everyone at the end of the

402
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,300
show. And I did that for like four or five months.

403
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,780
Made fucking 50 bucks a day.

404
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,260
Basically.

405
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,300
I think you were, you were a complete Robin Hood figure for this Krispy

406
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:06,700
Cream.

407
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:11,020
They paid fucking $8. So it's like, fuck you.

408
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:14,980
If you know, if you're working a job that pays less than like $13 an hour,

409
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,660
if you're not stealing, you're, you're fucking up. Like you should be actively

410
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,180
stealing from any like retail job, anything.

411
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,940
You should just steal everywhere you go.

412
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,860
You should just try to steal as much as you can.

413
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,260
And then I fucking would get yelled at by people around me because they'd be like,

414
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,340
can you just stop stealing everything?

415
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:39,620
That's the best part about being a bartender is you're just expected to steal.

416
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,260
Like you just,

417
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:44,580
it's actually an industry standard that you steal the alcohol and you drink it and

418
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,780
you give it to people for free.

419
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,480
Well,

420
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,480
You get into almost every...

421
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,040
But I mean like, you go to Walgreens and you fucking, you're checking out, you just reach

422
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,320
down real quick and put a candy bar in your pocket, you know, like...

423
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Yeah.

424
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,680
Fucking just any, any little thing you should just be stealing.

425
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,680
Yeah, anything.

426
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Anything you can fit in your pocket.

427
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,280
Yeah, that's what, that's what self-checkout is there for.

428
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,680
So you always like just forget...

429
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,300
They don't fuck with self-checkout anymore.

430
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,640
People abused it too much.

431
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,640
So I...

432
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
Who is they?

433
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,640
I actually...

434
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
Like Walmart and shit?

435
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Oh, okay.

436
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,640
'Cause self-checkout still exists.

437
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,640
Yeah.

438
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,200
in like like the big places they don't fuck around with that shit anymore.

439
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,560
They actually got I got arrested in L.A. for my girlfriend made me steal like

440
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,960
twenty dollars worth of mochi ice cream balls.

441
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,840
And I went to L.A.

442
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,840
County Jail for it.

443
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,040
But is that like a gay as crime?

444
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,240
It's like so it's so stupid.

445
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,400
I actually think the cops were right in that situation.

446
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Yeah.

447
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,200
Maybe they arrest you for stealing, but they arrest you for how gay the crime was.

448
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,960
My girlfriend wanted mochi ice cream balls.

449
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,980
It wasn't like we hadn't already been stealing from the store, like stealing a ton of shit

450
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:58,720
from them already.

451
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,640
But that particular day, it was mochi ice cream balls out of like a little...

452
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
It was like a cooler.

453
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
How did they get you?

454
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,840
What do you mean?

455
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,440
Just like three guards are standing by the front of the door, like waiting for you to

456
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,440
leave.

457
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
They got three guards in a fucking...

458
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
It was huge.

459
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,760
It was huge. It wasn't a Walgreens.

460
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,000
No, this was like a big grocery

461
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
store. Yes.

462
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,440
And you didn't put on like

463
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,000
you didn't put on the big eyes and go

464
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,920
like, oh, I must have forgot to scan

465
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:24,920
these.

466
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,620
You didn't try to wiggle out of it

467
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,620
somehow.

468
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,200
He had like a definitely did.

469
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,840
But this big of their shut down

470
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,880
his pants.

471
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,320
They were like, we've seen you steal

472
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
here before.

473
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,360
That was the thing.

474
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,720
We've been stealing from them.

475
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,800
Yeah.

476
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,880
So, yeah.

477
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,320
And you know, it was nothing though.

478
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,960
I just spent like a night in jail and because I'm white,

479
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,400
I didn't have to do anything. I didn't, nothing else happened.

480
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,600
Yep. I'm white. I'm really, really, really white.

481
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,720
Get over the fact that you're not Chinese.

482
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,680
Have y'all seen those ID picture? No. Can we see it?

483
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:11,320
It's I saw it the other day. I don't understand how it's one,

484
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,160
the same person as Noah and two that he's not Chinese.

485
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,720
I think you always look crazy like in IDs and like driving license pictures.

486
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,600
I look pretty much the same as I do right now.

487
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,440
You can look crazy, but you normally don't look Chinese.

488
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,480
I'm really excited for this now. Mike, have you, have you stole anything before?

489
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,720
Uh, I used to, when I was a kid,

490
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,120
I would steal cheese sandwiches from the cafeteria. Um,

491
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,480
that's cool. It's not, it's not,

492
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,480
I would go in after everyone had gotten lunch and the like,

493
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,200
this was in middle school or something like that.

494
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,680
And there are lines where you go and get stuff and there would just be like Kaiser

495
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,600
rolls with four slices of American cheese on them.

496
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,680
And I would take those and I would like pocket them and I would eat them on the

497
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,120
bus going home.

498
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,240
Two pieces of red with a bunch of cheese in it.

499
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,960
Yeah. Honestly, it should have been free.

500
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,400
Yeah. I think those are supposed to go into the trash.

501
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,520
I don't think we're supposed to eat those.

502
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Those are just scraps. I thought they were great.

503
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,120
Those sound like the free lunch that they give you whenever you don't have enough money in your account.

504
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I don't think it was that kind of school district where they had a free lunch.

505
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,120
The last thing I stole was 50 monsters.

506
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,120
50 monsters?

507
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
Yeah, like 2 of the 24 packs.

508
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,120
Just had them in the bottom of the cart.

509
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
So 48 monsters actually.

510
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Bottom of the cart? I've stolen thousands of dollars worth of stuff from bottom of the cart.

511
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,240
- Bottom of the cart is a fucking, that's a cheat code.

512
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,840
- You just scan everything top of the cart,

513
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,960
you have all the nice shit on the bottom of the cart,

514
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
and then you just go out.

515
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,320
- I didn't even do it on purpose.

516
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
I was just, you know, I walked to the car,

517
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,160
I started putting things around,

518
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,240
I was like, oh, I definitely did not pay for this.

519
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,640
- You never do it on purpose.

520
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,160
- Oh, that was an accident, I'm sorry.

521
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,280
- I legitimately, no, I'm being, I'm serious.

522
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,440
This one was actually an accident.

523
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,760
It was so practiced that I didn't feel.

524
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,820
- I've never done anything that frigging,

525
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:13,620
Like I've done stuff like that where I buy like a couple of stuff and I just like don't pay for like a like a jar of like jelly or some shit.

526
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,580
I'm like, oh man, whatever.

527
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:19,260
I guess I just told this, but 48 monsters is insane.

528
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:26,380
Yeah, that's Rex drinks that in a week, so it's that's nothing to him.

529
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,220
It is true.

530
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,780
I drink.

531
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:31,220
I go through a 15 pack in like a week and a half.

532
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,860
That's good.

533
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:33,980
All right, let's see.

534
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,980
Let's see.

535
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,460
Yeah.

536
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
I have to tell

537
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:45,480
I don't live like anywhere. That's your legal name in your ID. Okay

538
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:54,340
Tell me he doesn't look like fucking yeah me in a prime, dude

539
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,740
That's me

540
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,740
18 years old. Oh, man

541
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:04,920
Yeah, I honestly do see it. Yeah, that's fucking me

542
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:13,340
I guess it's a wrecked Rex's uber profile picture. I didn't even know you drove uber or is this just like yeah

543
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,260
Oh for writing. No, I have yeah

544
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:19,500
Yeah

545
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:27,600
What do you mean it's gone now, you know have pictures of you a short hair outside of your profile picture though no

546
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,500
That's it can't be true

547
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,300
Can be possible. What about when you're a little kid? No, but no family pictures. No, I didn't take pictures

548
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:48,140
There's just like gaps of like years where there's like no picture you've let you sort of this is the excerpt not him

549
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:54,940
Really not Rex

550
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,300
That was me when I was a freshman in college. It's in my dorm room

551
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:08,220
Like you got to run it back you need to get you need to have short hair again no

552
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm actually about to cut my hair

553
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:20,240
Well, I'm the other guy with long hair here like we can connect oh, yeah, we can

554
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,860
Yeah, we can bond over this

555
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,140
I

556
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Knew I was eventually going to cut it

557
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,960
Like even when I started growing it out. I just don't like dealing with it. I

558
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,540
Most of the time I want to put it up

559
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,300
I'm not I wouldn't say I'm bored of it like

560
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:41,580
Just what I'm working it can really be in the way and when I'm eating it's in the way when I'm walking on the street

561
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,860
It's in the way so you know what the answer is

562
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,340
Figured out you just give yourself. Thanks

563
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:59,500
I will shave my head bald before I give myself bangs.

564
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Just listen, when you're cutting your hair, you're gonna cut your hair, give yourself bangs, do it like the Hitler mustache when you're shorter, you know?

565
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,500
Like really really short, like turf bangs?

566
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:16,500
No no no, just do it like right to here, but you know, just to see what it would be like, and then you know, you can finish it off.

567
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,500
Oh, I understand, I understand.

568
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Yeah, like before shaving, you know, you give yourself a Hitler mustache.

569
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,020
I was gonna I was gonna go to like a Puerto Rican barbershop and get it done

570
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,860
So now I'll cut my bangs at my house and then I'll go to the Puerto Rican bar

571
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,620
We're the bangs a guy with bangs. I'd be like, can you cut my hair?

572
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:44,340
They're gonna get out of me for being you do that. Can I pay you to get like the like Korean like Bob cut?

573
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:48,980

577
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:04,860

00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,060
Okay, I'll get a little dangly earring yeah

579
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:15,900
We can go together. We can hold hands and get dangly earrings dangly earrings and bowl cuts

580
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,100
You're also about to become neighbors.

581
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
Yeah.

582
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,500
I'll wear a mesh shirt.

583
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,060
I'll wear a mesh shirt to work and

584
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,340
bartend in a mesh shirt with my

585
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,540
nipples protruding.

586
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,900
The place you work is like pretty

587
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,620
nice, right? It's like, yeah, you

588
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,100
know, they wouldn't let me wear that.

589
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,980
The owner constantly like talk shit

590
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
on what I'm wearing.

591
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,420
Do I wear this hat like every day?

592
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,740
And he's like, I don't know, he's

593
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,700
just he thinks I'm a hick or

594
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,860
something like that for sure.

595
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,540
Well that is a hick ass thing to do.

596
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,540
Yeah it is a hick.

597
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:52,540
But like it's not like Realtree isn't something you can wear.

598
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,540
Like it's a cool thing to wear kind of.

599
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,540
I'm wearing it because I'm a hick.

600
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:01,540
But he needs to understand that you can wear it not as a hick.

601
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:06,540
And you know if I had never told him I was from North Carolina he wouldn't know.

602
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,540
Yeah he'd probably, you have a California vibe.

603
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Yeah.

604
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Except for the fact I say y'all all the time.

605
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,540
That's really all.

606
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:21,540
California vibe. Yeah, I guess he is. Actually, you know, you could be more of like an Austin, Texas annoying guy.

607
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,540
No, no way. I get more of like a Guangzhou province. That's right.

608
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Two-tier city in China. Yeah, Shenzhen. I'm from Shenzhen.

609
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:37,540
This is actually perfect because I've been wanting to have Noah on for a couple of weeks.

610
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,540
Because I want him to tell the weird stories that he gets when he goes.

611
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:48,220
From people at work. Yeah, yeah, he gets so many insane outside his job that I wanted to keep it in recording

612
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:54,060
I'll start it with a deaf guy. I feel like that's a good place to start that one's like pretty short-winded

613
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,420
But there's this guy who terrorizes the neighborhood that I work in

614
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:03,860
Which is just all of Greenpoint. He terrorizes it all his father is like the

615
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:09,980
Lone shark for the neighborhood. So he has like this insane level of protection where like if you

616
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:15,680
Like if he gets fucked up like his father's gonna like get everyone else to fuck you up

617
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,140
So all you can really do is call the cops on him and get him arrested

618
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:25,220
Which even then like he's been arrested like 50 times. It's like ridiculous. He's always in and out but and he's down and he's deaf

619
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,820
he's deaf, but

620
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,300
he

621
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:32,180
Just goes around and like just knocks people out like constantly

622
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,060
He just knocks people out on the street all the time. I'll go game. Are you work?

623
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:38,900
He I did not get knocked out games. All right, I'm getting there

624
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,100
I'm getting that the guy that not gonna came that girl or Caleb song

625
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:48,540
No, that was in the middle of Manhattan, so this guy's only ever in Greenpoint he never leaves

626
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:55,420
Yeah, he never ever leaves like I'm being serious he never leaves I see him every day

627
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:10,380
Like the lady next door to us is like she owns a laundromat and

628
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,860
She's known him since he was like a little kid

629
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,480
So like if we ever have like really bad problems with him

630
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:20,560
She we can like grab her and she can talk to him because she knows ASL and she'll talk to him

631
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,560
but one day he like came into the

632
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,460
restaurant during brunch and

633
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:29,060
I was like helping a table up by the front of the door and I like knew who he was

634
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:33,980
but I just found out who he was like two days prior is probably like four months ago and

635
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,980
He's like trying to like tell me something without signing though.

636
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,140
And but he's really just also like yelling.

637
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,220
He's like, "Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh!" at me.

638
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,020
And also he's like kind of jacked, tatted, shirt off,

639
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,340
always drunk, always really like strung out.

640
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:57,820
And I was like, "Nah man, you have to like go. You have to go. You have to leave."

641
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:01,260
And I'm like trying, I like come out from behind and I'm like moving him out.

642
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,220
I'm like, "You have to leave."

643
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:12,220
And as I'm like walking towards him, he just pulls his pants down and wags his cock at me and then runs out of the restaurant.

644
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,220
What the fuck? I think he might like you, too. I think he likes you.

645
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,220
Yeah, I think he might like me.

646
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,220
Was it normal size or was it...

647
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:23,220
And I didn't really get a good look at it. I was looking at his face.

648
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:29,220
I really... and it happened so quickly, you know, I was just astonished that he wagged his cock at me in the first place.

649
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:34,100
But it's definitely like the not the worst thing that's happened to someone should wink at him got like a knife

650
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,380
He like pulled a knife on him and like tried to stab him Jesus. Yeah

651
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:41,700
and then the next

652
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:49,120
Time like something really weird happened. I had this huge monster of a guy. He was like 6 10 probably and he had like tons of

653
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,280
bags of

654
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,760
Takeout like you could tell that it was just from other restaurants

655
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,000
He had like four or five bags of takeout all with like receipts and different bags. So he's been to different places

656
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,560
and he just immediately sits down at like the dirtiest table in the restaurant.

657
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,800
Like people had just left. It was a bunch of people.

658
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,080
They had a lot to eat and drink and I go over and I'm like, Hey,

659
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,240
let me clean this up for you. I clean it up for him.

660
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,240
He immediately hands me a $20 bill and starts ordering like wine and all this

661
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,160
other stuff. Like he orders like a wine and an oyster. So I clean it up.

662
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,960
I go wait on like whatever actual normal tables I have cause I can tell this

663
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,600
guys a freak and then bring him his wine and I got the oysters coming.

664
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,080
I bring the oysters out and he's like, talk, he wants to like talk to me,

665
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,400
wants to have a conversation. But he's saying the weirdest shit. He's like,

666
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,440
I live in a cube.

667
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,000
Like that's the first thing he says to me. He's like, I live in a cube.

668
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Yeah, I live in a cube and um, like I can't really even remember what else.

669
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,760
He was like, I've got a beautiful girl for you. Do you like Polish women?

670
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,080
I was like I can set you up with her like and then I tell him I have a girlfriend and all this stuff like

671
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,640
specifically Polish women

672
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,920
Only Polish women like actually dude you hit it

673
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:08,600
Final a sampler of fine wares. Yeah

674
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,940
Fucking has a specific taste like that. Yeah, like it's specifically Polish women

675
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:19,520
Yeah, I actually get mistaken for Polish as well because it's a Polish neighborhood like all the time. Yeah

676
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,880
Yeah, all the time people are like do you speak Polish and I do not speak Polish

677
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,800
They constantly they're seeing you trying to screw in a light bulb

678
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:44,000
So I

679
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,520
I like finish up this conversation with this guy,

680
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,640
especially after he's like,

681
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,280
let me get you this Polish woman.

682
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,360
And then he orders like a chocolate mousse

683
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,200
and he hasn't touched his oysters.

684
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:59,760
It's been like 30 minutes and he hasn't eaten a single one.

685
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,320
And I like, I'm trying to figure out a way

686
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,160
to get him out of there.

687
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:08,000
He's been there for like an hour and somehow,

688
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,360
I can't remember what, but he was like,

689
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,080
can I get this all to go?

690
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,140
Like, can I get my oysters that have been sitting here

691
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,540
like 45 minutes to go. Can I get the chocolate mousse that's coming to go?

692
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,180
And I'll pay you. I was like, okay. So I box up his oysters

693
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:29,060
and I, we like box up his chocolate mousse and,

694
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:35,260
um, then I bring him the check and he pulls out like one of the fattest wads

695
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,500
I've seen anyone pull out in the restaurant. Also,

696
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,020
he's dressed completely normally. He's like white t-shirt covered in stains.

697
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:45,020
like cargo shorts and flip flops.

698
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:50,020
Normal in the sense of like what a normal person wears.

699
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Yeah, like he's not homeless is what I'm saying.

700
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,020
I don't know why it was under the impression.

701
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,020
I think, I don't know if it was because you said it's,

702
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
you told the story already to me,

703
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,020
but I thought that this guy showed up in a suit.

704
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
No, no, he did not have a suit on.

705
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
And that's also what I'm trying to say,

706
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,020
like why he has so much money as well as why that suit.

707
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,020
I thought he was the deaf guy from the last story.

708
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,300
No, that guy's tiny actually.

709
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,300
That guy's like 5'7".

710
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:15,100
A box of his oysters and then again, whip his cock out.

711
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,100
Yeah.

712
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,740
Okay, thank you sir.

713
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:21,780
But this guy, he pulls all this money out and he keeps counting.

714
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,060
He counts out like $200 or $300 and he's like, "No, that's not right."

715
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
It's like $40.

716
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,100
And he's like, "No, that's not right.

717
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,220
That's not right.

718
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:31,220
That's not right.

719
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,220
Do you guys...

720
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,220
I don't think I have enough.

721
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,220
I really don't think I have enough."

722
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,220
He keeps saying that to me.

723
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,220
"I don't think I have enough.

724
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,220
That's not enough."

725
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,220
And he's counted out like $400.

726
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,420
out like $400 like that's not enough money.

727
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,500
And then he looks at me like do you guys take EBT?

728
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,100
No we don't take EBT.

729
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,140
It's like OK that's fine then.

730
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:54,780
And then he gives me $200 and then walks out with once again another new takeout bag.

731
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,980
He now has another one added to his collection.

732
00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:07,220
I presume to go to the next restaurant down the street and do the same shit which is like the craziest thing about that story to me is he probably did that exact same thing to four

733
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,660
restaurants previous to like four different guys in the neighborhood.

734
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,580
So he just doesn't know how to count?

735
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:16,380
He might not know how to count.

736
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:20,020
It's not like a not like a funny way, but like like he's

737
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,380
he actually doesn't know how to count at all. Yeah. Yeah.

738
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:26,460
What do you think he does for a living, though, if he can't count

739
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,820
and has carries around $5,000 in cash?

740
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,140
I think he tries to fuck bartenders.

741
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,660
I think he maybe maybe he's a pimp.

742
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,660
Yeah, I think I think he might be a pimp.

743
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,540
I think you're going to be showing up in a in one of those like prank

744
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:49,100
shows and in a little bit, you got to be praying for a TV show.

745
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:52,340
This bartender was the nicest guy I've ever interacted with.

746
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:57,100
Yeah, because I just talked to him like 30 minutes like, No, man, you're cool.

747
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,140
You're cool.

748
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:01,500
In the new piece, it's all like, no, I see village Polish girls.

749
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,900
Yeah, that's where some of them would sit.

750
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,900
They're like, "No, I don't!"

751
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,900
"No, I don't like Polish girls, man."

752
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,900
Yeah.

753
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,900
Yeah, and then just like a bunch of

754
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
stinky people. I had a really stinky girl

755
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,900
come in the other day and get milk.

756
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:17,900
And she just got a glass of milk.

757
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,900
I hate stinky people.

758
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,900
Yeah, she was like,

759
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,900
dressed very nicely.

760
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Like, $3,000 bag,

761
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,900
all designer, but she was

762
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,900
the stinkiest woman I've ever had in the restaurant.

763
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:51,900
on

764
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,820
New York is the stinkiest place on earth.

765
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:56,740
Yeah, but you get used to it really, really quickly.

766
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,020
Like, you don't think it's the stinkiest place on earth?

767
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,140
No.

768
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,300
Well, what about in America?

769
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,020
And America?

770
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,740
I think it's also probably not.

771
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:09,180
I think it's top five stinkiest places.

772
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:14,180
Well, Texas, where they do like paper manufacturing and shit like that.

773
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,300
And that's their cash.

774
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:18,260
These are fucking dollars.

775
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,420
You live in fucking Dallas.

776
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,380
He wasn't.

777
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:21,820
I did not live in Dallas.

778
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:44,940
I've been to Dallas tons of times.

779
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,020
My mother's family's from Dallas.

780
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,860
I spent tons of time in Dallas.

781
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:56,980
Six months in Dallas just straight six months of six months in Dallas when I would do that a long story really where in Dallas

782
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,580
I

783
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:03,820
Spent like probably two months in Arlington and that's a shit hole. Yeah

784
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,140
And then the other rest of the other four months were in Fort Worth

785
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,100
Yeah

786
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,300
I was going all over the place in Dallas

787
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:22,300
There's nice parts of Dallas but Dallas as a whole is a shithole. Yeah

788
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:30,020
The walking that that's like what for this yeah, I did get the skateboard a lot which was sick

789
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,380
I was really heavy in the skateboarding. Yeah

790
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:35,260
Downtown Fort Worth is nicer

791
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:43,300
Now I'll rep for work I like San Antonio's my favorite place in Texas

792
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,620
The river

793
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:58,020
Houston is tied with San Antonio

794
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:07,060
Austin sucks awesome sucks

795
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:09,860
awesome awesome

796
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,980
Dope if you're gay and you cuff your pants

797
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:14,980
I don't cover my pants.

798
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:15,980
What do you mean?

799
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:16,980
Which is what you do.

800
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:17,980
I don't cover my pants.

801
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:18,980
The fuck are you talking about?

802
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,980
Let's look at him.

803
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:20,980
Let's look at him.

804
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:21,980
Notice those pant legs right now.

805
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:22,980
Pull those pants up.

806
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:23,980
Alright.

807
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,980
Oh, you're wearing Pyrex shorts, bro.

808
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:25,980
Yeah, I'm wearing Pyrex shorts.

809
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:26,980
You cannot call anything gay.

810
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:33,220
You cannot call anything gay while wearing Pyrex shorts.

811
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:37,100
I'm wearing fake Pyrex shorts from China, thank you.

812
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:38,100
Which is stinkier than New York.

813
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,100
Oh, your brain goes over to the home line?

814
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,100
Shouts out.

815
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,100
Boom.

816
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,100
Where's stinkier than New York?

817
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:57,100
the

818
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:02,940
the

819
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:05,440
the

820
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:16,320
the

821
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,320
the

822
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:25,360
the

823
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:30,880
That also doesn't sound that bad.

824
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,880
Where smells the best?

825
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,200
I think we're asking the wrong questioner.

826
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,200
Antarctica.

827
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,200
Fresh wind.

828
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,440
You think it's...

829
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:41,120
I think...

830
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,000
You can only really go bad, so you need the most neutral place, which is either of the

831
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,000
poles.

832
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,000
I think Washington.

833
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Yeah, I was gonna say Washington.

834
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It probably smells like fresh rain.

835
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
D.C.?

836
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
No, no.

837
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,200
No, like the Pacific Northwest.

838
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,700
Like, DC probably smells like fucking shit.

839
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,500
No, it smells mostly.

840
00:45:59,500 --> 00:45:59,700
Yeah.

841
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,100
Like Snohomish County, Washington.

842
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,700
Yeah.

843
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,300
Like wherever all these people live probably smells decent.

844
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,900
And I think some gorgeous woods.

845
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,900
Mm-hmm.

846
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,700
Gorgeous woods.

847
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,900
The Amazon.

848
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,100
The beautiful forest.

849
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:12,900
The Amazon.

850
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,400
It's pretty good.

851
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,000
Yeah.

852
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,100
I think the most beautiful flower garden.

853
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:16,500
What about a city?

854
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:17,300
A big city.

855
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,600
Maybe like Dubai?

856
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:20,300
Dubai probably smells of it.

857
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:20,900
No, Dubai.

858
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:23,180
You know, I really doesn't smell like anything.

859
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,980
It smells like hot dust.

860
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:28,740
They got no pipes in Dubai.

861
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,500
They have to carry the shit out of the city with trucks.

862
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:32,880
You know that?

863
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,060
I didn't know that.

864
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:35,500
They carry the shit out of the city?

865
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:35,860
Yeah.

866
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,540
They wipe their ass with their hands.

867
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:40,100
They have no sewers and no, no pipes.

868
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,340
What's it, what's a nice smelling city then?

869
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:42,900
Japan.

870
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:43,260
I don't know.

871
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,060
Japan?

872
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:44,340
Japan.

873
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:44,740
No.

874
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:46,740
Japan.

875
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:48,100
Japan the city.

876
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,220
Because of all the flowers, the cherry blossoms.

877
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:53,220
Wait, Rex, why do you fuck with Austin so much?

878
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:55,220
Why do you live in Austin so much?

879
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,220
Oh, I just had a cousin who lived there for a couple years.

880
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,220
When it was like the big hipster city.

881
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:01,220
Yeah, it's not that anymore though.

882
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,220
That's not what it is.

883
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,220
That doesn't mean there's not nice things to do in Austin though.

884
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,220
There's nothing to do in Austin.

885
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:09,220
Yeah, there's... you can...

886
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:11,220
I mean, literally, except for New York City,

887
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,220
NLA,

888
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,220
San Francisco,

889
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,220
Chicago.

890
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:18,500
No, fuck Chicago.

891
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:22,940
No, I literally like anything besides New York City and L.A.

892
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:27,780
is like, I've heard Philly, Chicago are pretty nice.

893
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,420
And then Detroit, Pittsburgh.

894
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,220
I like to talk about Austin's a tier two city.

895
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,420
Yeah.

896
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:34,980
Yeah.

897
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,380
We need tears like the Chinese do.

898
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:42,260
You need to fucking get them fucking actually right.

899
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,660
We need.

900
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,420
They got tears.

901
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:43,660
Yeah.

902
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,260
Do the Chinese actually have tears?

903
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:49,560
Like, yeah, it's like their credit is official, official system.

904
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:52,700
Like they've got tier one cities, tier two cities, two, three cities and shit.

905
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:59,300
I don't know how fucking far it goes, but the Chinese love to rank things.

906
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,700
That is like in their blood.

907
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,780
They love rankings.

908
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,200
They look to list Starcraft came out.

909
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,540
They were like, Oh shit, we can fucking rank.

910
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,380
They love ranking things.

911
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,060
Like you go back thousands of years and they're like top five

912
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,460
beautiful women in this city.

913
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:19,580
That's the type of shit they've been on for years.

914
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,580
I think I could make it big.

915
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:22,020
That is the craziest stereotype.

916
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:24,820
I feel like that's a thing a dad would say.

917
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:31,540
I don't know, my dad was once talking to me about a friend of mine and he was like, "Oh,

918
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:32,540
the Bulgarians, they're loyal."

919
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:33,540
I was like, "Oh yeah, I guess."

920
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:34,540
They're loyal?

921
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,540
The Chinese like to rank things?

922
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,540
That's crazy, man.

923
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:42,540
Chinese like to rank things? That's crazy man.

924
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:45,540
No dude, it's fucking true dude.

925
00:48:45,540 --> 00:48:48,540
I think I could make it big in a tier 2 Chinese city.

926
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,540
No you couldn't dude.

927
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:52,540
You don't think I could make it in a tier 2?

928
00:48:52,540 --> 00:48:55,540
You do not have the qualities that would make it.

929
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,540
What do you think you would bring? What are the traits you would bring?

930
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:01,540
You would be in prison after spending 5 days in a gaming cafe.

931
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:06,540
No, no, they let you die in there. They let you completely just be there for a day.

932
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,540
Not if you fucking suck at League, which you do.

933
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:09,540
That's not true.

934
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:13,540
You think you could make it like playing League? That's what you mean? Or just in general?

935
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,540
No, just make it in life, in general.

936
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:21,540
No, dude, you'd fucking log on to a Chinese server in literally any video game and you'd get demolished.

937
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,540
Yeah, definitely.

938
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,540
You'd feel so small. You'd feel like an ant.

939
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,540
I think I would not like gaming if I was in China.

940
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:30,540
In person, to be like what, 6'3"?

941
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:34,540
That's a crazy thing. I would need to pick up a new hobby.

942
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:39,540
You would be the tallest guy in all of China if you moved there.

943
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,540
But you would have to learn Chinese.

944
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,540
Yeah. That's the hardest part.

945
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,540
No.

946
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:45,540
No?

947
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,540
No.

948
00:49:46,540 --> 00:49:48,540
I would say he speaks a lot of Spanish.

949
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:52,540
I think I can get by just fine.

950
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,540
I think I got enough charisma in me that I can make it.

951
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,620
I think they will love me.

952
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:04,420
Do you think you would fit in eating all the food that is in China?

953
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:07,940
Like all the weird...

954
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,060
Like eating a monitor lizard and stuff like that?

955
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:11,060
Do you think you could do that?

956
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:15,660
Do you think you could fit through the door eating all the Chinese food?

957
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:22,820
Honestly, do you think he could handle the spice of Chinese food?

958
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,820
Of real Chinese food?

959
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:24,820
Maybe not actually.

960
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,360
I do remember seeing this one TikTok of a guy just like,

961
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:30,180
having, just killing a crocodile,

962
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,420
just like, just like skinning it and like cooking it.

963
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,860
And I was like, "That's just too much."

964
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,660
- No, that's a monitor lizard.

965
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,700
- That's nothing, dude.

966
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,700
I saw them fucking crack open like a fucking anthropod.

967
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:46,300
It looked like a giant roly-poly bug, dude.

968
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,660
They cracked that bitch open

969
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:49,900
and fucking ate the legs out of it, man.

970
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:50,740
This is insane.

971
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,380
It doesn't look like a natural creature.

972
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:54,220
Can't eat that.

973
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:57,720
It's gotta have like fur or wings or something.

974
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,320
I think a lot of fish are too weird to look at.

975
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,220
Yeah, tons of fish are gross.

976
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:07,220
They like to eat tons of like weird looking fish and I don't know.

977
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:08,220
Like the blob fish?

978
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,100
In Korea they like eating weird fish as well.

979
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,500
I think South Korea is fucked.

980
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:20,020
There's like a long history of Chinese famines and that's why they'll fucking eat anything.

981
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,860
they fucking don't have the hang ups like Chrissy and Americans eat the ground.

982
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,460
Eww, no, that's not food.

983
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:28,860
They'll fucking eat the ground.

984
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:34,900
Yeah, I'm 25 years old

985
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:37,600
and I only still eat chicken nuggets and cheese pizza.

986
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:38,640
I'm 25.

987
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:39,600
Yeah. Yeah.

988
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,900
Americans are like, oh, I have autism from GMOs.

989
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,600
Can I have chicken nuggets?

990
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,600
Yeah.

991
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,900
Like, let me eat.

992
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:49,220
Let me eat the first thing I see that's crawling.

993
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:52,620
Yeah, Chinese people are like, Oh, I'm gonna I'm hungry.

994
00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:53,820
Let me eat some delicious.

995
00:51:53,820 --> 00:52:02,180
OK, so this is solely Rex's opinion, and we're going to come after him.

996
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,060
You are you have complete free reign.

997
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,220
You can kill him if you want.

998
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,620
Yeah, Rex is in big trouble.

999
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,900
You just have to live stream it.

1000
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,300
If you we won't press charges if you kill Rex and you live stream.

1001
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,700
I'm saying this truly out of respect.

1002
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:16,340
No, I 100 percent.

1003
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,940
I do respect that.

1004
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,540
- Fucking eat dirt.

1005
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:20,380
- Out of...

1006
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,580
(laughing)

1007
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:22,620
I think out of all of us,

1008
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,300
I think Rex is the one that could make it

1009
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,880
in the tier one Chinese city.

1010
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,820
Any tier actually.

1011
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:29,380
- I don't think that's true.

1012
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,300
- I think he would.

1013
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,980
I think he's learned enough about the culture

1014
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:34,580
that he would completely fit in.

1015
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:35,940
- It's called Chow Chi.

1016
00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:38,180
- They'd be like, "Wow, look at that guy, he's eating mud."

1017
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,380
(laughing)

1018
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:44,020
- Chow Chi province, and it's dough pieces covered in soil.

1019
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:46,340
- That sounds good.

1020
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,900
- The soil's pretty good.

1021
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:52,420
Sounds good season it it's pretty good. Yeah, I've never heard of rock salt

1022
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,300
Okay, all right, you're right we do eat rocks

1023
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,900
Yeah

1024
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:01,900
candy

1025
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:06,380
Indecent thoughts

1026
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:14,500
You'll be a thought leader actually in China. Yeah, you think he could rise to the top of the CCP. Yeah

1027
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:23,060
There is a long history of like China file Jewish leaders in the CCP.

1028
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:28,500
It's like one of the first non-Chinese people in like Mao's like cadre.

1029
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:38,540
I would watch a two hour long like CCTV or not CCTV but um what's the news channel?

1030
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,020
Just like a news channel.

1031
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,020
CNN.

1032
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,020
No not CNN.

1033
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,020
BBC.

1034
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,580
Um, no, not BBC.

1035
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:48,480
It's like a live, it's just like live streams of shit happening.

1036
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,980
Oh, you're talking about like the people's, Oh, Oh, C-SPAN.

1037
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,860
C-SPAN.

1038
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,060
Yeah.

1039
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:54,580
C-SPAN.

1040
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:59,980
Just like Chinese C-SPAN of Rex giving a two hour long, like meeting just in,

1041
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:02,900
in very, why would you want to watch that?

1042
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,220
Passion Chinese?

1043
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,020
That would be awesome.

1044
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:08,460
I would love to wear that in a suit in front of like hundreds of people.

1045
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:10,340
I would watch that for two, three hours.

1046
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,500
If I don't even understand what you're saying.

1047
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:16,500
If I could take a really painful injection that taught me Chinese, I would move there immediately.

1048
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:18,500
One hundred percent.

1049
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:24,500
If I had to be tortured for a year to learn perfect Chinese.

1050
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,500
Yeah, you could just do that in a year.

1051
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:36,500
You could lock me up and starve me and shock my nipples with electricity.

1052
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,500
And then at the end I can learn Chinese.

1053
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:42,000
It takes so long to learn like good Chinese.

1054
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Oh, you mean like as if you grew up?

1055
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1056
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,000
If I could go through like hellish pain for like six straight months.

1057
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Six to eight, now you're moving goalposts.

1058
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah, you're completely stupid.

1059
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,000
If I could just fucking get hurt for one second to learn Chinese.

1060
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:09,000
I would take the most pain I've ever experienced in my life for a full day to speak fluent Chinese.

1061
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:10,000
That's it.

1062
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Yeah.

1063
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,440
Like if I was like completely immobilized, laying in bed, couldn't move, couldn't think,

1064
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,440
couldn't drink, couldn't eat.

1065
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,960
Yeah, like just shitting on myself and pissing myself.

1066
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,960
Yeah, just fucking miserable.

1067
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,960
Vomiting.

1068
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,520
But at the end of it I get to speak perfect Chinese.

1069
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:28,640
No, but you would think, you would think I already know Chinese.

1070
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,640
You would think.

1071
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,640
Lightening round, lightening round.

1072
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,560
What's the worst pain you've ever experienced?

1073
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,680
Dude, that's a difficult...

1074
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,120
I

1075
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,840
Don't know my little brother kicked me in the balls really hard one time. I

1076
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,000
Can't remember why I think I kill him too many times on Halo. I think I

1077
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,840
Sprained something in my leg once and it's really painful. I never broken anything

1078
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:56,840
Yeah, I've never broken anything either I could put a factory new I

1079
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:03,880
Broke a pinky toe, but I was like too drunk to really feel the pain. I just like slammed it into a wall

1080
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:07,780
The next morning it hurt like kind of bad, but it definitely wasn't the worst

1081
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:14,960
Was the worst thing? I don't know. I'm trying to think I got ghost pepper in my eye one time like ghost pepper

1082
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:24,280
When I say something else

1083
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:27,240
Probably

1084
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:30,080
Yeah, the pain of capitalism crushing my spirit

1085
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,720
Michael, you have to know something.

1086
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,720
One second, UPS guy at the...

1087
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,720
You have to know something.

1088
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,720
Yeah, I know some things about pain.

1089
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:44,720
No, I think it's either when my lung collapsed or...

1090
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,720
I have this thing where sometimes when I'm flying,

1091
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,720
and I'm in a plane and the plane is descending,

1092
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:54,720
they depressurize the cabin poorly,

1093
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,720
and I, from like an earlier filling in my tooth,

1094
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,220
my tooth have like a little pocket,

1095
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,900
a microscopic pocket of air in my tooth.

1096
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,900
And for some reason, the way like the pressure, the deep,

1097
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:12,380
the pressure change interacts with that,

1098
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,060
it like makes it feel like my head is about to explode.

1099
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:16,860
Damn.

1100
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,620
Fucking awful.

1101
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,740
It's not very good.

1102
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,740
So you just like,

1103
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:27,180
I was mostly asking the question as a joke because Noah was like for a day of the

1104
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,460
worst pain I would love to know Chinese.

1105
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:33,820
Yeah, but whenever we bring it around to you, you're like, yeah, my life

1106
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:37,500
completely sucks. I was born with no legs and no arms and no eyes.

1107
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,460
And pretty much I just suffered my entire my entire life.

1108
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,580
But I'm completely rich now, so it doesn't fucking matter.

1109
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:45,420
Yeah, I didn't even catch whatever.

1110
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:50,380
I'm going to assume I'm going to assume Mikhail said, like, I shut the door on my

1111
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:52,380
thumb one time. I got killed.

1112
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:53,820
He got killed.

1113
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,580
So do you like avoid as much as you can?

1114
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,980
in half by a samurai.

1115
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:01,880
That's not true.

1116
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:05,860
I guess like I don't remember the worst pain I've ever actually

1117
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:08,060
felt because like I chopped my thumb off when I was a little

1118
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:08,780
kid.

1119
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,880
What I had to like surgically reattach it.

1120
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,480
Were you on the ghost ship from the movie ghost ship?

1121
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:17,180
Yeah, do you have a scar?

1122
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:17,680
No.

1123
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:18,580
Yeah, I do.

1124
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:19,080
So

1125
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,660
you really can't see because it happened when I was 18 months

1126
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,680
old, but like you can definitely do it.

1127
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,980
Yeah, like right here.

1128
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,060
- You were 18 months old?

1129
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:28,420
So your mom chopped your thumb off.

1130
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,380
- What?

1131
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:31,740
- How did you chop it off at 18 months old?

1132
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,980
- I put it in a...

1133
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,620
- Blender, blender.

1134
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,940
- What was it?

1135
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:37,780
I can't really remember.

1136
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,620
- In a machine.

1137
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,740
- I mean, of course I don't remember.

1138
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,820
I was fucking 18 months old.

1139
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:46,140
So it was like a knotted pipe strainer or something

1140
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:48,140
or like pipe cleaner.

1141
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:51,020
And I like stuck my thumb in it and it like sliced my,

1142
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:51,940
I like pulled it.

1143
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,780
I pulled my thumb.

1144
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,180
- Oh, like razor wire.

1145
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,180
Yeah, yeah.

1146
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:59,180
Do you think you could be an assassin?

1147
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,180
Yeah, definitely.

1148
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,180
Like in a different life?

1149
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:02,180
In a different life.

1150
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:03,180
Yeah.

1151
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:06,180
I really wanted to join the special forces really bad.

1152
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,580
I mean, that was never going to happen, but you know, I definitely could have like been

1153
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,700
an infantry guy and then gone and just killed people for money.

1154
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:13,700
I think Noah could.

1155
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:16,900
I don't think Brian is stealthy enough.

1156
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:17,900
Souldy enough?

1157
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:18,900
Stealthy.

1158
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:19,900
I don't think he's stealth.

1159
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,900
I'm probably the most stealthiest guy that you've ever met.

1160
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:26,320
- You got caught doing your crime recently.

1161
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,880
- No, I didn't.

1162
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:29,720
- Yeah, you did.

1163
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:31,160
- I've never gotten caught doing any crime

1164
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,000
other than the one I said earlier.

1165
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,800
- You totally, you told me,

1166
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:38,440
I'm gonna tell the story, I'm gonna put you on blast.

1167
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:41,160
Brian completely stole so much shit from his old job.

1168
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:42,280
- I didn't get caught.

1169
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,240
- And he got caught by a coworker.

1170
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,160
- No.

1171
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,120
- That's not being caught,

1172
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,400
they knew he was gonna do it and they set his ass up.

1173
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,920
- No, I did not get.

1174
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,920
Okay, first of all, I've never stolen anything from any job that I've ever worked in heaven.

1175
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:02,920
Second of all, I did not get caught doing anything that is completely untrue.

1176
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:08,920
Okay, so you just alerted the sentries that were waiting there for you and you decided that it wasn't...

1177
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,920
I completely avoided alerting all of the sentries.

1178
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,920
You alerted the guards and they came to your position.

1179
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:18,800
It's just, it's not true. I walked on tippy toes.

1180
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:22,280
I'm the most stealthy, silent individual in the world.

1181
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,920
How did he get caught if I'm sitting in his Herman Miller right here?

1182
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,000
You're up.

1183
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,320
Hey, let's flex on him real quick. No, let's flex on him real quick.

1184
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,720
But this is so stupid.

1185
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,920
What are you sitting on?

1186
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:39,200
I asked Brian very nicely, can I have one?

1187
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,800
Can I pay you for shipping and have one? He's like, nah, I got two.

1188
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,160
And I can't.

1189
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:48,240
I said, what are you going to ship it?

1190
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,600
It's not feasible, bro.

1191
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,640
You can't ship a whole chair to Mexico.

1192
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,640
Put it in a box.

1193
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,080
That's going to be more than it's worth.

1194
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,480
It's going to be like seventy dollars to

1195
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:58,480
ship it. I'm not even kidding.

1196
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,600
It's going to be more than seventy

1197
01:00:59,600 --> 01:00:59,880
dollars.

1198
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,080
Yeah, it's going to be like two hundred

1199
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:02,080
dollars.

1200
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:02,560
Yeah.

1201
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,180
That's so cheaper than buying the fucking

1202
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,180
chair.

1203
01:01:05,180 --> 01:01:06,200
Have you checked on Craigslist?

1204
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,480
It's still used.

1205
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,740
You can you can go to office supply

1206
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,600
or office surpluses and get them for like

1207
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,600
fifty six dollars.

1208
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,440
in Mexico.

1209
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,280
Live in Mexico.

1210
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,400
You probably can't do that.

1211
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:16,300
Yeah.

1212
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,280
Come to America.

1213
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,680
Mexico, an entire building costs

1214
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:19,180
$10,000.

1215
01:01:19,180 --> 01:01:20,180
Bring it as your carry on.

1216
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:21,180
[Laughter]

1217
01:01:21,180 --> 01:01:23,880
Come take one of the ones from the office and bring it as a carry on.

1218
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,180
It'll be cheaper than shipping.

1219
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:27,680
Yeah, just rolling it down the aisle of a plane.

1220
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:28,980
It's just fucking bumping.

1221
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,680
I'm trying to shove it into the...

1222
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:33,180
I'm trying to shove it into the upper compartment.

1223
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:34,180
[Laughter]

1224
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:37,380
I need to have all of you come to my domain and you will understand everything in my life.

1225
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:39,880
I'm going to be coming in your domain for sure, bro.

1226
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:40,880
Yup.

1227
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:41,880
Yup.

1228
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:44,880
I don't know about all that.

1229
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:45,880
Uh-huh, you do.

1230
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:46,880
Alright.

1231
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:47,880
I do want to go to Monterrey.

1232
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,880
I need to paint myself like a Tigres fan.

1233
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,880
Badly.

1234
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:52,880
When are you coming down?

1235
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:53,880
I don't know.

1236
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:54,880
I need to get a new passport first.

1237
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:56,880
Bro, no one has any fucking passports.

1238
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,880
I have one.

1239
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:58,880
I just need a new one.

1240
01:01:58,880 --> 01:01:59,880
We're American.

1241
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:00,880
We don't need one.

1242
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:01,880
You fucking idiot.

1243
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:04,880
Yes, but only because I got it like two months ago.

1244
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,880
Oh, where are you going?

1245
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,880
To Bermuda.

1246
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:09,880
Whoa.

1247
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:12,080
Whoa, he's going to the triangle.

1248
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,080
He's going to go.

1249
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,780
I'm going there to explore the triangle.

1250
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:19,080
If he disappears, you're going to fly right in the middle of it.

1251
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,580
Good luck, Brian.

1252
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,680
You will never see him again.

1253
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:22,480
I'll leave it in the world.

1254
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:24,580
You should come down and visit me, man.

1255
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,080
Yeah, definitely.

1256
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:27,080
Pee for trip?

1257
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,980
I will house you.

1258
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:30,880
But only you, you cannot bring.

1259
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,680
Oh, don't say the name.

1260
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:34,280
Come on, man.

1261
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:34,880
Oh, shit.

1262
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:35,280
Yeah.

1263
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,180
Oh, yeah.

1264
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,080
All right, we're going to go.

1265
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,320
(laughing)

1266
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,160
- Bye. - Bye.
