00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,180
- You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,140
(explosion)

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:13,980
- Woo!

6
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,080
- Yeah.

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,480
- Back at it, back in the lab.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,120
- Ba ba ba ba ba.

9
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,560
- I feel, I don't know what about this thumb thing

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,840
walking around like this.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,560
- It's so you can hitchhike better.

12
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,760
- Well I have to be giving a thumbs up all the time

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,560
or else blood will pool in it 'cause it's still bleeding.

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,240
But it makes, I feel like a pirate.

15
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,200
- Yeah. - Kinda, yeah.

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,040
- 'Cause you have skirts.

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,720
- I feel like I have a hook hand.

18
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,240
- Yeah. - Yeah.

19
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,480
- Oh God, I feel like fucking shit right now.

20
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,440
- You feel like a pirate.

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,640
Your body feels like a pirate.

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,900
- I woke up too early, I went to bed at like four.

23
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:46,840
- Nice.

24
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,640
- I got home, I had all those white,

25
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,880
or truly hard seltzers left over from the show.

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,920
- You gotta go crazy with the seltzers.

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,880
- So I was like, yeah, I'm just gonna drink

28
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,640
like most of these.

29
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,280
- Just alone.

30
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,360
- Yeah, well no, I was drinking with Dom.

31
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,520
We had dinner, I made a meal,

32
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,560
and then we were like drinking.

33
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,080
And then I just realized, I just,

34
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,360
every time that I drink, I just keep drinking.

35
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,960
It's so easy with the seltzers,

36
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,680
'cause I'm just like, oh, I'm not drunk.

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,460
And then it hits me, and then I got too high,

38
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,520
and I went to bed at like four.

39
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,360
- Four?

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,200
- I went to bed at four, got up at nine,

41
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,920
because I had to clean up the apartment.

42
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,640
- And by the way, you did a bang up job.

43
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:36,320
Yeah. Spotless. I gave up halfway through. But yeah, I just feel like I've been farting all day

44
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,080
and it's been like just high octane just shit coming out of me. Just like nitrous, the energy

45
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:49,760
drink? Oh, they feel too hot coming out. I know that, yeah. I think it's, I ate a bunch of tzatziki

46
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:55,840
sauce last night. I ate a bunch of pita and tzatziki. Sometimes I walk around the art gallery

47
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,160
and I'm farting so constantly it's like I'm holding like a bowl of hot soup

48
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,360
and just steam is coming off of it. Yeah. Oh, I hate when it like you can feel it leave your pants.

49
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:13,200
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Your tight leather pants. Yeah. You see the bubble.

50
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:22,320
Yeah, dude. Man, the best is the still the fucking the infrared video and it's just the

51
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,440
the guy standing there and he farts, you just see the cloud of smoke come out.

52
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,440
It's so classic, too.

53
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Yeah.

54
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,440
Yeah.

55
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,440
It still, it makes me laugh every time.

56
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,720
I would say my farts run abnormally hot.

57
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,720
Yeah?

58
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Yeah.

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
I feel like sometimes they burn me.

60
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,240
Do you get like that when you eat garlic?

61
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,840
I eat a lot of raw garlic.

62
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,080
My entire diet for like two weeks has just been lentils and broccoli, which has been

63
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,080
just fucking me up.

64
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
Oh, yeah.

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,080
You know what?

66
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
And kidney beans.

67
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,080
I did have, I put a bunch of garlic.

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
I made like a vegan alfredo thing.

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
I think you're allergic to garlic. I've never heard of garlic makes you fart.

70
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,080
Yeah, maybe I am. I don't know.

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,080
Don't tell Patrick he's allergic to something.

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,080
Yeah, do not tell me I'm fucking allergic to something.

73
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,080
That's not going to go over well.

74
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,080
Yeah, what am I thinking? That's such a bad idea.

75
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
Yeah, you're going to come in tomorrow, he's going to have locked himself in the bedroom.

76
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,080
There's garlic everywhere.

77
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,080
Garlic has gone airborne.

78
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,080
I can't go outside.

79
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
I'll start farting if I go outside.

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,080
Yeah, there's garlic in the sauce I made.

81
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,040
garlic in the sauce I made and then there's I mean tzatziki is just mostly

82
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,080
garlic and yogurt. No it's mostly tzatziki. That's true. Yeah I didn't think about it like that.

83
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,200
It has to have tzatziki. Oh shit. I made a vegan tzatziki that's been in my fridge.

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,600
I had a different thing of tzatziki that I was eating. I have like a thing that big.

85
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,680
You're obsessed with that shit dude. It's so fucking good. It's just tangy. It's

86
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,240
is garlic yogurt. Yeah, but they don't have... There's no garlic flavored yogurt. Yeah, there's

87
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,520
no garlic flavored yogurt. Yeah, that's a very good point. It's the perfect sauce. What are

88
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:02,200
you putting it on? Pita chips, french fries. You just use it as a dip? Yeah. Oh, yeah,

89
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:07,600
that's good. Yeah, it's a good choice. It's better than hummus. I disagree. I replace

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,000
tzatziki with hummus all the time. Hummus is the bomb, dude. I don't know. A little sabra.

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I think I...

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,040
Yeah, I say I like Sabra.

93
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
The best hummus I've had is...

94
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,640
I don't like their hummus, but I like everything else about them.

95
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
I don't care.

96
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,640
Yeah.

97
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,640
I just support them as a brand.

98
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,120
Yeah, I buy all the hummus and I put it straight in the trash can.

99
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,520
I don't eat it, but I just want to make sure they get my money so they can do whatever

100
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
they want with it.

101
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
I donate straight to Sabra.

102
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
I have an active blue recurring donation for Sabra.

103
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,640
Yeah, $100 a week.

104
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Yeah.

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I've just been...

106
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,880
Last night I smoked weed, I didn't freak out.

107
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Oh, that's good.

108
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,140
- No, it was very nice.

109
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,480
- What was the context?

110
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,240
- I smoked weed and I didn't freak out.

111
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,080
- Where?

112
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,920
- In my room.

113
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,740
- By yourself?

114
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,580
- Yeah.

115
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,420
- When?

116
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,240
- Last night.

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,080
- No, when?

118
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:55,920
That's a when.

119
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,760
- Oh yeah, I can't tell 'cause of you.

120
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,600
- When?

121
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,420
- Accent.

122
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:02,000
- They're the same, yeah, I get made fun of.

123
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,960
Yeah, I always have.

124
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,840
- Rightfully so.

125
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,120
- No, it's a normal way to talk.

126
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
- No, it's not.

127
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,760
- It's normal to be from the South.

128
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,600
A lot of people are.

129
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,720
Most of the world is from the South.

130
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,560
- That's not true.

131
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,380
- Yes, it is.

132
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,640
Global South. - That's not true.

133
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,140

We have a paintball course inside the middle school.

And you can hit the teachers with the paintball.

146

We got homework and a homework bonfire.

Burn after reading it and doing it.

152
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,120
And you have to do all the homework and make all the problems.

153
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:06,040
I get to play paintball and watch it burn after reading.

154
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:10,360
On my side, we just finished filming Jackass 4.

Whoa!

156
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,560
We have a preview copy of it.

157
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,840
If you go to Caleb's side, all your hair will fall out.

158
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Oh no.

159
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,840
That's fine.

160
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,840
We have hair.

161
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
And Caleb thinks it's fine.

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,840
It is fine.

163
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,840
Caleb doesn't care if your hair falls out.

164
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,840
Yeah.

165
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,840
He doesn't care about you.

166
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,840
We have a cool wig selection.

167
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,000

00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,240
And nobody even gets weird about it.

171
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,720
No one will make fun of me for it?

172
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,920
Nobody will make fun of you.

say it? What? What? What word are you talking about? The N word. Which one is that?

176
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,640
What are you talking about? No, that you said you could say. Caleb doesn't even know what word he's talking about.

177
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,160
He said you could say any word on your side. He don't even know what word I can say.

178
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,640
Yeah, here you can you can say every word except that one. And I'm

179
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:06,640
I'm drawing a hard line in the sand.

180
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
I do like rules.

181
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
This sounds like a lot of rules, Caleb.

182
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,640
We have a nude beach and kids are allowed.

183
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,640
(Laughter)

184
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
Not, you can't be naked.

185
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
I'm not going to go there.

186
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,640
If you're a kid, you can come and you can watch.

187
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,640
I'm not a kid.

188
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,640
Yeah, you are.

189
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,640
I don't feel comfortable going to a nude beach.

190
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,640
That was my dream when I was a teenage boy.

191
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I was just like, "Please, a nude beach."

192
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
It's like 13 and up.

193
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,800
up. Never found it. We have a teen club where adult men are allowed in. Whoa! I don't want

194
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,080
to be on either of your side. You got a weird side, man. I didn't open it, we just have

195
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:48,080
it on the side. We have an original GameCube. I have a modded Wii. We have a Kinect. If

00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:17,600

201
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,040

202
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:38,720
about your music. He invented new standard tuning. I don't know what that means. He invented

203
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,720
power by Kanye West. Yeah, that's true. What the heck? I'm serious. He's the guy that goes

205
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, Swizz Beatz did that, okay.

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,500
Yeah.

207
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,000
Man.

208
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You fucking idiot.

209
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I just gotta stop drinking for a while.

210
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yeah?

211
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,500
I'm like...

212
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's unpack it.

213
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm so hungover.

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What's going on?

215
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No, it's just this whole weekend, like Saturday and then Sunday.

216
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Nice.

217
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Or yesterday, and now I'm just like, I'm shooting hot gas out of me.

218
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It'll make you, it'll fuck up your, your stump.

219
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yeah, I don't feel good right now.

220
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Feels, it'll fuck you up, man.

221
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yeah.

222
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,980
- I've been, I've just been getting home.

223
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,740
All my roommates all go to bed at like 9 p.m.

224
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,260
and I just like wander into my apartment

225
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,260

226
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,100
- Nice.

227
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,040
- And just like leave like a peanut butter

228
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,340
and jelly sandwich in the sink.

229
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,180
- Nice.

230
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,620
- And then fall asleep with the door open and I'm naked.

231
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,460
- Hell yeah.

232
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,280
- Yeah.

233
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,120
- Nice.

234
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:40,960
- That's how we do!

235
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,880
- I think I just got bad heartburn.

236
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,720
- Yeah?

237
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,540
- Yeah, I just ate that cookie.

238
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,660
No, I'm just disintegrating.

239
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:47,740
- He ate a cookie in front of me.

240
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,580
- You have cookie?

241
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,180
cookie out of his fridge and ate it right in front of me.

242
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,180
And didn't even offer you one?

243
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,180
It was one of those, um...

244
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,180
You had a fridge cookie?

245
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,500
Well, it was only a quarter of it left.

246
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
It was really weird that it was in the fridge.

247
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,500
It was only a quarter of it left.

248
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
It wasn't mine either.

249
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,380
Dom's gonna be pissed when she finds out I ate it.

250
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,260
Oh my god, she better not listen to this.

251
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,260
She's gonna, yeah, she listens.

252
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,660
You're gonna be in the dog house tonight, buddy.

253
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:10,340
I'll be in the freaking dog house when she finds out I ate her damn cookie.

254
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,580
I eat my dad when...

255
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,580
You ate your dad?

256
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,580
I ate my dad.

257
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,580
I ate my dad.

258
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:21,740
When my dad and my mom were like about to get divorced, that my dad would just sleep on

259
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,980
the couch like every single night, right?

260
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
Bollard.

261
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,380
And I would wake him up every day in the morning and I'd be like, "What happened?"

262
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,300
And he was like, "I just fell asleep watching Seinfeld."

263
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,580
And that's why he convinced me, they had a TV in the room, but they convinced me that

264
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,540
my dad liked Seinfeld so much that he had to sleep on the couch.

265
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Yeah.

266
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,140
Yeah, because he would just watch it well into the night.

267
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,140
Nice.

268
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
It's pretty awesome.

269
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
I was a pretty gullible kid.

270
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:47,400
Yeah, when they when they first got to like separated my dad

271
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,940
I just didn't see my dad for like a month and my mom was like I was like hey

272
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:57,580
Where the fuck's dad and she was like he's just cleaning the old house. Just getting it ready for the next person

273
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,860
I was like damn

274
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,060
Dad sucks at cleaning that's taking a long time

275
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,180
Get off your phone Patrick. Sorry my sister texted. I don't care

276
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:16,060
I went so I it was my nephew's brunch yesterday. Nephew's brunch. Nephew's brunch. I showed up there

277
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,580
three hours too late I

278
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:26,460
Showed up. I had that I still had that fucked up mullet. I gave myself. Yeah, I looked I didn't even I didn't notice it at all

279
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,860
It didn't look weird. It didn't look weird. I

280
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,620
Didn't even know you cut your hair since then. Oh, well, yeah

281
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:39,460
I just I came home Saturday and just cut both like I took the scissors and just cut I think one of them

282
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:42,340
I think there's a part on this side where I cut too close.

283
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,740
There's either this side or this side, but there's one where I cut way too close.

284
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:53,660
And then I showed up at my house and my cousin Ryan, who I barely see, was there and everyone

285
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,460
was like, "Yeah, look who it is."

286
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,740
They were all waiting for me to be like, "Oh shit, what's up dude?"

287
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,420
And I just went, and I just walked past him and just got a shit ton of water.

288
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,700
Damn dude, Ryan, damn, you got a shit ton of water too?

You can't lift them off his plate.

00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,560
I don't like eating breakfast.

314
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,260
If I eat breakfast in the morning, I'll throw up.

315
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,260
What?

316
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,260
I don't know why.

317
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,260
You'll throw up if you eat breakfast?

318
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Dude, I think you're pregnant.

319
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,260
Yeah.

320
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,260
Think you have morning sickness?

321
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:46,260
That sounds...

322
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,260
I don't know.

323
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,260
I just...

324
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,260
You'll vomit if you eat breakfast?

325
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
I don't know.

326
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,260
I can't hold down food in the morning.

327
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,260
That's insane.

328
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,260
You should go to the doctor.

329
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,260
I've never had breakfast sandwiches.

330
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I don't know.

331
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,260
I just...

332
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
I can't.

333
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,260
You should go to the doctor.

334
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Yeah, probably.

335
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,260
You have GERD or something.

336
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
You know what it probably is? I think that I can't eat breakfast

337
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,260
because I think that I'll throw up.

338
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,260
That's what it is. It's because you're doing

339
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:11,260
your hypochondriac thing with breakfast.

340
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,260
Yeah, I don't know.

341
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,260
Well, either way.

342
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,260
You're going to do what you did with weed and one day you're going to be like

343
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
"Guys, I love breakfast now."

344
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,260
Breakfast. I actually had

345
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,260
breakfast and it was fine.

346
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,260
It didn't even kill me.

347
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,760
I totally could. I don't know.

348
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,560
Just come get some breakfast with us sometimes.

349
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,960
No, I, I, every time I eat breakfast I feel like shit.

350
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,360
No, you know what it is? It's that I have to wake up in the morning to get breakfast.

351
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,160
Oh, see that's what, for me, I like, like today-

352
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,260
You're always awake at like eight though.

353
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,560
Yeah, 'cause the fucking, the cats wake me up.

354
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,760
Okay, then go to breakfast.

355
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,960
I don't know, I don't want to-

356
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,360
You're, you, I-

357
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,160
I like to stay in bed 'til like eleven.

358
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
Get up at eight and stay in bed 'til eleven.

359
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,760
You can get breakfast at eleven.

360
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,440
Eleven is a perfectly normal - I got breakfast at like 10 30 today.

361
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,280
10 30 is when breakfast ends.

362
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,080
At McDonald's.

363
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,800
Yeah, exactly.

364
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,360
Now they go to -

365
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,680
That is the perfect time to stop serving breakfast.

366
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,800
No, I like a late breakfast.

367
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,920
Well, it's all day breakfast now.

368
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,960
Because I also - I completely skip lunch most days. I'll eat a late breakfast.

369
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,680
How do you skip -

370
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,640
Like a snack.

371
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,920
Yeah, I'll skip lunch sometimes.

372
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,880
Skip lunch, eat an apple.

373
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,920
But a good lunch.

374
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,040
Good lunch. What do you - what to use like a good lunch though?

375
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,840
A good lunch is like a sandwich.

376
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
What kind of sandwich?

377
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,840
Like roast beef.

378
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,840
But breakfast is too heavy.

379
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:32,840
But I can do a french dip which needs a jus to make it fucking go down.

380
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,840
Like you're doing a hot dog eating contest.

381
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,840
So? French dips are great.

382
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,840
Breakfast sandwiches are great, dude.

383
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Yeah, I like a lox bagel sandwich. I'll eat that.

384
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:46,840
I don't like breakfast if it tastes like lunch.

385
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
You're a monster, dude.

386
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,920
a monster. You're like Michael Jackson. No. Yeah, you're a monster. No. He was a breakfast

387
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,520
monster. He was never technically proven guilty. Yeah, you know who else hated

388
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:08,720
breakfast? Who? Mr. Pedophile. Yeah. And Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Jimmy Savile.

389
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,800
Dr. Rapist, he hated breakfast. Now I'm not saying anything about you, but

390
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:18,760
Professor Racism thought breakfast was... he thought breakfast was for them.

391
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:24,800
Yeah. Yeah, so I just want that to... Wait, why would breakfast being for them be a

392
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,920
bad thing? Well, I mean, I'm saying that's what he thought. That's why he didn't eat

393
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,480
breakfast. I'm not saying that that's what you think. Yeah, but that's

394
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,920
someone who doesn't eat breakfast often. They might be racist, they might be

395
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:40,600
pedophile, they might be... I heard Hitler never ate breakfast. Hitler ate breakfast so much.

396
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,960
No, he didn't. Yeah, he ate fucking German. He ate little streusels. No, he didn't. No, he didn't. He tried to he actually banned streusels.

397
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,960
That's why there are no...

398
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:55,240
Okay, hold up. Try to find a streusel. Try to find a streusel. Hold up. Yeah. If I had like

399
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,400
Toaster streusel, I would eat toaster streusel for breakfast. So you like dessert?

400
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:04,640
Dessert? So I knew it goes... it goes lunch, dinner, dessert, breakfast.

401
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,120
I ate dessert. You ate dessert? I just ate a cookie right in front of me.

402
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,440
This is like the first time watching The Matrix. It wasn't even your cookie. You stole a cookie to eat it.

403
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:22,320
So now we're introducing a new category which is just food and then there's food that is around.

404
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:28,880
So where does food that is around rank in your ranking? Oh I don't care. Is that number one? No.

405
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:37,040
No? Food that is around does not count. What? That's still food. It's food, yeah. That's a meal.

406
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:42,800
It's not lunch or dinner or anything. It's just like getting you... It's snacks. Yeah, it's snacks.

407
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:49,760
Okay, so where do you rank snacks? Snacks is better than lunch. Oh my god. So you rather...

408
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,280
If I called you up in the morning and I say, "Hey, do you want to get breakfast?" You say,

409
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,760
"No, sorry. I hate breakfast." I say, "Do you want to get some snacks?" You'd say, "Yeah."

410
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,760
That's the best.

411
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,760
You would jump, you would leap out of bed like fucking...

412
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,320
Snacks can be anything too.

413
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
It's just like lunch.

414
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Lunch can't be anything.

415
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Lunch can be anything.

416
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
You can get breakfast for lunch.

417
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,320
You cannot eat oatmeal for lunch.

418
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,320
Yeah, you can.

419
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
No, you can't.

420
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
No, you could.

421
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Yeah, that's just...

422
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
You could.

423
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
It's not a good decision, but you could.

424
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Oatmeal for lunch, that's fucking insane.

425
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Okay, then you can eat anything for breakfast too.

426
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
You could eat anything at any time of the day.

427
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,320
You could eat a tuna sandwich for breakfast.

428
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,320
Yeah, you could.

429
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
You probably do.

430
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,320
But you wouldn't like that, because it's in the morning.

431
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Because it's breakfast, yeah.

432
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,320
Do you like eggs?

433
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:25,600
wouldn't like that because it's in the morning. Because it's breakfast, yeah. Do you like eggs?

434
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,400
No, I barely like eggs. Okay, all right. I only like scrambled eggs. Okay, never mind. I was

435
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,560
gonna say this absolves you. Or the McRiddle eggs. Okay, so that's two kind of eggs that

436
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:44,400
you're fine with. Do you like bacon? If it's in a sandwich. I'm gonna leave, dude. This is

437
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,760
completely insane. I feel like you dosed me with something. This is so crazy to talk to

438
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,920
to you about breakfast. What? It's not. I just don't like breakfast. You're an alien dude.

439
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:02,440
You're not from planet earth. You're from planet lunch dude. You're an alien from planet lunch.

440
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,760
So. And that's not good. That's good. It's not dude. Lunch is good. Hot dog? Hot dog

441
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:16,760
is. Hot dog hamburger. God you like a fucking wet hot dog? No. You like boiled hot dogs?

442
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,240
If I could eat a Chicago style dog every day for lunch, that would be the dream.

443
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
That's insane dude.

444
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,480
Your breath would smell so bad.

445
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,720
It would, but I would be full of good shit.

446
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,320
If I could eat breakfast for every meal, I probably would.

447
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
I would too.

448
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
The cheapest meal.

449
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,320
Cheapest.

450
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,560
And just like, I like it.

451
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
I can eat eggs every meal.

452
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,560
If I could eat, okay.

453
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,120
If I could eat pussy every meal.

454
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
Just sandwiches.

455
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,440
Just like, just good sandwiches.

456
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,440
Just a sandwich.

457
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,320
Your whole diet is different sandwiches.

458
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
So what's the opening sandwich?

459
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,320
The best sandwich?

460
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,320
The opening sandwich.

461
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,300
Like you wake up, you go, you head to the fridge, you take out your sourdough loaf.

462
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,660
What do you put in between those pieces?

463
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,660
Probably just cheese.

464
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,260
Probably just gonna make a grilled cheese.

465
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,540
Grilled cheese for breakfast.

466
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
What's that?

467
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:07,480
You literally, you live the life of fucking Tom Hanks in Big.

468
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,860
You just wake up and you eat grilled cheese and you play with your toy cars.

469
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,580
What is wrong with that?

470
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,300
Grilled cheese for breakfast, what's wrong with that?

471
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Yeah, it's like cheese and toast.

472
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
It's a baby meal.

473
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
No.

474
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
Grilled cheese is a child's meal.

475
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
No, not if you use like different cheeses.

476
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,300
So you think if you do more than one cheese, that's an adult meal?

477
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Yeah, but if you do one slice of American cheese, that's a baby meal.

478
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,300
If you are eating whole wheat with American cheese in the middle.

479
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,300
Mac and cheese or grilled cheese, both baby meals.

480
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,300
No, not if you bake the mac and cheese.

481
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,300
Baked mac and cheese is not a baby meal.

482
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,000
I'll go with baked mac and cheese.

483
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,960
Baked mac and cheese is a side.

484
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
That is not a main dish.

485
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
What?

486
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,240
No, you could have it for a main dish.

487
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
I wouldn't have it.

488
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,400
You could just throw some pulled pork or bacon in it and then it's a fucking meal.

489
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,240
No, that's a fucking experiment.

490
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
That's an epic mealtime.

491
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
Lobster mac and cheese?

492
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,800
Lobster mac and cheese I will never eat in my life because--

493
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,960
It's good, but I hate it as a concept.

494
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,200
It smells so bad.

495
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,200
Yeah.

496
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
It's cheese and fish.

497
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,560
It's disgusting, but I like it.

498
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,240
Cheese and fish are-- there's a reason God put those two things on opposite ends of the

499
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
like opposite elevations.

500
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:14,740
Yeah.

501
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,240
You know, they should never meet.

502
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,740
Cheese comes from the tops of mountains.

503
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,240
Cheese comes from goats which live on top of mountains

504
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,240
and fish actually come from the bottom of the earth.

505
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
Bottom of the mountain.

506
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
Yeah, the bottom of the mountain.

507
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Inside of the earth.

508
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Yeah.

509
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I don't like...

510
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Filet of fish, what about that?

511
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
What do you...

512
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,740
Because cheese and fish should meet,

513
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,240
but sometimes a filet of fish do be hidden.

514
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,240
The filet of fish...

515
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,240
They have the perfect amount of cheese on it.

516
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,240
One piece.

517
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,500
it's it's half a slight yeah yeah it doesn't even cover the corners yeah

518
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,260
yeah

519
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,000
uh...

520
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,240
playfish issues is the exception

521
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,000
i really wake up you need real cheese what's the lunch sam about goldfish

522
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,320
goldfish

523
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,880
called this season fish and i don't think it's she's i don't think that can

524
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,200
use that with real goldfish to make it

525
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,040
well they use it the use of goldfish mold with a three-year-old real goldfish

526
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:09,120
it was a little bit of a cut they put real goldfish inside it and i hope not

527
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
They do.

528
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah, me too.

529
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
I hope not.

530
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
They do.

531
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
The second, okay.

532
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
The second launch.

533
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,280
The second Italian job from 7-Eleven.

534
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,280
Solid choice.

535
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
That's your choice though?

536
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,280
I mean, an Italian sandwich.

537
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,280
Your ideal sandwich.

538
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,480
No, no, okay, you couldn't eat sandwiches all day.

539
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,840
That's what you said you could do!

540
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
I said if I could.

541
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,840
I'm just thinking.

542
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
I'm saying you can.

543
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Oh, okay.

544
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,840
So now I have the ability to eat sandwiches.

545
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,840
So your choice is the Italian job.

546
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,080
Okay, then I'm changing it from grilled cheese.

547
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,680
I thought I was I was trying to time everything out not so that I don't feel sick

548
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:46,520
Sandwiches make you sick. So you're no I just

549
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,020
Sick, it doesn't you know, you know, you know

550
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,440
Breakfast I feel like

551
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,760
Breakfast gives me heartburn the worst just because of how greasy everything is like a good breakfast

552
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:05,680
Just has a shit ton of grease in it like hash browns. That's true. Oh, yeah, I think it's a grease problem for me. Mmm

553
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,720
So like it's bacon and like eggs and it's all cut in the same grease.

554
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,720
That's him dipping fries in tzatziki sauce.

555
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,720
What? What is wrong with that?

556
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,720
I don't know, but grease just fucking makes you feel bad.

557
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
That's a pretty greasy meal I would say.

558
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,720
Oh yeah, but that's at the end of the day.

559
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,720
I can take fucking heartburn medication.

560
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,720
You can't do that in the morning.

561
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
No, I could, but it's just annoying

562
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
because then I have to spend the rest of my day with heartburn.

563
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,720
One day when you die,

564
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
in like a car accident,

565
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,720
or like a sandwich accident,

566
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,040
sandwich accident. They're going to cut your brain open and all of our questions will be

567
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:47,080
answered. There will be some growth in like some part of your brain and the doctors will

568
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:51,840
explain it to me and Cameron and we'll be like, "Oh, that was why he was completely

569
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
crazy."

570
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,720
Hold up. I got to get a fucking... I got to get a Tums.

571
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,800
Damn, just having the conversation. You said grilled cheese for breakfast and that did

572
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,620
make me feel bad.

573
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,540
My body started slowing down.

574
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,260
I feel like I'm in bullet time right now.

575
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:17,340
Patrick picked a list from the Odyssey Online today.

576
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,580
For those who are unaware of the Odyssey, do you guys know about it?

577
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,580
It's like Medium.

578
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:31,940
It's like Medium, but if your thing gets to the top of the page, you get like 20 bucks.

613
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,920
uh... it's a good thing that i was saying what patrick in new york and

614
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:37,720
beautiful Italian couple drinking a nice pinot grigio. Nice and cheap. She's feeling on his pinot grigio

615
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:42,600

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,640
Yeah it's like a tumbleweed. Yeah he's holding wine and she's holding a tumbleweed. She's got

617
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,640
that Jordi Vero thing. She's a cowboy. She touched a meteorite. Now she's growing grafts on her.

618
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,160
I don't know what you're talking about. It's like that. Have you guys seen Creepshow? Yeah no I

621
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:14,200
Jordy, vero the name of the fucking thing. I think the whole breakfast conversation got us heated up and we need to relax

622
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,680
Yeah, I think we're all

623
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,880
I think we're all a little prickly about the breakfast stuff still so let's

624
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,360
Let's focus on the job at hand, right?

625
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:28,120
Um, it's a typical saturday night and you're going out on the town to grab some food and maybe some drinks

626
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,560
So you start walking into Kilroys or Chili's to make your tummy happy.

627
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:36,040
And the moment you get in you see this gorgeous specimen sitting at the bar alone.

628
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,440
That sounds-

629
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,640
*laughs*

630
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,200
Some specimen.

631
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:38,840
Yeah, like some-

632
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,040
Yeah, a giant booger.

633
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,040
*laughs*

634
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,680
Specimen.

635
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,360
Damn, what's up specimen?

636
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,680
Damn, you want fine ass specimen.

637
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:51,800
There are other girls in the room, but you feel this special force that attracts you to her that

638
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,800
you've never felt before. You just feel like you gotta make a move or you're gonna regret it for

639
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,440
for the rest of your life,

640
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,640
but you don't know what to say and you're hesitating.

641
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,560
The time is ticking and you see other dudes

642
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,920
getting ready to make their move

643
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,680
to make an impression on the lady.

644
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,920
It's now or never.

645
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,600
Yeah, the fucking, the guys at Chili's,

646
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,440
they're like hyenas, dude.

647
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,840
They just circle specimens.

648
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,840
- If you're a guy and you're at Chili's,

649
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,640
it's like you get sprayed with horny juice

650
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,600
as soon as you walk through the door.

651
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,120
You're going in there, you're barking at women like a dog.

652
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,640
- I'm at Chili's looking for specimens.

653
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,480
- You're sitting there, I'm barking at some specimens.

654
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,080
Yeah, after this I'm gonna go to Chili's and find that specimen.

655
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
Hey!

656
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
Yeah.

657
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
Hey!

658
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
Hey!

659
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
Hey!

660
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
Hey!

661
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Hey!

662
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
Hey, what's up specimen?

663
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
I'mma experiment on you.

664
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
And then she starts to walk away and you go, "Hey!

665
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
Right!

666
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
Right!

667
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
Right!

668
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
Right!"

669
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,080
One.

670
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
Margaritas!

671
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
Two.

672
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
When I get to five!

673
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
Two and a half.

674
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,040
Well, in simpler times, brute force, wealth, or just plain physical attributes may have

675
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,680
helped others score some points.

676
00:28:53,680 --> 00:29:02,000
Yeah, that's a weird inclusion, I'll say. And win their potential date's heart. However,

677
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,640
in today's sophisticated society, just having a cute face or good body doesn't cut it anymore.

678
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,320

He's obsessed with the fucking bus.

744
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,560
Why is he obsessed with the bus?

745
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,560
He's the bus driver.

746
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,560
Yeah, he's...

747
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,560
I thought of all these while I was driving the bus.

748
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,560
Bus to bus.

749
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,560
I was using Tinder on my phone on the bus.

750
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,560
He tried, as people like tried to put their money in the machine, he was throwing these

751
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
at him.

752
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Yeah.

753
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,560
The second thing I was like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to get a new phone."

754
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
I was like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to get a new phone."

755
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,560
I was like, "Oh, I'm gonna have to get a new phone."

756
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:17,300
people like try to put their money in the machine he was throwing these at yeah

757
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:21,840

759
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:35,420

765
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,340

No. Yeah.

769
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,060
No.

770
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:21,340
Yeah. Were these helpful, by the way, to pick up college-aged girls?

771
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,580
Are they helpful for you?

772
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,620
No, I didn't write this.

773
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,580
Oh, so what about younger girls? Do they work on them?

774
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,020
I don't know. You wrote the list.

775
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,460
I did not write the list.

776
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:35,020
I was asking. I asked you a yes or no question. Do these pickup lines work on high school-aged

777
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,740
girls? No.

778
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,300
No, they don't?

779
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,540
(laughter)

780
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,380
- Gotcha!

781
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,620
(laughter)

782
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,020
- Damn.

783
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,500
- Yeah, do your parents know you're a pedophile?

784
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,340
- What?

785
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,160
- You know that?

786
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,000
- Do you guys know you're gay?

787
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,180
- You guys are still mad at me over the breakfast thing,

788
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,740
but look at this, look what you're not getting.

789
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,900
- Oh my, please, please, please, please, please.

790
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,740
- Please, oh my God.

791
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,580
- You don't get this.

792
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,900
- Patrick pulled out his penis.

793
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,740
(laughter)

794
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,300
- Look what you're not getting.

795
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,140
- My pee pee.

796
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,340
- Please, please, please, please.

797
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,660
- Number six.

798
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,020
You must be a small amount of red phosphorus on a wooden stick because we're a match.

799
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
Fuck you.

800
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,020
Yeah, you match.

801
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
Fuck you.

802
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
Shut up.

803
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
That's pretty good.

804
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
Please, I will do anything for it.

805
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
Take it, take the pedophile thing back.

806
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,540
Everything's back, you're not a pedophile.

807
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,740
I'm serious.

808
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,020
I can see you crossing your fingers.

809
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:23,020
My fingers are not crossed.

810
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,740
You're crossing your fingers behind your back.

811
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:25,740
They're not crossed.

812
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:26,740
Please, please, please.

813
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
He's crossing his eyelids, dude.

814
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:29,420
You have a drug that I'm addicted to.

815
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,820
Can I use it?

816
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,820
He blew a smoke cloud that said no.

817
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,820
When?

818
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:38,820
Oh, I caught it.

819
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:41,260
Go, Patrick, read number seven or something.

820
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,820
If I had a penny for every person that swiped right on me, I'd have 46.

821
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,820
Damn.

822
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:53,300
The most important thing is I'd spend it all on you.

823
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,300
You're worth 46 cents.

824
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,300
That's all I'm willing to-

825
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,300
Hey, bitch, you're a couple of pennies.

826
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Yeah, bitch, yeah.

827
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:03,180
You're worth fucking, you're worth two Ed, Edd n Eddy jawbreakers.

828
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:04,180
Not even.

829
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,980
Yeah, you're worth like, what was it, they just wanted a quarter?

830
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Yeah.

831
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,020
It's so funny, those kids did so much for a quarter.

832
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Damn.

833
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,860
They would spend all episode trying to get a quarter.

834
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:18,780
And they never got even, the jawbreakers were too big too.

835
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
Let me just say.

836
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:20,780
Well that's the other thing.

837
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:24,980
If there's a jawbreaker that big, it would cost a thousand dollars.

838
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,980
You know?

839
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,980
But they gotta-

840
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,580
You'd be licking that thing until you die.

841
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,580
You might lick it until you die.

842
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,580
And how do they fit it in their mouths?

843
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,580
They couldn't die.

844
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,580
Because they are in purgatory.

845
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,580
Is that a fan theory?

846
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:42,580
I love those dude. The rugrats are all inside of Charles Manson's head or whatever.

847
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
Yeah.

848
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
Spongebob is the...

849
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:49,580
Spongebob's are actually germs on top of Hitler's mustache.

850
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
Well what I heard actually is Spongebob is...

851
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,580
He lives under the sea.

852
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,580
Bikini Bottom is like basically

853
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:02,460

Sandy Cheeks woman.

859
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,700
Most of them were, most of the characters on Spongebob were gay.

860
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,380
The only one who is confirmed not gay is Plankton because he has a computer wife.

861
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,420
Well no, that's pretty gay.

862
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:38,180
That's why my cousins weren't allowed to watch Spongebob because it was too gay.

863
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,580
I mean how many lovers and joysticks?

864
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:46,100
You think the computer has lovers and joysticks and you know what those are.

865
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,580
So does a guy.

866
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,100
Joystick look like a peepee.

869
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:05,620
Yeah, sometimes, yeah, I watch, I watch TV and I get a red penis.

870
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:12,420
When it's after 11 p.m. and they play the Girls Gone Wild. When you go to channel 206. When I

871
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:16,420
accidentally flip to an extends commercial. Oh. And they show the hot girl. It's curtains for my

872

00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,940
almighty gods of tinder I am not worthy. Imagine being a woman and

875
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,600
getting these messages. Imagine being a woman and nevertheless she persists

876
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,880
You know what I mean? Even with all these freaks and creeps online.

877
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,880
Yeah.

878
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:52,520
Imagine being Spongebob on a dating website and what you'd... I mean, you probably wouldn't

879
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
get any swipes.

880
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,520
No, tons of... No. A lot of people would try to fuck him for the clout.

881
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
Yeah.

882
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
Yeah.

883
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520

889
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,640
I went to Bikini Bottom.

890
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,800
I fucked Spongebob. He's actually very down-to-earth when you meet him. Yeah he's

891
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,000
actually way cooler. He's a psycho on the show but when you meet him he's just

892
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,320
kind of chill. The money like never changed him. Yeah. He still lives in

893
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:34,440
that same pineapple. Now we're moving to IRL date pickup lines. I feel like these

894
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,560
ones are gonna be way worse. Oh they'll be so much worse. He's got a picture of

895
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:44,680

898
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,160
character because in the movie he he he lives with a gay guy he also does kung

899

fu and he does come through racist which is racist he plays dance dance

900
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,960
revolution yeah which is also racist yeah it's also racist I'm told by Patrick

901
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,720
Patrick tells me that pretty often.

902
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,120
Yeah.

903
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Is that it's racist to play Dance Dance Revolution?

904
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:16,000
Yeah. I go to Dave and Buster's and I stand there and I protest Dance Dance Revolution.

905
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:16,560
Yeah.

906
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,320
I stand there with a sign.

907
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,880
Because there's no white avatars in the game.

908
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,080
Yeah.

909
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:22,640
Yeah.

910
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,680
It's great. Dance Dance Revolution is racist against white people because the characters are a

911
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,000
shadow.

912
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,520
There's not a guy who looks like me.

913
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,640
Yeah.

914
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,160
It looks like my shadow.

915
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,800
Yeah.

916
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,120
There's a - I knew a kid who lost like a hundred pounds playing Dance Dance Revolution.

917
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,600
Really?

918
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,080
Yeah.

919
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,120
That's racist.

920
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:39,840
It was very racist.

921
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,560
It's racist.

922
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,920
Wow, he is racist.

923
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,160
Yeah.

924
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm gonna put him in jail.

925
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,440
He should go to jail for that. I just thought, I mean, just what a good - it's - that's like

926
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,120
the silliest way to lose weight.

927
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:49,760
Yeah.

928
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,600
Yeah, and it doesn't make you - like, it doesn't make you good at dancing. It just makes you

929
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,440
really good at Dance Dance Revolution.

930
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,000
Right.

931
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,880
You know what I mean?

932
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,160
You have to - if you want to go dance somewhere, you have to imagine the triangle.

933
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,160
the rose.

934
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Like dancing to a revolution.

935
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,880
Walking into the club, like yeah, dressed like Night at the Roxbury.

936
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,760
Just fucking, just dancing in a perfect square.

937
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,320
Just putting your feet like.

938
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:18,120
Yeah, holding on to two bars, you bring a walker, then you just start beasting on the

939
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,960
ground.

940
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,640
Only moving your feet, just breathing super, super heavy in your date's face.

941
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:25,640
Yeah.

942
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,200
Oh, I'm going to do that.

943
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,040
That's my pickup line.

944
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:34,280
The first IRL pickup line is, "If you had to binge watch a show for a few days, what

945
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
would you go with?"

946
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
What?

947
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
That's it.

948
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,280
That's your opening line?

949
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,960
You're supposed to say something sexual.

950
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,960
Yeah.

951
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
You know?

952
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,640
If you had to binge suck my penis for a few days, would you want to suck my penis in balls?

953
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:48,640
That's true.

954
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,240
And then you hand her a note in class.

955
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,280
It's like circle yes or no.

956
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,280
You say that out loud, then hand her a note.

957
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,120
And then you walk away because you can't handle the rejection that might happen.

958
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,040
bartender says, "What's that note? Do you want to read the whole bar? What's on that note?"

959
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,920
The next one is...

960
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,320
He sees him slipping something into the girl's drink. He's like,

961
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,440
"Oh, oh, do you have enough to share with the rest of the bar?"

962
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,240
Number 10, what film can you quote all day, every day?

963
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:20,960
Probably Elf.

964
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:25,280
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

965
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,800
Santa.

966
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Yeah, I know tons of elf quotes.

967
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,800
"We wish you a merry Christmas."

968
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
"We wish you a merry Christmas."

969
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,300
"Happy holidays."

970
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
"Dad!"

971
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,300
Yeah.

972
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
What else is an elf quote?

973
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
"I'm Will Ferrell."

974
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,800
"I'm elf."

975
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
"Hey."

976
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,300
"Hey, bitch."

977
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,800
"Hey, how you doing? I'm Will Ferrell."

978
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,300
"I'm a Will Ferrell."

979
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,800
"New York, the Big Apple."

980
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,800
"Oh, it's me, Jon Favreau!"

981
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
[laughter]

982
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,800
That's my elf quote.

983
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
"It's Jon Favreau!"

984
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
"Oh, how you doing? It's me, Jon Favreau!"

985
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,800
Forget he's in that movie, he's a doctor.

986
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:01,080
He's also the director, the doctor of the movie.

987
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
The doctor.

988
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,840
That is the doctor in film, the film doctor.

989
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:10,440
Number 11 is, "I wish I was cross-eyed so I could see you twice."

990
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
No.

991
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,440
But he is completely cross-eyed.

992
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,120
He doesn't realize it.

993
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,560
"Damn, I wish I had fucked up eyes."

994
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,560
Yeah.

995
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,800
His eyes are crossed outward.

996
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,680
He's looking at two different girls on either side of her.

laugh and a free drink. I don't know if that's the worst. I don't think that's the worst case scenario.

1020
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,040
It is a much worse case scenario. My dad, I guess he said this to my mom once, he said, "Hey, do you

1021
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:41,960
want to go to my place and fuck and have pizza?" and then he said,

1022
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,960
"What's the matter? You don't like pizza?"

1023
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,360
Because she said no.

1024
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,760
She said no to that.

1025
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,560
And now they're married.

1026
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,200
Now they're married. They've been married a long time. They have a bunch of kids.

1027
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,720
Yeah, well, because he said, "What's the matter? You don't like pizza?" And she was like, "Oh,

1028
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,880
I guess that's a really good point." All right, I do like pizza.

1029
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,560
Okay, I guess I do like pizza.

1030
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,360
You have a point there.

1031
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,560
And then he made her pregnant.

1032
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,120
He filled her up with pizza.

1033
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:08,840
Oh, come on.

1034
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,680
That's your mom, dude.

1035
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:12,580
Leave that to me, man.

1036
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,860
I'm not supposed to say shit like that.

1037
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,860
Don't ever say "fill your own mom up."

1038
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:17,860
You're disgusting, dude.

1039
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:19,860
What the fuck?

1040
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:20,660
It's not gross.

1041
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,660
It is gross.

1042
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:23,660
It's objectively gross.

1043
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,660
Jesus Christ.

1044
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,660
No, it's a fake.

1045
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,660
Unless she's your stepmom, then that's awesome.

1046
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:28,660
Yeah.

1047
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,660
Your Chinese stepmom.

1048
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:31,660
You could never fill up a woman with pizza.

1049
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,660
Not even your mom.

1050
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:38,660
Fill her up like how much pizza could your girl hold?

1051
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:47,660
this bitch full of a gallon of pizza. Yeah, my bitch can hold two tombstones

1052
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,500
worth of pizza.

1053
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,780
And I'll save it for later.

1054
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,460
Yeah. Yeah.

1055
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,740
The next one is

1056
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:58,740
do you eat or drink?

1057
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:03,700
Because I think we should do one of those things together soon.

1058
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:08,300
Do you eat or drink?

1059

To Mr. Trump.

1067
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:46,040
"Why guys sometimes prefer video games.

1068
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,740
Why I would still wear my high school."

1069
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:51,980
"Our society's impending doom."

1070
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,460
"If you could share your mind with."

1071
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,820
"Firearms are still a necessity despite the huge mistakes of Colin Kaepernick."

1072
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:01,660
Oh my god.

1073

1088
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:59,460
This just sounds like you're talking to your friend's mom.

1089
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,460
Yeah.

1090
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,460
You know?

1091
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,780
I would not tell my friend's mom.

1092
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:04,780
She has great taste.

1093
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,780
Me neither.

1094
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,660
You clearly have great taste in kids' friends.

1095
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,460
Because I'm here, bitch.

1096
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,460
Do you like any restaurants?

1097
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,380
Oh, he has the disclaimer at the end.

1098
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:16,180
You should have put this at the middle, at the beginning, dude.

1099
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,180
The middle and the beginning.

1100
00:48:17,180 --> 00:48:20,620
It says, "In an IRL situation, just saying these lines would be weird.

1101
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:24,420
Therefore, make sure you go up to them and introduce yourself first, then use these pickup

1102
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,500
lines to start and carry on interesting conversations.

1103
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,020
Okay, I want to point out that this next, the last two

1104
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,620
have, both of them have the word "shall" in them. Yeah.

1105
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:39,300
They both say "shall we". The first one is "I would love to be the reason you

1106
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,580
delete dating apps forever". Oh my gosh. Shall we have a drink this

1107
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:47,460
weekend? And then the next one is "shall we flip a coin? Heads you go out

1108
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:51,540
with me, tails I go out with you". See that one's at least recognizable as

1109
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:56,420
like a pickup line. Yeah. You know. Shall we? Shall we? The rest of these are... Just go

1110
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:02,180
up to a girl and go, "Shall we?" Shall we? All of these read like a bat, like you took a pickup

1111
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:07,700
line and translated it to Chinese and then translated it back. Yeah. Yeah. Is that the

1112
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:11,140
end of them? I guess that's the end of them. Let's see what else this guy has on here. Oh,

1113
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:17,060
well we already... Well, we should definitely look at... I just want to look at guns being a necessity.

1114
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,260

I wonder if he's made any money off of this stuff.

Awesome.

1150
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,120
Hopefully.

1151
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,840
He deserves it for the other one.

1152
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:57,040
Go to Odyssey, search meal rankings.

1153
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:58,040
Okay.

1154
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:01,040
Look up lunch.

1155
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,480
I'm just gonna search meal rankings.

1156
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:04,040
We're not gonna look up lunch.

1157
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,040
Why?

1158
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,040
Just look up lunch.

1159
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:07,040
Because lunch would be like the...

1160
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,040
It's skewed towards you.

1161
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,040
No.

1162
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:10,040
Yeah, exactly.

1163
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,040
We're trying to be agnostic here.

1164
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,280
Let's see.

1165
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,520
Vegetarian meals ranked by my bacon loving dad.

1166
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,880
Whoa.

1167
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,320
I'm not seeing any meal rankings here.

1168
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,280
45 Disney dogs ranked from the worst to the goodest.

1169
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,280
No.

1170
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,280
Yeah.

1171
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,960
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day for students.

1172
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:34,960
Click on it.

1173
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:35,960
No, fuck you.

1174
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,960
You guys said we couldn't look up lunch.

1175
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:37,960
It's the most important meal of the day.

1176
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:38,960
I didn't look up.

1177
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:40,000
We couldn't look up lunch, but.

1178
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,680
starts your day off on the right foot improves memory and concentration and

1179
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,960
increases energy. That's why you're stupid. Three reasons. So give us the reasons why lunch is good.

1180
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:55,200
Lunch is good because you can get a sandwich. You keep going back to the sandwich. You can get a burger.

1181
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,680
A burger? It's a different kind of sandwich. It's just you can get a salad. Basically you could if

1182
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:06,800
you if you want dinner for lunch go ahead. What's you want breakfast for lunch go ahead you can't

1183
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
can't eat dinner for breakfast.

1184
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,760
So it sounds like you just like, well first of all, you can't, boy you were saying, you

1185
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,120
wanted to eat a grilled cheese for breakfast and you say you can't eat dinner for breakfast,

1186
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:19,600
you just, you just like food and you think that you can only eat any food in the middle

1187
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:20,600
of the day.

1188
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,600
Yeah, you can.

1189
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,360
Once you break out of society's cage and you realize that you can eat any food you want

1190
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,400
at any time of day, you are going to love breakfast.

1191
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,640
Patrick was trained his whole life to, because he had a feeding time of one o'clock when they

1192
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,400
would fill up his trough with slop and big pink slop and slime. I did not eat big pink slop. You did man.

1193
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:43,840
You would eat a chunky... I'd eat regular slop. No you'd eat... no you like pink slop which is girl slop.

1194
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:48,400
No because once you blend all this shit together it becomes brown. No but you would get specifically

1195
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,520
pink slop because you like to do girl stuff. No. And girls are a pink color and you like to eat

1196
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:00,160
pink slop. No. Yeah I don't know what to tell you. Why would... how do they make the slop pink first

1197
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,000
of all. It just comes out that way. Yeah, because they put it on the girls.

1198
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,640
It's because girls make it and the pink comes off of their skin and goes on to...

1199
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,920
The pink comes off of their makeup. Yeah. And it goes, it falls into the slop. And then you eat it at home.

1200
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:16,160
And you eat it in a big, you eat it in a big bowl. And you put it on your face like it's makeup.

1201
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,480
Right, you eat it in a trough. I don't eat slop in a trough. You eat slop in a trough like a urinal at a

1202
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,880
NASCAR event. No. Yeah, and you pee in on the, you pee in the big, the big trough with the ice in it.

1203
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,600
Yeah, when Patrick goes to a NASCAR event, he sees the trough and he goes, "Ooooh!"

1204
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,960
He sticks his mouth in it and he eats up all the ice and all the water.

1205
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:31,960
The ice?

1206
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:32,960
Yeah.

1207
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,960
Why did they do that?

1208
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:34,960
That's funny.

1209
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,760
I will admit, peeing on ice.

1210
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,560
We should go to a NASCAR race.

1211
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,560
Yeah?

1212
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:41,560
We should go to the one?

1213
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,440
Did you see Trump flying Air Force One over a NASCAR?

1214
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,440
That's pimp.

1215
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,440
That was sick.

1216
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:47,440
Yeah.

1217
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,440
It sucks that that's cool.

1218
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:49,440
It's cool, dude.

1219
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,440
So cool.

1220
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,960
NASCAR, why don't they call it Fast Car?

1221
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:54,960
By Tracy Chapman.

1222
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:01,960
(singing)

1223
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,960
Patrick likes music by people named Tracy.

1224
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,960
Yeah, that's like the pink slop of music.

1225
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,960
Do you guys know that's a black woman?

1226
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,960
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1227
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:13,960
Tracy Chapman, Fast Car?

1228
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:14,960
I had never heard that.

1229
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,960
I thought it was a white guy until like three years ago.

1230
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,960
Did you know Banana Pancakes, that's a black woman too.

1231
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,960
No.

1232
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:20,960
Yeah, it is.

1233
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,960
I thought Tracy Chapman was a white guy.

1234
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:25,280
No, did you know Ashton Kutcher is a black woman?

1235
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,280
Yeah man.

1236
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,760
Did you know Caleb is a black woman?

1237
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:30,760
You did know that?

1238
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,760
Yeah I did know that.

1239
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,760
How did you know that?

1240
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:33,760
Because it's not true.

1241
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,760
Dude you just said yes to anything.

1242
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:39,120
Oh but did you know that song Bobby Caldwell?

1243
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,120
No.

1244
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,120
What you don't do or what you do for love?

1245
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,120
No.

1246
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,120
No music you have ever listened to or heard.

1247
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,120
Yeah that's true.

1248
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,120
No.

1249
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,680
Yeah, well that guy, that's a white guy.

1250
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:50,400
Well then it's like, I guess you wonder where I've been.

1251
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:54,520
I bet you when you get into a bar with a touch tunes I bet you go fucking crazy.

1252
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,280
Yeah, I did once.

1253
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,280
I bet you fucking.

1254
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,240
We did at that pool place in Sherman Oaks.

1255
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,640
Yeah, you loaded up with like $15.

1256
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,160
Yeah, you spent so much money on that.

1257
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,800
That was $10, that wasn't that bad.

1258
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:07,800
No, you spent more than $10.

1259
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:08,800
You spent a lot of money.

1260
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:09,800
No, I spent $10.

1261
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,800
Yeah, you spent more than $10.

1262
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:11,800
I remember that.

1263
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:12,800
Dude, you spent $180.

1264
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
No.

1265
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,360
You spent $300 and then you had to buy your plane ticket back.

1266
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:17,360
Yeah.

1267
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:18,360
No.

1268
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:19,360
Yeah.

1269
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:20,360
You did.

1270
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,280
by my plane ticket but you actually sold your plane ticket in order to spend more

00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:06,440
voice but he has to save it because he's going on American Idol next week. Yep. That's right.

1282
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:12,520
And let me tell you what buddy, you're going to Hollywood. I've been waiting for them to say that

1283
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:18,600

1287
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:45,080
His sunken in eyes. Yeah. Yeah, he looks like a corpse. Yeah, he looks like the Bye-Bye Man.

1288
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:52,100
yeah cuz he's constantly saying bye-bye to bad contest exactly yeah bye-bye

1289
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:58,940
goodbye bye-bye oh there was one I remember now you get off my fucking

1290
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:05,980
stage now he fucking owns yeah Simon Bowles he was so mean compared to Randy

1291
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:13,060
and Paula Paula was too nice Randy too cool mm-hmm Simon just right no Simon

1292
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:17,140
too mean but when they would have like a guest judge like Christina Aguilera or Steven Tyler or

1293
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:25,380
Steven Aguilera those two. Honestly if I had to get a blow job for one of them I don't know which one

1294
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:31,220
I would choose. Christina Aguilera or Steven Tyler. Probably choose Randy just because he seems nice.

1295
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:37,860
I would just imagine he was live. Do you guys know Tyler Stevens? No. I made him up. How is he doing?

1296
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,860
I went to high school with a Tyler Stevens.

1297
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,860
Really? I made a you didn't I made him up.

1298
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,360
I just said I made him up so you couldn't have gone to high school with them.

1299
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:50,860
Okay, so the the judges for the new American Idol is

1300
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:56,860
Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie and also some someone named Bobby Bones

1301
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:58,860
is the in-house mentor.

1302
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,860
Remember the fuck Bobby Bones?

1303
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,860
It's a skeleton.

00:58:01,860 --> 00:58:03,860
Yeah, Ren and Stimpy are the new judges.

1305
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:04,860
That would be sick.

1306
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,860
