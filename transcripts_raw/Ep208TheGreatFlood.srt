00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,680
that's ever happened to us.

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,120
- You walked in and bought,

14
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,960
you went to go buy paper towels.

15
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,560

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,600

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,020

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,880
You don't need any money.

32
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,040
- Everybody requests a lot of money from that Venmo,

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,520
make it really annoying for him for saying that.

34
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,360
- Yes, please do that.

35
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,080
That is what you get.

36
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Start requesting tens of thousands of dollars.

37
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,760
- If you're listening to this right now.

38
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,840
- No, don't do that either.

39
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,360
- And Venmo, Cameron Fetter, 16.

40
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,840
- What, why would it be 16?

41
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,680
- A random number.

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,720
- The year you were born.

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,560
- I was not born in the year 16.

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,000

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,080
Maybe it's Caleb Pitts the Comedian.

54
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,160
It might be that too.

55
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,880
I don't remember.

56
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,320
I think I tried to do that

57
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,240
and it was already taken or something.

58
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,080
Caleb Pitts.

59
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,240
- Is somebody impersonating you on there?

60
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
- What's up?

61
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,040
- Is somebody impersonating you?

62
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,600
Their name is Cameron and their @ is Nabira Truth

63
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,680
and it's not you.

64
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,760
'cause I sent them a video and they said,

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,360
"Boy, did you send me this?"

66
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,440
- It is crazy.

67
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,780
Yeah, I don't know.

68
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,320
I don't go in for all that social media shit.

69
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,040
I'm more into books, talking with your friends in person.

70
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,240
- I don't fuck with that anymore.

71
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
- Yeah. - Yeah.

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,640
- I don't go in for that bullshit.

73
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,160
- Basically, I've gotten my screen time

74
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,040
sub 20, 30 minutes a day.

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,880
- Really?

76
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,080
- Yeah, so I'm basically just kinda cruising through life,

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,480
actually putting my head, looking at what's in front of me,

78
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,320
got forward emulation going on.

79
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,960
Meanwhile, my my screen time on my my sub my submarine way up. I've been

80
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,480
taking it out on many voyages my screen time. Yeah, you're talking to talk

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,240
and Tom. I'm talking. I'm an old old old captain accent. I've been

82
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,380
writing for my submarine that I've been taking out on voyages. Is there

83
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,680
what they screen? Yeah, it's a radar is I'm scared. That doesn't a radar

84
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,240
doesn't count by for screen time. Well, you tell them that because I still

85
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:13,480
get the notifications every week. He's got it. He's got it.

86
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,640
He's got a test your

87
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,440
Your screen time is up to 24 hours a day.

88
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,780
Look at what, Jesus Christ, what app am I using?

89
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,480
Radar, 23 hours, 45 minutes, Google Maps, 15.

90
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,600
- Yeah, I'm gonna take my submarine to Taco Bell,

91
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,360
to McDonald's, to Europe. - You know, they should set it up

92
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,580
on Google Maps so that it's like a radar,

93
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,320
and it blinks and you see everybody else

94
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,160
who's using Google Maps. - I saw the Google

95
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,960
Street View car, I think I might be on the street

96
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,360
and it's pretty soon. - You gotta, you better,

97
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,720
I bet you showed your nuts.

98
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,720
- I did a rock on sign, nice.

99
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,460
- I can show you, I was at home this weekend.

100
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,880
My old apartment building, I am in front of

101
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:58,840
my old apartment on Apple Maps.

102
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
- Really?

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
- Yeah.

104
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,340
- What are you doing?

105
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,920
- I'm looking at, it looks exactly like Sasquatch.

106
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,760
It looks exactly like the photo of Bigfoot.

107
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,600
- What?

108
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,420
You went Bigfoot on Apple Maps?

109
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,260
- I'm blurry.

110
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,920
- Then it's not you?

111
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,320
- That is unmistakably me.

112
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,360
- Oh, that's you, man.

113
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,600
(laughter)

114
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,400
- Oh my god.

115
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,320
- If you want to see it, 200-206 Harvard Ave on Apple Maps.

116
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,120
- How did you even find that?

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,720
- I remembered, I was showing my girlfriend,

118
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
I was like, I think I'm on Street View here,

119
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,880
and then I looked around the street on Apple Maps.

120
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,720
- And there you are, clear as day.

121
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,120
- You can also see me in the door of my old apartment.

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,960
Like I'm looking out.

123
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,780
- You're in both?

124
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,520
- I'm looking out at the car and I'm like,

125
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,360
is that the Apple Maps car?

126
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,280
can see like my thing of my I went to check if I if they put me on Google

127
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,720

Listen, hey, what's her name? Beyonce's got Halo. What's her name? Beyonce's got Halo.

Halo Top. Jordan Sparks has Battlefield. What's next? You're gonna sing

135
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,020
call of duty. Jordan X Nintendo has a Super Mario Bros. theme song in one of their games.

136
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,320
Yeah. Wouldn't that be like...

137
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,820
Something like that.

138
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:45,820
That's not it. No.

139
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,320
No, that would be... I don't remember which game that's from.

140
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,620
Speaking of, we were talking about Talking Tom earlier.

141
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,320
You were talking about Talking Tom earlier.

142
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Well, yeah, there's a new streamer.

143
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,820
For one second you weren't even talking about it, you just said it.

144
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,620
There's these streamers and they do these videos where they call Talking Tom and Talking

145
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:05,500
been at 3am and my nephews are obsessed with this shit and I couldn't get away from it

146
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
all weekend.

147
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,500
It's called lanky vision.

148
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,220
So why are you putting them on then?

149
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,740
I'm putting them on because I got really mad because they sell these lanky vision surprise

150
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,340
boxes at Walmart and they were saying the only way to save yourself from talking to them at

151
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,140
3am is to go and buy a lanky box from Walmart.

152
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,580
That's just smart marketing.

153
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,580
You're getting mad at that?

154
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,100
I'm getting mad because there are plenty of other ways to save yourself from talking Tom at 3.

155
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,460
I would say that's clearly...

156
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,780
Like maybe I don't know, going to a podcast about this live show.

157
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,860
I would say that that's clearly some kind of like

158
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:47,300
democratic leftism way of trying to get people to not buy firearms and have like legal protection

159
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,940
of themselves. They're like, "Oh no, you don't need a firearm."

160
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,620
Because what else is at Walmart? Guns.

161
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,820
Yeah, you don't need a firearm.

162
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,100
You don't need to go to that aisle.

163
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,660
You just need to get a box to defend yourself from talking Tom.

164
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,860
Buddy, if Talking Tom knocks on my fucking door at three in the morning, he's gonna meet my steel.

165
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,180
He also-

166
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,220
I'm blowing him away.

167
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,620
Yeah.

168
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,180
They also said-

169
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,060
My katana.

170
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,340
And I have my shotgun filled-

171
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,900
Katana.

172
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,980
Listen, two birdshot, one buckshot, right? Pump, pump, birdshot, pump, pump.

173
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,260
Yeah, I mean, it's my katana.

174
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,300
My nunchaku.

175
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,220
Yeah, he's gonna be my nunchaku.

176
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,100
They said they're gonna-

177
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,380
Just completely blow his head off with my- the chain on my nunchucks.

178
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,300
I had to register my forehead as a deadly weapon.

179
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:26,020
Because I was headbutting. I mean, because look at it. It's got a point. Look at that.

180
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,340
They said that there was exe dripping off of Talking Tom at 3am which showed that he was glitching.

181
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,220
He was glitching at 3am?

182
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:40,900
The thing that they were saying was that, I forget, I think it was called the Blippi glitch

183
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,540
or something?

184
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,860
He's gonna, I'm gonna glitch him with my Blippi.

185
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,580
Yeah.

186
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,260
Honestly, Talking Tom, these days he's getting up there on my list of my ops.

187
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,100
I did see, I did see in that one video you can kind of see Blippi's glitch,

188
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,660
this spot in between his bum and his

189
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:01,940
ball holders. Remember when Sharon Stone's blippy glitched on that? No, that was her

190
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,620
glitch. It was showing her glitches. The glitch is what it's got the space between

191
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,700
your finger and your backside. What's up? She was showing her that's a guy. I was

192
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:14,020
rubbing my blippy. That's a blippy is a man. You're rubbing it rubbing your dick

193
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,980
like I was rubbing my bill. I found I accidentally I stumbled on one of those

194
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,420
those those child like four children streamer type guys. He stumbled on a

195
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:31,220
child. I stumbled on a child. I was trying to see. He stumbled on a child and he

196
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,220
started streaming all over. You were watching these for a full weekend. I was

197
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,820
watching them because my nephews would not let me have control of the TV. You

198
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,420
said it yourself, you could not tear yourself away from it. I wanted to watch

199
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:45,860
Paramount Plus and all their awesome shows. You know how you can buy like on

200
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,180
eBay, you can get like a cursed doll or like a cursed like antique or a cursed

201
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:56,180
I was trying to think like a little John cursed antique. I'd love to curse and

202
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:01,180
okay, that's fine. I'm listening. I'm listening. I'm listening. I just want

203
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,180
trying out new. I'm trying new ways of you can what you could try it out

204
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,180
during your own thing. How do you ad lib your own speech? You have to figure

205
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:14,180
it out. Okay. Well you finish your story about it. It's not a scary doll. Not

206
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,180
even that good. It wasn't even about a doll. Okay. Well, you basically ruined

207
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,060
whole flood vibe. I think the flood is tearing us apart by making you be so

208
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,740
mean to me that I want to cry. See I know and then I try you don't even acknowledge it.

209
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,740
Well because I don't know what this is. I don't know who's adlibbing. That's my adlib.

210
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:33,580
Oh double it. Double it. Remember that from double it. So it's not your adlib then.

211
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:39,740
Remember it from what? My speech pattern. Remember from your songs that you make?

212
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,180
Oh no I don't. But I thought that maybe it would be great if I could find on

213
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:47,180
on craigslist or ebay. If i could find in the day, well ebay also they have a

214
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,900
whole section called metaphysical, really all cursed and magic items, but i

215
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:56,500
really wanted to find either cursed legos or a cursed bionicle or like a

216
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,300
something like that to be there isn't there's none of it and i found that

217
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,140
out because i googled cursed legos and all i found was like a streamer for

218
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,500
children who is like playing gmod and was like i found a cursed lego car in

219
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,340
the game and it's just like it's a twenty minute video of them being like

220
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Lego car is cursed. Oh my god

221
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:19,060
Yes, literally like what I found out also the word cursed is ruined forever because of cursed pictures

222
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Yeah people when you search for a cursed

223
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:27,260
Bionicle all you find is cursed bionicle pictures someone put a dildo on a bionicle right? Well, you know, I want a bionicle

224
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,260
That's like

225
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:36,100
Okay, so it's the original all the streamers all those like children streamers talk to it's the most annoying

226
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:42,700
I literally was not allowed if I change the channel they'd be like what no and like it was they

227
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,020
Think they glue. It's like the fucking like silver shamrock thing

228
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:54,060
Yeah, Halloween three these kids cannot stop watching these fucking streamers, and they all talk like they're like like oh

229
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,380
This is completely

230
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:02,820
Haunted yeah, actually see the exe glitch inside of I don't want to see a haunted glitch

231
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,200
I want to see a haunted real item. Yeah, I'm with you there. Yeah, I

232
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,260
We got to stop talking about streamers cuz it's making you guys do

233
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:17,180
Annoying voices I've ever heard in my life doing these impressions. Yeah. Yeah, they're really hurting my ears that I was just trying to

234
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:25,500
Baby fit when you made your scooby-doo, so I don't remember throwing a hissy baby through it

235
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,980
I remember bringing up cogent and logical points

236
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:34,720
Oh, you can't say yeah like little John cuz I hate rap. Oh, that's a flop

237
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:54,340
We should be putting more

238
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,180
- Yeah, we need some new-- - I'm crying.

239
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,220
- All right, we need to change. - I feel like those annoying

240
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,820
little guys who start podcasts and have the soundboard

241
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,940
'cause it's how radio is.

242
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,420
- We have, I will say the flood has given us a--

243
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,420
- Woo! - Damn!

244
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,900
Holy shit.

245
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,220
- Hold up.

246
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:13,340
- The flood is giving us a good opportunity--

247
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,820
- Homer. - To make some changes

248
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,140
'cause it's a, think about the great flood

249
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,940
in the Bible, biblical story. - NPC cartel.

250
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,660
- Or it's MPC. - Canon.

251
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,260
The-- - Danon.

252
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,940
- Danon. - Danon.

253
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,680
- The flood was the beginning.

254
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,060
- The flood was Danon's beginning.

255
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,580
- Listen, the flood is a new beginning, right?

256
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,300
Everything is a new, right?

257
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,140
And so--

258
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,020
- I wish Jonah's Ark was in here.

259
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,420
- We have Joe in the office.

260
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,540
- Yeah, that's true.

261
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,380
- I don't know what Novark is.

262
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,140
- I wish Joe was here to help clean.

263
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:42,980
- Yeah, he was.

264
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,820
- He was.

265
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,340
- I'll say this, he did his piece more than you.

266
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,180
- Oh, really?

267
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,000
- Yeah, no, he did a pretty good job.

268
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,840
- I didn't know he was here.

269
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,460
Well, then I wish Alex was here to help clean.

270
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,100
- Alex has a job.

271
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,940
- Oh, right.

272
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,780
- Yeah.

273
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,080
I wish Pierce was here to clean up his mess. He doesn't even work here.

274
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:04,380
I wish Patches came here to clean up his mess. Patches, I think, also does a good job. You have to hold your mic a little closer to your face.

275
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,780
Sorry, I was... He's taking it away. I'm prepped for my... Damn! Yeah, I know you're ready.

276
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:12,780
That was so good. You sounded like a cartoon volcano. That was a good one.

277
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:18,780
Jesus fucking Christ. I'm about to explode! Oh my God. You should be a voice actor.

278
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,780
We should try... Okay, what about me? Do you think I should... Okay, wait. Go ahead.

279
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,980
this, but you think i could be a yoshi actor.

280
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,920
See that was better that was so much better and i thought that because he has

281
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:33,640
a little bit deeper of a voice, you wouldn't be able to reach that. What

282
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:38,440
are you a phone? No, that's what okay that's what yoshi does when he throws an

283
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,620
egg, but i'm more interested in this new character now. Okay, we've heard yoshi

284
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,000
before and also we've never heard yoshi before cameron peter really and can you

285
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,940
do some more sound

286
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,900
I have to say I like these sounds a lot better when they're in the middle of someone else

287
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,420
talking I feel like it really elevates them.

288
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:02,060
It almost creates like a soundscape you know.

289
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,380
Can we put this in stereo and maybe we could have.

290
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,580
Yeah I think we could master this in 5.1.

291
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:11,940
Yeah I feel like can you imagine dude just cranking up sitting in front of a full speaker

292
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,220
system a guitar system.

293
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,380
That would have been really good.

294
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,380
Nice.

295
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,900
This is quality stuff.

296
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,900
people are really gonna like this. No one's gonna be like "Holy shit!"

297
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,900
That's disgusting. What? That almost sounds like a mouth.

298
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:31,900
Have you ever watched the roast battles where the guy keeps hitting the

299
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,900
"Holy shit" button too much? No. Is it cool?

300
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,900
No, because it sounds exactly like "Holy shit!" I think that

301
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,900
roast battles, I mean, I just don't... I used to be so into

302
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,900
those. You used to be in a roast battle? Really? Like the ones at the stand?

303
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,900
Really? You used to go watch all those on YouTube?

304
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
I watched those on YouTube in Laconia.

305
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,400
Nice.

306
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,900
In Lakes Region Community College. I had nothing. I would leave them on in the background.

307
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,900
They're all just skinny white guy, fat black guy.

308
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,900
I used to be really into physics.

309
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,900
Or sometimes they'll get a fat person and somebody who has a clear disability and they'll make them go at each other.

310
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Yeah.

311
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,900
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy that, there's that one roast comic who's in the wheelchair. He's good.

312
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,340
- Roast battles were more like a Naruto tournament arc

313
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,140
where everyone has a clear power,

314
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,900
you have a superhuman ability,

315
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,620
and there's 32 of them and it's a bracket.

316
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,620
- That's what they try to do at the stand or whatever

317
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,460
by putting the Hadouken sounds and shit,

318
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,780
but it's just annoying. - Do they have anybody

319
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,460
who can control sand though?

320
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,380
Or maybe who is-- - I don't think they have

321
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,900
a sand man. - Oh, who is a Japanese

322
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:34,740
warrior? - They do?

323
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,340
- They say if it's at the Apollo,

324
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:38,660
the sand man can come and take you off the stage.

325
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,300
- True, that's true.

326
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,420
- He's got a cane.

327
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,300
- Uh-huh.

328
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,140
Can you imagine that happening to you, bro?

329
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,660
Dude, imagine you get a tomato--

330
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,580
Can you imagine you going up at the Apollo,

331
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,940
you're doing Greg Peppers.

332
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,780
Me going up, okay.

333
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:52,060
Yep, you're doing Greg Peppers.

334
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,500
I'm not doing that soundscape.

335
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,780
(laughing)

336
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,620
And you get pulled off the--

337
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,820
I remember the first time I ever saw

338
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,660
Bo Peep or whatever.

339
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,460
You know when you're like a kid and you--

340
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,220
Something that I did in college,

341
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,540
material I wrote in college.

342
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,380
Absolutely.

343
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:08,420
And I'm just like, get off the stage.

344
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,700
Yep, that was a good one.

345
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,540
That was a good one.

346
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,360
That was a good voice.

347
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
like a kid and you see something for the first time and you it's the like just

348
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,400
the for like the first time that I saw like I the cane pulling somebody off

349
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,960
stage was a funny thing it was in Shrek or a Shrek to or whichever Shrek that

350
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,360
happens in yeah happens to I think the three blind mice and I'm everything like

351
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:31,080
oh that's a Shrek thing it's a Shrek joke that yeah I think it happens in you

352
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,680
start to know Roger Rabbit you start to notice tropes tropes trope that breaks

353
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
your fucking brain mm-hmm embrace your heart honestly

354
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,680
- Yeah, yeah. - Break your heart 'cause it's like there's no originality.

355
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,680
- And it breaks their creativity most of all, though. - What the hell?

356
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,180
Are you telling me there's a hero and a love interest and--

357
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:47,180
Wait, I recognize that trope. That's scary teeth.

358
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,180
That's when the monster has sharp and scary teeth.

359
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,180
- That's from "Jaws." - That's been--

360
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
That's been in millions of movies.

361
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,180
- It's in the actually starting to enter your room. - Where's your originality?

362
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:59,180
Oh, this is a trope. This has been in every single one of these war movies I've watched.

363
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,180
This is the Hitler trope.

364
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:03,180
- Yeah. Oh my God. - He's in every single--

365
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,680
What are you doing in here?

366
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
That was the fast and damaging bullet trope.

367
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,420
bullet just killed this character completely fast and damaging what's up

368
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:11,040
Alex.

369
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,000
I didn't even hear him come in because I'm wearing these headphones and you

370
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,400
guys your eyes are just shifting behind me and it scared me so bad. I thought

371
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,760
something was happening. You had a beast. I thought there might be something

372
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,760
behind. I was in ready to say what it is and he's a say it out to the beast on

373
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,360
the mic. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, what if what if he came in here and he was

374
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,080
not Alex, but he's a giant be a giant be giant be you want to say something

375
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:44,580

00:17:51,540 --> 00:18:00,540

378
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,540
You look good. You look official. Yeah, you do look good. Are you giving it to me?

379
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Yeah, so if you had any scrubs... It's not a scrub.

380
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,540
Get out of here. You're explaining someone else's thing now.

381
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,540
Yeah, go get the fuck out of here. Stop smelling your armpits.

382
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,540
You might want to wash it because there was a flood. Everything got flooded.

383
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Yeah, we cleaned everything. No thanks to you, but go take your lab coat.

384
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:28,540
Yeah, you saw the text and you said I'm not going.

385
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:32,540
were you working or were you just at our apartment the whole time?

386
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
I was working and then I was like I'd probably leave.

387
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,540
Yeah. Alright, that's fair.

388
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,540
Alright. That's fair.

389
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,540
Thanks man. Yep. We'll see you later.

390
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
Bye. Bye.

391
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,540
This guy's a piece of shit.

392
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,540
Completely ruined the episode.

393
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:47,540
This guy's a piece of shit. Ruined the episode and we indulged him by just talking to him.

394
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,540
And look, he's pooping on the floor.

395
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,540
Oh my god. He's fucking rubbing around.

396
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,540
No, he's doing the, he's pantomiming eating pussy at me.

397
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:03,500
I don't even want to hear that word eating just say eating thing. Yeah eating glitch guys. I'll say I fucking love eating pussy

398
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,900
I fucking love it. Is that is that men in IST or male feminist?

399
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,160
I love eating that thing and I just love putting another you know

400
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,980
My favorite part about it is when you're eating and then you also put your fingers inside of it

401
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:21,860
I'm on that thing like a fucking rack of ribs. Mm-hmm doing that thing when that I'm gnawing it

402
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,940
I'm like a rat the bottom of a trash or uvula

403
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,300
That's what's sexy to me is being able to put my fingers into something while I lick it.

404
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:30,780
Oh my god.

405
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,500
Yeah, because that's sexy.

406
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,620
A gaping hole.

407
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,060
Yeah, a hole that I just...

408
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:34,860
A wet hole.

409
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:35,740
So gross.

410
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,500
You know, it's okay.

411
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,180
Sex is completely disgusting.

412
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,420
No, not... women's bodies are disgusting.

413
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,140
Oh, okay.

414
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,620
Dude, I'm in there and it's like every second I'm making a sound like a bootstepping in a puddle.

415
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:46,940
I'll say...

416
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,500
Just rapidly.

417
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:47,980
The penis...

418
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,180
That's what I'm in there like...

419
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:56,860
The penis and the balls make perfect geometrical sense and geological sense.

420
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:58,060
And they don't smell.

421
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,300
And they don't smell bad. They do smell.

422
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,420
They smell normally.

423
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,140
Yeah. It is crazy how... why do your balls...

424
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,220
It's crazy how much it smells like paper.

425
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:10,160
What?

426
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,780
Paper?

427
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,060
Y'all know that smell?

428
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,340
No. I'm not familiar, but the papers... your balls smell like paper?

429
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,380
Balls and dick both smell like red paper.

430
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:27,280
signature. Who did that? It's got to be a scooby in here. We've detected a

431
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,700
scooby in the old man. That's a scooby signature. Do you think that you would

432
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,220
do you okay? So I guess I haven't experimented with this and I'm curious

433
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,780
if maybe you guys have. Would you like the smell of another guy's balls or is

434
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,300
it like you only like your own balls? I think unquestionably, I would like the

435
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:46,420
smell of another guy's balls. Yeah. I think there's like zero doubt in my mind.

436
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,440
I like that too, but wanted you to say it first.

437
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,680
(laughter)

438
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,180
I think if somebody gave me jars and it was,

439
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,020
it was mine.

440
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,160
I don't think I could tell the difference

441
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,700
between my ball smell and someone else's.

442
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,620
It was a Yankee candle.

443
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,220
It's a Yankee candle, it just says Zach Braff's ball sack.

444
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,620
No, no, listen, if it was three Mason jars,

445
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,260
it was a Yankee candle, the smell of like,

446
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:13,920
my wife's shirt or something, like the perfume she wears,

447
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,400
and then a guy's balls a random any guy's balls. Zach Braff. I would be like

448
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,280
Zach Braff's ball sack. If I didn't have the context of like it wasn't labeled I would

449
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,440
smell that and be like oh that smells like pretty good like that smells like

450
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,560
home to me you know. Yeah yeah I think that maybe I guess I guess that I

451
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,160
probably definitely one smelled it. I've definitely I've absolutely have caught

452
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,920
indirects of other guys balls I'm sure that I smelled it without realizing it.

453
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:44,220
gym, but not very much. What do you think I am? You've been to the gym, you know

454
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,640
that smell. Yeah, you're looking good. Yeah, right? Yeah, look at that. But I

455
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,400
feel like I've probably caught a whiff, you know, in a locker room or walking by

456
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,360
on the street if someone's wearing stinky underpants that comes out. That

457
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,000
guy's got a, those balls are loud AF. Well, that's, I can't, I can't, well, I

458
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,120
can't, that's what I'm saying. I can't call to mind when I have. You're right.

459
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:06,160
Smelling other guys' balls. So I'm not sure that maybe I would have, maybe if I'm

460
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,780
like nose deep in a guy's crotch. He's been sweating all day and it might

461
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,080
smell completely different than I expect. I might have my own smell and I

462
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,780
don't know because I'm I'm not you go outside and you smell that Baba.

463
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,080
I'm not little little Rover Fido sniffing up into a guy's between his

464
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,980
legs. I'm not going to do it, but I'd but the mystery of it. I think

465
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,980
you're wrong. I think if you smell a guy's balls on the street, it's

466
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:31,780
like passing by a subway. You're like immediately like, oh, that's

467
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:36,900
balls. Yeah, that's balls and I like that. But I'm not sure I've ever smelled balls on the street, I guess.

468
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:41,060
You probably never have smelled them on the street. I'm also completely a mouth breather. I don't smell

469
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,140
anything ever. Oh, I didn't know that. You know that... You're basically, it doesn't matter,

470
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,740
your opinion holds no weight. Yeah. You don't smell anything. You know that smell,

471
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,980
like the New York trash smell? Yeah. It's the one that smells exactly like the best cheese in the

472
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:00,020
world, but it's the worst smell. Definitely. It smells like cheese. Your brain is confusing

473
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,140
things a little bit. It smells like cheese and if it was a cheese it would be like

474
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,140
it's a smelly cheese but it tastes, it's hard. There's a smell connection in my brain that I

475
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:14,100
don't think make, that I think makes almost no sense. And I, this is, I'm

476
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,860
gonna open up to you guys here, okay? I'm ready. So I'm ready for all the jokes here

477
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,460
but I really, whenever I open a jar of peanut butter it makes me think of the

478
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:28,500
smell of a dog. And I assume it's because we feed my dog peanut butter as a treat,

479
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:33,700
sheep right just every day. You can't control it every time I it I don't I

480
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,780
the smells are not the same obviously, but when I smell it, I'm like my brain

481
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,220
is like that smells like a dog. It's like a dog has been in this. Okay, just

482
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:45,100
since I'm I'm a hundred percent serious, smell peanut butter. I think of my dog

483
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,100
and then I look down and there's just a puddle on my front.

484
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,420
I see this is what the jokes I was. I was trying to get out of here, but I'm

485
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,540
completely serious. They're lazy. I don't I don't want to go there. I will

486
00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,580
I do kind of agree because but that's because I realized the other thing there

487
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,860
already is a food that smells like dogs and it's corn chips that's already it

488
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:08,940
that's already it it's cone yeah it's a horn it's yeah dogs smell like corn chips

489
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,620
if they have a certain there's a dry and warm dog some of them have some kind of

490
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,820
like fungus or bacteria or something that creates that smell yeah the top of

491
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,580
the dog smells like a free those yeah exactly

492
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,420
- That's how I smell.

493
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,060
- Go home and smell Phil, he smells like Fritos.

494
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:23,900
- Yeah, 100%.

495
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,060
- He smells, no.

496
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,420
- That's documented, that's normal,

497
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,820
but I've never met another person

498
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,780
who thinks that peanut butter smells like a dog.

499
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,620
- Yeah.

500
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,220
- And I, but I can't, I don't know.

501
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,500
- I think that, I will say since I got Phil,

502
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,740
I've probably eaten zero peanut butter.

503
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,580
It's like-- - Really?

504
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,900
- 'Cause I feed him to him every other day or whatever.

505
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
- Yeah, it becomes dog food.

506
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,740
- I think that's what it is.

507
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,620
- I don't have a peanut butter in my house that isn't like--

508
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,900
- Same with like Doritos.

509
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,980
- I think that's what it is,

510
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,260
is that we had a separate peanut butter jar for the dog,

511
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:53,060
maybe that one started to smell like dog or something and then like I don't even

512
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,500
I just don't understand it. I definitely slowed way down. That fucking, that natural peanut butter

513
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,980
with a teddy. Shit you gotta fucking. I got the teddy. I give him the teddy. Yeah. I'm a good dog owner.

514
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,580
Yeah you gotta, you gotta squirt that shit. What? You don't squirt. Squirt that shit.

515
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,860
What are you talking, it's a jar of peanut butter. What are you squirting? How do you squirt that?

516
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:16,940
Dan and you, squirt that Earl. It's gotta be the worst episode I ever did. These people are gonna, everyone's gonna hate this.

517
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,140
No, no one's gonna feel bad about the flood at all. We're just being, yeah,

518
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,340
it's the most annoying episode of all time. It's 'cause we're, you know,

519
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,740
traumatized. We're completely traumatized. Let's admit it, we're traumatized.

520
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,140
There's a lot of emotion inside of us right now. A lot of people use being

521
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,340
annoying and using types of humor as coping for being traumatized. And I've

522
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,940
done it my whole life. It's like saying Danon loudly is a coping strategy.

523
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,740
It doesn't even make sense. Specifically for flooding.

524
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:44,940
Double it, double it. You can't steal other people. Guys, I'm not participating.

525
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,260
I'm collaborating. You started it so you should feel responsible.

526
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:55,060
Here's a thing I can talk about. So I... A spot on your pants? You see, well it's a

527
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:01,020
brown spot and it's exactly what it looks like. I'm listening. It's poo-poo? You got doo-doo on

528
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,100
your... You've been wearing these all day and you didn't tell us you have doo-doo on

529
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,460
your pants? What if I rubbed your knee? It's a doo-doo. I tried to get it out with a shout.

530
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,020
What if I did a joke about you being Santa Claus? Let me tell the story here.

531
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,820
Okay, so I found so I left it was a money Mondays. I left a money Mondays

532
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:23,300
I found a cat walked up to me in the street with no eyes. Yes, I remember

533
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:30,260
Mmm turns out it had an infection in its eyes. Yes, but these two cats walk up to me. I immediately I picked them up

534
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,380
I'm walking down the street

535
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,700
I walked all the way home from the office with two kittens in my hands like French Montana with the Tigers

536
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:42,100
yeah, I was walking around like that like to like probably I think I live like I

537
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,260
five blocks away mm-hmm I walked five city blocks with just two holding two

538
00:26:48,260 --> 00:27:01,180
kittens just going like oh geez yeah I want to like like Morty like Morty and

539
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:07,420
then I well okay so I'm petting one of them and I'm like oh man there's this

540
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:19,660

541
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:26,460
The stain has not. You chose to put the pants back on? No no no I washed them. And then the stain

542
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,540
wasn't gone and you put them back on? Yes. You put dude you know what stains are

543
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,140
made out of? Yes I know. The thing that it is. I tried I sprayed it with shout I tried everything.

544
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:38,180
and then you put the pants on. You weren't like, "I'm going to leave these pants off

545
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,180
for a while."

546
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,180
These are my favorite pants.

547
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,180
I need to put them back on.

548
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,180
These are your favorite pants?

549
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,180
Yeah.

550
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,180
There shouldn't be any more.

551
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,180
They're just green.

552
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:47,920
They're the perfect fit pants. Look at how they look on me.

553
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,540
Right now it's giving you a fake boner and there's a hole in them.

554
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
And there's poop on them.

555
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,140
They've got to sell these pants somewhere. You've got to be able to get new pants, man.

556
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,620
You've got doo-doo on them.

557
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,480
Well, I can't because I have to pay you to fix the whole flood.

558
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
You're going to pay to fix the whole flood.

559
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
I'm putting all the money down.

560
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,960
- Okay, all right, that's fine by me.

561
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,800
- Sounds good to me.

562
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,620
- But, yeah.

563
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,320
- If the price to pay for that is some poopy pants,

564
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,160
that's okay.

565
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,800
- And then that cat died.

566
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,880
- He got what he deserved.

567
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,920
- One of them died.

568
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,760
- Yep.

569
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,520
- He had panleukopenia.

570
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,400
- What the hell, why would you tell people this?

571
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,520
- Kitten AIDS.

572
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,160
- That's gotta be the quickest way

573
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,960
to ruin an episode of the podcast,

574
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,080
talk about a cat that died in your care.

575
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:26,920
- Uh-huh.

576
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,740
- Yep.

577
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,580
- It wasn't my fault.

578
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,420
- No.

579
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,240
- Yeah.

580
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,080
- He should have been standing under my foot.

581
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
- It wasn't, exactly.

582
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,920
- Yeah.

583
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,960
it was it wasn't directly your fault yeah yeah and then I well I've been taking

584
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,020
care of the other one that's what I that's what I tell the police she just

585
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:48,320
died in my apartment yeah she had something she pooped on me

586
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:57,140
it is what you think it is a woman's blood yeah and poop tell you what would

587
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:01,160
suck having a period that's yeah I've been thinking about that a lot recently

588
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,440
Look, I have a period, all right?

589
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:03,440
Let me think about trying to give myself a period.

590
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
You have a period?

591
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,240
A period of where I'm eating too damn many chips.

592
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,480
Dannon!

593
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,920
And when would that period be?

594
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,400
Maybe before your food gets there at the Mexican restaurant?

595
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:19,760
Here's the thing about these chips, buddy, I'm filling up on the-

596
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,760
Let's go!

597

Here's the thing, here's the thing, yeah, here's the thing, okay let me stand up.

605
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:34,760
Alright, listen up.

606
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Mexicans.

607
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
Yeah!

608
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Okay?

609
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
You guys.

610
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Okay, but you better say the chips thing.

611
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
'Cause I already said it.

612
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
Mexicans!

613
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
No, no.

614
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
No, just say it.

615
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,400
When I finish the first bowl of chips, don't bring me a second bowl of chips.

616
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:48,400
I don't want them.

617
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,400
Mexicans.

618
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,040
No, alright, you're leaning too hard into the Mexicans.

619
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,040
I'm not leaning at all, I'm standing straight up.

620
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
I immediately regretted saying the Mexicans thing.

621
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,040
Alright, Pat's standing up now.

622
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:10,160

I like to apologize to the brave people of Mexico

631
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:06,920
Tips I'd like to apologize to the brave people of Mexican restaurants - yeah the chips listen the chips there as long as you keep

632
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,360
Them free you keep the chips free you're gonna see a lot of me. Yeah

633
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
We should put that in an almanac.

634
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,640
What's an almanac? You say almond stack?

635
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,640
An almanac.

636
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,640
I'd love to have an almond stack of wasabi almonds.

637
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,640
How are you going to stack an almond? Their shape is not...

638
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
You can stack them if you shave them down.

639
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,640
You ever do the thing where you try to get all the skin off the almond and leave just the nut?

640
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
No.

641
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,640
And then it doesn't taste as good.

642
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,640
And then you realize it's like a rotisserie chicken.

643
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
I have to say, it's odd behavior.

644
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
You know they sell...

645
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,240
god the keto chips. I'm basically a normal. I have to you know. I don't

646
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,440
want to I don't want to start. I don't want to start a fight here or anything,

647
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,840
but normal people don't do that. What take take all the skin off an almond.

648
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,240
That's weird. No, I do that. Don't smell peanut butter and think of a dog. You

649
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,940
smell that is what that is low. That is so low your penis. If I smell a dog's

650
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,540
come, I'll think of a dog duh. Why do you recognize a dog's come because it

651
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,700
came out of a dog's penis onto my floor or lap.

652
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,780
- Why is it going on your lap, man?

653
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:14,540
- 'Cause it's grinding on my knees.

654
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,020
- You can't, that's not your fault.

655
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:19,460
If the dog starts using you as like a device

656
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,220
to masturbate with, it's not your fault.

657
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,180
The dog humps your leg, it's your,

658
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,020
I think at that point, it is your choice.

659
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:29,620
You don't have a moral obligation to swat the dog away.

660
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,460
But it's--

661
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,500
- What about a cat?

662
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,340
'Cause there's--

663
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:34,260
- I don't, cats don't hump, right?

664
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:37,860
I've never owned a... no, I've owned boy cats.

665
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,780
But I've never owned a boy cat that wasn't fixed and I'm really ner... because he's getting

666
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,780
around the...

667
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,780
My...

668
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,780
Mohammed, my little...

669
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,780
What's Mo?

670
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,140
I think he might fuck your face or something?

671
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:49,940
I think he might cheese all over my couch.

672
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
That's okay.

673
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,500
He's done so much to that couch already.

674
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,500
We're deciding whether or not...

675
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,740
You watched him on Saturday.

676
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,300
Yeah, he pooped everywhere.

677
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,300
He pooped on the wall.

678
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,580
He pooped on the wall, the couch, the blanket, the floor.

679
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:07,940
the floor. He's a street cat and I when I when I met him he had a switch plate and he was

680
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,740
pointing it at me. Whoa. Yeah. He slick his hair back like Shia LaBeouf. He's a two dollars kid.

681
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:18,180
Tombstone. No. Liam Neeson. I think you're talking about Better Off Dead.

682
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:23,300
The kid who says two dollars. Better Off Saul. The show's over bring it back. Mm-hmm.

683
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,740
So he pooped on the wall? Yeah. I think he had already pooped on the wall when we

684
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,700
he got there yeah, because he was having problems with he so what happens is

685
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,360
so this cat, which I learned which I was not. I was we were told halfway through

686
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,420
into watching him, which I'm very glad that Alex told us this because I can't

687
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,660
believe no one else told us this because this is maybe I'm pretty sure I told

688
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:49,220
you this is no you did not say what I'm about to say is the number one most

689
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:53,620
important thing I should have known watching this cat is that if he meows

690
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,760
yeah, he's about to blast diarrhea everywhere yeah, and I was not informed

691
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,980
about this and at all he every time he meowed three times. Every time he

692
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:06,320
me every time he meowed when we were watching him, he started pooping

693
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,760
everywhere wow and and other one and otherwise we would have assumed like any

694
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,480
other person watching a cat that if it meows, maybe we'll pick it up and put it

695
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,840
on our lap or something and we were told that just in time and I can't believe

696
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:23,640
that that was not that was that was yeah God Almighty. I know they pooped every

697
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,340
really just well you it was easy it's brutal yeah it's really really good yeah

698
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:34,380
you clean it up with like a shop sweep like a shop room yeah we got to do that

699
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,580
and then like I have a I have these these wet wipes that are the smell like

700
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:45,240
Japanese cherry blossoms I have to wipe its Clorox wipes no no it's it's pet

701
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,860
wipes oh the ones we were using were Clorox yeah yeah that's the that's the

702
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,020
opposite oh I thought you meant wiping his butt you weren't wiping his butt with

703
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:59,060
chlorox I was not wiping his body wiping it why you're wiping his but I have to

704
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:05,300
why I did see his but I'm not touching that yeah dude it's fucking nasty it's

705
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,620
covered in poop I'm just I watch my friend's cat of what I'm wiping his butt

706
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:16,220
every time this thing is like okay if you like the next people who own them I

707
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:20,140
think if you watch someone else's kid and the kids shits or pisses in its

708
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:25,160
diaper that's not my problem yeah that's the that's your problem clean up the

709
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,320
poop but I'm not gonna wipe his butt no you should have emptied him before I got

710
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,040
him yeah that's that simple I wasn't asking you to wipe my cat's butt yeah

711
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,560
you were but you thought that maybe I might have been wiping his butt yeah you

712
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,120
were hose that there's there's been many times or I've had to wipe his butt why I

713
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,080
could tell that he needed somebody to wipe his butt and there but it is all you

714
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,340
I would not would not be me I was not getting paid I was doing it for love of

715
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,600
the game I and I'd alright well clearly you don't like the game if you're not

716
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:58,880
wiping its butt. Wiping his butt is not part of the game that is a timeout

717
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,800
that's in timeout no huge part of the game is looking at the cat and going

718
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,000
aww and petting it and playing with it with a toy yeah that's the game you have

719
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,640
no vitality. Vitality? Mm-hmm what do you mean like hit points? Yes.

720
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,480
You're we know you would have you would have wanted to wipe the cat's but

721
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,520
It's part of the job. I was not getting paid. It was not a job you get paid. I did not get paid

722
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:27,720
If I got paid I would have wiped the cat's butt what if he's been withholding payment just then I'll go back

723
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:30,440
I'll come back. I'll come to your house and wipe the cat's butt if you pay me how much

724
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,240
$60

725
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,640
Yeah, that's there's a there's a much lower amount of money I would do that for 40

726
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,060
I'll do it for 40. Wait, I can't I'm beating myself out of the fucking thing

727
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:47,920
I'm do I hear 30 30 going once to wipe his kid his butt like a good wipe am I do it?

728
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,000
Am I doing it all day? Yes all day. Fuck you. It's all I'll do it once. Yeah, I'll do it once for

729
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,860
That was the number I had in my head. I think that's the lowest I would go his butt legit

730
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,400
Looks like goatee

731
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:08,120
It's really nasty. It he's got no goatee. I can I can tell you as an outside observer - it's not just his butt

732
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,500
that is the gross part is that he gets poop all over his entire back of his body.

733
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:18,200
It's been a rough couple... I've barely been home too. I feel

734
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,440
like an asshole because I left this fucking cat that I found. You would know what an asshole feels like

735
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,680
because you've been sticking your finger in that thing. I wish I could just put on a

736
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,560
rubber glove and just poke that gland back into its butt. What about a piece of

737
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,040
cork. I honestly I'll do any any solution to put to plug up Mo's butt so he stops

738
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,600
pooping. Yeah yeah he does need to stop. You know what it is just cuz he's on

750
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,200
rich fucking cat. Eating pate? I've never had pate. You have? You've had a banh mi. They

751
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,120

754
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:55,900
- No they don't.

755
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,940
- Yeah they do. - That's a lie.

756
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,220
No, it's mayo.

757
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,140
- It's like a pate, yeah, it's like a pate.

758
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,460
- No, no, wrong.

759
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,580
- I suppose you're looking at me

760
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,860
like you wanted me to settle it.

761
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:04,700
- They don't put any pate on that.

762
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:05,660
- Like you want me to do some kind of--

763
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,820
- Look up bahn mi recipes.

764
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,020
- Yeah, let's use the wifi.

765
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,500
- I can't look anything up.

766
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,460
- Not.

767
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
- Oh yeah, we don't have a list

768
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,460
because we can't really have access.

769
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,960
- I thought maybe we could do a fun,

770
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:16,800
figure out what is a list.

771
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,420
- Well, the Caleb's Cup has a list.

772
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,660
- Okay, wait, list of banh mi ingredients.

773
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,060
- What, you have access, you have what?

774
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:23,900
What?

775
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,980
You have a, you have service?

776
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,220
- I have LTE.

777
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:29,140
- Why didn't we, you didn't tell us?

778
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,300
- You just let us think there was no hope?

779
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,260
- What's wrong with you?

780
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,980
- Okay, bread, pork, sauce.

781
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,320
- He's got perfect-- - Oh my God.

782
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,020
- Coriander.

783
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,620
- There's no pate on that?

784
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,460
- Wait.

785
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,740
- There's never, I've never heard of pate on a banh mi.

786
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,900
- What if the pate is the sauce?

787
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,340
- Then they would call it pate.

788
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,300
Why are you, it's just sauce.

789
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:53,140
- Bon Me Pate, authentic bon me, cooking with Lane.

790
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,460
- I've never had an authentic bon me.

791
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,660
I just have the cheap ones.

792
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,340
- That's true.

793
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,680
- I've never had pate.

794
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,520
- I don't know, I don't even--

795
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,820
- And now you're just,

796
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,180
we could have been reading the list off your phone.

797
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:07,540
- Are you too intimidated by your local Asian grocery store?

798
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,580
Let me help you out.

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,340

804
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,220
You found a loophole.

805
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,260
- Found a trick, a phone trick.

00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,260

821
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,380
- That's all it says?

822
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,520
- See, it says this first sentence here.

823
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,140
- Patrick, I'm completely disengaging with you.

824
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,260
- Oh, it says Nalgene on the other side.

825
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,480

So there's a list that I found just now.

829
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,020
- I spy with my little eye my list on mine.

830
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,260
- I've never had it bond me to look like that.

831
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,100
You had to try so hard to find a bond me with pate on it.

832
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,300
- Here's a list of letters on Patrick's hat.

- Oh, wait, wait.

Let's just get a mad look going for you.

868

I'm a little bit of an academic.

869

Would you guys consider yourselves academics?

A bard.

875
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,920
Once a bard, forever a bard.

876
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:40,920
A bard for the bard.

877
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,920
What the hell?

878
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
I'm going to need a noun.

879
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,920
Okay.

880
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:46,920
William Shakespeare.

886
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,440

888
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,800
Okay.

889
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,880
And then the other surprise will be what the story is with all the words in it.

890
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,880
Thank you.

891
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:10,200

00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:11,200
Cameron.

893
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,480
That's not, you can't, you can't say one.

894
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,360
can't give him one like that. Okay, William Shakespeare. That's not how you cough. I was

895
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,680
clearing my throat. Okay, clear your throat again. We'll do that because William Shakespeare's

896
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:25,040
spirit is all around us. Tell me what your thing is because he said Cameron. And then

897
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,480
I said William Shakespeare is a compromise. You have to say something here, Cam. Okay,

898
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,400
Patrick and Caleb combined it to one person. Okay, so it's going to be... You can't say

899
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,400
what it is. Hey, listen folks, I know which one I'm picking. I like one of these answers

900
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,400
a lot more than you. This is completely, it's not fair. Wait, why don't we just do Pamela

901
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,400
Anderson. Pamela Anderson's in the room right now? Yeah. Yeah, she's in the room.

902
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:54,560
Oh. It's so hot. Stop mixing up the mic. What are you doing? Yeah, my arm is already tired.

903
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:59,080
We will do, we'll do Pamela Anderson. Oh, I'm not supposed to tell you guys. Yeah, I

904
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,400
don't know, you're really messing this up. No, you're messing it up. We're only two in.

905
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:10,240
I need a nap. William Shakespeare, nap. I need a nap. Oh, that actually works pretty well.

906
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:22,120
and

907
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:24,120
I guess I'm saying the same thing over and over again.

908
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,120
I guess I won't.

909
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,120
I guess you are.

910
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,120
I don't know if you guys remember how Mad Libs worked.

911
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,800
You're supposed to say something just oh so ridiculous that no matter what the format

912
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,120
is and what the meaning is.

913
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
Okay, I got you.

915
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,160

00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,260
- Yeah, it needs to measure your head.

1137
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,100
- Oh yeah.

1138
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:13,820
- Maybe he saw you walked in, your head was bald,

1139
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,220
and he thought you were just the mannequin

1140
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:16,060
that was coming in.

1141
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:17,300
- I think he, my head is so big,

1142
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,300
he probably thought that I was like trying to do--

1143
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:20,820
- Your head is not, put this on.

1144
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:23,300
- No, you have a, I mean, come on.

1145
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,620
I have a big head, okay?

1146
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:27,660
That doesn't mean that you don't have like a freakishly

1147
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:30,160
like fucked up head size.

1148
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:31,000
- I've learned recently--

1149
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,820
- I have a normal big head.

1150
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,620
I fit in a 7 and 5/8.

1151
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:37,740
Knowing hat sizes is the ultimate sign.

1152
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,980
That just means you wear a fitted hat.

1153
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:41,980
No.

1154
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:42,980
No.

1155
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,980
Yeah, it does.

1156
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:44,980
No.

1157
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,980
No.

1158
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:48,540
I don't think most people who wear a fitted hat would, off the top of their head, would

1159
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:51,220
be like, "I just learned I can wear this size of fitted hat."

1160
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:52,220
It's on the gold foil sticker.

1161
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,220
What are you talking about?

1162
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,220
You're supposed to leave those on.

1163
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,780
You put it on and you feel how it feels.

1164
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,060
If you know the numbers, I think there's something up.

1165
00:59:58,060 --> 00:59:59,060
No.

1166
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,060
That just means you're buying them online.

1167
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:01,060
I'm sorry to make...

1168
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:02,060
I think you're just being contrarian.

1169
01:00:02,060 --> 01:00:07,420
Yeah, you were you were just trying to throw a wrench. It doesn't make sense that there's sizes. I think that I okay

1170
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:11,200
5 15 it makes sense that their sizes

1171
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,300
Could it make sense that there's

1172
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:22,180
50 I think if there's a running commentary in your head of what size you learned you just you just running comment

1173
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:27,340
You said he just learned that he can win. He literally just said I just learned I can wear this size of hat

1174
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:32,040
I just learned things every day. Does that make me anything other than a myth buster? No, it doesn't I learned that

1175
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:36,600
maybe the flood is one of the best things that's ever happened to us today. I think the flood is

1176
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,060
making me feel, I will say, all this talk about floods making me have to pee so bad

1177
01:00:40,060 --> 01:00:42,920
but I'm holding it in because that's the kind of show we are now. Yeah I've been

1178
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:46,680
holding in my pee too. Everything is being completely, there's things at work that

1179
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:52,240
you fucking small-minded piece of, you wouldn't even know. There's so many things going on behind the scenes.

1180
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,280
You don't know what's coming and when it does come it's gonna, buddy, you better

1181
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:59,700
buckle up because it's gonna hit you like a fucking freight train okay? Yeah.

1182
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,140
We're gonna be bowled over.

1183
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:04,100
- It's gonna hit you like a Ziploc bag of bricks.

1184
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:05,740
- 100%, you're basically, I mean,

1185
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:08,740

1186
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,060

- 'Cause we'll fucking kill you.

01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,500

1196
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:26,820
in one fell swoop.

1197
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:36,380
Yeah, fucking animals. Uh-huh. Maybe even less like animals and more like blades of grass or weeds like nothing nothing just without
