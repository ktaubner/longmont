[Laughter]

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,800
That was... we just counted down for 10 minutes.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,800
That was the best countdown we've ever done.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
That was incredible, dude.

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Fuck, dude, I feel so good.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
You want me to fucking talk about...

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Me and Kayla both got some kind of like super power G.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Oh my god.

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Dude, I think it's COVID.

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,800
I think I got the exact right amount of brain damage.

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,680
Well, I don't have COVID, so it can't be better than me. I think...

16
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,880
You don't know that.

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,720
That's true. I think I was just like touched by God or something.

18
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,320
Yeah, did you open that letter I sent you?

19
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,520
You have COVID-19, dude.

20
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,960
Whatever, dude.

21
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,040
I'm so lucky that COVID-19 came before scientists developed a way to send like

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,120
smells and breath over the internet.

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,280
That is true. Yeah, that'll be a much worse virus.

24
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:57,400
Yeah, that's a good point.

25
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,320
You got an email from your buddy.

26
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
You've got smell.

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,320
You have wind.

28
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,320
Yeah, and you open your mouth and it blows out of your speaker.

29
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Fuck, dude.

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,320
Fuck, dude. Adam Sandler sent a fart to me in my fucking smell mail.

31
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,320
Oh, no.

32
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,320
Snail smell. That's what they'll call normal smelling then.

33
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
They'll call that snail smell.

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Oh, yeah. I smelled that last night by snail smell.

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Yeah. Do you still use snail smell?

36
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:27,320
I've had my tubes tied years ago.

37
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,280
- Smell smell is when a guy brings the thing

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,720
to your house for you to smell.

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,800
- Yeah, just a guy carrying dog shit on a stick.

40
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,040
(laughing)

41
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:40,880
- And it gets a tracking number and everything.

42
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,240
Dude, we do need some kind of--

43
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,040
- Smellogram for Patrick.

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,560
- There needs to be, like you look at a tracking number

45
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,120
when something is getting shipped to you

46
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,560
and you get really excited.

47
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,620
There needs to be an evil tracking number

48
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,760
so you know when something bad is coming to you.

49
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,200
there's a true number like old dog shit is coming to my house or a guy who

50
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,660
you're not a bomb

51
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,760
no it's like a kid it tells you how long it's going to take a drink and i

52
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,080
worrying

53
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,240
army

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,780
yet that looks like rebel but it's not

55
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,600
but

56
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,720
still i mean it is really seeing says read right there

57
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,560
what the fuck is that the current it doesn't it probably bowl

58
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,680
all the further

59
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,680
I'm sorry I interrupted you Cameron, I'm just, I'm so, what the fuck is, Red Thunder?

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,680
Red Thunder?

61
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680
Red Thunder?

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
Yeah dude.

63
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,680
What the fuck are you putting in your mouth?

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,680
I'm asking you, I'm asking you what you're putting into your body.

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Red Thunder sugar free energy drink with caffeine.

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,160
Right before we started recording, Patrick was telling us that he drank something called

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,520
highball so I don't know if there's a leg to stand on in this one. It is a caffeinated

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:59,040
sparkling water and a lot of people drink it. I mean that sounds equally as... I mean

69
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,680
at least you're not drinking like the knockoff version of highball I guess.

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:11,760
Highball! Slime mall! They have they have ads... Sky mall! They have ads with comedians. Highball

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:20,720
does yeah well I'm doing one right now sugar-free energy drink with caffeine it

72
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,560
comes from Aldi and it's four for three dollars oh that's actually yeah now you

73
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,600
talking all that shit no you didn't tell me it was an Aldi brand I mean the thing

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,480
about another thing about knockoff energy drinks is that normal energy drinks are

75
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,440
already like poison enough I don't think it matters if you have for the knockoff

76
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,580
one like you're already fucking like embalming your organs I think it's my

77
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,840
might as well just like the one that cost 50 cents no no certified synthetic colors

78
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,040
I mean uncertified synthetic I mean who could there's no nobody you would not

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,560
believe yeah buddy don't even look at the ingredients of this there's gonna be

80
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,680
some fucking like dude that's lovecraft like it doesn't make it it makes you go

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,200
crazy kind of shit it doesn't make any sense to they say no colors in it but

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:11,880
it's red thunder right that's the drink metal pours it to your head for it make a

83
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:17,200
cup I'll put it in my mouth to show you well no cuz that'll I can't see it is it

84
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:27,560
blue taste pink it's not recommended for pregnant women also I think this is the

85
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:35,000
cure for COVID-19. I have COVID-19. Do you have it? You don't know? I don't know. I think I

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,920
probably do but I'm still gonna go to PAX East. Nothing will stop me.

87
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Nothing will stop me.

88
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,920
If you think I'm not going to PAX East with you, you got another thing coming.

89
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,920
And if you're going to PAX East, that thing might be COVID-19 for me.

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Come up and hug me if you're going to PAX East.

91
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,920
I'll be fine. I'm wearing a big hazmat suit.

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,920
I'm gonna be signing

93
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,080
Tissues for anybody who wants to come by my booth. Are they having a PAX East this year?

94
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,600
I hope so dude. Otherwise, I'm just gonna be alone in that big-ass convention center in Boston

95
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,480
Just blowing tissues, you know a couple of might might shoot it shoot a load into

96
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,160
Convention center well, if there's no one there it doesn't matter

97
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,160
red thunder, so i just searched red thunder, just that, just on google images, the first

98
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,280
one two three four five six seven eight nine ten pictures are just of thunder that is red,

99
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,040
the next picture is a nike jacket, then there's more red thunder, and then there's a picture

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:42,400
of a liquid called red thunder biodegradable degreaser, it removes grease, silicone, and

101
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,760
heavy soils safe to use on aluminum and most other vehicle surfaces.

102
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,160
Alright, I am in trouble.

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:57,440
And then they have a spray bottle called Little Red Thunder.

104
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,120
I don't know what, look at my eyes dude, that just made me cry for some reason.

105
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:08,560
I'm not kidding, I don't, I think this might be a side effect of the coronavirus.

106
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,080
just brought tears to my eyes learning that I'm drinking an imaginary drink

107

Yeah, his name is just Frog.

139
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,120
Oh, here they had a whole thing where they just made superheroes into animals.

140
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm looking at this here.

141
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,760
They've got...

142
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Eugene Pattillo.

143
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,960
Dude, they're really good at this.

144
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,480
Spider-Ham, Peter Porker, okay, good.

145
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,360
May Porker, J. Jonah Jackal, right, okay.

146
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,200
Flash Tomcat, yep, okay, right.

147
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,120
And then of course there's Mary Jane Water Buffalo.

148
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,360
(laughter)

149
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:33,960
- No, that's-- - Elevator Superman, dude.

150
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,800
- That's pretty good.

151
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,220
Oh no, it's Throg.

152
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,840
It's not just Throg, it's Throg.

153
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,880
- Yeah, that makes way more sense.

154
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,880
Throg would be, that guy's getting fired, dude.

155
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,000
Stanley himself is taking him down, dude.

156
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
- Yeah, I think Throg does make a lot more sense.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,560
But it would be cool, oh no, you know what I was thinking?

158
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,560
I was thinking of Frog from Chrono Trigger.

159
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,800
What are you sending me pictures of this now?

160
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
A swine lady girl?

161
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
A swine lady girl?

162
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
Is that his daughter?

163
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Why does he have a cane?

164
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:14,560
Oh no wait that's the bedside I thought he had a cane.

165
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,960
I'll post that picture too.

166
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,120
It's Peter Portsch and I guess Mary Crane Watson maybe?

167
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,120
Oh!

168
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,360
Looks like a crane.

169
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,360
That's pretty good.

170
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
Of some kind.

171
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:30,840
Alright, so I need you guys, you guys will be my doctors because I'm not going to the

172
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,840

I need you guys to help me cure my COVID-19 virus disease.

174
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,880
You don't know you have it.

00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,000
I can't taste anything except Red Thunder right now.

I think you have it.

178
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,460

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,940
I'm having to drink Red Thunder five or six of them a day.

192
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,740
I thought I had it the other day before you applied it to my mouth.

193
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,240
Patrick, we're talking about cures right now, okay?

194
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,240
We're not talking about your little problems.

195
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Well, I'm just saying.

196
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
I'm saying.

197
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Okay, I don't care.

198
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,240
I can fix Caleb.

199
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Okay, I don't care.

200
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,240
We're going to go through this scientifically, okay?

201
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,660
So what are the symptoms that you're having right now?

202
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,740
You can't taste anything, right?

203
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,060
I can't taste anything.

204
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,620
I can't have sex with my wife.

205
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,620
Okay.

206
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,140
I can cure that for you right now.

207
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,500
I stayed up too late last night.

208
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
I...

209
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
All right.

210
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:17,140
a bunch of shitty cooking YouTube videos. So those are most of my symptoms.

211
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,860
So the first thing, so... You just became me.

212
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:32,060
Yeah, because you can't have sex with my wife, buddy. You better watch it.

213
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,260
The way you cure a disease is you cure the symptoms one by one, right?

214
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,580
Yeah. Everybody knows that who's a scientist or

215
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,700
so you can't taste anything you got to get something real spicy you got to get

216
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,420
oh wait you gotta get the white boys nightmare on your taste buds

217
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,860
Caleb I have a night boy having right now with the red thunder so what's the

218
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:59,700
opposite of red thunder Caleb go to your kitchen water Caleb go to your kitchen

219
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,500
right now get your hottest hot sauce and a red onion okay that is so a red onion

220
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,500
ketchup. Alright? Even better, even better. Go get that right now and eat it on camera.

221
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:19,300
Okay. I mean we can diagnose you. That's not gonna taste good though. Oh wait, it won't matter.

222
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:23,020
Right. Yeah. If I don't have- Dude, you should just be eating this- come on, just-

223
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:28,020
That's what I'm saying! That's what I'm saying! But I can taste stuff still.

224
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:35,580
I think. You said you couldn't. Go eat- okay, go get a f*cking coffee grounds and eat the coffee grounds. Oh I'll do that, no

225
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,620
problem dude that's like fucking that's like chewing my own cud to me oh what was

226
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:48,500
the second symptom Caleb's you have sex with my wife she's dead she's out there

227
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:56,540
dying could develop a robot maybe okay and marry it and marry it all right what

228
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,020
if I just marry my hand right now that you know what I do are you ordained

229
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,020
Pat you're a dame right? Yeah let's do this. Okay let's do it. Ready?

230
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:14,180
Dearly beloved we are gathered here today to witness the, um, let's witness the

231
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:21,740
matrimony. I don't know. The holy union. The holy union. Holy union. Bams on holy union.

232
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:31,420
We're here to witness Bams on holy union between Caleb Michael Pitts and Handley

233
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,820
Handley Pitts. Just Hand. Not even Pitts yet. We're not married yet. Okay.

234
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:43,700
Handley. Your Hand has the same last name as you. No, it's a different thing.

235
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:53,020
I can't agree. Handmantha Handley. The union between Handley. No. Handy Milonakis. All right.

236
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,580
Continue. The union between Handy Milonakis and Caleb Michael Pitts. If

237
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:02,460
If anybody has any objections, please speak now or forever hold your peace.

238
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,300
I do. I have an objection.

239
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,800
Whoa.

240
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,500
I think the robot idea was better and we should do that instead.

241
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,140
I have an objection. I don't want to fuck my hand.

242
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,180
It's also-

243
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,340
I don't know where to go from here. This is my first-

244
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,020
I think your job is done.

245
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,700
Um, okay.

246
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:25,100
Did they just stop the wedding when someone does that or do they keep going?

247
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,540
I don't know.

248
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:33,540
Do they just say, "Okay, we'll reschedule it. We'll do another wedding when you invite that guy next time."

249
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,540
"Okay, you are uninvited from the second wedding."

250
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,540
'Cause also, if you have an objection, do they have to listen to you?

251
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,540
Do you have to stop the... Do you have to stop it? Is that part of the wedding rules?

252
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,540
Yeah, you have to stop the wedding for sure.

253
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,540
Why? Why don't you just talk over them?

254
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,540
Oh, sorry, I can't hear you. You're in the back.

255
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,540
Yeah, I mean, 'cause in that situation, the bride could just turn to whoever and just say, "Oh, shut the fuck up."

256
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,780
like something like that. But they've already objected. Yeah. Do they have to like, I think

257
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,940
they should have to write a form and bring the form to the wedding. I think objections,

258
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,100
I think, I think objections in marriages. They need to have a judge at the marriage. Yeah. I

259
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:15,580
think that it's it's a thing that nobody thinks about because I think it'll never happen but

260
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,620
nobody you know Boy Scouts motto you got to be prepared. Exactly you gotta, you gotta be prepared

261
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:28,020
to marry a Boy Scout if you're a priest. That's a Boy Scout's motto. Yeah. But yeah, no, a

262
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:32,180
judge there who can like you know also who can hit his big hammer you know at

263
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,180
the end when they say like you may now kiss the bride you could go you may now

264
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,020
kiss the bride and then go like bang with the hammer. True. And you have to get registered.

265
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:46,020
You have to get registered too now that I think about it. You probably have to get a jury in there. And an executioner.

266
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:52,700
Yeah, just in case the objection is a crime. Wait, so when you know gruffer - and you might want to do it in a courthouse

267
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,740
Yeah, yeah

268
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,780
When you do get married you do have to go get it like like the day before the wedding or whatever you do have to

269
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,700
Go get it like like right that I maybe I'm thinking of dogs. You have to get like this

270
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:10,040
Right not like I mean you don't have to register a dog

271
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,900
It's true. You don't have to do you

272
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,620
Don't register

273
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:23,860
No shot if you don't give your dog a shot it's not gonna trust you you should be scared of needles and they are sharp

274
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,380
Are you scared of knives?

275
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,380
Fucking idiot. Are you scared of dogs?

276
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,420
You scared of sure you took your dog to the doctor and they said alright

277
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,860
We have a doctor here with a mosquito nose and he's gonna stab your dog. You would leave

278
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:43,740
We have a doctor who's a mosquito. Do you want to stay? You'd say, "Fuck no, dude. I don't want a fucking mosquito bite."

279
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,880
He's too small. I mean, I

280
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,360
I'm going to the natural food store, and I'm gonna get some mushrooms. If my doctor was too small

281
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,420
I wouldn't listen to a thing he said because I couldn't hear him. Hell no. I don't trust a doctor under six feet. Mm-hmm

282
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:01,140
That's just true. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? I'm not gonna look down on my doctor, dude. Right.

283
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,840
Which I would if he was 5'11" because I'm so tall. If the doctor was

284
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,600
Was one inch tall though. I would be okay with it. If the doctor's below a doctor's got to be over six feet or under one foot

285
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,340
Well, yeah, that's the other thing. Your doctor was like tiny if you had like a little tiny one-inch doctor

286
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,600
He would be able to find you would get into your different areas

287
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:25,920
Yeah, he would definitely know so much more about the human body cuz right like ant-man going into the Iron Man

288
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,100
So here's the thing, right?

289
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:33,520
It would have to be a doctor that's one inch tall and also has a very active sex life because then you climbing all over people

290
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,200
one you would know doctors. The perfect medical situation you have one

291
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,640
one-inch doctor and one very big doctor. Oh so they can one can check your bottom

292
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:49,420
parts. Not just your bottom. One can go up in you up inside you.

293
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:55,040
One can look in your head. What about an eight-foot tall doctor and then

294
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,240
each of his fingers are doctors. Doctors should play different

295
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,360
positions at different heights like a basketball team. Like the shortest one

296
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,520
should be like kind of a point guard like leader. The shortest doctor is

297
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,000
the jester. Yeah and as they get taller also. And that's why his name was Dr. J.

298
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
True. That's a good point. Yeah. No, no the tallest one should be the tall people,

299
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,520
the taller somebody is the stupider they are. The harder it is for

300
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,200
blood to reach their brain. That's fine with me. As long as there's one jester

301
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,920
doctor. The seven foot doctor needs to be like a bumbling oaf. You know what I mean?

302
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,460
who walks around like duh are you sick and then the small doctor needs to be kind of like

303
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,400
an evil genius. It's like pinky in the brain. Yeah and it needs to be a gradient between

304
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,840
those two where there's different doctors at different heights who can say you know hey

305
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:48,600
I'm like the second smartest and second shortest doctor and I'm here to check out your hips.

306
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,760
You know what I mean? And they have to have a coach and it's me and I get to hang out

307
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,240
with the doctors after work and listen to their stories. And we all drink at a pub and

308
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,040
sing Irish songs together. We all drink in my basement. We sing "Come Out You Black and Tans"

309
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:08,180
together. Yeah. And we do some pranks to cars. We sing the "Whose Line Is It Anyway"

310
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,220
Irish drinking songs. As if they're actual Irish drinking songs and we have them all

311
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,460
memorized from every episode. Yeah and we play Warhammer on the weekends. You don't make up your own?

312
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,980
No you don't make up your own. Why would you fuck with perfection dude? Wayne

313
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,220
Brady are you kidding? What a talent. This guy can dance, he can sing, he can rap I

314
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,460
I guess and he can do a backflip.

315
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,460
That's true.

316
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,900
I don't know if he can do it anymore.

317
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
He's kind of old now.

318
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,900
No.

319
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,820
Let's ask Wayne Brady if he can do a backflip.

320
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,820
You guys, you could trade doctors too and there could be a big Dr. Draft.

321
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,820
You think about that.

322
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Oh my god.

323
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
Dr. Draft.

324
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,820
And they could play basketball.

325
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,820
That's a pretty good idea dude.

326
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,820
Uh huh.

327
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,820
Yeah.

328
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,820
LeBron James Jr. he could become a doctor.

329
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,820
Yeah.

330
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,820
Basketball.

331
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
Basketball.

332
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,820
Basketball.

333
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,820
Basketball.

334
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,820
Basketball.

335
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,940
Basketball player doctor.

336
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,300
That's the doctor, being a doctor is the new basketball.

337
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,140
And nobody's going to listen to us about this because it's like so too good of an idea.

338
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:01,700
Exactly.

339
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,180
That's right.

340
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,140
Wayne Brady lotion.

341
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:03,780
I mean, hopefully.

342
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:09,300
Okay, what was, Caleb, what was your third symptom now that we solved that one?

343
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,180
My third symptom, well, I'm about halfway through my second red thunder since we started the episode

344
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,620
and now I think this might be COVID, my heart is beating really, really fast.

345
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,140
You think that's COVID, okay.

346
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,420
Well, you know, that's still kind of solved by the tiny doctor. He could kind of go.

347
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,180
Yeah. Is there a doctor who's small enough to touch my heart?

348
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:35,460
Well, I guess it's not about a doctor that's small enough. It's really just about a doctor

349
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,860
that's brave enough because you could be - you could get a seven foot doctor that puts his hand

350
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:44,580
down your throat and just grabs your heart and like holds it still for you. You just got to have

351
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,780
the - That's a scary doctor, dude. That's like Jaws from James Bond.

352
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,900
Okay, well, what happens when you get scared? Your heart stops beating.

353
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:57,140
What about a doctor, well if you need your heart to stop, maybe have it skip a beat,

354
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,940
maybe a doctor you can fall in love with.

355
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,780
Yeah, a doctor who can fuck you.

356
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,380
Well, just, okay, so here's the thing about anesthetic.

357
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,380
It's very dangerous.

358
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,380
Some people have an allergic-

359
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,540
And that's the doctor you fall in love with, her name is Anasthetic.

360
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,220
Well, yeah, because this is what she does.

361
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:15,260
She is like a replacement for anesthetic because like 1% of people are allergic to anesthetic.

362
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,100
It doesn't affect them.

363
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,780
And then when they go under, they can feel like all the pain and they're completely conscious,

364
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,780
they're just paralyzed.

365
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,220
So she would trick you, she would say sweet things to you and make you fall in love with

366
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:30,060
her to distract you from the fact that they're cutting open your abdomen.

367
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,060
Exactly.

368
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,060
You know what I mean?

369
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,060
She'd be like, "Hey, babe."

370
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,060
Yeah, she'd be like, "What's up?"

371
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,060
"Hey, baby."

372
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,060
"What's going on?"

373
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,060
"What's up, handsome?"

374
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,060
"Hey, my beautiful husband.

375
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,060
You're my husband now.

376
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,060
I love you so much."

377
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,060
Pause.

378
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,060
"I am in love with you.

379
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,060
I love you so much."

380
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,060
"I love you so much."

381
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,060
"I love you so much."

382
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,060
"I love you so much."

383
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,060
"I love you so much."

384
00:22:47,060 --> 00:23:00,500
I don't I don't like it kind of like a Lord Zedd type figure yeah she's kind of

385
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,220
like a like a bebop or a rocksteady yeah

386
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:20,460
You can see her brain like Lord Zedd too. She's like a warthog that you can see its brain. It's covered. It's kind of like a mojo jojo type.

387
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:24,460
It's like a mojo jojo, yeah exactly. Or like a Mars Attacks type thing.

388
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,460
And get this, she's wearing stripes on her.

389
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,460
She has zebra stripes.

390
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,460
She has zebra stripes on her skin.

391
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,460
And her hair.

392
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Her whole body. Like camouflage.

393
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,460
I'm in love with this doctor. Oh my god.

394
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,460
Oh my god.

395
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
Fuck me dude.

396
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,140
I think one of the COVID-19 symptoms is I become like Bill Murray style sarcastic.

397
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,140
Yeah.

398
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,060
Well that's not curable.

399
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,940
No, is it?

400
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,780
I was thinking about this the other night.

401
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,340
How like it probably, I was thinking like in five years but honestly probably already

402
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:08,220
might be happening is like the lame like IT guys or like lame moms are going to start

403
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:12,220
getting mugs that say, instead of fluent in sarcasm, that say fluent in shit posting.

404
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,220
Yeah, something like that.

405
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:23,740
I mean, yeah, all the shit that we say now is going to be like old hat in a couple of

406
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,740
years.

407
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:28,580
Because right now we're on the cutting edge, is the thing.

408
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,460
We're really trailblazing.

409
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,340
It is funny to see people actually say awesome culture.

410
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,820
I did see that the other day.

411
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,740
We did create awesome culture.

412
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,700
There's gonna be like a like a like an NBC like a reality show called like finding

413
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:45,960
awesome culture pretty soon. And they're not gonna be like game reddit.

414
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,740
There's gonna be a CNN documentary that's like the dark history of awesome culture.

415
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,980
It's so funny it's sort of this one man. It's the stupidest thing I've ever said.

416
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:58,180
It is the dumbest thing I've ever said. I don't know about that.

417
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,980
No that's crazy that you think that. What? You think I've said dumber things?

418
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:09,860
I have seen you drink 30 PBRs in one night. Yeah, I've seen you say way stupider shit than that

419
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:22,380
Like I was I'm always coherent when I was when I was drinking but like I was just loud stupid but as the least

420
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,860
It made sense

421
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,420
Sense

422
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:36,000
Wouldn't be using it. That's true. We should be coining more terms, dude. Yeah. Yeah, we haven't done. I mean that was like

423
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,460
The first word that can you like this this makes no sense

424
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,360
Yeah, the first thought that came into my head was like coining a term goes fish fry

425
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,180
And I don't know why I think it's really funny

426
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:57,360
I came up with that. I came up with the word fish. Yeah, you should call it oil boiling

427
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,360
Yo, that might be right now

428
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:14,580
French oil boiled

429
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:24,780
K. Oh B. See

430
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
turkey oil boil chicken

431
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:42,300
Hey, too much oil boy. I'm cutting out oil boiled things for my diet. We just got an oil boiler

432
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:51,380
It's like an oil boiler, but it's oil it boils

433
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,380
*laughing*

434
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,380
Boils the oil in air instead.

435
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,380
*laughing*

436
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,380
God damn it.

437
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
That is so fucking stupid.

438
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,380
*laughing*

439
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
And then you could sell

440
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,380
an oil boiler and the boiling oil.

441
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Those are like boiling oil.

442
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Oh yeah.

443
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
Boiling oil and oil boiler.

444
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
Boiling oil does have a very good

445
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,380
It does.

446
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
Oil, oil, boiling oil.

447
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:25,180
Boil boil boil oil boil boil. It does have a very nice ring to it. I will say it's real. Yeah

448
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,260
Which way would it go?

449
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:36,940
Okay. Now it's oil oil. Something is oil boiled, but then like canola oil would be called boil oil

450
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,140
Cuz it's for boiling. I need to get some boil oil for my oil boiler. Yeah

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
Oh, man.

Fuck it up.

456
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
De-oil the boiler.

457
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,100
I'm going to have a heart attack today, dude.

458
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Fuck.

459
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Yeah.

460
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
I'm going to have a heart attack so soon.

461
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,620
These COVID blood clots are forming in my brain.

462
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,940
I'm having an oil-boiled poor oil.

463
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,540
Dude, I'm eating some joyful oil boiling for me today.

464
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,380
Oh, I soiled my oil boiler.

465
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,420
Oh, fuck.

466
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:39,860
Oh, dude, my oil-boiled coil shorted out.

467
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,020
(laughing)

468
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,580
- Yeah, I have to get a new oil boiler.

469
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,340
- My coil's not oil boiling anymore, my oil boiler.

470
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,380
- But yeah, so there's one term, dude.

471
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,220
- Yeah, I've got a good term.

472
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,220
- Okay. - Okay.

473
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,100
- Down evil, it's like down bad, but it's like down evil.

474
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,660
- Oh yeah, down evil. - Shit.

475
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,500
- That's good, that's pretty good.

476
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,320
- That's pretty good, right?

477
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,180
- Yeah, dude's down evil.

478
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,620
- Yeah, I'm down evil.

479
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,300
- Dudes who are down evil.

480
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,740
- Dudes down, the down evil patrol.

481
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,780
Down dudes, dudes who are--

482
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,620
- Dudes who are down low.

483
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,620
I got a down evil due to our down low.

484
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,620
Pictures of John Travolta.

485
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:19,620
Tom Cruise. Due to our down low.

486
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,620
It's just every male Scientologist.

487
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,620
Pretty much, dude. That's why you join Scientology.

488
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,620
You're like, "I think my penis has been cursed somehow."

489
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,620
"I need you guys to use electricity on it."

490
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,620
I think gay people might have a certain amount of thetans in them.

491
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:37,620
I think no doctor has ever thought to study.

492
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,160
Doctors are ignoring this excess of thetans on gay men.

493
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,720
This is another thing that our doctor teams are going to uncover.

494
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,980
We're going to have one doctor who's an expert in thetans.

495
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,940
The first Scientologist doctor.

496
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:54,500
I don't want to get too into Scientology bashing.

497
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,100
I'm very afraid of them.

498
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,100
That is hilarious.

499
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,260
Do you think that you're on their radar?

500
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:00,260
I don't know.

501
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,260
Somebody could.

502
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,260
No, no, no.

503
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:06,020
Do you think they're subscribed to the premium feed of a podcast about list?

504
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,580
You think that, you think Tom Cruise

505
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,580
is gonna send guys to your house?

506
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,700
I, have you seen those videos though,

507
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,880
of like them confronting suppressive people?

508
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,060
Yeah, but those, all those people like used to be

509
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,620
Scientologists and shit. Oh that's true, yeah.

510
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,780
Did you, are you saying you used to be one?

511
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:24,820
I considered it.

512
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:25,660
(laughs)

513
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,900
Nah. Dude, when I was in LA,

514
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,540
I think I've talked about this before,

515
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,180
but like me and David Potashnik

516
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,820
were like walking around his neighborhood,

517
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,500
and he lived right next to the Scientology like media center.

518
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,420
Yeah. And they have like

519
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,440
this giant gate around it and there's cameras everywhere, but then one side of

520
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,540
it is like zoned commercial and it's like a strip mall. And apparently all of

521
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,720
those... Yeah, they're all front businesses. Yeah, all those businesses. It's like dry cleaners where you

522
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,560
walk in and there's no clothes anywhere. It's also... It's shit like that. Yeah, also

523
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:57,740
near the like the in the psychiatry museum when I was walking there, I walked

524
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,340
by there a few times and I think the multiple times that I walked by there

525
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:04,620
they always had construction workers that were standing there and like just

526
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:11,100
not working. God, what a sick, that is a dream job. That's just a normal construction worker

527
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:14,220
dude. No, but you know what I mean, they're just like standing, they're just like looking

528
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,060
around. They must have been Scientologists, they started like yelling at women and saying

529
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:23,100
they're fat asses and shit, saying "Honey, come here," which I think is a code in Scientology.

530
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,980
Yeah, that means "Honey, come here." That's absolutely just a paranoia thing, but it's

531
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:31,140
so creepy. Yeah. That they just, yeah, and they stand out there and try and get you to

532
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,160
I mean it's got to be a very cool religion to be a part of because all the

533
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:41,940
celebrities are in it. Yeah of course it's fucking sick dude. Giovanni Rubisi?

534
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,220
Yeah a celebrity based religion is genius. You're telling me you wouldn't

535
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:53,580
join a religion if Jenna Elfman was there? Can you believe it? Like only with

536
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,140
the power of Scientology could like a like a woman who looks like Elizabeth

537
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,520
Moss be like one of the most famous actresses in the world that's like so

538
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,660
impressive that is the power it's so funny that she's a Scientologist cuz her

539
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:09,500
like she's in like the Handmaid's Tale or whatever that is yeah she was like

540
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:18,120
flounder dude I'm just saying that you like a handmaid's tale is about like

541
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,800
like the like evil culture I don't know I've never watched it isn't it about like

542
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:28,280
how women are... It's about a few... It's about Merle Mumbleton. Yeah, I kind of, I think that is what

543
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:32,760
what like the the Hulu show is kind of about. It's like a speak truth to power show right? Yeah.

544
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,440
It's one of those shows that my mom calls me, she's like, "This, you have to watch this because it's

545
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:43,480
happening right now." My mom loves it too. Yeah, and it's like, oh yeah, also the main actress is like evil.

546
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,000
Yeah, the main actress is in an evil death cult. You know who is, and you probably wouldn't

547
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,600
think he is Michael Peña. Really? Yeah. That's pretty funny. That's why he was in Tom and

548
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:59,600
Jerry. Yep. They need to put Leguizamo in Scientology dude. God, who's your dream Scientology?

549
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,600
I got too many things. Huh? Tom and Jerry in Scientology is what I said. Yeah. That's

550
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,680
your dream Scientology? Well they would tear it down from the inside. You saw what they

551
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,120
did to the hotel in the Tom and Jerry the movie? That's true. Directed by Tim Story,

552
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,960
streaming on HBO Max. Yeah, I've seen it like probably 50 times. Yeah. I mean it's really

553
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,960
I mean, yeah.

554
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
But I mean, anyway.

555
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,200
That scene where Tom sings at the piano, ooh.

556
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
Oh my God.

557
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
When it wasn't a rap music, it just changed my life.

558
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,120
Their joint Instagram story is honestly just hilarious in a way I can't put my finger on

559
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,920
in many different fashions.

560
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,720
I mean, it is like Tom and Jerry, what Tom and Jerry would do today.

561
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,720
Exactly.

562
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,160
It's like it takes these beloved characters that kind of, you know, everyone loved as

563
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,480
a child and it brings them into the modern era.

564
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:48,120
shows what they would be like in a world full of pigeons that can rap and it has

565
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,160
everything and I'm always on the Jerry or twerking they're doing the wop dance

566
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,440
they both have only fans is and and exactly and it has it has one of the

567
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,000
most creative it's one of the most beloved millennial actresses of all time

568
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,440
Chloe Grace Moretz everybody in our generation is you know that's exactly

569
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:11,400
the actress you need to bring Tom and Jerry into a more modern era she's a

570
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,760
a queen and that's a dream team and I'm gonna scream when I see that on my TV

571
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,200
and that's kind of an example of the hip-hop kind of rap that you'll see in a

572
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,960
movie like Tom and Jerry. Exactly and you know you just have to respect too that

573
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,840
the director Tim's story I mean his output is just unreal he's he's directed

574
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,200
some of the best films of our time and you know just his his guts to put

575
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,040
himself into the movie as a news announcer pigeon I mean just listen to

576
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,800
Listen to what this guy's made.

577
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,720
This is just something else.

578
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,960
Let me pull this up here.

579
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,540
And while I'm pulling it up,

580
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,360
think about-- Kevin Hart's comedy special?

581
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,240
Tim's story.

582
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,440
Of course his name would be Story

583
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,760
'cause he's a storyteller at heart.

584
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,880
Exactly. Wow.

585
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,960
He's, I mean, and you can quote me on this, AV Club,

586
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,300
he's effing brilliant.

587
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:02,140
Let's see, he's directed Fantastic Four from 2005,

588
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,920
Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer from 2007.

589
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,480
He directed the Shaft remake from 2019.

590
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,780
He made Ride Along and Ride Along 2.

591
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,420
He made Taxi and Barbershop and Think Like a Man.

592
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,560
- Taxi was Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon?

593
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,400
- Mm-hmm.

594
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,800
- Wait, he made Barbershop?

595
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,640
- Yep.

596
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,620
- Okay, he might actually be goaded.

597
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:20,460
- He is goaded.

598
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,720
- Barbershop's awesome, dude.

599
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,400
- Barbershop's a good movie.

600
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,320
- He's making Monopoly the movie.

601
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,280
- Did this guy just walk around like a Barnes & Noble,

602
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,520
just pointing at shit, like,

603
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,680
I'm gonna make a movie out of that.

604
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,720
- He directed a bunch of Kevin Hart specials, too.

605
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,240
I'm gonna make a movie out of that Kevin Hart book.

606
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,760
I'm a grown little man, did he direct that?

607
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,000
Probably.

608
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,360
No, I think his budget, I think after Kevin Hart blew up... Yo, wait!

609
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,280
He's directing... Rest in peace, Kevin Hart.

610
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,200
He's directing Humbug,

611
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:59,480
a contemporary telling of the story of Scrooge. Yo!

612
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,120
Oh, that actually... Yes, dude, that's gonna be sick. That does sound fun.

613
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,780
I do kinda like that.

614
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,140
Ice Cube is Scrooge?

615
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Ice Scrooge!

616
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:08,140
I don't know if it's...

617
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,180
I don't know if Ice Cube is Scrooge or not.

618
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,920
He better be Scrooge!

619
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,380
I hate this Christmas shit!

620
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,380
It says...

621
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,380
No, no, no!

622
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Universal...

623
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:20,380
What if he's still in like 1800s like...

624
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,140
Like London?

625
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,380
Scrooge!

626
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,780
You have to go back to the past!

627
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,620
Man, fuck you man!

628
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:33,420
Universal Pictures has won a four studio bidding battle to acquire Humbug, a spec that is fast

629
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,380
coming together for Ice Cube to star in the title role.

630
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,380
Yeah!

631
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,380
Humbug.

632
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,500
He's playing Humbug, dude.

633
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,500
The title role.

634
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,500
The titular role, Mr. Humbug.

635
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:48,500
It's gonna be Scrooge, and then he's like a little ladybug and he's like, "Hey man,

636
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,500
what are you doing?"

637
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,500
Humbug!

638
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,500
He's Scrooge's sidekick.

639
00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:00,940
Scrooge's sidekick Humbug and he just walks around like, beatboxing and humming songs.

640
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,500
Yeah, and you're not gonna guess who Scrooge is being played by.

641
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,180
The real Scrooge.

642
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,180
Tom the Cat.

643
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,180
*Gasp*

644
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,180
Yo.

645
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,180
Man, Mr. Story does it again.

646
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:13,180
I'm gonna make the porn parody Cumbug.

647
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,180
Cumbug?

648
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,180
Yeah.

649
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,180
No.

650
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,180
Yeah, I'm gonna make Cumbug.

651
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,180
I, I, I hate having sex.

652
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,180
Yeah.

653
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:25,180

661
00:37:59,220 --> 00:37:59,720
He's gonna-

662
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,720

No, that's disgusting.

664
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
I'm going to jack you up with a Tenga egg.

665
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,480
Hello, Mr. Scrooge!

666
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Hey, if you showed a tiny Tim-

667
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,480
I just learned how to jack off!

668
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Look at my tiny penis!

669
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,480
Tiny Tim, that's the biggest penis I've ever seen!

670
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,480
Oh, what a toadser!

671
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,480
*laughter*

672
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:18,980
Hey, guys.

673
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,480
What?

674
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:24,480
If you showed a Tenga egg to a guy from the 1800s, you would die.

675
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,840
Yo, that's lowkey a funny tweet.

676
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
That's lowkey tweet status.

677
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
I might go viral.

678
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840
Sorry, I've been too busy battling cancer.

679
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
Is that why you're bald?

680
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
No. Yes.

681
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,840
We should just do that.

682
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,840
We should just pretend you have cancer.

683
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,840
If we just pretend I have cancer.

684
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,840
Alright.

685
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,840
This is a mission for the fans.

686
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
We give you black eyes every morning.

687
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
So your eyes are all sucky.

688
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,840
Whenever somebody mentions Caleb or something

689
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:58,820
something just be like oh I know it's so sad just you know guys cancer isn't that

690
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:05,780
crazy and didn't just let Caleb's like appearance that's like in college when

691
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:11,000
we pretended that I died for a sketch oh yeah everybody got so fucking mad yeah

692
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:17,600
which like duh like yeah I because Joe's post took it people took it way too yeah

693
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:22,920
Yeah, Joe was like, "You never want to hear this news."

694
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:28,360
And I remember thinking it was a joke until I saw Joe's post and I was like, "Oh, fuck,

695
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,360
wait."

696
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,440
Because I didn't know you guys that well at the time.

697
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
And I just remember-

698
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,800
Yeah, the ones that we were supposed to do were just being like, "Damn, this is horrible.

699
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:37,800
RIP."

700
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,160
And then just like a picture of you making a stupid face and it's like, "Oh, that's clearly

701
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,160
a joke."

702
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,680
And then people were being like, "My heart is broken today and it will never mend."

703
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,680
Right.

704
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,480
just like shit like that I remember like walking I remember outside of like I

706
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,600

00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,680
I was trying to think of one for present but I couldn't.

711
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:31,680
Jizz on this peasant.

712
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
Jizz on this peasant.

713
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,680
And this is about Bradshit.

714
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,680
Yeah.

715
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,680
Yeah.

716
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,680
Yeah.

717
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Those are the trials.

718
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,680
Oh man.

719
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,680
Oh man.

720
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,680
What?

721
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:41,680
It's still Christmas.

722
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Oh my god.

723
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
It's a...

724
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
Oh fuck I'm done.

725
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
I'm done.

726
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
I'm done.

727
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,680
I'm done.

728
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,680
I'm done.

729
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
I'm done.

730
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,680
I'm done.

731
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
I'm done.

732
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,680
I'm done.

733
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,680
I want to see a Scrooge played by Jackie Chan dude that'd be some pimp shit.

734
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,680
Didn't they do that?

735
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
Uh, honestly probably.

736
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:06,680
That sounds like Jackie, back in the, they were like what if it's Jackie Chan's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

737
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,680
I feel like I would, somebody might have said this before but Scrooge should be the next press tea troll like Joker is.

738
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
Yeah.

739
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
That would be good.

740
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,680
It should be the next thing that like corrupts actors you know.

741
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,680
Yeah.

742
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:20,680
You know I mean the idea, the idea that a man could hate Christmas was just.

743
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:24,920
The idea that a man could think it's okay to say humbug to his employee.

744
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:28,520
It is fucked up that like Daniel Day-Lewis would be like the most amazing Scrooge.

745
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Oh yeah.

746
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,440
Like he would fucking crush that role dude.

747
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,440
Yeah.

748
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,680
You know who would be a great Scrooge is Bill Murray.

749
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,160
Have they thought about that?

750
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,160
Yeah.

751
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,080
I don't really like Christmas.

752
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,760
Have they thought about it?

753
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,720
They should get Andy Serkis to play Scrooge as like a creature.

754
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,880
Like a Scrooge.

755
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,840
Like that could be like maybe like a modern retell.

756
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,200
It's like oh a Scrooge infected our town.

757
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:57,920
Yeah, what would in the well? What would a Scrooge look like like an elevated horror like a 24 thing about Andy circus?

758
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,920
And he looks like it looks

759
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,160
It's like the opposite of a Grinch. Okay, no comparisons to a Grinch can be drawn. It's already too similar

760
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,280
So it's not it's not green. It's not furry. You know probably looks like a wrinkled little little thing

761
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,920
I would lizard like a lizard maybe with a penis or something

762
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,840
but you know like a like a flesh-toned like a flesh-toned lizard like a

763
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:25,200
flesh-toned frog maybe yeah like a flesh that's a Scrooge yeah

764
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,120
and I'll let it as a person's head yeah it's like it's like got like it so like

765
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,720
you know like you know like a frog's head but it's got like a nose yeah mm-hmm

766
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,120
yeah the nose is very prominent I think is what Patrick is trying to say he's

767
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,000
trying Patrick is no I'm not on the nose no I'm not it to be have a certain like

768
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:53,680
faces in a direction it's like a reedy right like famously yeah famously okay

769
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:58,840
what religious symbol do you think you would wear on a chain around his neck

770
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:03,160
probably like a crescent moon with a star

771
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:13,680
and Bob Cratchit get this his job is he's a well cleaner

772
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,760
he's a well washer but he thinks the well is way bigger than it really is

773
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,160
yep he's like that's also the well over there he's pointing at people's houses

774
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,480
mm-hmm no come on dude and screw the scrooge

775
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,400
whispers evil ideas into him his head do you think we get our

776
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,120
ariester the bob yep okay wait so there's they're all creatures

777
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:39,280
everything's a creature everything's a creature uh and we could call it

778
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,160
i want to retract like it follows it'd be called it scrooges

779
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,160
I want to retract a few statements I made.

780
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Like what? I would like to retract oil boiling. It doesn't make any sense.

781
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,160
No, oil boiling is very good, but I think... Okay, never mind.

782
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,160
I want to clarify, if a frog

783
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,160
had a nose, it would look weird. Not necessarily.

784
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,160
It would look literally something like this. Like this.

785
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,160
I just want to clarify, there was no... Ew, weep it.

786
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
No, no.

787
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:12,160
You did not.

788
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Don't.

789
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Don't.

790
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,800
May I have a fly, please?

791
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:20,080
Don't imply that I said that.

792
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,200
Don't imply that I said a frog with a nose would look Jewish.

793
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,200
That is not what I said.

794
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Whoa!

795
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,200
What the fuck?

796
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,200
Where is that coming from?

797
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,880
What the fuck, dude?

798
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
You need to go to the hospital.

799
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:30,880
Yeah, I think you need to go to the hospital.

800
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:31,880
You have something wrong with you.

801
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:35,880
I don't want anyone to get mad at me.

802
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,400
They don't call you Rachel Patrick for no reason.

803
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,400
Why is it Rachel Patrick?

804
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
What?

805
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,400
Your full name?

806
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
No, it's Rachel.

807
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,400
Oh, I'm sorry.

808
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,400
Yeah, Rachel Patrick Edward Doran.

809
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,400
That's my full name.

810
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I'm sorry.

811
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:49,400
It's spelled Rachel, but it's like a gay thing.

812
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,400
I love your initials, dude.

813
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,400
R-P-E-D.

814
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
No!

815
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,400
I'm just walking on eggshells.

816
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
I'm just walking on eggshells.

817
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,400
I'm just walking on eggshells.

818
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
I'm just walking on eggshells.

819
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,400
I'm just walking on eggshells.

00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
I'm just walking on eggshells.

823
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,400
I'm just walking on eggshells.

824
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
I'm just walking on eggshells.

825
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,700

00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,080
I went there the other day

852
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:49,080

853
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,920

854
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,120

00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,920

00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:58,680
And I didn't buy it.

858
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,320
I'm really like regretting--

859
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:01,560

860
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,560

862
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,080
This honky's crazy, dude.

863
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,920
Yeah.

864
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,960
This honky, I need to see what this is.

865
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,040
It's a picture of Don Imus.

866
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,200
This honky's nuts.

867
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,680
This honky's nuts, I took a picture of it.

868
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,440
It's just a picture of him smoking a cigar.

869
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,560
Oh, that is a good color.

870
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,640
Oh, no, no, no, it's not him smoking a cigar.

871
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,060
It says X-rated on it.

872
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:27,260
Yeah, it's him sticking his tongue out.

873
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,380

882
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:08,420
stars. It's Imus. Awful. I hope he can blame this on drugs and alcohol. There's

883
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:11,940
no other excuse. I threw it away. Do not waste your money. I didn't even realize

884
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:16,820
that he did stand-up, dude. I thought he was just a radio guy. Yeah, I forgot that he did stand-up until I saw

885
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:22,620
that album. Bring it back, dude. Come back to her. Oh, yeah. There's a spider in here. Okay, we're stopping

886
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:28,520

887
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,420
Imus. I'm not worried about your... Can you just... The spider's not gonna kill you in

888
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,920
the next 20 minutes. Well, I don't... What if it's like a brown recluse and I don't

889
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:40,320
know? What color is it? It's too far away for me to tell. Then it can't bite you.

890
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:45,900
What if it's a bedbug? A bedbug crawling on the ceiling? A huge bedbug? What are you

891
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:51,460
talk about but that looks really it's a bit of a cm

892
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:54,140

893
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,820

896
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,860

897
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:11,860
other way

898
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:13,700
He's having so much fun.

899
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:14,700
I hate when you have fun, dude.

900
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,700
This brings a light to my heart.

901
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:16,700
This pisses me off.

902
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,020
This brings a light to my heart.

903
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,700
I hope the spider bites you and you get a new power.

904
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:21,700
Don't!

905
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:28,380
Don Imus actually had a good, he has really good album names.

906
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:35,100
The only other Don Imus album, or just Imus, the only other Imus I can find on Amazon is

907
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,860
an album called "1200 Hamburgers to Go."

908
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:38,860
That's pretty good, actually.

909
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,580
it's pretty good actually that's a really good album

910
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,260
scrolling around on my on this amazon page for this honkys and nuts and my and

911
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,180

915
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:04,620
innovators dilemma

916
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,540
wow you must be very intellectual very cultured i i was gonna

917
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:13,340
I was gonna do this thing where I just kept getting shit delivered to Caleb's house and then I realized like

918
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,540
I would have to spend money to do that, but I was

919
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,780
I was gonna

920
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:22,700
I I didn't I I don't know. I didn't want to just buy a bunch of stupid books that wouldn't show up

921
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:27,340
At the right time, you know, I don't know but I was gonna buy you the shoe bill storks fact book

922
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:31,420
Just wait for that to arrive

923
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:36,620
You can hand deliver it dude. You live down the street from me. No, I know you should buy stuff from me

924
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,140
I mean, we should both go and have something for you.

925
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,060
I was gonna buy 'em, but then I realized

926
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:47,060
I didn't have either of your new addresses saved.

927
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:49,260
I had Caleb's house in North Carolina.

928
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,500
Actually, that would be really funny

929
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,820
if I delivered something to Caleb's house.

930
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,660
My mom gets an IMAX record?

931
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:54,500
Yeah.

932
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,580
Like, what the fuck is?

933
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,660
Well, now I've ruined the bit.

934
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:57,500
That's a funny ad.

935
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:59,060
This is actually pretty good.

936
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:01,420
I keep doing this where I'll ruin the bit

937
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,220
instead of actually going through with it.

938
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,380
I did it the other day with the Nightcrawler stream.

939
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:07,860
What was the Nightcrawler stream?

940
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:11,980
I was gonna do like full Nightcrawler cosplay.

941
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:12,980
From X-Men?

942
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:13,820
From X-Men on stream.

943
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,060
You're gonna do blue face?

944
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,740
I was gonna dress up like Nightcrawler

945
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:19,980
and then do a whole stream normal.

946
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,300
And if anybody talked about it,

947
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,580
I would have a moderator.

948
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,420
Ban them?

949
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:26,020
Yeah, ban them and time them out.

950
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,060
That's good.

951
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:27,900
Yeah.

952
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,060
You should still do that.

953
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,460
No, 'cause now it's on the episode.

954
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,940
I mean, we'd have to edit this out of the episode.

955
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,780
All right, fine.

956
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:35,620
Just do it with like Marilyn Monroe or something.

957
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:36,460
Okay.

958
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,280
Yeah.

959
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,620
- Just come up with something new.

960
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:39,460
Get some better camera angles.

961
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,720
- Yeah, come up with something funny.

962
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,240
- Just think of something else.

963
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,920
- Just think of a new idea, dude.

964
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,760
- Okay, I got a new idea.

965
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,560
- I thought of one, oil boiling.

966
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,520
You come up with one, dude.

967
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:49,360
- That's true.

968
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,360
- I came up with one too, I came up with down evil.

969
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,520
- I thought I could just coast off of awesome culture, but.

970
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,800
- No, dude, we're way past that.

971
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,520
- It's a hungry industry.

972
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,960
I mean, making up stuff.

973
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,800
- Okay, I've got an idea.

974
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:01,640
- It's people wanting new stuff all the time.

975
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,800
- Terms are huge right now.

976
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:03,920
- It's a hungry industry.

977
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:06,920
I've got the perfect mascot for the hungry industry.

978
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:13,080
little hamster and he's hungry. No, that's an old idea. Come on dude, I need a new term.

979
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:18,760
Not a mascot, not a movie idea. Okay, I have this, there's a spider in my room right now.

980
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:25,400
What if his name was Michael the Crawler? That's old. It's old. This is all old stuff, okay?

981
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:32,360
It's, I mean... Ireland. That's a country. It's not making, you're not making any fucking sense

982
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:34,360
- Just come up with a word, a word for a term.

983
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,200
- Just like one term.

984
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,020
- All right, all right, all right.

985
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,520
- Like slang, like urban dictionary.

986
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:38,660
- Yeah, urban dictionary thing.

987
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,680
And not like, well it could be a sex thing.

988
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,800
- Okay, I got, what about like a crazy frog?

989
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,460
- You're looking at, there's a,

990
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:46,340
what do you have behind you?

991
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:47,820
What's that blue thing?

992
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:48,740
- Yoda mask.

993
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,180
- That's green.

994
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,780
- Behind that, blue.

995
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,700
- Cowboy hat.

996
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,760
- Underneath the cowboy hat.

997
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,740
What is wearing the cowboy hat?

998
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,020
- Picture of my nephews.

999
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:58,380
- No it's not.

1000
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,380
It's a stuffed animal.

1001
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,500
- You're cheating dude.

1002
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,460
You're fucking cheating.

1003
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:03,460
You have all of these written on your hand.

1004
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,460
That actually is a picture of his nephew as well.

1005
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,460
Wow.

1006
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:09,460
That's incredible. You're such a dedicated uncle.

1007
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,460
My sister gave me that

1008
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,460
for Christmas. Wow, that's a horrible gift.

1009
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:15,460
[Laughter]

1010
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,460
[Laughter]

1011
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,460
Give me a PSP dumbass.

1012
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:21,460
I don't want a fucking picture.

1013
00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:23,460
At least give me like a

1014
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,460
cool picture. Ansel Adams

1015
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,460
photo of a mountain or something.

1016
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:29,460
Yeah, it is a picture of them. It's a picture of my

1017
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,060
My nephew's a Santa.

1018
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,060
You just go, "Huh, thanks."

1019
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,060
Cool.

1020
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,060
I'll put, "It's not an X-Fox, okay?"

1021
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:38,060
I'll hide this behind my Crazy Frog plush.

1022
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:42,860
Hey, I know I haven't given you a Christmas gift in a little bit, so I got you a picture

1023
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,460
of my dog that you've met twice.

1024
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,860
Here you go.

1025
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:46,860
Pretty cool, right?

1026
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:47,860
No.

1027
00:52:47,860 --> 00:52:48,860
No.

1028
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,860
But I need you to come up with a term.

1029
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,860
There is a Crazy Frog era.

1030
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:53,860
Okay, wait, here's a term for that.

1031
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,860
Ready?

1032
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,860
Schadenfreude.

1033
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:57,260
A lame frame.

1034
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:59,840
when someone gives you a picture of something you don't want for a present.

1035
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,380
Cam's on a fucking roll right now, dude.

1036
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,380
A lame frame.

1037
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,380
You guys know I have the lame frame.

1038
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:04,380
A lame frame media.

1039
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,580
I can't think of these things.

1040
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:06,580
The lame stream.

1041
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,580
The frame stream media.

1042
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,580
Okay, okay, okay.

1043
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:12,780
The frame stream straight, flame.

1044
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,780
When Biden came in.

1045
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,780
The flame stream media.

1046
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,780
That's the Young Turks, because they're on fire right now.

1047
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:23,500
When Biden came into office, CNN became the tame stream media.

1048
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,900
Okay, close.

1049
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,900
You're getting somewhere.

1050
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:32,020
We kind of just already did two Aimstream media things.

1051
00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,380
What about the Aimstream media?

1052
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,380
That's actually pretty awesome.

1053
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,660
What about the Mainstream media?

1054
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:38,660
It's LiveLeague.com.

1055
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,900
Stop, do something that's different.

1056
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,380
Okay, that was actually something.

1057
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:43,860
But I do want a new thing.

1058
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,180
I want you to pick something, or we could pick something.

1059
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:47,180
A rollercoaster.

1060
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:49,220
What are you going to start calling a rollercoaster?

1061
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:50,220
What's a new term for a rollercoaster?

1062
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,460
Rollercoaster is already too goofy of a name.

1063
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,460
Shocking.

1064
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,460
It's a good start.

1065
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:59,460
Good start. Really good start.

1066
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:01,460
Shocking car.

1067
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:03,460
Shocking car.

1068
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,460
That sounds more like a bumper car.

1069
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,460
Or like an electric car.

1070
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:09,460
Yeah, that's like a Tesla.

1071
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:11,460
Crazy train.

1072
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,460
Crazy train is an Ozzy Osbourne song.

1073
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,460
It's pretty good though. It works.

1074
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:17,460
It's not bad, but it's already a thing.

1075
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,460
What about a roaster coaster?

1076
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,460
No, that's what you would call a rotisserie.

1077
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,460
No, that's what you would call a rotisserie.

1078
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:29,940
okay that's pretty that's yeah I got some finger licking chicken off the roaster

1079
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:38,420
coaster at the roaster stoaster the grocery store the stoachery grower yeah

1080
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:45,600
stop and stop I went to the stop and stop and I mean I mean roastery chicken

1081
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:50,020
coming up with new names for like a grocery store like if we were to come up

1082
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,500
with like a different thing.

1083
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,340
Yeah.

1084
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,580
We would just be naming a grocery store

1085
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,420
because that's how most grocery stores are named.

1086
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,700
But you guys are from Boston.

1087
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,580
You guys came up with Bubbler and like all this weird shit.

1088
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,380
Have you ever read the book Friendle?

1089
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:04,860
Yeah, I have seen Friendle.

1090
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,600
I haven't read it, I've seen it.

1091
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:07,440
You've seen it?

1092
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:08,900
I've looked at it and I've said,

1093
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,340
I'm gonna say yes to that.

1094
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,660
That was a great book.

1095
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:13,100
Friendle, that's a great book.

1096
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,940
You think that is a great book?

1097
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,140
Friendle, Moby Dick.

1098
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,700
Friendle is a great book.

1099
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,520
Yeah.

1100
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,420

1101
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,220
thing takes place in new hampshire

1102
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,060
so they are partial

1103
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:28,780
parsons

1104
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:29,640
uh...

1105
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:32,600

the

1118
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:07,720
the

1119
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,040
willful and the

Down will come Caleb, hitting his walls

1122
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:24,320
Dude, I don't want to fall. This sucks. Why would they sing a song about a falling

1123
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:29,000
baby, dude? It puts you to sleep. Yeah, it's telling the baby if you don't fall

1124
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:36,120
asleep right now, I'll fucking kill you. I'll fall on you. Mm-hmm. I'll fall upon you with my

1125
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:42,800
weapons. No. Yeah, so that cured your COVID. It's a Clapton song. No, it did not.

1126
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:48,280
cure my COVID. All of Eric Clapton's songs are about his dead son.

1127
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:56,280
Layla. He did write Rockabye Baby. Yeah. Mm-hmm. After midnight my son's gonna

1128
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:05,960
fall out the window. After midnight. You know what I was saying? Have you guys seen that video of Michael Jackson holding his son over the balcony?

1129
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,680
We've talked about this. Okay all right I just think about it a lot cuz I'm like

1130
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:10,180
Yeah.

1131
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,180
Relax.

1132
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,580
It is an insane video.

1133
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,180
Daddy's having fun, dude. Chill.

1134
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,180
Yeah, the baby needs to fucking calm down.

1135
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:16,680
Yeah.

1136
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,180
Which one? Which baby?

1137
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:18,380
The baby was fucking fine, dude.

1138
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,480
Which baby was he hanging? Was it Blanket?

1139
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,980
What?

1140
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,680
It was a kid named Blanket.

1141
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,380
Alright, never mind. That is abuse.

1142
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,380
Every part of that video is abuse.

1143
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:28,680
I changed my mind.

1144
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:30,680
Blanket, dude?

1145
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,980
What the fuck?

1146
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,080
Yeah, Blanket Jackson.

1147
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:35,480
That's worse than the...

1148
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:35,980
the...

1149
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,680
the Ha Ha Funny Elon Musk name for his baby.

1150
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,480
Yeah.

1151
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,380
blanket that one at least yeah that's like that's like they asked Michael

1152
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,340
Jackson at the hospital like hey what do you want to name the baby like looked

1153
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:54,800
around really fast yeah I get he did the the I love lamp scene from yeah with his

1154
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:01,760
child yeah goddamn dude I'm in other day he would have been so sick now no no no

1155
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,200
look around the room really quick to see what another child was smothered with I

1156
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:08,760
was thinking of Frank's name can you imagine how sick it would have been when

1157
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:11,860
Michael Jackson started supporting Trump for president.

1158
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,840
That would have been so fucking funny, dude.

1159
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,760
- No, Michael Jackson wouldn't, I don't think he would have.

1160
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,720
He would have supported Marianne Williamson or something.

1161
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:20,560
That's what I think.

1162
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,400
- Hell no, dude.

1163
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:24,320
Him and fucking Trump are on the same stack.

1164
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:26,160
Same fucking amphetamine stack.

1165
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,760
- Yeah, they were.

1166
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,280
- I think you definitely would have gone for Trump.

1167
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:32,120
- Nevermind.

1168
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:32,940
- What?

1169
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:33,780
- 'Cause I realized it would just be me

1170
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,720
saying somebody else's joke.
