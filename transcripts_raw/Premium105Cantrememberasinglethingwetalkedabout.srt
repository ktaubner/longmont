1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt!

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:13,260
- Oh my god.

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,260
(imitating gunfire)

6
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,540
- Scare all the audience at the up top.

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,920
- You did that, that was the last episode.

8
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,960
You can't do that anymore.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,600
- Oh yeah, true, yeah, but I'm scaring the audience,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,440
not Caleb.

11
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,560
- Joke's on you guys, I had fucking 15 cigarettes

12
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,400
on the way over here.

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,220
(burps)

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,220
central nervous system is completely blocked.

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,220
- Well I do have 15 cigarettes on the way over here.

16
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,040
- So you guys can't scare me.

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,080
- I wasn't gonna scare you.

18
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,800
- I'm dead now.

19
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,720
I'm barely alive.

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,980
You're gonna need to do one more thing again.

21
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,060
- I'm doing force lightning, Caleb.

22
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,220
- My heart isn't even beating right now.

23
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,540
My heart is slowly rotating like this.

24
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,340
- I'm in poor condition today.

25
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:50,900
- I can tell 'cause I see the bottom of your foot.

26
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,820
(laughing)

27
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,020
- What, what's wrong with that?

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,860
- I just don't--

29
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:56,860
- It's yellow with slime.

30
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,700
- Yeah.

31
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,520
- What's wrong with the bottom of your foot?

32
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,120
You don't have an arch on your foot at all.

33
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,120
You're excluded.

34
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,120
I have fucked up feet.

35
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,120
You have a completely flat foot.

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,120
Who has the flatter foot?

37
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,120
Me or Cam?

38
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:08,120
Might be a bit of a tarsup.

39
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,320
Hold on, let me take my sock off.

40
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,480
No, I don't want to see your foot.

41
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,040
Can we just fucking move on?

42
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,840
There's some people who would want to hear about my feet.

43
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
Who?

44
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,000
You can hear about them, I don't want to see them.

45
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah, I don't want to see.

46
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,040
Do you want to see the picture I took of Neil's foot?

47
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Oh yeah.

48
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
We were waiting.

49
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
He had his foot on his foot.

50
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,040
He had his foot on the table in the living room.

51
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,040
He was just...

52
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,040
Oh my fucking god.

53
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,040
How is that possible?

54
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Does it have a bruise on it?

55
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,040
I think so.

56
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,040
What?

57
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,040
Oh god, that's awful.

58
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
Feet are disgusting.

59
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,040
They're really nasty.

60
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Yeah.

61
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
I love how this picture is like blurry too.

62
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,040
It looks like it's attacking me.

63
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Yeah.

64
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
That looks crazy.

65
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
I just couldn't hold my hand steady when I was taking it.

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,680
It was so funny because he had his foot on the table.

67
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,500
We were all sitting around just talking and Cam just pulled his phone out and put it right

68
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,000
up to his foot and took the picture.

69
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I bet he was mad.

70
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yeah, maybe.

71
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,160
No, he thought it was funny actually.

72
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Really?

73
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,160
Yeah.

74
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Wow.

75
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
I'd be mad if he took a photo of my foot.

76
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,640
My feet are all kinds of fucked up.

77
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,760
All my toes have these permanent scratches on them.

78
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,920
I've got like a, I don't know if it's a bunion or a wart.

79
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,240
No, they're on the toenail.

80
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,240
Sorry.

81
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,420
know, has permanent scratches. I've had it since I was like 13 years old.

82
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,020
I've got some kind of bump on one of my toes.

83
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:30,020
That's nice.

84
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,020
Yeah, it's called your toe.

85
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,560
I don't know if it's a plant or wart.

86
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,800
A plant or wart?

87
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,240
Yeah, I could be growing a plant out of there.

88
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,240
You probably could.

89
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,040
I have a little sprout that's growing out of my pinky toe.

90
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,640
You have a fertilizer because you step in your own dookie all day.

91
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,920
I'm turning into poison ivy.

92
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,760
You like, you literally have dookie on the floor of your room.

93
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
No, I don't.

94
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
You do.

95
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:54,360
I saw a little perfect poopy pile on the ploar of your plume.

96
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,720
The ploar of my plume?

97
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
I-pod.

98
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,240
I saw a dollop of dookie in your doon.

99
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
Is there a fucking gas leak in here?

100
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
What's going on?

101
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Me me me me me me me me.

102
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
What did he say?

103
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
Fuck you.

104
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,840
He said like, "ploar the plume" and then said "i-pod."

105
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
I didn't say "i-pod."

106
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Who said "i-pod?"

107
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,840
I didn't say "i-pod."

108
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I-pod.

109
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:11,840
You're having...

110
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,840
I-pod.

111
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Caleb's having a stroke.

112
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
I didn't say "i-pod."

113
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,200
Oh my god, it hurts my stomach to laugh today.

114
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm so I'm suffering. He walked around.

115
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,800
He said I walked.

116
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,100
Okay, first of all, that's not what I literally said.

117
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,900
I walked around.

118
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,600
Yes, I'm much I sprinted for like an hour for the video.

119
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,300
We're making with Joan.

120
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:34,600
Alec.

121
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,100
Yeah, I did when I'm not in shape.

122
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm not like I don't like do stuff.

123
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,400
So sprinting for an hour is me up.

124
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,900
He's lying.

125
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,000
Now.

126
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,800
It's crazy that it the hierarchy is like of most in shape is probably like

127
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,680
Caleb me Cameron. Yeah, I go the other way or it should I should not be second. Yeah, but then I did it's messed up

128
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,160
And then I just had to I just had to do it even look like I'm a shit

129
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,360
And then I got a migraine like as I was going to bed and I woke up with it still going

130
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,240
Okay, so I'm I'm I'm suffering today. That's I'm telling you guys and you guys are laughing all over me

131
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:14,080
Well, I got in a car accident, you don't hear me complaining yeah, I flew out of the window

132
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,020
Yeah, this side you crashed your RC car. Nope. I don't drive an RC car. Not that small you drive an RC car

133
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:22,020
Okay, we riddle me guys

134
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,040
I might my Hot Wheels car flipped all the way over in the loop the loop guys

135
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,720
So I'm having a really stressful day Caleb and Stuart little share a parking garage little

136
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,400
You know me this in New York City you Riddler Jokers if I was as small as a

137
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,040
Thing that could be driving in our seat car. You're not talking into the megaphone. Yeah, I can't hear you

138
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:49,040
I was small enough to be driving an RC car, how would I hold the controls?

139
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,520
Just for the listeners to know, I've been pitch shifting Caleb's audio down like three octaves

140
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,520
for every episode.

141
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,040
Usually he sounds like a hummingbird.

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,760
I don't go like...

143
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,160
Okay, so the pitch shift malfunctioned for just a second there.

144
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,580
No, it didn't malfunction.

145
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,920
You don't have a giant reverse helium box.

146
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,720
645 Caleb.

147
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,080
That's how tall I am, 6 feet and 45 inches.

148
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,680
Six millimeters, four millimeters, five millimeters.

149
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,040
I don't, that seems pretty tall.

150
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,040
That's like 15 millimeters.

151
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
To you, that's like really tall.

152
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,520
Yeah, that's a million meters, so that's the most tall.

153
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,520
That is pretty tall.

154
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,760
15 millimeters, like that's like probably, that's really tall.

155
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
I think it might be.

156
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,440
I feel like if you jumped off that height, you'd die.

157
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
15 millimeters?

158
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Yeah.

159
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,040
I'm going to keep a stack with you.

160
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,120
I don't know how much a millimeter is.

161
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,120
I do.

162
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,840
How much is 15 millimeters roughly?

163
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
It's about 15 millimeters.

164
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,240
If you could do it with your fingers.

165
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,720
That's probably like, it's probably close to like .015 centimeters.

166
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,920
Oh, okay.

167
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,200
So it's smaller than a centimeter.

168
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
Is that correct?

169
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
I don't know.

170
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,360
It is smaller than a centimeter.

171
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,720
Can we get millimeters to centimeters on the clock?

172
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,360
I think it's 10 in a centimeter.

173
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm pretty sure.

174
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
Oh, okay.

175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,280
half an inch that's point six inches 15 millimeters point six inches that's

176
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,720
average i was pretty close i hear that's average wait wait change it from inches

177
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,440
to centimeters why i was gonna say it's gonna say point one or 1.5 i think yeah

178
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,440
1.5 i was i was way way wrong yeah all you knew is that it's base 10 and so it

179
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,120
was you just knew it was small which is that's the idea that's pretty much all i

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
think you guys have to give me credit for it i am giving you credit at least

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
- Just knowing math a little bit.

182
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,780
- You know it's smaller than a centimeter.

183
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,620
- How is that you knowing math?

184
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,460
- It doesn't matter beyond that.

185
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,420
- 'Cause you knew that metric is all just

186
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:48,360
in multiples of 10, you think that's you knowing math?

187
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,300
I don't think so.

188
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,000
- You didn't know what a millimeter was either.

189
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,060
- I knew it's a metric unit, so I knew that it was--

190
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,100
- But he did too.

191
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,720
- Yeah, but I'm saying it's not a--

192
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,480
- I think you didn't even have a guess.

193
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,900
You couldn't even think of a number.

194
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,160
- I have Caleb Beat here.

195
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,000
- Nope.

196
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,820
- You literally couldn't think of a number that entire time.

197
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,460
- You guys know I have less neurons

198
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,460
because of my small brain, and it's impressive that I can even form a single sentence.

199
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,460
But I don't have a small brain because I'm small.

200
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,460
It's small in comparison to my big body.

201
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:22,460
And I didn't come here rowing a leaf.

202
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
No, of course not. It was a bottle cap.

203
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,460
It wasn't a bottle cap.

204
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,460
[Laughter]

205
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:31,460
Very funny. No, I didn't.

206
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,460
I know you weren't rowing anything. It wasn't raining when you came here.

207
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:43,420
with a hawk and I didn't turn myself into a pickle. It was a sparrow. There's a

208
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,260
there's been a hawk at the park recently. Have you guys seen this hawk? No. No you

209
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,540
should try to catch him. I want to dude I keep seeing it he swoops like pretty

210
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:58,620
close to my head with a mouse in his like claws. What? Every time? Yeah I've seen it like

211
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,420
twice this week. Twice this week I've seen this hawk go up to this

212
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:09,320
lamppost with a mouse in his claws. I'm like damn I'm gonna try and like swing my

213
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,340
skateboard at the hawk. Save the mouse.

214
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,340
Yeah.

215
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,340
In like a bowling park.

216
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Just truck smacking a hawk.

217
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,340
That would be kind of cool actually.

218
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:24,340
That would be funny to see.

219
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,340
But I would get in so much trouble.

220
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Yeah. You should shoot him.

221
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,340
I would just get arrested on the spot.

222
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:32,340
I hate being in those situations.

223
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,760
where you have to swing a skateboard at a hawk to save a mouse.

224
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,380
Where I want to do something so bad but I know that somebody would like videotape it.

225
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:43,300
Yeah. And then I would get in a lot of trouble.

226
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,480
Like public urination?

227
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,780
Yeah, like shitting in public.

228
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,200
Dude, I almost got... I didn't almost get caught or anything,

229
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,980
but I did get caught on Halloween by a guy in a Mario costume.

230
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,900
While you was peeing?

231
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,440
While I was peeing in between like...

232
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,420
His butt?

233
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,660
Cheeks.

234
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,300
well as the player i was in the middle of a mario and a lowly g_e_

235
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,260

236
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,600

237
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,040

238
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,420
mario's not that that outfit near your neighborhood of the in

239
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,500

241
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:28,100

242
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:32,100
Are you serious it was Chris Pratt? Can I see a photo of Chris Pratt? Yeah. Wow, that's a good photo.

243
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,100
Go to Google and look up Chris Pratt. I'm looking him up. This is a hot guy.

244
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:41,100
Yeah. I hope he's not a Christian. Oh, I hope he doesn't love God.

245
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:48,100
I hope he's only one inch tall. You're gonna be sorely disappointed.

246
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,100
Chris Pratt, can you please autograph this postage stamp? No, I don't. I'm such a huge fan.

247
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,020
Well, not a huge fan, but I'm a...

248
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,020
I'm your littlest fan.

249
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,020
I'm the tiniest fan you have.

250
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,020
Chris Pratt.

251
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,020
@ChrisPratt.

252
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,580
I'm a fellow Christian and your littlest fan.

253
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,580
Your number point one fan.

254
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,340
Yeah, no, I'm not small though, like actually.

255
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,620
Like I fit on my couch normal and I barely fall between the cushions.

256
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,380
Your couch is a crumb.

257
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,200
That's what you thought of?

258
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,500
My couch is a crumb?

259
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,500
Yep.

260
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,940
You didn't have to think of it.

261
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,940
It doesn't even look...

262
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
We've been to your apartment.

263
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,980
You can't just say anything I use.

264
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,860
And notice I said we've been to your apartment, not in it.

265
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,860
You can't say...

266
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,860
Because we can't fit in your apartment.

267
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,860
That doesn't make any sense though.

268
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,340
It needs to generally have the shape of something.

269
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,860
Like you can't say...

270
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
Crumbs can be any shape.

271
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,380
Oh, the plate you eat off of is a piece of dust.

272
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,420
Your bathtub is a peanut shell.

273
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,820
That one makes some sense.

274
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,820
Because it's true.

275
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,820
It's not true.

276
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,140
And you bathe in peanut water.

277
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:52,820
If you, okay, if I'm so small, why can't I sit on one of your shoulders and I can just

278
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,820
walk around maybe sit in your pocket?

279
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,820
What are you talking about?

280
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,820
We do that like all the time.

281
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,820
How do you think you get-

282
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
But it's been a while.

283
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,820
How do you think you get on the train?

284
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,740
Yeah, your train is a crumb.

285
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,740
Look I'm trying to-

286
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,540
Yeah, basically your computer is a crumb.

287
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,540
You're so small.

288
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,540
You're so small that your shoes are crumbs, your clothes are crumbs.

289
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,460
You're basically, they call you crumbleb.

290
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,340
You're basically a small guy who also-

291
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,340
Crumbleb pits.

292
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,060
small you also have a lot of bread or crumbs around.

293
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,060
Hmm.

294
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,060
Yeah, I leave trails for myself.

295
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,460
Small stuff loves crumbs though.

296
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,540
I won't admit to being small.

297
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,740
I will say I do leave a breadcrumb trail everywhere I go.

298
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
Yeah.

299
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
Just to make sure I can get home.

300
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,100
That's how I get places too.

301
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,100
Yeah.

302
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,100
Yeah.

303
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,580
Well, Pat follows me and eats all the breadcrumbs as I go.

304
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,580
Yeah.

305
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
I'm just glad.

306
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,580
And then I get lost.

307
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,060
I'm just glad I can follow the breadcrumb trail to get back to my apartment.

308
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,420
That's how we met actually.

309
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
Yeah.

310
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,660
I was leaving a breadcrumb trail and uh...

311
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,660
I want to try that one time.

312
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:49,700
picking them up and doing that one. I want to try to leave a breadcrumb

313
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,220
trail see if I can get a home that way. I could see that as like one of those like

314
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:59,500
when you like when you like when you like open YouTube without an account it

315
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,940
shows you like a city to find your house it's all it's all it shows like like a

316
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,540
like it shows the like the the vloggers that no one's ever heard of and they're

317
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:14,980
like I like did I but that would be a really good one of those videos like

318
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,980
- Yeah, I followed a breadcrumb trail from New York City to my house.

319
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,380
- It'd be cool to follow a bread-- I mean, the thing is, there are breadcrumb trails here.

320
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,780
There's breadcrumbs. I probably passed seven loaves of bread worth of crumbs on the way here.

321
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:32,880
- I followed a few glass shard trails, but they usually just take me from, like, one line on the sidewalk to the next,

322
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,280
so they're not very interesting to follow.

323
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:39,380
One really good trail is-- there's really good train station trails.

324
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,880
- That's true. Train track trails?

325
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,380
- Yeah. Those are good.

326
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,180
- Those will take you--

327
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,580
- Yeah, building trails, too.

328
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:48,500
You ever look and like see like the lights on in one of them?

329
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,060
In one of what? In a building? Yes.

330
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,820
In a train? In a train? Yes.

331
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,660
I've seen the lights on in a train. In a train tunnel.

332
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,580
There's like lights on in a train tunnel? In a train station? Yes.

333
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,180
I've seen lights on. Usually when I cross the street,

334
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,620
I leave myself a trail of white dashes on the ground.

335
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,580
And also I build a sign with a picture of me. Yeah.

336
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,420
I was on an R train. With a picture of my big red hand.

337
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,140
I was on an R train and I looked, it was like middle of the tunnel.

338
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,420
Yeah, you were. And I saw like the lights on

339
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:18,500
in the train. I was like, "Damn, if I could live in there, live in the train tunnel."

340
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,820
Wait, you saw the train.

341
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,220
You saw the train.

342
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,940
You persisted.

343
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,180
I saw the train tunnel with the lights on.

344
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,860
And you said...

345
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,860
"Damn, what if I could live in there?"

346
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,860
What if I could live...

347
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,420
In the train.

348
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,540
We did see some elves fixing the train. Do you remember that?

349
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:33,860
Oh, yeah.

350
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,060
And they disappeared.

351
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,460
Dude, this was so fucking freaky. We were coming back from Six Flags. It was like 3,

352
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,600
four in the morning we're sitting at some that's how late you guys got back yeah

353
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,600
we're sitting at we're sitting at World Trade Center one of those like train

354
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,480
stations well those are the you know no we were in we were in the elves that

355
00:13:52,480 --> 00:14:05,400
stayed home we were what that is true no elves died in but there was like we have

356
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,540
to go. Yeah we heard like some like some like clanging and voices from the tunnel

357
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,920
and I thought maybe there were like devils sabotaging the tracks or something.

358
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,200
We looked and there was there was two little green I think they were green

359
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,040
gnomes or elves. They were either green or skin colored. No they were green and they

360
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:29,440
were they were going away with little little squeaky hammers. And my mic just

361
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,520
stopped working for a second. So scary but they're singing a song. Did you

362
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,080
actually see elves? I don't remember there were elves but then the train came. There were

363
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,200
little elves working down there and the train came and I was like those guys need to get

364
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,240
out of there. They're going to fucking die. They're going to get killed. And they didn't

365
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,880
come out and I was like we're going to watch these little elves get killed and then the

366
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,800
train came and right as they were coming I looked and they were gone. And then they came

367
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,320
back when the train left. Yeah. It was fucking terrifying. Yeah we called the person who

368
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,240
was still waiting at the train station after we got on the train and they said they were

369
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,080
Alright, I believe this. I believe that there were elves.

370
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,080
It's true.

371
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,640
There are subway elves in New York. That's one of the big things about this city.

372
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,520
Well isn't there like bronzed little subway elves in the 14th street station?

373
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,760
Those are the elves that died in service.

374
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,760
By getting hit by the train.

375
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,040
Yeah, and they bronze them after. That's why all the bronzed elves are so grotesque and

376
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,760
their viscera is...

377
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,480
- They look like the little green guys from Fraggle Rock.

378
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,360
- The Fraggles.

379
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,400
- No, no the little guys.

380
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,840
- Oh, the green Fraggles, yeah.

381
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,680
- No.

382
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,500
- The little Fraggles.

383
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,760
- No, not the Fraggles.

384
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,640
- Right, oh the Rocks.

385
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,840
- They're not the Rocks.

386
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,760
The little green guys, I forget their names.

387
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,480
- I think they were Rock Fraggles.

388
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,320
- No.

389
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,120
- I think you're gonna grabble my cock.

390
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,240
- There's red, and red was the main Fraggle.

391
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,080
- Knock it off, quit grabbling my cock.

392
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,920
There's the purple fraggle with the blue hair.

393
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,040
- Grapple cock.

394
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,880
- Grapple a cop, is that what you said?

395
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,040
- No, I said grapple cock.

396
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,440
That's a good, that's a fun phrase to say.

397
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,160
- There should be an MTV--

398
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,000
- There's a big guy who says,

399
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,820
"Look, mom, I found a fraggle."

400
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,080
- UFC show where they get like a--

401
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,880
- There's a little green guy and they do work.

402
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,720
- Yeah.

403
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,560
- You know?

404
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,380
- Like it's like a Deadliest Warrior thing,

405
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,560
but it's the same matchup every--

406
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,400
- But it's real.

407
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,240
- It's just different cops and different guys.

408
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,000
- It's just like literally just an octagon style UFC fight

409
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,280
between like guy who volunteers and a cop.

410
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,720
you know and they should make uh...

411
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,540
they should be forced in fire but they're making guns there's a new season

412
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,200
did you hear what i said

413
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,760
that's a good idea yeah

414
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,260
but there's a new season of force of our government acted by my own brain

415
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,200
i'm pretty excited

416
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:46,720
i really hope they make a career sort of something out of damascus steel uh...

417
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,740
they love them asked if they don't ask i was at the time as a steel and like

418
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,080
elementary school 'cause i got this like kids magazine that would have

419
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,000
uh... was a called

420
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,540
Damascus steel samples?

421
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,740
- Muse. - The Doozers.

422
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,840
- Muse, okay.

423
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,240
Muse, you remember, my mom signed me up for Muse,

424
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,000
I think it was called Muse Magazine.

425
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,600
Those are Fraggle Rockers.

426
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,440
- Those are the Doozers.

427
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:09,560
- Those are called Rockers.

428
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,920
- They're the Doozers.

429
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,000
- And there was one article in there

430
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,440
just about Damascus steel, and I thought it was so cool,

431
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,120
even though it was a boring article, it was like--

432
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,320
- It's cool as fuck, dude.

433
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,480
- It's not cool when it's written down, though.

434
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,320
- But it looks cool.

435
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,640
- It looks cool on a video.

436
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,280
- It looks cool. - Damascus steel?

437
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,720
- Yeah.

438
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,260
I could live with it or without it, I don't care.

439
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
Damascus steel?

440
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,260
Yeah.

441
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,480
What are the things you couldn't live without in this world, Patrick?

442
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
My friends.

443
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Mm-hmm.

444
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,480
People aren't allowed.

445
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
I said things.

446
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Okay.

447
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,480
It shows what you fucking think of us.

448
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
He thinks his friends are things.

449
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Probably.

450
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
You think I'm just a sex object?

451
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,520
Well, first off, my 700 slaves.

452
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,000
I would bring them to my desert island, no question.

453
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,040
Well, yeah, how else am I gonna get around this thing?

454
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:54,800
And for my desert island album, I would have to say the magical song that commands my slaves

455
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
to do my bidding.

456
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,880
Yep, the one that makes your eyes completely white and makes you build me a house.

457
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,120
And the movie would be that swirly thing I put on the TV screen that makes them follow

458
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
my every command.

459
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,000
And I would play it on, basically they would arrange themselves in a kind of cheerleader

460
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,200
position and each would play one pixel of the movie and run around and show me a movie.

461
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,440
I'd have to say too my Desert Island book would probably be 101 fun activities to do

462
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,800
with your slaves on an island.

463
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:23,280
Pat Rick actually does have slaves that he uses like nanobots.

464
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,280
Yeah.

465
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:24,780
Yeah.

466
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,280
Yeah.

467
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,960
And he, they sometimes are a roller coaster.

468
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,460
Yeah.

469
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:27,960
And uh...

470
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,680
Oh my god.

471
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,480
Well, okay.

472
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,980
Oh my god.

473
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,980
Don't act like, don't act like you guys don't have fun on that roller coaster.

474
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,180
It's so much fun.

475
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,680
Yeah.

476
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:41,680
It's, they've, yeah, well one of the slaves, his face is like the exact reverse contour of my, of like my ass.

477
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,180
Yeah.

478
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
Yeah, so.

479
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,680
Yeah.

480
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,180
It's a good seat.

481
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,380
Yeah, it's a great seat.

482
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,380
It's pretty much, they're basically like the doozers.

483
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,580
They just fart on them.

484
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,980
Yeah.

485
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,180
Not dead.

486
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,840
I like the slave who draws a picture of us what we looked like on the big drop

487
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,480
after we ride it. Yeah that's right and he gets really white for a second.

488
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:03,240
He does that. And he has a beautiful painting of us

489
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,680
with our arms up and one of us is clapping because we love the ride so

490
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,040
much. I always show my tits. Show my tits on the ride. Show my tits on the stretcher.

491
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,800
I always like basically just like glue down like monopoly pieces to a board

492
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:19,720
and it's like a pretty funny joke every time. Yeah it's like funny as hell.

493
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,720
that was

494
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,880
that was

495
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,160
uh...

496
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,120
one of the worst things you've ever done

497
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,280
there were so many of those there's so many of those monopoly pieces that like

498
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,960
as you've been use a lot of glue

499
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,880
radio and that guy when my slaves i

500
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,440
oh yeah well that was on purpose

501
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,180
well because you know the little die cast metal dog

502
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,640
well yeah it's pretty easy to fall off the bar me you know you don't

503
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,900
you didn't know i had a i had a pellet gun

504
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:54,260
Oh yeah. I had a custom pellet gun. So you were just telling me that it was the

505
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,700
the the little die-cast dog from Monopoly. I didn't know. Oh it was the die-cast dog.

506
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,340
Oh you put a pellet gun you put the dog in the pellet gun. Yeah.

507
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,420
Oh and you shot. You shot at my slave with a dog. Yeah this is becoming more clear. Yeah. Okay.

508
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,780
Kind of a clue situation. Clue? Now that's a good board game.

509
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:25,460
true yeah yeah Patrick with five hundred getting so excited to like glue do the

510
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:28,900
glue down pieces thing and you the only board game you have is Scrabble and you

511
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,900
but you just like do just a bunch of random letters. There's no doesn't spell

512
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,980
any words. They're like not in the right spaces. Those were the thing is about

513
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:41,140
those like yes, those are played out, but if I went if I got off of a roller

514
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:46,180
coaster and I saw that I'd be I'd laugh my ass off. Yeah, I would laugh my

515
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:49,300
ass all year i'd last are a thorough my i feel like

516
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,040
yeah

517
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,960
it'll be funny though to get little

518
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,460
to get a little turkey somehow yeah and for life from a six flags as you try to

519
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,060
smuggle in a chessboard yeah well you know what you're doing immediately

520
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,420
yeah i know that you're not sitting at the dip in dot if you're going to get

521
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,340
a hand for life at least bring in like

522
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,840
think i'm gonna get really good at something else

523
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,640
yeah i think i i think i'm gonna get really good at chess i think i have a

524
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,220
perfect mind for it

525
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,420
right

526
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,420
It takes you a long time to move the pieces though.

527
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,420
I'm sick of games.

528
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,420
Uh, well I ride the pieces.

529
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,420
Yeah.

530
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,420
I'm tired of games.

531
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,420
And that's how I dictate to somebody bigger than me.

532
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:24,420
You're tired of games, including chess?

533
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
Yeah.

534
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,420
Yeah.

535
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,420
I'm tired of these games, man.

536
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,420
Man, it's not real.

537
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,420
I'd rather get into checkers.

538
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,420
I think I could be really good at checkers.

539
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
Okay, how about this?

540
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,420
Tomorrow, 3pm, my chess pieces versus your checkers.

541
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
Are you serious?

542
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,420
You're busy?

543
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,420
Yeah.

544
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,180
Well then, you lose by default.

545
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,180
I win by default.

546
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
Good game, my fellow foes.

547
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,180
I just rescheduled the game to yesterday.

548
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,180
It seems like you didn't show up.

549
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,260
I feel like he's doing some Bobby Fischer type move.

550
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,640
I just rescheduled my...

551
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,640
This is...

552
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,640
You can't reschedule.

553
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Pay attention, kid.

554
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
This is mental chess.

555
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Okay.

556
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,640
Huh?

557
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,640
I already won.

558
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
You can't reschedule it.

559
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,640
Stupid says what?

560
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,640
Who?

561
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,640
Wow.

562
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,640
What'd you say?

563
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,640
I said what?

564
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
He got me.

565
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,640
I said what?

566
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
I said what?

567
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
I said what?

568
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
I said what?

569
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,640
I said what?

570
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
I said what?

571
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
He got me.

572
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,600
What was Bobby Fischer's deal?

573
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,600
He was like a little freak.

574
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
He was Hank Hill's son.

575
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Okay.

576
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,600
In the show.

577
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,840
I think he, I believe he was the, you know, Autismo Chess Master kind of thing, right?

578
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
I don't know.

579
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
Wasn't he?

580
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,840
Wasn't he?

581
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,440
Well, I know that he like, I don't know who he is.

582
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,960
He just like exhausted a guy into like making him lose a game.

583
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
By just like not showing up.

584
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
He exhausted a guy?

585
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,240
he just kept like not showing up to the match. He exhausted the guy. Yeah he exhausted him.

586
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,000
How did he exhaust him? What did he do to him? Like draining him like the dark crystal.

587
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,400
Yeah. And begin.

588
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:02,920
The essence. God. Is it my turn yet? Is it my turn yet? Hey is it my turn yet? Is it my turn

589
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,680
go can I go can I go can I go and then taking 200 minutes on his turn. Why is chess the

590
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:16,480
only board game where there's like a flourishing yeah yeah a competitive scene.

591
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,460
You can be very good at clue. You can be very good at shooting. You know what's more

592
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,440
impressive? If you're very good at clue because it's all stuck in it is all

593
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,040
shit in an envelope. Exactly. Can you imagine you sit down for the Bobby

594
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,720
Fisher of chess and you sit down that you put the cards in the envelope

595
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:35,360
immediately he guesses it. He's just like yeah, Mr. Mrs. Violet in the study with

596
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,240
the candlestick, you open up the clue, the clue, you open up the clue. The top secret

597
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,160
envelope. Yeah, it's there dude. Mm-hmm. It's fucking, that'd be so cool.

598
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,920
That would be cool. What board game would you be the best at? Would you like to be the

599
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,640
best at? Like what would you like to be the world champion of? Mousetrap, because I could

600
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,080
never figure that shit out. Mousetrap is a really good pick. That'd be crazy cool. Even

601
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:04,080
Even the world championship of mousetrap, they don't play the board game, they just do the Rube Goldberg machine.

602
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:09,080
It would be cool if you 3D print your own pieces like Warhammer or something.

603
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,080
And then you're in there just fucking...

604
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Mousetrap, Warhammer.

605
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
Yeah.

606
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,080
The mouse has a gun.

607
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,080
I think there is Rube Goldberg machine competitions for marbles.

608
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
Yeah, probably.

609
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
Whichever one is judged, though.

610
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
There's not a clear-cut winner.

611
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,080
Yeah, there needs to be rules.

612
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,920
You know what I like watching? Sometimes, the marble racing videos.

613
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,680
Oh yeah, marble racing is so sick.

614
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
That's the coolest shit I've ever seen.

615
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,480
Yeah.

616
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,360
They, a guy builds a humongous slide, right? And I'm not saying humongous because it's,

617
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,320
because of how small I am. It's actually huge.

618
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,280
Okay, so when you say humongous slide, you mean like,

619
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,720
Like it's like a slide wedge over here.

620
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Here's how big it is. It can fit 10 marbles on it.

621
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:04,160
says huge and he races them he has like a start and an end and he talks about it like it's a real

622
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,080
race like it's nascar or something he was like here comes blue coming up and here comes the

623
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:18,480
red marble have you seen the guy who does the the treadmill races no oh those are sick oh wait yes

624
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,980
Yeah, I've seen those. Those are so cool, man.

625
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,680
Did you see the ant treadmill? Did you see that video?

626
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,180
No.

627
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,180
It was made a treadmill for an ant to study how ants walk or something.

628
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,180
Let me see if I can find it.

629
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,180
It's pretty cool.

630
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:39,180
I wish that these guys who do these inanimate object racing things would invent backstories for the different things.

631
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:44,680
Yeah, I know. Because it's like you got like the teams, like you got like the blue blazers and shit and like the red like...

632
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,980
Yeah, like why are they so... Why are they all about color?

633
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,980
Yeah, he just runs on a ball.

634
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,980
Oh my god!

635
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,980
Oh damn.

636
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,460
That's a fast ass ant.

637
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,460
That's an ant treadmill.

638
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,460
Damn!

639
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,460
It's like a styrofoam ball.

640
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
It's like a track pad.

641
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,820
Scientists built a tiny treadmill specifically for ants.

642
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,820
Caleb you might want to try this treadmill for ants.

643
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,820
What is this?

644
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,820
A treadmill for ants?

645
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
I'm trying to lose some weight.

646
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:04,820
Right?

647
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
From Zoolander?

648
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
Oh yeah, that is funny.

649
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,820
That is pretty funny.

650
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
Hey, this from Zoolander.

651
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,500
The gas station?

652
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,500
Yeah.

653
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Yeah.

654
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,740
Yeah, you didn't, if he's saying wake me up before you go-go, a layman would guess it,

655
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:23,740
I guess did right away. I knew from Zoolander. Right. Yeah. Alrighty then. That's Ace Ventura.

656
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:28,740
Wait, he's the Zoo Master. Checkmate. Right? The Zoo Master? Zoo Master? Right? No. No.

657
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:34,740
Is it with the animals? No. Zoolander. Zoolander. There's no... Alrighty then. No, you fucking...

658
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,740
Are you serious? Was that when we watched that impressions guy video, the guy doing the

659
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Ace Ventura impression? Oh yeah, he did Zoo Master. Yeah. Really? He did a Zoo Master

660
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
That was pretty good.

661
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,740
I told you guys about the guy.

662
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,740
He was going like this.

663
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,740
I told you that already.

664
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
I told you.

665
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,740
Oh yeah.

666
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
Yeah, you talked about that.

667
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,740
Yeah, the dude in my class.

668
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
Yeah, we watched that video yesterday.

669
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,340
Watched it again.

670
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,580
The video, it's like best Eddie Murphy impression done by a white boy.

671
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
Oh yeah.

672
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,580
It's a classic.

673
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
It is.

674
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,580
That was pretty cool.

675
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,940
He's really fucking good at it though.

676
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Really?

677
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
He's a good Eddie Murphy?

678
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,940
He's really good at Eddie Murphy.

679
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,940
He gets to laugh down.

680
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,940
I'm making waffles.

681
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,940
No, he doesn't sound like that.

682
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,940
I'm making waffles.

683
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:09,940
He does the hee hee hee hee hee hee hee.

684
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,940
You're not.

685
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:16,280
You're not. I'm making my own voice. You're not the white boy from the video. I'm the white

686
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,580
boy from the video. Nah, no sir. White boy from the video does the perfect impression

687
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:24,940
in real life. White boy from video does perfect impression of the video of the white boy doing

688
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:31,940
Eddie Murphy. The Numa Numa guy. Oh, dude. White boy does perfect Numa Numa guy impression.

689
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:38,220
If Numa Numa came out today it would be called the white boy sings in perfect German. Numa

690
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,220
Numa Numa style.

691
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,220
Yeah.

692
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,220
Yeah, Numa Numa.

693
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,220
What other videos would be renamed?

694
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,220
That's not German.

695
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,220
I think it's Belgian.

696
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Oh, is it?

697
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
Mm-hmm.

698
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,220
Don't give a fuck.

699
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,220
I think Dragosta Dente.

700
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,220
I thought it was like Romanian or something.

701
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,220
Whatever.

702
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,220
It's a good song.

703
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
It is.

704
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,220
It's catchy.

705
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,220
And then he tried to do a fucking...

706
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,220
Oh, Numa?

707
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
As in Belgian, like French?

708
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:58,220
Numa Urahe?

709
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,220
Numa Urahe.

710
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,220
Yeah.

711
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
Yeah.

712
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,220
Fuck you, Gary Braulsma.

713
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Gary Brauls...

714
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,220
Fuck you, Gary.

715
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,220
It's so...

716
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
I fucking...

717
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,220
If Gary's listening to this, I'm fucking...

718
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:11,320
brought up that guy by his full name so many times in my life.

719
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,520
Yeah, because it's kind of impressive to be like, I know his name.

720
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,020
I know the numismatist's real name.

721
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,520
Gary.

722
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:27,120
It's like I went to Boston Calling a couple years ago, and I was waiting outside,

723
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,820
like me and my ex were like meeting.

724
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,520
We were waiting to meet Mac DeMarco because we were like 19.

725
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,320
And there's like these two kids who kept talking about Overwatch.

726
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,020
No, it's like a group of kids that kept talking about Overwatch,

727
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,120
and then one of them was like, "Yo, pull up Wikipedia right now.

728
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,920
I'm gonna tell Mac his full name."

729
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,320
Because he's got some like fucked up like Canadian, like,

730
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,620
like it's like McBrayery, like something.

731
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,920
And he's like, "Yeah, I'm gonna tell him his full name."

732
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:55,920
And I just like, I just walked away from that group.

733
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:56,920
If I was meeting Mac DeMarco with my girlfriend,

734
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:02,420
I would make sure she was wearing like a, like a mech suit or a knight's armor or something.

735
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,220
Well that's why you tell him his full name, so you can rebuke him.

736
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,300
You can draw a circle around your girlfriend with salt.

737
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:14,100
I still like his music, I don't give a shit what anyone says.

738
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,260
I think his newer albums are still good.

739
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,500
You never got into that?

740
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
Nope.

741
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,500
Never got into smoking cigarettes?

742
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
No.

743
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,980
Smoking cigarettes and finger popping girls?

744
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,460
Oh yeah, Mac DeMarco style bitch.

745
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:29,900
It's a Mac DeMarco summer dude.

746
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,700
I mean a Lunchable and using my slimy turkey fingers to fucking finger pop somebody.

747
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:40,780
That's still, I mean, freaking out the neighborhood, still an amazing sight.

748
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,340
You know how he freaked out the neighborhood at that one party.

749
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:45,580
Yeah, by fingering all the people there.

750
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:49,220
"Oh yeah, fuck, fuck baby, fuck, fuck baby."

751
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Just fingering people.

752
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,740
I bet he fingers with the pinky white ass male bitch.

753
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
That's right.

754
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:58,380
Well, yeah, when he fingers he has a huge gap between his two fingers.

755
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,380
Yeah.

756
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,380
Yeah.

757
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,060
I think I can still fit a cig in here.

758
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,060
This gap.

759
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,060
What?

760
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,060
No you can't.

761
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,060
No way.

762
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,060
I mean, maybe squeeze it.

763
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,060
I mean, don't do it though.

764
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,060
It's not good for you.

765
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,060
Yeah.

766
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,060
Don't do that.

767
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,060
That's good for you.

768
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,060
That's how his teeth got all fucked up.

769
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
Yeah.

770
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
I don't trust people with fucked up teeth, man.

771
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,380
That's the beginning of the entire body.

772

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,120
- Why don't you get them removed?

783
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,240
- Look, the forehead's the stupidest part of the body.

784
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,380
- I wanna make my teeth look like Shane McGowan's teeth.

785
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:03,260
I wanna have a life of poor dental hygiene

786
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,380
and whiskey drinking that my teeth turn black.

787
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,080
- You're developing whatever the teeth version is

788
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,660
of cauliflower ear.

789
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,500
- Yeah.

790
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,840
- It's just like an occupational hazard.

791
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,680
- Mouth cancer.

792
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,300
(laughing)

793
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,280
- Yeah, it's just what happens

794
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,040
when you do what I do that long.

795
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,120
I'm so scared of getting mouth cancer.

796
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,320
I'm scared of cauliflower ear.

797
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,000
Can you imagine how fucked up I would look?

798
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,560
All you'd have to do is drain it.

799
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,080
Oh, but you, yeah.

800
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,080

Yeah.

802
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,080
Dude, it'd be over for me.

803
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,240
I can't, I can afford to make my ears look a little bigger.

804
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
No, I can't.

805
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,240
I have nothing to hide.

806
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,240
You can't.

Yeah.

809
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
You'd be able to float away.

810
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
Just on your ears alone.

811
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
You know what?

812
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,280
I'd be able to float away.

813
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
That's right.

814
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
Yeah.

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,040
And would that be so wrong?

903
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,800
Tim Robbins.

904
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,440
Tim Robbins. Not Robinson.

905
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,440
You think Tim Robinson wrote a Robert Altman movie?

906
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,160
1992? That would be a good movie. That would be the best movie ever.

907
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,280
Yeah, Tim Robinson and Robert Altman working together, that'd be sick.

908
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,360
Yeah. That's pretty cool. And I think it'd look a little something like this.

909
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,840
We're all trying to find the guy who uh... What kind of trying to find the guy who...

910
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
We're all trying to find the player.

911
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:02,040
We're all trying to find the player who played this.

912
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Yeah, that could be good.

913
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,040
That could be pretty good, yeah.

914
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,400
We're all trying to find Robert Altman.

915
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,600
I don't want to be the player anymore.

916
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,840
We're all trying to find the guy who directed this.

917
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,000
Anyway, you keep talking about the player.

918
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,240
We're all trying to find the guy who wrote the movie with Robert Altman.

919
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
It's my favorite kind of movie.

920
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,280
It's a self-referential Hollywood movie, right?

921
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,480
people are walking around and they're going Hollywood yeah yeah they're yeah

922
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,880
they're walking around there's a popcorn a candy bar and a soda and they're

923
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,960
walking around and they're all going to the movie they're all headed yeah they're

924
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,560
singing a nice little song about it's one of Robert Altman's greatest

925
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,840
achievement you think those freaks eat in the lobby those fuckers those fuckers

926
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,320
what are the crazy you know if they get are they getting popcorn their own kin

927
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,720
or what I think the candy eats the popcorn and the rock corner scissors

928
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,200
the soda. But then the soda eats the candy.

929
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,720
Yeah, no I think the candy eats the popcorn. Yeah, yeah. Candy eats the popcorn

930
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,120
because chocolate popcorn is pretty good. And the soda drinks the or eats the

931
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:15,120
popcorn. So they both eat the popcorn. What does the popcorn eat? You're bad at this.

932
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,280
Hold on, the popcorn. He's never played rock paper scissors. The popcorn drinks the soda because it's so salty.

933
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,280
The scissors cuts the rock

934
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,820
Because it's so

935
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,820
Figured it out. I mean

936
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:33,440
That I mean the truth that rock should just be both of them. Yeah, dude. Yeah fucking I can't I would lose to a rock. Yeah

937
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,400
If it was rocks paper scissors Caleb, I would lose honestly only one

938
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,400
I'm being real. I lose it two out of the three. There's no way that I could beat scissors the nor rock

939
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,020
I know lasers how oh swat him out of the way

940
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:55,960
Easy, that's not an animal of them. Okay, if scissors are those

941
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,400
Me if scissors were the same size as you yes, you would lose with scissors. This is an easy scenario

942
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,220
Yeah, I imagine if they were even smaller and the scissors are I mean scissors are already bigger than Caleb. Yeah, they're not

943
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,400
No, I'm not being the same size as scissors. That would be crazy

944
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:19,840
We may be so big so scary scissors and you get really scared about scissors were the same size as me

945
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:24,120
It would have to like they'd have to walk like peg-legged

946
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:29,520
They fly I could I could fucking put my foot out. Just you put your

947
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,680
All right. Here's a hypothetical for you. Uh-huh

948
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,820
Bruce Lee's mind in a giant pair of scissors his body, but it's still

949
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,120
Peg-legging you don't think Bruce Lee could figure out peg leg. Okay half right side

950
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,260
artistic side Bruce Lee's mind left side motor side

951
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:55,440
Black beard this guy's a peg leg expert. I could still do this. Yeah, couldn't do it

952
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,960
I would not win you would come up with your say you're the winner you kidding me part that it's peg-legging on is the dangerous

953
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,760
You guys don't even know that I have a gun in this scenario.

954
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,160
You don't have a gun.

955
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
That doesn't make any sense.

956
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,560
The paper doesn't have a gun and rock, paper, scissors.

957
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
You just have a gun.

958
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,360
No, you don't.

959
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,860
You can't fucking, you can't, that is, oh, okay.

960
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,160
You wouldn't, first of all, you wouldn't even have clothes in this.

961
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,960
Yeah, I have no clothes, but I have a gun.

962
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,560
No, you're literally, only you.

963
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,960
You don't even have hair.

964
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,460
Oh, what's this?

965
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,560
I have a machine gun arm already.

966
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,160
No, you don't.

967
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,560
Yes, I do.

968
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,160
Look at it.

969
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
That's not a machine gun.

970
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,960
[MACHINE GUN NOISE]

971
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
You're just making noises.

972
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,560
[MACHINE GUN NOISE]

973
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,760
just pretending you're playing okay you have a phone are you acting like a

974
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,440
child I just unloaded five thousand rounds per second into Cameron's wall

975
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,120
and I'm not gonna pay to repair it there's nothing there you don't but you

976
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,720
have to do anything you do have to pay to repair it yeah and you have to split

977
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,680
the money evenly between me and him because I actually rented this wall I

978
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:53,920
just started and putting up is the most horrible post honestly honestly that's a

979
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,360
pretty good idea. This wall, how much a month to rent it? That's not my wall. That wall,

980
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:03,760
your wall. This wall, you can have that wall for free. Yeah, look at it. Look at that thing.

981
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,640
I don't want no. Look how horrible this wall is. Yeah, that wall sucks. I don't want a

982
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,240
free wall because then that means you'll say no to things. I want to have some skin in

983
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,520
the game. Fine, you can pay me $1000 a month. That's, no, I need an honest answer. You're

984
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,720
not taking me seriously. I said free and you said no. I'm like a serious investor. No,

985
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,320
because I don't want to have. I'm being serious too. I want to have leverage. I will never

986
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,960
do anything with this wall. This is your wall. But I want to be able to do anything I want

987
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,960
to it. Yeah, he just offered it for free. He's lying. Once this shit, you better, you're

988
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:34,040
going to regret the day unless I get this. Okay, then $1,000. You're talking too much.

989
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:37,520
Okay, then you can't rent it. How about this one right here? No, this is the only wall

990
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,400
you can rent. This is my wall in this apartment. Okay. Even for, okay, what if $1,000 for this

991
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:53,840

992
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:59,760
fucking it. Is this the only rule? Then no. And no food? You can have this wall for a

993
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,720
thousand dollars. Okay. If you want me to be serious, I'm being serious. That's pretty

994
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,840
good. I play hardball, dude. You see that right there? It's got a dip. It does have

995
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:26,840

walls in your room? Yes. How much to rent one? The one with no windows. One with no windows?

997
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:42,880
On the left side that has my oblivion poster? Either one. Honestly, you pay me $100 a month.

998
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:50,880
Really? You can put anything on my wall? You're a whore. Fuck slut. Look at you, slutish whore.

1005
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:29,040
wall. Look, if I don't know what's happening, dick can go up. What is that?

1006
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,040
It's a fucking wall in your room. Look, I have to get into fights with my

1007
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:43,920
mom that I live with as a wall lord. Okay, wall lord. There's gonna be a lot of

1008
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,040
problems with your wall, okay? Yeah. And you're gonna tell me

1009
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,480
about him, I'm not going to fix them, and then I'm going to scream at my mom about dinner.

1010
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,600
You tell me you're going to start fucking punching holes in the wall when your mom takes

1011
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,400
away your cigarettes?

1012
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:58,400
You don't know.

1013
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,000
It's not my wall.

1014
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,680
There's other walls that I have to take care of.

1015
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,480
You're subletting the wall to me?

1016
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,160
No, I'm the wall lord.

1017
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,760
First month, last month, and security.

1018
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,080
What if I put, honestly, what if I go to a screen--

1019
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,400
And I argue with my mom all the time.

1020
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,720
You hear it and it's like inappropriate time of night.

1021
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,840
I go to a really...

1022
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,000
It's like 10.30, like you have work tomorrow.

1023
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,720
Well, I'm not living on the wall.

1024
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
No, I know.

1025
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,840
I'm just saying that this is what goes on in my wall.

1026
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:36,480
You can rent this wall for $50 a month.

1027
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,480
Okay.

1028
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:38,480
But...

1029
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,480
Unless...

1030
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:40,480
Cameron has to argue with my mom.

1031
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,480
Unless...

1032
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,480
Well, that's a given.

1033
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,480
My Polish mom.

1034
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,800
Unless you rent a path to the wall through my apartment on the floor for $50 per foot,

1035
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,660
you can't come to the wall.

1036
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:53,660
You don't have free...

1037
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:57,600
You can come in once a month for 10 minutes unless you rent a path along the floor.

1038
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,600
Oh, that's fine.

1039
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
That's fine.

1040
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,600
I don't want to see the wall.

1041
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,160
I'm going to go to a print shop, get a giant, like perfect vinyl, like exact dimensions that

1042
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,720
covers this, basically a wallpaper of just like a big piece of dookie, like zoomed in

1043
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,520
with corn in it and even red peppers, you know?

1044
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,520
Yeah.

1045
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,440
And just blow it up as much as possible, highest possible picture quality.

1046
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,760
Getty Images, I'll put that-

1047
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,080
After that first day, I don't think that would bother me anymore.

1048
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,080
I have to be completely honest.

1049
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,080
It's mostly for these people.

1050
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:29,080
Yeah, that's true.

1051
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,080
To walk by and think that you-

1052
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,080
Yeah, my girlfriend's work meetings too.

1053
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:32,080
That would be pretty good.

1054
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:33,080
Right opposite.

1055
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,080
Yeah.

1056
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,480
They're like, "What's up with the wall behind you?"

1057
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
We're renting it out.

1058
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480
Yeah, sorry.

1059
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Yeah, it's not ours.

1060
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:41,480
Yeah.

1061
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,560
Yeah, it's just our crazy tenant. It's a photo of him.

1062
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:47,960
I can't evict him because he keeps calling a lawyer.

1063
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,280
Yeah.

1064
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,760
Yeah.

1065
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:53,320
And I would call a lawyer. I would get a serious... you'd be breaking my contract if you...

1066
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,040
Dude, I want to be a wall lord so bad now.

1067
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,920
It's a good idea. It's funny that I never think about how funny the term lord is until you

1068
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,320
remove it from landlord and put it into something else. I mean, that's like objectively pretty cool

1069
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,080
to be a lord.

1070
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:07,960
To be a landlord?

1071
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:08,840
I'd be a landlord in two seconds.

1072
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,960
It's the coolest job.

1073
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,920
It literally is, dude.

1074
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:11,320
It is.

1075
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,340
How is it not the cool you do you get to argue with your Polish mom?

1076
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,340
You get to like smoke cigarettes inside cuz who's gonna tell you it's your bill

1077
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:19,980
Yeah, you can do whatever you want

1078
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:27,240
You can like if someone's like dishwasher breaks and it's leaking water from their apartment into the apartment below

1079
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:31,580
You don't got to fix that shit. You can just call someone else this is two months

1080
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:36,460
You are being so scathing right now, and I'd like to let you know this past three years

1081
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:43,180
I've actually been an undercover agent for Bill Maher and we want to have you on the show really. Yeah, it's true

1082
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,100
No way. No, I want to have you on the show. No, I want you to do this

1083
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:49,800
No, I'm that that tip it over the line. Mm-hmm

1084
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,080
I want to do a lot like I can't I can't join I can't join Bill Maher now

1085
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,120
I want you to come to know I can't join the show

1086
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,300
You know why why because I'm also I'm a my DSA chapter will not allow me to

1087
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,500
I've actually been renting one of the walls on the Bill Maher set really

1088
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:09,380
Yeah, they tricked me. It's not it's never on camera senator. I'm a landlord

1089
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,020
That's pretty good

1090
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:17,380
That was a crazy shit dude. It's crazy. He just said that

1091
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:24,820
It wouldn't even like no Martin. You do whatever the fuck. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, he earned a lifetime pass. Yeah, come on

1092
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:32,500
Yeah, he just slithers around like you remember that like say Bill Maher others man. What that's fucking anti-semitic

1093
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,220
that's so anti-semitic. He literally is. He's not Jewish. Look it up right now. No, Bill Maher is

1094
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:44,820
Christian. No, his ethnic background is Jewish. Bill Maher is not Jewish. You want to put $100 on it?

1095
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:51,700
Hold on. Put $100 on it. Hold on, it says Bill Mafe.

1096
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,500
No, that's Jawish. Bill Maher, Jawa.

1097
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,380
Is Bill Maif Jawish?

1098
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,380
Is Bill Maif Jawish?

1099
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,380
Is Bill Maif Jawish?

1100
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:11,380
We did some research on this question.

1101
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:14,380
Alright, I guess, yeah.

1102
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,380
He's Jewish.

1103
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:17,380
No, he's half Jewish.

1104
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,380
Oh, are you really doing this to me?

1105
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:24,380
He was raised, until his early teens, he was unaware that his mother, whose family is from Hungary, was Jewish.

1106
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,380
He's still Jewish.

1107
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,380
So he didn't know he was Jewish.

1108
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,380
If your mother's Jewish, you're Jewish.

1109
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:34,380
you

1110
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,580
my view you know yeah fucker well he wasn't Jewish trust me I know exactly

1111
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:47,340
wasn't he wasn't Jewish until he unlocked it later oh he reached a level

1112
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,780
Uh-huh. He leveled up in his teens and then unlocked Judaism.

1113
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:51,780
That'd be cool.

1114
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,780
And then he fucking hit first prestige and got rid of all that shit.

1115
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:03,780
He did, yeah. Prestige once, level 50, hitting Judaism, level 50, going back to 1, Christianity.

1116
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:06,780
No, no, atheism. He don't even have a religion.

1117
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:08,280
True. So true.

1118
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,780
Yeah, dude, and he's staying at level 1 because he's better at it.

1119
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:13,780
But he's got the banner still.

1120
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,280
Yeah.

1121
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:15,780
You know, Danisky used to be so high level.

1122
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:29,780
I

1123
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,040
- Can it be like a live stream though,

1124
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,900
like with a desk?

1125
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,240
Can we please have a desk?

1126
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,080
- Yeah.

1127
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:38,420
- Yo, if we get office space,

1128
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:41,120
we're gonna do a political talk show live stream out.

1129
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:41,960
- Of course, dude.

1130
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,160
- Oh, I can't wait to rent out the walls in that office.

1131
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,000
- Oh my God.

1132
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,220
- Oh, that's actually a good idea.

1133
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,660
- We should rent them out to the fans.

1134
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:49,980
- That's a great idea, like 10 bucks a month.

1135
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,980
- 10 bucks a month, you could put,

1136
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,380
if we get an office. - You could put any poster

1137
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,860
in our office.

1138
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,740
That's actually such a good idea.

1139
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:59,300
- Maybe that's the $20,000 Patreon goal.

1140
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:03,300
get in an office. We take more money. We get in an office and then you can put...

1141
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:07,300
$20,000, I'm putting my foot down. $20,000 Patreon goal is we're making a feature

1142
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,300
film. Non-negotiable. We're making a feature film. Feature length

1143
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,300
film. If we make $20,000. What's major motion picture? 115 or 130? I feel like it's

1144
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,300
130. It's gotta be 130. Well, 115, I feel like it would be

1145
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,300
technically feature length but it would be a cop out. By feature length film we mean

1146
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:27,300
fan film and by fan film... No, we mean film and by feature length we mean at least three

1147
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,180
hours long and also probably I mean I know it's like a fantasy epic yeah yeah

1148
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:40,220
yeah like basically like 300 400 million budget yeah yeah big stars yeah but you

1149
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:45,300
have to pay for it no we pay no no we play why are you trying to they need to

1150
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:49,500
be excited for this patreon goal yeah what you want to fucking go to 20,000

1151
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:52,300
and be like oh yeah can we have another fucking 200 no we're gonna make a

1152
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:57,260
feature-length film that's gonna open in 3,000 movie theaters across the country

1153
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:01,500
And in China. Yes, even more in China. It's gonna be six

1154
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,620
And it's called adventures of China

1155
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:11,080
Honestly since China like always wants like cool like American movies that are think China is awesome

1156
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:16,280
I'll make like just a whole movie. I would rule China's just release it there, right?

1157
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:20,380
Yeah, we could just do that right we get a nice window in it. We get in contact with

1158
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:25,060
Jackson we say hey we do we're like we're really

1159
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,060
the famous comedians, or actually screenwriters, and actors and directors.

1160
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,260
All three of us were outdoors.

1161
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:32,700
We're very famous multi-hyphenates.

1162
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:39,500
Yeah. And we would like to make a movie about how basketball was invented in China

1163
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:47,900
by the Chinese. We would like to come and make that movie. And we would like for that to be

1164
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,140
a lasting generational movie.

1165
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:51,580
Yeah, we're going to make a series too.

1166
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:51,980
A whole series.

1167
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:52,860
It's going to be a series.

Like seven or eight movies.

1169
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:58,320
And we want a Starbury hookup.

1170
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,320
Yep.

1171
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,620
Yeah, we want a Starbury hookup.

1172
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:01,620
Absolutely.

1173
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:02,620
Sponsored by Starbury.

1174
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,300
That's what it was called, right?

1175
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,300
Yeah.

1176
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,300

00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:11,060
They're sick, dude.

1180
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:12,060

00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,060
Didn't they make like a...

1182
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:18,060
Fuck, I think it's Starbury made like a shoe with speakers in it.

1183
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:20,380
I don't remember.

1184
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,380
That shit used to be cool, man.

1185
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,100
They used to put so much shit in sneakers.

1186
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,100
Yeah, I think they made like the bubble

1187
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:32,860
They should I they should do adult light up sneakers, yes, that's what it was they put spinners in a shoe

1188
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:37,900
Did you guys ever have Healy's? No, no, I wasn't allowed. I wanted them. But yeah, there's no way

1189
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,180
It's whatever gotten them for me or these I thought they were so cool

1190
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:47,300
Yeah, my little brother had Healy's growing up and I just fucking trip him all the time. Yeah, they're pretty dumb

1191
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,500
they're not they're definitely they're

1192
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:53,440
They're cool, and you're like I feel like it's a good thing to be like in fifth grade

1193
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,460
You see a sixth grader cruising down the hallway. You're like my god my mom

1194
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:08,660
My mom didn't let me get Heelys cuz she heard that a kid was on Heelys and was gay and rode into a plane

1195
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:10,160
propeller I

1196
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,900
Think she made that up. I think she made that up to scare me out of everyone

1197
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:18,400
go that fast on Heelys. That kid had a lot of, he was like, oh look.

1198
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,600
She said that he tripped and fell into a plane propeller.

1199
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,200
What the fuck?

1200
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:29,100
Indiana Jones style. There's a lot of shit that I think my mom just lied to me about so that I wouldn't want it.

1201
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,400
That's what happened to Indiana Jones.

1202
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,800
Yeah.

1203
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,700
That's how he died.

1204
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,300
Yeah.

1205
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:35,400
So they haven't made a movie in a while since Crystal Skull.

1206
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,600
I feel like they probably fall over a lot on Heelys, right?

1207
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:42,000
Because it's just like, it's well, it's like on your heel.

1208
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,000
So if you ever put your heel down, it just rolls out, right?

1209
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I mean, it's like a high heel in a way.

1210
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
You're walking around on your tippy toes.

1211
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Yeah.

1212
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I don't know, I've never worn

1213
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Heelys with the soaps though.

1214
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
There was a security guard at the mall

1215
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,000
in my hometown who rode around on Heelys.

1216
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Whoa.

1217
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
I saw there was a movie about a security guard

1218
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
who rode around on a Segway.

1219
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Yeah, I remember that one.

1220
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
He might have been doing a little

1221
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
budget imitation of them.

1222
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Yeah.

1223
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Yeah.

1224
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,600
I might become a mall security guard.

1225
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:19,760
For me that's more of an honor than like defending like Fort Knox.

1226
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:20,760
Yeah, absolutely.

1227
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,760
You know, defending a game stub.

1228
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,760
The greatest stuff in the world is in a mall.

1229
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,640
Defending an Orange Julius.

1230
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,640
China Walk.

1231
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:27,640
Yeah.

1232
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:28,640
Master Walk.

1233
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,120
I would want to be stationed just to one of those like touch screen directories to make

1234
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,280
sure people aren't like fidgeting with it or anything.

1235
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,840
Oh dude, I'd love to watch, I'd love to be the mall security camera guy.

1236
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,840
Yup.

1237
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:39,840
Oh my god.

1238
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,120
looking in a Claire's I bet you would know you would know he's literally

1239
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:48,400
blushing there's big hearts coming out of like an Animal Crossing character yeah

1240
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:54,440
this I always why do I put my foot in my mouth so much I don't know it's crazy

1241
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,080
it's impressive you know what it is is you guys are able to twist everything I

1242
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:05,280
say into some weird fucking shit yeah you twist your penis into a pretzel at

1243
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,480
at the mall that you want to be a security guard at.

1244
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,880
Okay, I was trying to give you a layup there.

1245
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:11,680
I was trying to help you out.

1246
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:12,080
Yes.

1247
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:12,960
Yeah.

1248
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,240
Owned.

1249
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,560
I guess I've been owned.

1250
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,360
Yeah, you have.

1251
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,400
I guess so. I guess I have.

1252
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,280
Don't freeze up on me now.

1253
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:25,360
I would be the security guard of the food court, but I would be like a lord.

1254
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,520
I'd be like a vassal.

1255
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,520
They'd have to give me tribute, like every restaurant in the food court,

1256
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,480
or I wouldn't defend them.

1257
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,280
Like they'd have to pay me up.

1258
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,160
Like if I didn't get Auntie Anne's, I'm not.

1259
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
I'd have one of those nightsticks.

1260
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,160
You'd be letting kids run out.

1261
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:40,160
It's not mom protection.

1262
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,160
Pretty much, yeah.

1263
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,160
You're walking around.

1264
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,600
Okay, but more medieval is how I would play.

1265
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:46,160
I'd walk around with those nightsticks that swing out.

1266
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:47,160
I'd fuck you.

1267
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,160
Yeah, sick.

1268
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,720
I'd probably batter at you.

1269
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:54,200
Any college kid acts up, any college kid gets drunk and acts up, I'm smacking them in the

1270
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,200
head.

1271
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,200
That's right.

1272
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:59,200
I'd get plastic surgery to look exactly like the heavy from Team Fortress 2.

1273
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,800
I'd walk around yeah just smacking the just smacking the cashier yeah around so

1274
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,600
I can get synth all injections to look exactly like the heavy yeah I literally

1275
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:12,880
just want the samples just doing the voice yeah yeah so I get it put this

1276
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,880
dispenser here just like

1277
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,600
Planning the mall do you have to have you planning?

1278
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:36,160
Like the heavy and then the engineer that he's just got like the like the toolbox

1279
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,560
and he just keeps building, building, dipping the hot machines in the mall.

1280
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,560
And then a sniper.

1281
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,560
Yeah.

1282
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,560
Yeah, but you know what the sniper's doing with that jarate?

1283
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
Oh, hell no.

1284
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
Oh, is that what he calls his boomerang?

1285
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,560
No, that's his pee bottle.

1286
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:54,560
Yeah.

1287
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:58,560
Somebody didn't taste test the items in TF2.

1288
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:00,560
I didn't, I'm sorry.

1289
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,560
Oh, I remember the sandwich, alright.

1290
00:56:02,560 --> 00:56:04,560

1365
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:20,580
wet but then it wasn't anything yeah yeah that's every seitan part I've ever had I

1366
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:24,900
I didn't know that my body could produce such heat.

1367
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,540
That should be killing me.

1368
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:30,180
It should be burning a hole through every...

1369
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:32,780
It felt like I had an ulcer.

1370
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:34,860
I should have checked my pants for blood.

1371
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,860
Yeah, definitely.

Yeah.

1375
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:49,100
It's also one of those ones where the fart doesn't shoot out like a...

1376
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:53,060
it like wraps around your ass like an asteroid just hit Earth.

1377
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,060
You can feel it.

1378
00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:55,060
And the shockwaves.

1379
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,100
A part you can feel come all the way out of your shorts.

1380
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,100
Yeah.

1381
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:00,220
You feel it just ripple down your skin.

1382
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,220
Yeah.

1383
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:06,700
Like, have you ever seen, have you ever played like the first Battlefront 2015 and it's like

1384
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,620

1385
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,620
No.

1386
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,620
Like the volcanic gas bubbles?

1387
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:13,100
No, damn well, neither of us.

1388
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,940
God damn it, somebody's listening, dude.

1389
01:00:15,940 --> 01:00:20,020
Did you go to my middle school and meet Mrs. Tumen?

1390
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:25,740
Mrs. Tumen? Yeah. She was two men at the same time.

1391
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:30,300

1392
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,740
She died having sex with two men at the same time. Come on.

1393
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:36,780
The Phantom Menace announcers that were played by the Sklar brothers.

1394
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:38,860
That's Mrs. Tumen.

1395
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:45,420
No, she was a very sweet lady. I think she's alive.

1396
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,860
- Yeah, and she died.

1397
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,260
- She didn't die. - She died peacefully

1398
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:49,080
in her sleep.

1399
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:51,380
- She died when she met me. - No.

1400
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,220
No, not true.

1401
01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:54,860
- She died when she saw me.

01:00:57,660 --> 01:00:59,460
All right, here's a better example.

1405
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:01,500
A fart like that looks like the bubble

1406
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:03,460
in a witch's cauldron.

1407
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,820
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

1408
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,420
- It's like if you put dry ice at the bottom of liquid,

1409
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:10,100
and you can see the smoke come out.

1410
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,020
- The smoke come out of the bubble.

1411
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:13,220
Yeah, that's what it feels like.

1412
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:14,420
It feels like you're protruding,

1413
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:19,620
you're smoking smoke when you when you when you when you when you like buy one

1414
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,620
of those like instead of using soapy water you buy like a bubble mixture like

1415
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:28,220
what and and you pop it and you can feel like slime on your hand that type of

1416
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:33,300
bubble yeah yeah feels like it feels like a boba tea bubble just shot out of

1417
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:40,260
your ass I don't think that's pure yeah it's like a bird flew out of a cannon

1418
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:45,720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's kind of like if a bouncy ball went over a jump rope. Yeah

1419
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:50,220
It's like a bunch of candy coming out of a pinata pretty much. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a chili dog in reverse

1420
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:57,320
Yeah, it's like when you see a cat lapping up milk. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh, it does sound like that though. Yeah

1421
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,940
Yeah, almost exactly. Yeah, you know like the the farts that come out like

1422
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:09,660
And they smell like horrible, yeah, I had a fart the other day that Jana I farted in the

1423
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:16,660
I'm going to end on this. I farted in the car and we were on a road trip and Janice smelled

1424
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:30,940
it and said, she was like, "Oh, did we just pass a Chick-fil-A?" I was like, "No, that's

1425
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:31,940
my ass."

1426
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:32,940
All right.

1427
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:33,940
