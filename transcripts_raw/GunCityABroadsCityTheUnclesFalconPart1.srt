1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,200
Interior, detective's office at the Top Ten's Tattletail Agency in Gun City.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,840
The year is 2245.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,680
Or 2245.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,080
A grizzled old detective hits his jewel and kicks his size 4 men's vans up on his desk.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,740
He's wearing a cheap felt fedora over a thrasher hoodie and dickies.

6
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,460
His haggard face has seen better days, but better days are just around the corner.

7
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,780
Exhaling his favorite techno-slime vape flavor, come, the detective chews pensively on the

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,820
string of his hoodie.

9
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,060
His monologue slips into the scene, a silky saxophone precedes it.

10
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,460
An air of mystery and intrigue blossoms.

11
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,180
He speaks.

12
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,820
She's just a V-Girl.

13
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,460
That's what I said to myself the moment I first laid eyes on that anemic mouse of a woman.

14
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,460
She's just a V-Girl.

15
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,140
And V-Girls aren't even real, like all V-folks, and that's with an X of course.

16
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,220
If you could remove your calculus rift, the virtual reality chip shoved into everyone's

17
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,380
penis when they turned 13 in Gun City, you'd see the truth that she's nothing but a bunch

18
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,820
of ones and zeros, the two lowest numbers.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,860
If you tried to kiss her or give her an old-fashioned spanking, you'd get nothing.

20
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,780
Worst of all, like all V-Girls, she doesn't have nothing, neither.

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,420
No chest, no ass.

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,980
She sounds like a baby and she dresses like a hot topic meth head.

23
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,580
Me thinks, no thanks.

24
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,400
But god damn it, I couldn't help myself.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,940
Those games, like two pale twigs sticking out of a schoolgirl's outfit.

26
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:38,980
And those cat ears.

27
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,980
Adorable.

28
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,140
I wanted to make that kitty purr.

29
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:46,740
Whoa, I'm getting a bit ahead of myself, aren't I?

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,740
Let me back up for a second.

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:53,460
My name is Detective Lenny Krapschitz and I'm about 10 minutes away from retirement.

32
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,760
See I was planning on running out the clock on my last day by drinking absinthe and playing

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:02,020
helly attack on miniclips.com when all 85 and a half pounds of that v-girl walked in.

34
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,020
Hasekitsune.

35
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,300
Soon as she got situated she started crying about her husbando who went missing last week.

36
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:16,740
Apparently he might be mixed up with some totemawariito or very bad men that may have wanted him dead.

37
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:20,020
She tried to talk around it but I pressed a hard real hard.

38
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,140
And eventually she admitted that her husbando is an unfaithful lout.

39
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,660
Jacking into Da Matrix 2 sponsored by Teen Vogue to get V-Paid by other V-Girls who look

40
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:31,260
like V-Children and say they're 18 before stomping on your V-Junk.

41
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,000
Not that I would know anything about that.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,620
She thinks he might have owed some tokens to the Totemo Waruito for these excursions into

43
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,340
Da Matrix 2 and didn't pay up.

44
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,780
And everybody knows that in Gun City it's all about the tokens.

45
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:49,140
make the planet E-Bomb go round and round and round like an awesome famous video of a dick

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,740
spinning around.

47
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,820
So even though some of her story didn't add up, the tokens sure did.

48
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,180
So even though I wanted to tell her to fuck off mom I'm trying the game I took the damn

49
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,180
job.

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,040
But by the time she was ready to leave I was more or less off the force.

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
So it goes.

52
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,940
It's Kurt Vonnegut.

53
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,100
Now I can't promise this will be an easy case boys.

54
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,540
Something tells me there's a lot more going on than I know especially since this involves

55
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,540
and the greatest liars of all time.

56
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,820
So as my last act as private investigator for the Top 10's Tattletail Agency, I pass this

57
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
on to you three hotshots.

58
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,060
Report in, detectives.

59
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,940
He walked into my office in a pair of the biggest platform Adidas Kobe 2's I've ever seen.

60
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:34,860
It's like he was 3 foot 7 and the shoes were doing all the work for him.

61
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,060
He looked 5'7" until I saw the shoes.

62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:41,060
How he learned how to walk in those, I can never figure out.

63
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,140
I mean seriously, how do you get platforms on a pair of Adidas Kobe 2s?

64
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:50,860
They already look like the cloud cars from Bespin, which exist in this universe by the

65
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:51,860
way.

66
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,820
But I digress.

67
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,820
He said his name was Larry Crapshits, being a case he just straight up didn't want to

68
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,980
work on anymore.

69
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,860
Because he had just retired.

70
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,980
Shit.

71
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,300
More paperwork for us.

72
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,700
When I read through the dossier he handed us, I immediately spilled hot coffee all over

73
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:17,180
my cock and balls. It was unrelated to the shock I had felt reading the case. I burned

74
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:23,740
my cock and balls so bad I had to go to the bathroom and splash some cold water on them.

75
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:29,180
I later realized this was a mistake, as I was still holding the dossier in my hand and I

76
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:36,500
got water all over it, making the page completely unreadable. I had to look over Ray William

77
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Johnson's shoulder and read his. I've seen over a million cases in my time at the agency,

78
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,660
but none that were like this. My name is Patrick Yoda. I've been a detective for the Top 10's

79
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:56,340
Tattletail Agency for two weeks. I may not be much of a hero, but heroes don't solve

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,340
mysteries. Not in Gun City.

81
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,540
That was awesome. Yeah, you got me.

82
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:05,820
I liked it you just there's you just invented a new scenario

83
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,940
For some reason we're in your office

84
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,460
He's wearing different shoes

85
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:20,620
We all have the same office yeah as Larry, okay, I just you know

86
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:25,500
The names piss

87
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:30,260
Blowtoss to my friends, but those seem to be few and far between these days

88
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,020
You can't trust anyone in gun City

89
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,460
Especially not in my line of work

90
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,300
the city bristles with a thousand laser knives eager to plant themselves in the backs of anyone with the nerve to ask questions and

91
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,380
I happen to be in the business of asking questions

92
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,780
difficult questions

93
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,820
questions nobody else seems to ask

94
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,700
questions about grinches

95
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,260
That's right. I'm a Grinch detective.

96
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,500
I've solved every Christmas crime this city's ever seen.

97
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:03,760
The case of the missing present, the case of the lost gift, the case of the stolen stocking.

98
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,860
Of course, when I say solve, I mean it in the loosest, most violent sense of the word.

99
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm not so much one for thinking.

100
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,120
I got my own special way of closing cases, and it involves my colt Santa Claus special snub-nosed revolver,

101
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Two lengths of very disagreeable lead pipe and a dash of vigilante justice

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,060
I may not be much of a hero, but heroes don't solve mysteries not in gun city

103
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,880
Yours was scary

104
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,760
Scared

105
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,920
You're the scary one

106
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,220
You're a sit. Yeah, I've got I've got I'm chewing on a jewel like it's a cigar

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Whoa.

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,880
Dan, I got sharp teeth.

109
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,400
I have like in comic books when they draw someone with sharp teeth.

110
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Yeah, and it busts open in your mouth, the pod.

111
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
And I drink it.

112
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,160
And then for ten minutes you're just like, "Ew."

113
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
And spitting.

114
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
That's disgusting.

115
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
Okay.

116
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,880
No, you're chewing on it from the electric end because you like to lick that part.

117
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,800
Yeah, you're chewing on a poop like a cigar.

118
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
A hard poop.

119
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,520
Now, just go ahead and read your thing.

120
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,520
I'm sorry.

121
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:17,320
I'm going to be completely honest here.

122
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,900
For most of Larry's meal, I was pretty clocked out.

123
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:26,000
It's been about 4 hours since I last ate, and I actually have a friend who is going through

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,380
some stuff, so I kind of have been dealing with that.

125
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,560
I was also just imagining that movie Jumper with Aiden Christensen and thinking about

126
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,360
how fucked up it would be if he got stuck in a wall.

127
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,320
Would he clip through it like in Gmod, or would he get cut in half?

128
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,300
I don't know, there's just a lot on my hard drive right now.

129
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,800
I've been trying to paint recently, and it's not going super well.

130
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,600
Maybe I just don't have an eye for it.

131
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,880
I also kind of feel like I'm coming down with a cold.

132
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,300
My name is Ray William Johnson, and I am a computer that has been duct taped to the back

133
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,560
of a demon.

134
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,040
I may not be much of a hero, but heroes don't solve mysteries.

135
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,040
Not in Gun City.

136
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,040
Thanks boys, I just needed your names but I'm glad you...

137
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:27,040
I mean that's good you know, I see a lot of color character too.

138
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Alright.

139
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,040
So uh...

140
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:43,680
So yeah I know at least one of your dossiers are covered in piss so let's just open one

141
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,800
of yours and I'll tell you what's going on with this case.

142
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,400
What you're dealing with here is a classic, what I think is a classic missing persons

143
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,400
case or perhaps just a husband gone wrong situation.

144
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:02,180
So if you're going to want to solve this I'm just going to need you guys to go first probably

145
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,100
just talk to Hussie see what she knows see if she can point you in any directions

146
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,060
you know she only gave me so many details but after that it's up to you look I'm

147
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,460
out all right I'm retired I don't I know I'm trying not to deal with this I'm

148
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:19,580
trying to go to space Cancun I thought you had 10 minutes left you know I have

149
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,500
about you know those intros were long so you know I got about like three and a

150
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,260
half minutes left to oh my god yeah so no but I know here's the thing here's the

151
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,580
thing look if you start with her I'm sure she's got some stuff going on look

152
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:38,580
She is a pretty big streamer, she is a big e-girl, v-girl I mean obviously.

153
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,580
And so you know she is pretty popular so she might have a lot of enemies herself.

154
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:52,140
Her husband Sean McKelvey, he's got a lot of enemies too.

155
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,740
Like who?

156
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:01,580
A lot of real jerks who like to call out people who pretend to have integrity.

157
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,100
Just real, real jerk-wads.

158
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,460
Stuff like that, you know, or maybe cuckservatives.

159
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,240
Some normal world types.

160
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
That was fire.

161
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Oh, damn.

162
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Oh, okay.

163
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
That's right.

164
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,240
Thank you.

165
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,420
I see what you did there with the words.

166
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,420
He chews harder on the string of his hoodie.

167
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,420
In excitement at your approval.

168
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Patrick, are you Australian now?

169
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,420
No, I'm doing a mid-Atlantic action.

170
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,420
Alright, I'm Australian to take.

171
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,420
That's on a screen.

172
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,420
I think we were just doing Cockney.

173
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420
Oh boy.

174
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:40,420
So, oh.

175
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,420
Alright, that's good, there's a cat.

176
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,420
So, look.

177
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,420
If you guys want to ask me any other questions, though, I'm here.

178
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Let me see if I can answer anything.

179
00:10:49,420 --> 00:11:04,540
thing. Go ahead. What's up? I'm retiring, you know. In a minute and 30 seconds you are retiring.

180
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:10,460
What will be your first move as a new retiree? Honestly, it's something I've been thinking

181
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:15,660
about because the pension is pretty nice but, you know, oh you mean like the first thing

182
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,180
I'm gonna do it like like do you do you walk out of the room or what? Oh, yeah

183
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,500
No, I get 30 seconds. Yeah, I can't stay at here

184
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,660
You sure you don't want any of the more valuable information because do any time off the clock

185
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,100
You know

186
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:35,260
Do you have any orders for the vending machine do any I do have some quarters? Here you go

187
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:42,060
I'm a couple quarters short. You see and I also have some quarters. Yeah, hold on. He gives you guys some quarters

188
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:47,600
Each 10 quarters add them to your inventory 10 quarters each

189
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,940
Score oh wait hold on one more thing before I retire

190
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,500
seconds

191
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:01,260
My all the duties that you guys need from normally for me are gonna be handed over to him my assistant who is now gonna be

192
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,060
promoted to head detective and he and

193
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:10,720
And his assistant walks in and it's none other than a dapper little frog with a bowler hat and vest

194
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,520
Oh my god, dude. With the Winnie the Pooh style cartoon no pants situation.

195
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Mm-hmm.

196
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,520
Oh. I don't think I've seen this frog before.

197
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:25,920
Uh, how you doing? My name's Sullivan and I guess I'm the new head detective here.

198
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
But I guess I'm-

199
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,720
When do-

200
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,720
Sullivan, when do you retire?

201
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,720
[Laughter]

202
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,520
Well, I've had a lot of college debt, so I don't think I could ever really retire anytime soon.

203
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:47,520
I spent 10 million dollars on the Vrije University.

204
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:51,280
Is that the one on the computer?

205
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,800
I'm a full-sale graduate myself.

206
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I've got a-

207
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,440
We have separation issues because we lost our old captain.

208
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
No, I understand.

209
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,840
That's very frightening and stressful.

210
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,720
I've gone through that myself with my captain just leaving also, the same one you guys have.

211
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,720
How do I know if I'm gonna trust you?

212
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,220
Uh...

213
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,220
Uh...

214
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,720
You could roll an insight check to see if you...

215
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,220
...consensate a nefarious intent or...

216
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,220
...or something.

217
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:20,720
No, I just have trust issues 'cause I missed my old captain.

218
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Oh, okay. I understand then.

219
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
But look, I can drive you guys.

220
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
Was she our captain?

221
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,220
I guess so, like a police captain.

222
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:29,720
I guess.

223
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Sort of like the head detective.

224
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,720
Okay.

225
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,720
Okay, so we need to ask him some questions.

226
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:43,780
No, you don't have to have to you know, well, but so Sullivan Sullivan, where's this V girl stomping ground?

227
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,540
So to speak

228
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:51,380
Well, she lives at the spaz or the sucker fucker auto erotica zone

229
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:56,660
Which has been annexed by gun city for over ten years now

230
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:03,500
So it's seen a slow but steady increase in crime since the introduction of a Dunkin Donuts that gives free donuts to officers who have

231
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
approvable negative IQ score

232
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,260

233
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,820

234
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,460

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,420
i thought i was doing a mid-atlantic no i think you're doing better than caleb suggesting

250
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:13,860
but no i think yeah i think i just never realized how close those two accents were

251
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,300
yeah because it's mid-atlantic it's in the middle of the atlantic ocean just like australia

252
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:29,620
exactly damn dude that's such a good point yeah all right um i say we get down there and we we

253
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:37,860

254
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:46,740
guys outside the Tattletail agency and leads you to the 2007 Ryan Dunn, 2007

00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,720
Porsche 911 GT3 Ryan Dunn edition. Let me put the detective voice back on. It's the

256
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:57,700
Havokah of dreams. It cruises smoothly and easily and has working brakes and a

257
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,580
breathalyzer installed that won't let you drive if your BAC is anywhere near where

258
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,100
Ryan's was at the time of his tragic death. As he swerved on the roads of

259
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,580
Eastern Pennsylvania, endangering countless innocents and killing a

260
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,420
thirty-year-old production assistant who was riding with him in the passenger

261
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:20,820
seat. People seem to forget that he just killed another person, you know. Very cool,

262
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,260
no, it's awesome, he's a hero. He's my hero. Yeah, and so uh yeah, Sullivan leads you

263

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,400
i'm green but you know

298
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,340
i guess i get mistaken for white sometimes

299
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,140
can i quote you on that

300
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,100
yes i've heard green is white for frogs

301
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,560
well yes it is that's a good point

302
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,680
great frogs always complain green people used to be slaves to but you're white

303
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,920
now

304
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,720
yet the interesting you try to walk around tracy green lives matter also

305
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,880
never once i go

306
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,760
what do you say you're a system like a man to say that i've met a two-year

307
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,040
song exactly

308
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,800
that's right

309
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,640
and that's what i believe

310
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,760
this character

311
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,280
anyway so uh... you guys drive in the car you have

312
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,680
like three thousand stimulating

313
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,960
uh... screens going off

314
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,120
you know

315
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:13,000
you drive through the lockheed martin plaza

316
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,880
uh... with the voice back on

317
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:20,080
passing by bars and techno slime cafes and department stores and

318
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,840
things that look for green all the sun

319
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,120
the last bit of grass in all of gun city besides

320
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,640
that kind of grass

321
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,160
starts to come into view

322
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,160
What kind of grass?

323
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,160
What the hell are you talking about?

324
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
It's weed. I'm trying to say weed.

325
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Wait, stop. I can't. I'm supposed to be...

326
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
Nice. Sorry.

327
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
Hold on.

328
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,160
You reach Mr. Hands Boulevard and make a right on it.

329
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,160
Suddenly there is a front lawn, expanse like you've never seen.

330
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:58,160
And there's not just a gate, but an entire fence in front of you made entirely of photon lasers.

331
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:05,800
On the center of the gate portion of this laser palisades are the initials SM.

332
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,760
In a white hot laser booth sits the absolutely still security thwomp, protected by a thin

333
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,520
layer of iron around him.

334
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,480
Your car cruises up to the window.

335
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,200
I think he's trying to say state your business.

336
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,360
Um, uh.

337
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,120
We're detectives.

338
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,600
And we're here to see a bitch.

339
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,220
That's right.

340
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,280
He seems to nod approvingly.

341
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,280
How does he nod?

342
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,240
He moves his entire body just back and forth.

343
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,400
So he wiggles?

344
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,880
But you can tell it's a good wiggle is what I'm trying to say.

345
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,920
He's not falling over onto us, flattening us into a pancake.

346
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:55,180
No, well actually you know what, I should roll, let me roll an athletics check to see

347
00:20:55,180 --> 00:21:15,060
see

348
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:28,020
the

349
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,620
You got it. You got it already. You actually got a crit on your first one. So you both got crits

350
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:38,900
I don't get back to the chat and where's the there's the button. Yeah. Yeah, you got yeah, you did it. Yeah, so Caleb

351
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:46,980
Ray William Johnson perp and and blow toss piss you guys have a you guys completely get out of the way just in time

352
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,300
Patrick Yoda you do okay - that was sort of the check that was about the the amount you needed to get through it

353
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,400
So now the flop is crushing the car and Sullivan is still inside. Hey, I'm trying to get him off, please

354
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,600
I

355
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:01,400
Look, no

356
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I look into the camera and I say I

357
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,720
Can't stand when people hurt frogs and then I run and I grab Sullivan and I try to pull him out of the car

358
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,920
Okay, and that case do a do a strength just do a strength check. So strength saving throw again

359
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,960
No, I guess just a straight straight strength check. Okay, so just hit you strength button on top of your thing. Yeah. Yeah, it's enough

360
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,200
That's perfect. So you pull him out of there and uh the thwomp is going to crush the car though if

361
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,800
you guys don't pull him off so I'm going to give you guys one chance to do so.

362
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,360
Um the thwomp meanwhile is just like

363
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:44,840
I perfect form I deadlift the thwomp back up to his resting position.

364
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,880
You have I think the lowest strength. I have I am I am so strong.

365
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,920
actually if you all of you guys roll a strength just strength check and we'll

366
00:22:55,920 --> 00:23:02,760
see we'll see yeah okay all right that's that's look at that 19 dude yeah that's

367
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,720
yeah you guys are all fuck you man look at that 19 dude yeah yeah that's good

368
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
the 19 is what does it so you guys all sort of get together and lift as hard as

369
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,440
you can you lift the thwomp up you see a giant anime sweat drop and he's like

370
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:23,400
embarrassed yeah and he waddles back to his booth and just presses a button with

371
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,400
his like stubby and 64 a circle hand and you watch as the photon laser palisade

372
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,400
sort of slowly disassembles you see the long like football field length road up

373
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,520
to what looks like princess princess princess pieces castle is what I almost

374
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,120
said so I'm just gonna keep that yeah all right guys let's get back in let's get

375
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,120
God, that was close.

376
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:53,120
"You should learn how to nod!" he chastises the Thwomp.

377
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,120
The Thwomp sort of looks downcast.

378
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:05,120
So, anyway, let's all pile in.

379
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,120
So you guys all pile in, and when the laser gates go up, you see countless other traps beyond it disable.

380
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,920
EMP charges and turrets retreat into the ground.

381
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,040
Electric netting dissipates.

382
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,400
The road to the mansion itself is about a football field in length.

383
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,160
You see wealthy folk parading around the gardens and fields on either side, treating the estate

384
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,000
as if it were a public park of some sort.

385
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Once you all reach the mansion itself, the Princess Peach Castle, you're greeted by a

386
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,240
massive fountain, spraying what looks like gamma fuel, and it refracts against the artificial

387
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,120
argon-charged lighting radiating from below the base of the fountain.

388
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,000
It's quite the sight to behold.

389
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,600
Sullivan is directed by one of the staff to a parking spot near the fountain, and you're

390
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:59,280
escorted out by the same staff and led to a massive gothic front door of the mansion.

391
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,560
The front door is covered in logos for off-brand sodas and other crude cultural detritus that

392
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,280
suggest a civilization in decline.

393
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:11,220
This is that old gun city money you've heard so much about.

394
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,960
So you're at the front door, what do you guys want to do?

395
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,960
Ding dong ditch.

396
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
Mm-hmm.

397
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
I agree.

398
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Let's do it.

399
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:18,960
Yeah, so there is a doorbell.

400
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,960
See if we ding dong ditch.

401
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:20,960
Sorry.

402
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
No, keep going.

403
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,960
I'd rather you guys do that.

404
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
I just wanted to explain our tactic.

405
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,960
Explain what a ding dong ditch is.

406
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
Well, no, if we ding dong ditch, then we can get in there.

407
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,960
Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and do that.

408
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

409
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,960
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

410
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,960
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

411
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

412
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
I'm going to go ahead and do that.

413
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,460
ding dong ditch, then we can get in there.

414
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:39,420
We can sneak behind them.

415
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,860
Once they're out the door.

416
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,860
- It's also very funny.

417
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,600
- It's also too funny.

418
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,760
- I need a laugh right now.

419
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,480
- Do you guys want to ding dong ditch this bitch or what?

420
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,560
- Okay, I already did it.

421
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,400
- Okay, yeah.

422
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,480
- I'll do it right now.

423
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,320
- Okay, yeah, you hit the taco-shaped doorbell.

424
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,960
I sense an offensive accent coming on Patches of Smart.

425
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,080
No, no.

426
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,600
And uh, yeah, and the doors open.

427
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,320
And do you guys try to run away then before the doors open?

428
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Yeah.

429
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
I hide in the bush.

430
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,320
You guys actually try and-

431
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:22,800
I hide in the same bush really, really close.

432
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,200
Everyone makes a stealth check.

433
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,520
So go to your skills area, yeah, and just hit stealth.

434
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,520
22.

435
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
I'm so good.

436
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,520
damn.

437
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Alright, so yeah.

440
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,840
is a robot of some sort.

441
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,760
Um, and he opens the door.

442
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,360
He is a robot butler, he has a little robot bow tie.

443
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,920
And he goes, "Who is it?

444
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,800
Those damn teens again.

445
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,720
I hate this."

446
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,880
And he, uh, shuts the door.

447
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,880

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880

Yes, please, please.

463
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,880
Now, Ray, once the robot gets out here, I need you to throw your computer at his head.

464
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,880
You want me to hack him?

465
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,880
If that's what you call it.

466
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,880
Let's see.

467
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,880
I still have my hacking ability, right?

468
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Yeah, you should still have that.

469
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Alright, you know what? Fuck it. Yeah. Do it again.

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,880
Alright, cool.

473
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,080

474
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,800
time again so go for it doesn't really matter because as soon as he popped I'm

478
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,760
roll a I think I guess a constitution saving throw just to see if you're able

479
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,760
to like withstand the like earth-shattering feeling of emptiness

480
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,900
that just overcame you yeah you just found out God wasn't real yeah that's

481
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:47,580
not just it's not gonna be enough man

482
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,600
you are sitting in the bush for the remainder of the campaign yeah for the

483
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,960
remainder of the campaign Pat is in an existential malaise just completely

484
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,100
unreachable he's right now realized that he will never see his grandparents again

485
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,080
they're dead forever. You take two psychic damage.

486
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:13,600
What do I do? I take that out of anything? Yeah, your hit points.

487
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,680
Oh, my hit points? Okay. Yeah. And then I come up and I pat him on the back and I say,

488
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:25,760
"You should dry headspace." So what you're telling me is there's no techno Christ?

501
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:44,040
Yeah, so everyone kind of was like, oh there's enough there was enough irony in there, but it's okay like

502
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:47,680
Spirits a little bit. Yeah

503
00:30:47,680 --> 00:31:05,760
So the robot answers the door and he's like, and then like while he's answering the door

504
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,760
he's like in mid sentence like, I swear I'm gonna kill these teenage and he sees you guys

505
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
there.

506
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,760
Okay, now immediately I hack him.

507
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,040
Whoa, it just switched to a different part of my character sheet.

508
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,840
Oh, sorry, I did that.

509
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,640
I was switching to your spells area.

510
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
That was gangster.

511
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Thanks, dog.

512
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Yeah, okay, cool.

513
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:32,640
So, it is a, what is it, a fucking, I wrote this all.

514
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,160
I forget I have child porn upload.

515
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,560
Yeah, feel free to use that, you know.

516
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,560
I will.

517
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,400
I'm gonna use it on you in real life.

518
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,400
No.

519
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Yeah, I'm going to.

520
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
No, I don't think so.

521
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:51,400
you can't do that. So I made the spell. So, it's like I know that it doesn't work on cool

522
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:58,400
guys. Frankenstein's monster kills Frankenstein. No. There's no way. You can't read, so you

523
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,640
wouldn't even know that that's what happens. I've read the book twice. So I'm pretty much

524
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,660
an expert on books. I've never seen you read before. You've only read one book and it's

525
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,080
Lolita and I'm going to upload Child Born to you. I actually wrote my dissertation on

526
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,080
lolita and why that's bad. So yeah. Yeah. Well, you're canceled for going to college. No.

527
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:22,600
Yeah. No, actually, I got a I got a I've got a only have a GED. So I'm one of those cool.

528
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:32,240
I'm cool. Actually, guys, this is a GED. This argument is is is Caleb's computer data attacking

529
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,080
the robots data and the robots.

530
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,080
I thought it was fighting back.

531
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,080
I thought it was a roll.

532
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,080
It's a D-DOS attack.

533
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,080
Or a D-DOS?

534
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,080
A D-DOS?

535
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,080
I don't think the pronunciation on that one matters all that much.

536
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,080
It's THE DOS.

537
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,080
Yeah, it's D-DOS.

538
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,080
Yeah, so anyway, roll a...

539
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
Roll, I guess...

540
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,080
Oh, what do I have here for this?

541
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,080
Oh, hell yeah. Oh, I just got a roll.

542
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,520
I rolled intelligence saving throw against your spellcasting modifier, which I think I'll

543
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,160
do pretty well on because I am a fucking robot.

544
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,640
So my stats are pretty decent for intelligence.

545
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
Let's see though.

546
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,400
You're not even that smart.

547
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,760
No he's not, you hacked him it turns out actually.

548
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
Yes!

549
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,480
Yeah so you hacked this robot.

550
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,480
So your computer tower, I guess, that's on your back or whatever, unhooks.

551
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,720
Yeah, you describe the process actually, because I want you to take ownership of this, man.

552
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Okay, yeah, so my demon, he turns around and Blotoss gets behind me like a quarterback,

553
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:53,520
and I squat down and I basically hike my computer directly into his skull.

554
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:58,800
And then now I've taken over his body and I coyly say, "Come on in, ladies."

555
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,800
What?

556
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,920
So, yeah, you hack the robot, you tell him, "Come on, ladies."

557
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
What do you want to do?

558
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,000
You're now inside this mansion as the robot.

559
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,920
I believe you hacked him for 10 minutes.

560
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,480
Oh my God.

561
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,280
So you basically have full control of this guy for 10 minutes.

562
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,600
Well, I guess I need to see...

563
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,480
I mean, I haven't seen inside the mansion yet.

564
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,040
I don't know what I'm working with.

565
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:29,920
banks and find where they keep the snacks and treats affirmative the pantry

566
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:36,240
okay cool yeah so he you go into his files and you see he has a snacktivist

567
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,840
selection they could choose yeah the the treats are pigs dead in the blanket an

568
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,560
an LGBLT, a Me Tootsie Roll,

569
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,360
or if you're feeling frisky,

570
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,140
the Lovely Bones Caesar Salad.

571
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:57,280
- Do they have any Magic Spoon Protein Cereal?

572
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,560
- Why don't you roll a, I want you to hack in deeper.

573
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,600
So I'm gonna have this guy roll

574
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,920
an Intelligence Saving Throw against that idea.

575
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,640
Like, does he have that?

576
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,880
Let's see if he can pull that up.

577
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,480
- Okay, 'cause it might be like how parents hide treats.

578
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,920
- Yeah, yeah, he has that.

579
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,960
- He has it? - He has that, yeah.

580
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,660
You have to go into the pantry behind,

581
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,720
yeah, go for it, yeah.

582
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,700
- Yeah, I pull like a secret bookcase,

583
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,800
I pull one box of Lucky Charms,

584
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,800
and it opens up a second pantry.

585
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,200
- Yeah, so you go into this kitchen,

586
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,960
it's pretty clean and pristine, pretty gorgeous.

587
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,520
You do the Lucky Charms book turning thing,

588
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,060
and it opens up a deeper pantry

589
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,320
where it's got more secret snacks in there.

590
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,680
you take those out

591
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:47,720
you make it all this ruckus in the kitchen so i'm not trying to try to do

592
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,360

Robo, did you let somebody in?

602
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,980
- Wait, no, wait.

603
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,280
Well, she won't recognize my voice though, huh?

604
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,000
- You'll be Robo.

605
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,960
You'll have his voice. - It's me, your robot butler.

606
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
I just said nobody was here.

607
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,040
I'm here, I'm your robot butler.

So-- - Go back upstairs.

00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,880
- Go back upstairs.

611
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:40,040
- There is an actual shooter downstairs.

612
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,520
(laughing)

613
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,800
Go back upstairs.

614
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,080
Do you guys wanna- wait so the robot's now saying that.

615
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,160
Alright, I'm gonna need you to roll a deception check with disadvantage because there's all

616
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
this other insane noise going on.

617
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,160
What's my disadvantage?

618
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,800
Yeah, she's like, "Okay, that is- this is not okay."

619
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,400
And she starts walking downstairs and you do see, out of the corner of your eye, all

620
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,480
eighty-five and a half pounds of that hussy kitsune.

621
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,500
Uh, v-girl.

622
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,800
And she looks at you all and she's like, "Oh, are you guys the detectives?"

623
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
"Fuck."

624
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,040
"I don't know this for nothing, dude."

625
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,800
I say, "What's a detective?"

626
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,960
"Okay, I, there, so like I reach out to the Tattletail Agency to get a detective to come

627
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,800

628
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,760
"Wait, I forgot that she sent us here.

629
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,760
Why did we do all that?"

630
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,560
"Yeah, I was kind of wondering, but I didn't want to stop you.

631
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,560
I was having a good time."

632
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,560
"No, it's okay.

633
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,560
Now we're full."

634
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,560
"Yeah."

00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Yeah.

652
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,800
Yeah, make a strength check to see if you can carry it all later.

653
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,720
While this is going on, I need to use your bathroom.

654
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,720
Uh, yeah, sure.

655
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,880
Or wait, that was a strength save.

656
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,880
One second, that was the wrong thing.

657
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,880
There, ten.

658
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,880
I mean, we can just subtract from that.

659
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,880
Alright, cool.

660
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Yeah, that's enough.

661
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,880
I mean, you can carry it, okay.

662
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
Ten is fine.

663
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
I think anything lower than that.

664
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,680
Like, you know how much you can carry.

665
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,760
Um, uh, yeah, sure.

666
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,840
If you want to go to the bathroom, it's just go around the corner there and up the stairs

667
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
and you'll find it.

668
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,840
Okay, I'm going to go there.

669
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:36,840
Okay, good.

670
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,840
Yeah, so now the robot.

671
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,840
She can't see me winking.

672
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:50,440
No, Patrick does a large wink and it actually makes a cartoonish wink sound in real life

673
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,440
when he winks at her.

674
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,280
Yeah, she is just sort of skeeved more than anything.

675
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,600
I'm gonna use my time in the bathroom to investigate some clues.

676
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,040
For sure.

677
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,640
You can roll an investigation check.

678
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Okay, let's see.

679
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,680
Oh no, I have a negative one.

680
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,120
You're sort of like the resident detective here, really.

681
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:11,400
Oh, I got a seven.

682
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,040
Except for that terrible roll, I guess.

683
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:21,200
Yeah, so you see some toilet paper and some good housekeeping magazines, but nothing really

684
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,480
that intriguing about the bathroom.

685
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,960
You notice that the decor is like kind of chintzy, like it's not that, it's kind of a little

686
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,020
bit tacky.

687
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,320
That's mostly what you notice.

688
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,600
I'd like to investigate the toilet paper roll.

689
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,040
Yeah, do it, do it.

690
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,600
How many ply?

691
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:47,200
You notice that the toilet paper roll is made of like double, like double layered, like rich

692
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,600
cotton toilet paper.

693
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,360
Like it's probably like three dollars a square.

694
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:53,720
like this is rich.

695
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,200
Yeah, this is insane.

696
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,040
It's insane money.

697
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,240
- You mean she didn't tip me off?

698
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,080
- Yeah, no, but this is good.

699
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,400
- The toilet paper does.

700
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,240
- Yeah, and you also, you look a little closer

701
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,080
and you notice that it says,

702
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,960
yeah, it says #abolishice on all the squares.

703
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,800
- Whoa.

704
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,040
(laughing)

705
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,460
This really is Sean McElwee's house.

706
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,040
(laughing)

707
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:17,280
- All right, am I downstairs with her still?

708
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,640
- Yeah, you are.

709
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,600
- Okay, I feel like we should ask her some questions.

710
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,520
- Yeah.

711
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,020
You know?

712
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,520
Yeah, she's...

713
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,280
Yeah, she's uh...

714
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,780
Yeah, she says, "Yeah, please, uh, I guess ask away."

715
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:28,420
Tell me about your husband.

716
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,980
How... how tall was he?

717
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,180
Uh, he was like 5'3".

718
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,920
Am I more or less attractive than him?

719
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,720
He is 5'3", I should say.

720
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,120
I... I think he's still alive.

721
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,720
Um...

722
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:41,980
Well...

723
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,820
I mean, he was pretty ugly, but like...

724
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,980
Agree to disagree.

725
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,520
You...

726
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,020
[laughs]

727
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,880
Well, why...

728
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:49,740
Why do you think he's dead?

729
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,780
Like, have you learned anything?

730
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,780
Um, it's called a hunch. It's huge in detective work.

731
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:14,780
Yeah, she sort of looks downcast at that. She's like, you know, like, honestly, like, he was just like so wrapped up in his activism all the time, you know, it was hard to sometimes to talk with him, you know, he always had cheeto dust on his fingers wherever he went.

732
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:31,940
we

733
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:41,560
check I guess. Okay. Uh. Terrible. This sucks. Fuckin' hate this game. Do it, do it. Tell

734
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:52,300
me about the zex now, bitch! Uh, it was like, like when it was good it was good, but most

735
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:57,020
of the time he would just sort of lay there and just be on his phone. You know, he ran

736
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:04,940
data for pogress so it was like a big deal. That's P-A-W-G-R-E-S-S. Pogress. Thank you.

737
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:12,620
Uh, cut thank god oh my god have you seen those ones that aren't? They look crazy.

738
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:19,260
Not a fan of uncut, hmm? I mean, you know, whatever. I take out a notepad and I write that down.

739
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:28,540
in a in a blue's clues notepad. I take out an L.A. Noire legal patent and I start drawing

740
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:34,740
a picture of an uncut penis. Yeah. Does it, ma'am, does it look anything like this? I

741
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:42,860
grab his notepad and show it to her. Nope, I said it was cut, so. Sheesh. While this

746
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,620
wait hold on are you alleging Sean McElwee shits his pants?

749
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,900

00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:30,180
there's no guy no i mean maybe probably but like not anyone i know

751
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,180
I thought it was just a good name.

752
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:34,180
[Laughter]

753
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,180
Yes!

754
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,180
Ahooga!

755
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:40,180
Cam's got the heater on him tonight.

756
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:42,180
So yeah, there's huge

757
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,180
huge tubs of cheese balls scattered on the floor.

758
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,180
The computer has, uh,

759
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:48,180
the computer looks like one of those keyboards

760
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,180
that, like, Joyce Carol Oates had.

761
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:52,180
You know, when they get all the fucked up shit in them.

762
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,180
Um, and he has a huge board

763
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,180
on his wall with red string

764
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,180
running along, connecting it to pictures of AOC

765
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:03,940
and Ilan Omar, people like that. And it says in big writing over it says I will

766
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:11,620
pretend to have ideals until it is inconvenient. So yeah you can sort of

767
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:16,580
do whatever you want now when you're in the room. So I'm just gonna do some

768
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:21,940
general investigating and then I'll get into the hard stuff. Okay cool. So I

769
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:27,660
rolled a six on investigation. So yeah with that six I mean you know you get

770
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:34,680
it the poopy smell is happening you know you sort of notice that there's just a

771
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:38,700
lot of shit in the way of anything out like you can't there's like just too

772
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,140
much stuff in the way for you to really get a sense of what the layout of this

773
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:50,620
room is or what is even in it basically do I have a yeah wait can we eating

774
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:56,580

00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,580
I had an ability to eat poop.

776
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,580
Can we cut back?

777
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:02,580
I want to ask her a question.

778
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,580
Yeah, sure.

779
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,580
We can cut back while Patrick's still navigating the room, figuring out what to do about it.

780
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,580
Navigating bodies in space.

781
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:10,580
Of course, absolutely.

782
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:13,580
So I say, "You said you think he's still alive.

783
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,580
Any idea where he could have gone?"

784
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,580
And then immediately before she answers, I say, "I have to go help Patrick in the bathroom."

785
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:25,580
And I go upstairs to the bathroom.

786
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:31,780
we like to call that metagaming folks but yeah let me let me get let me get my

787
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:37,900
bearings I'm in Sean's room with her and they're in the bathroom no no you're

792
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,460
yeah so Kate Cameron asked that question or I just blow toss asked that question

793
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:17,580
and she and she she sort of says like I mean I don't know like he would always

794
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:20,940
I always go into the Matrix 2 for a little while.

795
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,700
We go to clubs a lot of the time.

796
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:25,060
Like he just stopped paying attention, I feel like, at home.

797
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,380
You know, I was doing a lot of sex work,

798
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,700
like really important sex work,

799
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:32,540
and like, he just like stopped caring, it felt like, you know?

800
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:35,220
- You said sex work.

801
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,060
Can you speak on that for a little bit?

802
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,680
- Yeah, sure, I just sort of like show a little bit of skin

803
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,520
and then--

804
00:47:42,520 --> 00:47:44,060
- Can you give an example?

805
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,580
Can you show an example?

806
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:53,580
Alright, so while that's going on, Cameron and I are investigating.

807
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:57,580
Trying so hard to figure out how to respond.

808
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:58,580
Alright, so...

809
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:01,580
Yeah, we'll give you time to figure that out.

810
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,580
I have something already.

811
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,580
Alright, I say, Patrick, Patrick Yoda, you grab one side of that mattress and I'll grab the other.

812
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:11,580
Let's flip it over and see if there's anything underneath it.

813
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:12,580
Okay.

814
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,580
Okay, let's do that!

815
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:20,020
Yeah, you guys don't need to roll for that. You guys just flip over the mattress.

816
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:23,780
And which is a good instinct. It's a Casper mattress, it's very light.

817
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:31,540
It's a purple mattress. It's a purple Casper mattress collaboration.

818
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:36,180
Oh, well, most companies have sort of combined at this point. So yes, it is a purple Casper.

819
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,660
So purple and Casper are together. So yeah, you flip it over, which was a good instinct,

820
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,420
Because you see a some sort of like looks like a cyber diary

821
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,220
um underneath the mattress

822
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:55,700
If we find this under the mattress, let's flip over the dresser and the rest of the furniture too

823
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,500
before I can open the diary

824
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:04,740
Yeah, okay. You guys flip over all the other furniture in the room and just make a fucking mess

825
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:11,460
Um, and uh, yeah you find you find like more shit covered underwear

826
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:15,540
Well, I guess my hunch was wrong that time around.

827
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:17,780
Well, we still need to look through the closet.

828
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,140
Yeah, yeah, go into the closet.

829
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,140
Can we cut back to the mudroom?

830
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:24,340
Yeah, sure, we'll cut back.

831
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:24,980
The foyer?

832
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:25,700
Cut back to the mudroom.

833
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,740
Yeah, yeah, the foyer.

834
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,260
I just asked how, for an example.

835
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:30,420
Yeah, you just sort of asked this woman to show her ass.

836
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,420
So she, this V-girl.

837
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,860
Or anything else, do.

838
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,460
She's not really real, though.

839
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:37,460
Anyway, she's just ones and zeros.

840
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:46,460
She says, "Well, I guess you can check out my OnlyFans if you want to. It's like 3,000 tokens."

841
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:52,460
"Do you have a code? Do you have a promotional code I can use?"

842
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:56,460
"Yeah, for sure. I have the AbolishICE promotional code you can use."

843
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,460
"Well, good thing I'm a computer."

844
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,460
"I say this from upstairs."

845
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:13,500
stairs. How many times do you have to spell out abolish ice? You have to, and she yells

846
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:21,340
back up, you have to spell it out like 120 times. Okay, so since I'm a computer I do that.

847
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:29,780
Is that a hashtag? Uh, no, you don't need the hashtag, just slur it and like clump the words

848
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:33,700
together. She says that louder I guess than I do.

849
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:40,700
I do that in my computer self immediately and then I just do this. Oh, oh nice. Oh yeah,

850
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:50,820
super cool. Yeah I guess remove 50 dollars from your inventory.

851
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,820
Okay, wait, alright.

852
00:50:52,820 --> 00:51:01,820
Okay, so now I'm at 50 and now I go, uh, here wait, no, cut to them, I'll save this.

853
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:03,460
I'm just trying to distract her.

854
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,380
Cut back upstairs, me and Patrick are ripping the wallpaper off the walls and tearing up

855
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:08,380
all the carpets.

856
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:09,380
Okay, it's just the diary.

857
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,380
I haven't touched the diary.

858
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:13,780
The diary is just sitting there.

859
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:20,860
I am, the diary is sitting there, you're destroying this room.

860
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:22,860
Now it's the darnest thing!

861
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:24,860
I just don't understand!

862
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:28,860
Why can't we find any more clues?

863
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:33,860
He found pictures of Carmen Electra behind there, but he was hiding.

864
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:35,860
Nice.

865
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,860
Yeah, dude.

866
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:46,860
Okay, I say, maybe there are clues written on the walls in invisible ink that we need fire to reveal.

867
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,860
Wait, wait, here.

868
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,100
(laughter)

869
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,160
- Ah well, that's a good idea.

870
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:56,000
(laughter)

871
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,120
- Okay, okay wait I run downstairs to ask

872
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:00,440
(laughter)

873
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:04,520
Hussie, what is her name, Hussie Kitsune for a match.

874
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:10,260
- Okay yeah, what, yeah one second let me go get one.

875
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:12,180
What are you doing up there?

876
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:13,020
And she goes, oh it's a bit close.

877
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,580
- Okay, okay, okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

878
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:17,700
No, to distract her, to distract her,

879
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:24,700
I eject a CD from my CD slot and I say, "What do you think of this?

880
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:27,700
Want to do anything with this?"

881
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:28,700
What's the CD?

882
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:30,700
Uh, James Blake's CD.

883
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,700
Oh, I love him!

884
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,700
He's dating that annoying woman!

885
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,700
Wow.

886
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,700
How about you touch it?

887
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,700
Uh, I guess roll a persuasion check?

888
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:41,700
That's right.

889
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,700
This is rough, man.

890
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,700
21.

891
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:55,300
I'm gonna I'm gonna all right yeah she goes up and she sort of like like sort

892
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:04,540
of gently like poke the hole in the middle and just go sort of embarrassed

893
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:08,300
all right and then I look to I look to blowtoss and I say I bought you some

894
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:17,580
time go. Okay so I look at I have the match do I have I did I take get the

895
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:23,660
match? Yeah you got the match man you got it you got it from her. I ask her before I

896
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:29,060
look at her and I ask her we don't really know where to begin with this

897
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:32,780
where should we even go to look for him what were some of his favorite haunts and

898
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,380
also what was his favorite color and then before she answers any of those

899
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:42,780
questions I run back upstairs with the match. Oh he liked to go to the Mommy

900
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:50,220
Good Legs Club a lot um that's one of the places he liked to go and I guess he's

901
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:56,260
gone but his favorite color was teal? Is, is teal. I'm trying to say is. I promise you I'm

902
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:01,500
writing all this down now focus on the hole in the middle of the ZD. Okay he's

903
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,380
focusing on the hole what are you guys doing upstairs? I hand the match to Patrick.

904
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:10,260
I have already just like ripped the bed in half.

905
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:16,860
Okay, let me just see if like the robot notices this is happening at this point.

906
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:22,620
Because this is just too much activity for me to not just check to see if the robot notices.

907
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,500
I mean we are going absolutely thing one thing two.

908
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,980
He absolutely does not notice.

909
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:29,140
He is the worst robot ever.

910
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,140
You know.

911
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:31,140
Nice.

912
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,140
God damn.

913
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,140
The rolls I'm getting.

914
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,780
Yeah, so keep going I guess.

915
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:35,780
What do you guys keep doing?

916
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,460
Alright, so we have the match.

917
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:40,540
Yeah, I hand it to Patrick and I say, "Do your Yoda magic."

918
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,540
Okay.

919
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:42,540
So, I've, uh...

920
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:48,900
Are you gonna light the match or are you gonna do some Yoda magic?

921
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:49,900
Um...

922
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,900
Huh.

923
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:56,380
Well, would lighting the match be Yoda magic, is the question.

924
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:00,060
It was just a figure of speech, okay?

925
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,660
I just meant light the match.

926
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:06,580
well that you used if you used a force you will be able to cast lightning at

927
00:55:06,580 --> 00:55:08,780
will

928
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:22,380
lightning striking in the house then I'm going to use the force okay yeah that's

929
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:27,860
five technic line points but when you use the force Patrick Yodic used to force

930
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:32,900
for one minute giving him an extreme boost in combat ability and skills. Based on a wisdom

931
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:39,140
DC check as determined by the DM, Patrick Yoda can move objects, people, and more. As a passive

932
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:42,900
ability, Patrick gets advantage on all saving throws, can levitate at will, and is able

933
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:47,620
to shoot lightning out of his hands, dealing 2d8 lightning damage as a bonus action.

934
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:53,380
So basically what this means is you are now levitating in her room with a match in your

935
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,420
hand do you shoot lightning at the match to light it on fire or do you just shoot

936
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:02,740
lightning at the wall? I'm shooting lightning all over the house.

937
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:09,220
If it hits the match it's coincidental but it does hit.

938
00:56:09,220 --> 00:56:13,180
Okay yeah you're shooting lightning everywhere the sound is reverberating

939
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:18,420
through the house. It's like going absolutely crazy. At this point Hasek

940
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:22,480
Kitsune is like oh my god what's going on and she runs upstairs to see what's

941
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,320
going on and she sees a floating... she sees... do you have a grappling hook?

942
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:32,160
Do I have one? No, nevermind, continue.

943
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:38,720
She runs upstairs to see what's going on, you're just shooting up the fucking room with

944
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,880
lightning and she's like "uh okay is there anything I could do to help you

945
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:45,120
guys in here? What are you doing to a A'Shaun's room?"

946
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,120
We're looking for clues!

947
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:52,120
Uh, no, we are, um...

948
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:54,120
Huh.

949
00:56:54,120 --> 00:57:00,120
Meanwhile, I'm downstairs ejecting and then putting back in a CD over and over again.

950
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:06,120
He's going, "Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah."

951
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,120
Yeah, you destroy...

952
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:12,120
We are just kind of... I'm sneezing.

953
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,840
Yeah, I guess roll a deception check.

954
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:16,840
That's okay.

955
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
On that.

956
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,560
That's gotta be disadvantage that lightning is...

957
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:25,080
Yeah, it's, I mean, I wasn't even gonna, but yeah, it should be.

958
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,080
No.

959
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,080
Okay.

960
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,080
I got a 10.

961
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,640
No, but it was gonna be a crit.

962
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,640
Here let me see.

963
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:35,080
Let me see how she does on, on believing you.

964
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,080
I mean...

965
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:39,480
It was gonna be a 22 until Cam mentioned...

966
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,680
Yeah, Cam, this is all your fault.

967
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:42,680
She believes you.

968
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:46,480
She's like, "Oh, yeah, I guess I've heard that you guys sneeze like this."

969
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,480
"You? What do you mean, 'you guys'?"

970
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,480
*laughter*

971
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:52,480
*laughter*

972
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,480
"Excuse me?"

973
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,480
"I'm so sorry, oh my god, that was so..."

974
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,480
"You better leave right now and let us investigate!"

975
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,480
"So unwoke of me, I'm so sorry."

976
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,980
And she walks out, she's like so fucking embarrassed.

977
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:07,980
She's like blushing, anime blushing, all over.

978
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:12,320
like she's a v-girl so like her fucking like body is like like shifting in and

979
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,280
out it's like almost fading out because she's so fucking flustered by it and she

980
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:22,220
walks away sort of totally embarrassed she comes back down and I'm smoking a

981
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:31,660
cigarette I say thank God I was I was it for you

982
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:38,820
uh... and before she has a chance to answer

983
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,600
that uh...

984
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,740

985
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,700
ring once again, bong

986
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,460
and the rob, the robot goes up to the door

987
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,120
and opens it

988
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,520
and out walks

989
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,100

990
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,260

991
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:00,500

both of them are in the bathroom yeah cut cut to upstairs the room is just

1001
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:58,540
completely destroyed there's it's you can see like the underneath the paint on

1002
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:01,860
the wall it's all been stripped down the bed is ripped in half all the furniture

1003
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:06,820
splinters and there's just in the middle the diary is is lying in the middle

1004
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:12,140
like yes absolutely I guess that was the only clue after all and I pick it up

1005
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,620
put it in my way way way before you before you open it I run upstairs I

1006
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:20,660
don't open it I put it in my backpack all right before you pick it up I run

1007
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:25,180
upstairs and I look at you guys and I say have you checked the floorboards and

1008
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,180
And then I run back downstairs.

1009
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:29,180
(laughter)

1010
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:31,180
Oh, great idea!

1011
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:33,180
I guess we have to now.

1012
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,180
You guys start ripping up the floorboards.

1013
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:37,180
(laughter)

1014
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:39,180
Papi Chuko looks to you,

1015
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,180
Ray William Johnson,

1016
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:43,180
as you come back downstairs.

1017
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,180
And he says...

1018
01:00:45,180 --> 01:00:47,180
At this point, Haseki Tsune has gone away.

1019
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:49,180
She's been dismissed by Papi Chuko.

1020
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,180
And he says,

1021
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,180
"Look, I'm very thankful you guys are here.

1022
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:57,340
I wanted to make sure that Hussie had somebody who was looking into this case.

1023
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:59,340
We're all very upset about Sean.

1024
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:01,340
He was a good guy.

1025
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:04,620
I didn't always agree with him, but he took care of her.

1026
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:06,620
She's my niece. What can I say?

1027
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:11,100
When you say you didn't always agree with him, what do you mean?

1028
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:17,100
You know, he just abolished this, abolished that.

1029
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,860
I'm not in the business of abolishing anything. Let's put it that way, okay?

1030
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:23,500
What, what kind of business are you in?

1031
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:27,740
Oh my buddy, you know, I can see you got the glow behind your eyes.

1032
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:30,300
I'm in the techno slime business, you know?

1033
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:34,140
We try not to abolish or regulate anything in techno slime.

1034
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:39,540
It's just not, uh, it's just not ideal. Let's put it that way, okay?

1035
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,740
Okay, Chachi?

1036
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:46,140
Okay, is there any way that I can get him to charge me like seventy dollars for a gram?

1037
01:01:46,140 --> 01:01:48,540
Of techno slime?

1038
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,740
Yeah, you can try.

1039
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,180
You can, uh, you can...

1040
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:57,460
When I, when I hear the word "technoslime" from upstairs really faintly, I run down, I

1041
01:01:57,460 --> 01:01:59,940
start prepping up the floorboards and I run downstairs.

1042
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:00,940
Okay.

1043
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:07,100
I'm committed to my detective work though.

1044
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:14,780
I know, I know that it would be a fun 20 minutes, but I'm committed to my detective work.

1045
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,780
*laughs*

1046
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:20,620
Okay, so you run downstairs, he's like "whoa, whoa, who's this guy over here?"

1047
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,060
He's cool, he's cool.

1048
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:23,620
I was in the bathroom.

1049
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,500
Oh, I guess who is right?

1050
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,500
He parties.

1051
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:28,500
Oh, okay, that's cool.

1052
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,500
No, I mean, hey, that's good to know.

1053
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:36,980
But look, I'm, look, fellas, you know, I'm not into the small time dealing, okay?

1054
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:38,260
I let other people do that.

1055
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:39,540
Let's put it that way, okay?

1056
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:40,540
Are you holding?

1057
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:41,540
No, not on me.

1058
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,540
Come on, I'm a CEO.

1059
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:43,540
Oh my god, you suck.

1060
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:45,540
Oh my god you suck bro.

1061
01:02:45,540 --> 01:02:47,540
I go back upstairs.

1062
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,540
Stop it.

1063
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:51,540
I don't suck. Come on.

1064
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:53,540
Hey I think you suck.

1065
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:55,540
Ok look fellas.

1066
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:57,540
I'm being very generous with you right now.

1067
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,540
I'm not gonna ask who I am.

1068
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,540
I'm not gonna shout who are you.

1069
01:03:03,540 --> 01:03:05,540
When you're all the way up there.

1070
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,540
Oh ok. I was worried you would think he was just very small.

1071
01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:09,540
But yeah he's upstairs.

1072
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,540
I'm not that small!

1073
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:18,540
Okay, I mean, yeah, I haven't seen you yet, so I believe you.

1074
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,540
He's definitely small, don't listen.

1075
01:03:20,540 --> 01:03:23,540
I'm not, hey, I'm not Yoda, but I'm not that small.

1076
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:25,540
He's like three feet tall.

1077
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,540
That's fine. Normal height.

1078
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,540
That's not fine. Not normal.

1079
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,540
It's a pretty good height to be if you're a Yoda.

1080
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:35,540
What, did you think like a tall Yoda would look normal?

1081
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:38,540
I'm saying it's all downstairs.

1082
01:03:38,540 --> 01:03:42,780
I mean now that I'm thinking about it, I thought Yoda would be pretty weird looking.

1083
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:43,780
I gotta say.

1084
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:44,780
Yeah, you would hate it.

1085
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:48,140
I wouldn't hate it, you know, I don't hate anybody, okay?

1086
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:49,660
Let's put it that way.

1087
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:53,020
When, okay, we're getting off topic.

1088
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,540
When was the last time you saw Sean?

1089
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:56,540
Sean?

1090
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:57,540
Ugh.

1091
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:02,380
Well, I mean, last time I saw him he was in here, he was ranting and raving about abolished

1092
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,380
cocks, you know?

1093
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:06,020
I didn't even know what the hell he was talking about at that point.

1094
01:04:06,020 --> 01:04:07,020
Abolished what?

1095
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:08,020
Patrick Cullum.

1096
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,020
Abolish Cox!

1097
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,020
Say it again!

1098
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:16,020
Abolish Cox!

1099
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:18,020
Cox?

1100
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,020
Cox!

1101
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,020
C-O-K-C

1102
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:24,020
S

1103
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:28,020
I think you spelled it wrong!

1104
01:04:28,020 --> 01:04:30,020
Hold on!

1105
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,020
He pulls out a tiny dictionary

1106
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:34,020
Ok yeah, no I see now

1107
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:36,020
what I did wrong, ok, I got it

1108
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:37,020
I got it.

1109
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:39,220
But you know what I said though right?

1110
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,220
I said Cox?

1111
01:04:40,220 --> 01:04:42,860
I think I get it.

1112
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,120
Ok good.

1113
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,120
Who is this guy?

1114
01:04:45,120 --> 01:04:46,120
What the hell is his deal?

1115
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:47,120
I'm Patrick Yoda!

1116
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:48,120
How did you hear that?

1117
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,120
I got huge ears!

1118
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:50,120
Like a Yoda!

1119
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,120
Hey you know what?

1120
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,120
Let's do this.

1121
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,120
Roll perception check to see if you can hear.

1122
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:54,120
Hear shit like that.

1123
01:04:54,120 --> 01:04:55,120
Ok.

1124
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:56,120
Um where?

1125
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,120
Ok.

1126
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,120
I'm Patrick Yoda.

1127
01:04:58,120 --> 01:04:59,120
I'm Patrick Yoda.

1128
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:00,120
I'm Patrick Yoda.

1129
01:05:00,120 --> 01:05:01,120
I'm Patrick Yoda.

1130
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:02,120
I'm Patrick Yoda.

1131
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:03,120
I'm Patrick Yoda.

1132
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,120
I'm Patrick Yoda.

1133
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,120
I'm Patrick Yoda.

1134
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:09,240
Oh wait I still have disadvantage on hold on.

1135
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:12,000
Just take, yeah you can just take the 15 but um.

1136
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Oh yeah I'll take the 15.

1137
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Oh whoops.

1138
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Okay wait wait wait.

1139
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,000
Try again.

1140
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Oh there we go.

1141
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
Fuck alright.

1142
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:25,800
Yeah I guess you could just hear shit with your big ass Yoda ears.

1143
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,080
Let's put it that way.

1144
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:31,280
Okay well while this whole conversation is going on I'm ripping up floorboards in the

1145
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:37,200
the bedroom and I rip up a floorboard that causes the floor to collapse and we fall down

1146
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,200
next to Papi Chuko.

1147
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,200
So we're all downstairs now.

1148
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,200
Well, I heard you, now I can see you.

1149
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:41,200
Alright, let me just roll some damage for you guys.

1150
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,200

01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,200
Oh yeah, you don't take any damage.

1154
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,200

1155

1173
01:06:52,120 --> 01:06:53,120
Mommy Goodlegs.

1174
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:54,120
Okay.

1175
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,120
Mommy Goodlegs?

1176
01:06:55,120 --> 01:06:58,480
Yeah, he'd go there every once in a while.

1177
01:06:58,480 --> 01:06:59,480
He was...

1178
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:02,000
Look, he was cheating on her.

1179
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,320
Let's put it that way, alright?

1180
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:05,320
Whoa!

1181
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,320
Whoa!

1182
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,320
Oh!

1183
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:09,320
I would never do that.

1184
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,320
Hold on.

1185
01:07:10,320 --> 01:07:15,520
You're telling me the woman with the OnlyFans was cheating on her boyfriend?

1186
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,520
No, that's not...

1187
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:23,800
no it's not what I said it's the other way around yeah wait you're telling me

1188
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:31,760
the man with the girlfriend with the only man what was cheating on her yeah that

1189
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,600
was what was I mean what's a look with me that's I don't know with or I mean

1190
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:43,280
with any friggin girl was around in a club like that okay not any girl I mean

1191
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,280
You know, he was the anaconda.

1192
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:49,160
What was he into?

1193
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:55,340
Sure.

1194
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:57,340
Tell me, he loved big bitches.

1195
01:07:57,340 --> 01:08:02,860
Yeah, he fucking loved them, you know.

1196
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:04,860
Let's put it that way, okay?

1197
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,860
That's what I thought. My man.

1198
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:10,480
Hey, he's no man of mine. Just make sure he's safe, okay?

1199
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:22,560
safe okay. Alright, I grab Papi Chuko by his collar and I kick him, I literally kick him

1200
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:36,880
off the property. Okay, I guess I'll just. I need you to roll the DJ Jazzy Jeff check.

1201
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:40,880
He's like, "Oh, whoa, okay, all right, all right, all right, okay, I know what I'm not

1202
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:41,880
wanting."

1203
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,720
He sort of starts to waddle away, the giant grasshopper he is.

1204
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,440
So yeah, what do you guys want to do now?

1205
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,000
I kind of got some of the intel.

1206
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
You have the diary too.

1207
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I say we go to Mommy Legs, the Mommy Legs place.

1208
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,280
You want to try that again, big shot?

1209
01:08:56,280 --> 01:09:01,000
I say we go to the Mommy Legs place.

1210
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Good enough.

1211
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Yeah.

1212
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
All right, I agree.

1213
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,680
So you guys head outside I guess and you see Sullivan's waiting in the car.

1214
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,480
He sort of already gave up on...

1215
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:15,640
Oh that's where you went Sullivan.

1216
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,880
I was worried about you.

1217
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:21,880
Yeah I saw that you guys had sort of a DIY style so I just didn't want to interrupt.

1218
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,440
Did you see the lightning Sullivan?

1219
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:24,440
It was awesome.

1220
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,680
Yeah that was really cool.

1221
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,040
I got a little scared I'm not going to lie.

1222
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:30,240
But I thought it was pretty cool.

1223
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,760
Why'd you get scared you bitch?

1224
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,000
Oh, oh, oh, okay, I mean just 'cause lightnings.

1225
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I'm sorry.

1226
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,400
No, I gotta toughen up, you're right.

1227
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:38,400
I gotta toughen up.

1228
01:09:38,400 --> 01:09:40,560
I'm gonna flick your belly with my fingers so you toughen up.

1229
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,880
Oh, please, please don't flick my belly.

1230
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:45,080
Sullivan, we need you to-- Don't touch him.

1231
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,140
He has a poisonous coating on his entire body.

1232
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:49,140
I'm immune to it.

1233
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,140
It's like a child.

1234
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:51,140
Yeah, I'm immune to that.

1235
01:09:51,140 --> 01:10:01,720
Sullivan, we need you, we need you to drive us to the Momleg store.

1236
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:16,880
for

1237
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:31,880
like

1238
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,760
book you'd probably like something lame like that Sullivan and I throw the diary

1239
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:41,520
to him okay yeah he says huh that's interesting he huh hmm and he puts it

1240
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:48,160
inside a like like a it's like a cyber diary right so he is observing it and

1241
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:57,480
he's like hmm it's interesting all the logs seem to be deleted after hmm hold

1242
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:59,480
And he puts it in. This is the last entry.

1243
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:09,480
And you guys hear this play over the car speakers as you start to drive out of the fucking place you're at.

1244
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:18,480
"Dear Diary, Another day in early retirement after selling data for progress to Stakem's Federation of Bodies and Spaces.

1245
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:24,480
I'm glad I spent all those years posting, making people think I had convictions when really I just had ambitions.

1246
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:30,480
like a tumorous slug sucking shit through a straw. I don't think that analogy applies,

1247
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:35,520
but it's the only thing that comes to mind when I think of myself, me, Sean McElwee,

1248
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:42,920
resident of Gunn City in the year 2245. However, I've been bored lately. There's only so much

1249
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:51,400
child porn- I mean, Karl Marx books, I can masturbate to. And my dutiful wife, as sweet

1250
01:11:51,400 --> 01:12:07,400
in

1251
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:09,400
This is almost two months ago.

1252
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,800
He just stopped

1253
01:12:11,800 --> 01:12:16,040
Just stop recording his own thoughts. It's probably good for the world, but hmm

1254
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:20,200
The sulvin ejects it and hands it back to you blow toss

1255
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,400
All right. Okay. I put it back in my backpack

1256
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:27,320
I take it out of the backpack

1257
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:33,560
Sullivan drives the three of you down the long driveway out from the mansion back into mr

1258
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:38,620
the hands of boulevard. As you cruise down into the Lockheed Martin Plaza, you veer down

1259
01:12:38,620 --> 01:12:46,180
a narrower, seedier alley where it perpetually rains. At the end of the alley, you see a

1260
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:53,160
giant pair of legs spread open with a door in between them. Mommy Good Legs Club. I would

1261
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:56,780
like to take a moment to apologize to all the women in my life, I know my irony will

1262
01:12:56,780 --> 01:13:02,760
not be enough for many of you. You walk into the club and you're flushed with intense red

1263
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:07,400
lights. In some corners the lights are bluer and in another corner it's more black and white.

1264
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:13,240
You can sort of pick your noir vibe. To your right you see a long bar and a stage where

1265
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:20,680
performers, all Goyles with gams, with the backing band from Mos Eisley performing with

1266
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:27,200
the ass cheeks on their foreheads. A few regulars crowd the stage and a stag group of some kind

1267
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:31,360
occupies a corner hooting and hollering at the Goyles saying things like "D" in crumpets

1268
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:33,680
or whatever British people say.

1269
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:38,280
Some V folks, and that's with an X of course, wait staff are flying around serving people

1270
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,920
drinks, giving people sly winks and cooing.

1271
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:45,240
You know, how they do that to get tips, because that's what they have to do.

1272
01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:50,920
At the last song comes to a close, a cool cat takes the stage.

1273
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,440
Thank you Mos Eisley Band and Girl.

1274
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:56,160
Weren't they great folks, and that's with an X of course.

1275
01:13:56,160 --> 01:14:00,440
In case you don't remember, I'm your host for the evening, the Fucker.

1276
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,520
And I'm pleased to announce, and is that a cool cat?

1277
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,800
That it's finally time for the star of the show, the head babe in charge, the foxiest

1278
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:10,720
gal in gun city.

1279
01:14:10,720 --> 01:14:14,960
She turns boys into men, men into women, women into non-binary people, and non-binary people

1280
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:18,760
back into boys due to a curse put on her long ago.

1281
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:21,080
It's Mommy Good Legs!

1282
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:22,080
Rawr!

1283
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:23,920
Cause I'm a cat.

1284
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:27,120
And out comes the most beautiful woman you've ever seen.

1285
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:31,440
In fact she looks exactly like whatever you find to be most beautiful.

1286
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,440
Which is... what exactly?

1287
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,200
Oh my god, Lisa Ann, Nalen Palin.

1288
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:40,520
Oh my god.

1289
01:14:40,520 --> 01:14:41,520
Each of you.

1290
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,520
I'm trying to think.

1291
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,520
Hell yeah.

1292
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:47,360
Oh wow, oh my god, she looks exactly like my beautiful wife.

1293
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:51,800
Wow, this is truly the coincidence for the ages.

1294
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:52,800
That's incredible.

1295
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:59,800
But to blowtoss she looks like the sexy hoo-hoo bitch from the Grinch.

1296
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,800
You're thinking of Cindy Lou Who because you're also thinking of her.

1297
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,800
No, no, no.

1298
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:06,800
The one that marries the girl.

1299
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,800
Cameron, you're thinking of the child.

1300
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,800
Oh no, the one with the big tits who shoots the lightbulb gun?

1301
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,800
Yeah, you know who I'm talking about.

1302
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:17,800
The scene in the Grinch where she shoots a gun that only exists to make her tits shake.

1303
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:21,800
That's cool that you have that on hand as a memory.

1304
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:28,420
Yeah, I've an entire movie memory banked. Why I'm googling lightbulb gun big tit Grinch

1305
01:15:28,420 --> 01:15:37,560
Christine Baranski, okay

01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:20,760
actually has this like blue like glowing light coming out of it as you're going

1337
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:28,980
towards it and when you walk in you notice that there is a a bunch of like

1338
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:35,980
fucking weird. There's a touch tunes in the bathroom.

1339
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:44,420
There's a touch tunes. But there's also...

1340
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:47,820
Wait, there really is a touch tunes? No, it wasn't what I was gonna put in there.

1341
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:50,860
No, there is a touch tunes and I walk up to it and I pay

1342
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:54,700
three of my quarters and I play

1343
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,700
Toby Keith beer for my horses

1344
01:17:56,700 --> 01:18:02,940
So I have the I have the app I have the app and I keep

1345
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:06,580
Skipping all of Caleb's plays

1346
01:18:06,580 --> 01:18:12,460
And I keep playing closing. I keep playing closing time to get people out of the bar so we can investigate

1347
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:16,220
Yeah, this only plays in the bathroom. So you're just trying to get

1348
01:18:16,220 --> 01:18:21,500
So I'm playing it but it's only playing in the bathroom. So everyone leaves the bathroom

1349
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:25,000
Yeah, the only person who stays in the bathroom as you're playing it.

1350
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:30,500
So these blue lights that were flashing were techno-slime light drugs.

1351
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:36,500
So it's like you shoot this light into your eye, using a Men in Black light,

1352
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:42,500
and it makes you see those spots that everybody loves, and you get fuckin' high off that.

1353
01:18:42,500 --> 01:18:53,100
And the only guy left in there is a anthropomorphic Tommy gun named Gavin Shit.

1354
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:56,340
And he's just, he looks sort of like Clippy, but he's a Tommy gun.

1355
01:18:56,340 --> 01:18:57,340
And he's like, "What are you doing?

1356
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:58,340
Why are you driving out my customers?

1357
01:18:58,340 --> 01:19:02,180
I was trying to sell them the techno slime stuff!"

1358
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:07,180
"Well, Gavin, I'm an investigator, you see."

1359
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:10,500
"Well, I don't want to deal with any coppers around here, okay?

1360
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,060
I have no interest in that!"

1361
01:19:12,060 --> 01:19:14,060
Well, I gotta go to the bathroom.

1362
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:16,060
Okay, fine. Just go to the bathroom then.

1363
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:20,060
But don't stop scaring my customers out with your closing time.

1364
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,060
People hate that song.

1365
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,060
I like that song.

1366
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,060
I like that song.

1367
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:30,060
I like it more than you, I feel, because you're the one who wants to tell me to shut it off.

1368
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:32,060
I don't, I, no, no, no.

1369
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,060
I don't dislike that song.

1370
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:36,060
I dislike seeing my customers leave.

1371
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:38,060
They hear closing time, they go, "Oh, I guess I gotta go home."

1372
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:41,060
And that's the problem, because they need to sell them stuff.

1373
01:19:41,060 --> 01:19:43,220
Well, that's their fault. I don't care

1374
01:19:43,220 --> 01:19:46,700
That's a bad fault, but it's my problem

1375
01:19:46,700 --> 01:19:52,480
That's the worst part about playing music in a bar is you play dance with the devil in a bar and everybody thinks they have to

1376
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:54,480
Have sex with their mom

1377
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,920
People just follow the orders of the song

1378
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,100
God well I

1379
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:06,440
Didn't do anything wrong, so I don't know why you're yelling at me

1380
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:10,660
Okay, so cut cut back. Can we cut back to the bartender?

1381
01:20:10,660 --> 01:20:18,340
Me and Ray William Johnson walk up to the bartender and we simultaneously say, "You got no guy

1382
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:19,340
named Sean."

1383
01:20:19,340 --> 01:20:20,860
"You got no guy named Sean."

1384
01:20:20,860 --> 01:20:24,860
"Look, I don't know anybody named Sean, okay?

1385
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:28,500
I mean, well, Sean McAleese, who you mean?"

1386
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:30,580
"That's his name is Sean."

1387
01:20:30,580 --> 01:20:36,540
"Yeah, I mean, he's a big deal.

1388
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,540
What can I say?

1389
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:39,700
Nothing to say about that except that he's a huge deal.

1390
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:44,340
I haven't seen him around here in a while if that's what you want to know.

1391
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:47,540
I heard he used to come here to cheat on his V-girlfriend.

1392
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:53,020
Well, look, I'm not trying to say I know what he did or didn't do, okay?

1393
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:54,900
But yeah, I mean, let's put it that way.

1394
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,540
You are so confusing.

1395
01:20:56,540 --> 01:20:59,900
Can you please just say it's true or not true?

1396
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,460
I just don't look, alright?

1397
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:02,460
I'm a worm, alright?

1398
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:05,140
There's enough I gotta deal with being a worm.

1399
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:06,140
Quit bragging.

1400
01:21:06,140 --> 01:21:07,140
No, that's...

1401
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,480
Well, thank you, but no.

1402
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,080
When people see a worm they think, "Oh, he's a worm."

1403
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,280
You know, I'm trying not to throw my patrons under the bus, okay?

1404
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:16,520
Let's put it that way.

1405
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,520
So you threw Sean under a bus?

1406
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,520
No.

1407
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:20,520
And you killed him?

1408
01:21:20,520 --> 01:21:21,520
No, I did not do that.

1409
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:22,520
We have the confession.

1410
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,520
Well, well, we heard the news.

1411
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,520
No, no.

1412
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:27,520
Book him, boys.

1413
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:30,720
All right, we attempt to arrest Jamal the worm.

1414
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:32,920
Okay, yeah, roll a strength check then.

1415
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:33,920
I got a 23.

1416
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:34,920
Yeah, you guys killed him.

1417
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:35,920
I got a 19.

1418
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:36,920
Wow.

1419
01:21:36,920 --> 01:21:37,920
Okay, cool.

1420
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,920
Yeah, that's...

1421
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:40,920
I'm arresting Jamal Da Worm.

1422
01:21:40,920 --> 01:21:42,920
Are we allowed to do that as detectives?

1423
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:43,920
Can detect...

1424
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:44,920
No, not really.

1425
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:45,920
So we'll try to...

1426
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:46,920
Just sit and try to rest.

1427
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:47,920
We'll try to resolve that.

1428
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:55,920
You can detain, as a private detective, you can technically detain somebody until officers arrive onto the scene.

1429
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,920
We don't call the cops.

1430
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:03,920
You're just arresting this bartender.

1431
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,920
Yeah.

1432
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:08,920
We just arrest him, we just kinda, we just like sit on him.

1433
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:09,920
Yeah?

1434
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,920
Yeah, so he can't go anywhere.

1435
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:17,920
Yeah, so you sit on Jamal the worm and he's like, "Yo guys, fellas, please stop!

1436
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:18,920
Stop!

1437
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:20,920
I didn't do nothing wrong!"

1438
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,920
Um, and I- You're comfortable.

1439
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:24,920
Yeah, you're squishy.

1440
01:22:24,920 --> 01:22:28,920

01:23:47,740 --> 01:23:49,740
I'm going to get the entire venue, you can hear it.

1467
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:58,260
And I say, "Um, this guy named Sean McElwee just disappeared.

1468
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:01,000
And do you know anything about that?

1469
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,740
Also do you want to go on a date with me?

1470
01:24:02,740 --> 01:24:06,900
You're so hot and you look like the Who woman from that movie.

1471
01:24:06,900 --> 01:24:09,700
Do you've seen the movie with the Who woman?"

1472
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:15,140
She puts her hand over your mouth and says, "Okay everyone, we're going to take five.

1473
01:24:15,140 --> 01:24:16,460
One second."

1474
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:20,780
And she turns to you and she says, "Okay, can we just talk about this after the set?

1475
01:24:20,780 --> 01:24:23,660
I'm happy to tell you anything you need to know about Sean, okay?"

1476
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,220
"Well, how long is the set?"

1477
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:27,740
"It's like a few more songs."

1478
01:24:27,740 --> 01:24:28,740
"That's so long.

1479
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,300
Can we- can you just end it early?"

1480
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:33,300
"How long are the songs?"

1481
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,300
"What?

1482
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:35,300
What did he say?"

1483
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:36,300
"What was that?"

1484
01:24:36,300 --> 01:24:37,300
"How long are the songs?"

1485
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:40,940
"It's like three and a half minutes, you know?"

1486
01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:41,940
"Each?"

1487
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:42,940
"Yeah, each one.

1488
01:24:42,940 --> 01:24:43,940
And it's like three or four more songs."

1489
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:48,260
three or four more songs. I thought you were saying it was three and a half minutes for all the songs.

1490
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:51,380
Yeah that would be fine if it was a three and a half minute set that would be fine. How about

1491
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:58,900
you do one more song and then we'll talk. Roller persuasion check. Okay um that's an eight.

1492
01:24:58,900 --> 01:25:07,220
Yeah um yeah she's like she's she's like no I'm gonna I'm gonna do like three more songs. Okay

1493
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:10,180
but what if I gave you this entire backpack full of snacks?

1494
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:18,020
I guess role persuasion with disadvantage because you already tried but but that's that's worthy of a check. Okay

1495
01:25:18,020 --> 01:25:20,420
um

1496
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:22,420
It's a one

1497
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:25,220
She's like I don't I don't eat

1498
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:27,300
what is that one of those is just

1499
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:32,180
It looks like the the the cosmic brownies, but it looks like they're made of poop. I don't want any of this

1500
01:25:32,180 --> 01:25:40,020
Just just just please just three more songs they'll all be i'll make them two minute songs

Do you see him? Do you see how he

1510
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,820

1511
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,820
We handcuffed his head to his tail?

1512
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:04,820
You're next. [laughter]

1513
01:26:04,820 --> 01:26:06,820

01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:33,380
okay, okay, okay, okay. I'm gonna play one more song, okay? It's gonna be Blood Vision

1519

1520
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:39,620
Jay what?

1521
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:41,380
Can you say that again?

1522
01:26:41,380 --> 01:26:44,580
Can you do a clean take on that second word?

1523
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:46,380
I don't think so.

1524
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:48,820
Oh okay, just play it then.

1525
01:26:48,820 --> 01:26:51,780
Okay yeah, she does a jazz standard of blood visions.

1526
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,980
I don't leave the stage, I'm standing right next to her the whole time.

1527
01:26:54,980 --> 01:26:55,980
Okay.

1528
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:02,980
Cameron's on the stage and he's just hitting one note on a synth.

1529
01:27:02,980 --> 01:27:06,980
Okay, awesome. That's awesome, dude. What note are you hitting?

1530
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:09,980
C1. Very low. Very low note.

1531
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:12,980
C1? Yeah, it's insanely low.

1532
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:14,980
Yeah, so there's just like, you're playing...

[Laughter]

1535
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:26,040
So yeah, she's playing her song and uh, and uh, she's playing her one last song and there's

1536
01:27:26,040 --> 01:27:27,040

1537
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:31,620
Everybody, uh, uh, Patrick and uh, Caleb, roll a constitution saving throw to see if

1538

01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:38,140
Yeah, Patrick Yoda, you destroy your fucking Yoda ride.

1541
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:41,700
I'm not, I'm not shitting, I'm in the bathroom so I'm on the toilet already.

1542
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,900
Oh, yeah, you're on the toilet?

1543
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:44,900
Yeah.

1544
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:49,500
Okay, alright, so yeah, it all goes into the toilet actually, and uh, but it fills up the

1545
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:50,500
toilet.

1546
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,860
a little bit of it on your butt as you waddle out.

1547
01:27:53,860 --> 01:27:54,860
Yeah, alright?

1548
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:55,860
How do you like that?

1549
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:56,860
I give you some poopy.

1550
01:27:56,860 --> 01:27:57,860
I don't like it.

1551
01:27:57,860 --> 01:27:58,860
Alright, you don't like it?

1552
01:27:58,860 --> 01:27:59,860
I'm sorry then.

1553
01:27:59,860 --> 01:28:00,860
Yeah, Caleb, you're fine, man.

1554
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:04,260
You're just so- Thank God for Jamal, because you're sitting right on top of him.

1555
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:05,260
Yes!

1556
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,860
So that would've- Yeah, that would've been brutal.

1557
01:28:07,860 --> 01:28:14,460
Okay, I voluntarily shit my pants.

1558
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:16,060
Just to fuck him up.

1559
01:28:16,060 --> 01:28:18,260
Yeah, so you- You're just like, "I don't know, man.

1560
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:20,260
It must have been the brown note.

1561
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:26,260
Yeah, roll deception check to see if he believes it's the brown note that did that.

1562
01:28:26,260 --> 01:28:27,260
Uh...

1563
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,260
Twelve.

1564
01:28:28,260 --> 01:28:32,260
Okay, let me see if he believes that.

1565
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:34,260
He's pretty good at telling when people are deceiving him.

1566
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:35,260
No, he is a worm.

1567
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:36,260
No, he's a bartender.

1568
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:37,260
No, he's a worm.

1569
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:42,260
He's like, "Dude, I know that you just shit on my head.

1570
01:28:42,260 --> 01:28:44,260
I am not fucking stupid.

1571
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:46,260
I know you just shit on me on purpose."

1572
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:48,260
It was the music.

1573
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,260
Bro, that is only a brown note.

1574
01:28:50,260 --> 01:28:52,260
That is a brown note for Yodas.

1575
01:28:52,260 --> 01:28:54,260
Uh, sorry.

1576
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:56,260
Music make me lose control.

1577
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,260
[Laughter]

1578
01:28:58,260 --> 01:29:06,260
He's like, "Okay, yeah, I mean, it's a good song and everything, but you just shit on my fucking head. Oh my god, dude."

1579
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:08,260
"Stay here, I have to-"

1580
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:12,260
"It smells like, it smells like fucking, like asbestos. I'm so confused."

1581
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:14,260
"I'm gonna pass out."

1582
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:20,020

1593
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:17,780
She goes to the back, she goes away.

1594
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,780
So yeah.

1595
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:26,860
Okay, I talk into the microphone and I say, "Hey, Ray William Johnson and Patrick Yoda,

1596
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:29,380
come to the back, we're meeting up with Mommy Good Legs.

1597
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:30,380
Wink, wink."

1598
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:33,380
And I say, "Wink, wink" into the microphone too.

1599
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:36,380
Okay, I'm a little busy in here still.

1600
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:41,960
I had, I pooped so much from the brown note,

1601
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:48,220
I had to go to a different stall just to wipe.

1602
01:30:48,220 --> 01:30:52,480
So, it's gonna be about,

1603
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:57,880
gonna have to give me like two minutes maybe.

1604
01:30:57,880 --> 01:31:01,700
But again, I just wanted to make clear,

1605
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:03,700
I was in the bathroom when it happened.

1606
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:08,700
And none of it happened in my pants.

1607
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:13,700
And, uh, have a good day.

1608
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:19,700
You see everyone in the bar kind of go, "Oh, thank you, thank you.

1609
01:31:19,700 --> 01:31:21,700
Yeah, no, thanks man."

1610
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:26,700
Yeah, so two minutes go by and he cleans himself up and you guys get out of there.

1611
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,700
And you guys start going towards the door.

1612
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:35,700
And that stag party that was hanging out by the stage, sort of gets in front of you guys.

1613
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,700
"Oh, where are you guys going?"

1614
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,700
"I'm not going to the bathroom!"

1615
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:45,700
"You guys trying to go to talk to mommy good legs, huh?"

1616
01:31:45,700 --> 01:31:49,700
"Yeah, you try to talk to mommy good legs, you can't talk to mommy good legs, she's all,

1617
01:31:49,700 --> 01:31:51,700
yeah, she's all girl!"

1618
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:56,700
"She asked me to talk to her, she wants me to talk to her in the back."

1619
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:01,220
You know, talk to this in the back and one of them takes out brass knuckles.

1620
01:32:01,220 --> 01:32:03,220
You know, talking to mommy good legs.

1621
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:04,220
Yeah, you know, talking to mommy good legs.

1622
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:05,220
One of them's a boy.

1623
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:06,220
Yeah, you know, talking to mommy good legs.

1624
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,220
I'm an orphan.

1625
01:32:07,220 --> 01:32:13,220
Um, I grabbed the kid.

1626
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:14,220
Okay.

1627
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:15,220
Yeah.

1628
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:19,420
Roll an intimidation check for whatever you're about to do.

1629
01:32:19,420 --> 01:32:22,220
Because I know you're going to try to intimidate him.

1630
01:32:22,220 --> 01:32:23,220
Ten.

1631
01:32:23,220 --> 01:32:24,220
Okay.

1632
01:32:24,220 --> 01:32:25,220
Okay.

1633
01:32:25,220 --> 01:32:26,220
Yeah, you don't scare me!

1634
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:29,620
I'm gonna kick your frickin' arse!

1635
01:32:29,620 --> 01:32:31,820
I sit on him and I shit again.

1636
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:34,020
Okay, uh, roll initiative then.

1637
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:35,420
That's where we'll end it here.

1638
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:36,340
That's real initiative.
