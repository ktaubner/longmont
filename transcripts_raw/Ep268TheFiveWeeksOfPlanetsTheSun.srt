1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,820
I thought that would work what what you thought you thought that would be

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,100
dropping the gun was going to work. What the hell are you doing man do it

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:22,160
anymore? The citrus is in I told you this already, but you put it on the

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,200
fuck. You put it on the table to show you know, because I was going to take

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:30,900
one you're showing I forgot. I'm glad that we're getting to the point with nicotine.

6
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,700
This is how all drugs should be. Yeah, you should not be enjoying nicotine sitting back

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,820
smoking a cigar having it slowly enter your body and saying, oh, my God, look like poop.

8
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,300
First of all, I'm not saying it, but you should everything like this. You should be taking

9
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,700
it. You got some crap in the middle of your bra. I got I got the fake Oakley's. I got

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:55,740
Oakley's got eczema. Your Oakley's got eczema. That's an Action Bronson lyric. My Oakley's

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:02,580
got eczema! Do you see it? I do see it. Those might be real and then the coating, that happens

12
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,900
sometimes. Do you think they sell real Oakley's for $1? Where'd you get them? The store? The

13
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,700
Chinese store. Are Oakley's expensive? Yeah. Why? They've always been. They cost me $1

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,140
only one that doesn't have sunglasses on. I got an Oakley backpack. Oh, you guys are

15
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,180
wearing sunglasses because of the sun. Oh, I wasn't even meaning to do that. I just my

16
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,460
eyes hurt. That's incredible. I almost like sunglasses on also, but I don't want to ruin

17
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:38,060
my amazing lion makeup that I did. Okay, well, we're getting into it early, guys. No, this

18
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:42,180
is a lion. You can see the mane. The red is the mane and then the white. Oh, and the mustache

19
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,420
or the main yeah. Well, I didn't want to do full face. Why because I have to do

20
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,540
something after this you did zoo you get did a bit of a zoo pals. Yeah, I do like

21
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,420
a zoo pal. All right, let's walk it through the whole thing guys. Welcome to

22
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:06,060
the five weeks of planets week five day one day one. I don't want to be more

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,540
points. Oh my God, wait. I just remembered I have the most insane news

24
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,000
to share. I'm sorry to do this right at the top, but this is really important.

25
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,380
This changed my life forever. This will tell my ass man. Stop making me sit here.

26
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,300
I saw this on Twitter or I guess I should say X. Yes, I saw this on X this

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:27,140
morning. Do you know how every year the Japanese make a list of birthdays that

28
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,960
are the most lucky and fortunate birthdays for that year and the twenty

29
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,420
twenty four birthday list has dropped? Oh my God way. Now I want you to zoom in

30
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,080
here and look at birthday number one. I just want to show you what this looks

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,000
like first

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,880
birthday number one. What's the number one most lucky birthday in twenty seven

33
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,240
four

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:53,000
cameras? That's your seven four bro. That's my way. The Fourth of July number

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,180
one most

36
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:01,760
I am the luckiest guy number one guy for twenty twenty four. That's fucking crazy.

37
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,560
isn't that unbelievable? Where's my is my birthday on here? Every birthday is on

38
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,620
there man every way it's ranked it's ranked from one day to sixty six okay

39
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,800
seven twenty three the day of the first day of Leo, which is why I'm dressed up

40
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,300
like a lion. Oh because of the sun is the sun. I don't know

41
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,500
seven. Twenty one is number twenty five.

42
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,900
I can't look at this now I'm going to if I know what my my luck is, then I know

43
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:32,580
I'm going to have a I couldn't believe I can tell you I was in full denial when I

44
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,740
saw my birthday on there to the point where I was like, oh, you know what that

45
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,340
must be April seventh. They may be they do it backwards, but they don't bro.

46
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,580
It's my birthday. I'm number one luckiest. Holy crap, it literally is

47
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:47,060
changing my life per per per permanently. Holy shit permanently, yeah, well it

48
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,300
hasn't started yet. Yeah,

49
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:54,180
so it's still good. Guess what the guess of the second worst birthday is what

50
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,460
fucking

51
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,020
April Fool's Day. Oh yeah, that makes sense and the absolute worst is August

52
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:05,720
nineteenth. That's the least lucky birthday. If you are burnt more burn on

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,660
August nineteenth, that's why I feel fucking sorry. Yeah, you're even you're

54
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,660
you're on one one. Only every four years do you get a chance to be as low as you

55
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,620
are on that list. Your number three hundred and sixty six, not three hundred

56
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,180
sixty five. Yeah, three hundred. That's literally so fucking unless next year

57
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,220
leap year. Yes, Holy Shit! Three hundred and sixty. We got to do something for

58
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,940
that this year.

59
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,780
Dude, I can't. We got to do something for that this year. It's going to be

60
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,220
amazing. We have to do something for it. We have to do something for leap day.

61
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,820
All right, what should we do? I don't even know. I'm too excited to even

62
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,620
think. It's a free day. Well, let's just go somewhere. I've never done shit for

63
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,020
leap day. Yeah. Well, is leap day when an episode comes out this year? Well,

64
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,860
wait, no, leap day. Here, so leap day, the way we should do for leap day is

65
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,380
just do something that will be erased from history when it's over. So we do

66
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,040
something we will make so fucking bad yeah like yeah have a relationship with

67
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,000
each other. I mean a cup,

68
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,680
you don't have a relationship with us. I can get rid of I don't want to, but I'm

69
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,200
saying on leap day, it's like well might as well do it on leap day because that

70
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,700
day is going to disappear. So it's basically we won't even have a memory of

71
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,220
it. You know I'm getting really fat row. I'm getting really fucking scared

72
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,240
looking at the going scrolling down and down and down do it again. Try and get

73
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,920
me in, although I think I'm in the top half at least,

74
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,120
which is amazing. Oh, that's a lot of cups being thrown. Did you start from the

75
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,020
bottom yeah. I started that's kind of pessimistic from the bottom, because I

76
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,380
figured I was like with my fucking luck. I probably am the least fucking best

77
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,020
birthday. Do you look for a

78
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:35,400
way? I'm the hundred and eleventh that's one one number that's lucky here.

79
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,480
Julio look for the rest. I'll send this to Julio and Julio look for the rest of

80
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,860
our birthday, so we can talk seven. Twenty three is my birthday. I'm sending

81
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,300
a day of

82
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,660
Leo. Do we have a lion sound? Are you a Leo? Yeah, we have a lion sound effect.

83
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,700
So what are you?

84
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
What's your...

85
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,700
Cancer.

86
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,700
Damn, dude.

87
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,700
I'm an Aries, man.

88
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,700
Yeah.

89
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:56,700
Yeah.

90
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,020
So somebody tell about the kind of compatibility for throuples between that.

91
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,020
I think that Aries...

92
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,300
Yeah, can you look that up?

93
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,260
Because Aries and Lios are both fire signs.

94
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
I think they are compatible.

95
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,260
Cancer is a water sign.

96
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,740
And I think that you're a water sign.

97
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,860
I don't think that the same thing is compatible.

98
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:10,220
Don't you want to have a team of different ones?

99
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,660
I think you want to have a team.

100
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:14,580
Which one is the hacker?

101
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,580
That's got to be Gemini, bro.

102
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,580
Definitely Gemini.

103
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,580
That's a hacker name.

104
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,580
That's a hack.

105
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,580
Yeah, Gemini.

106
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:27,020
code name Gemini for Leo Neo Leo Neo Neo true cancer cancer. You can answer

107
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,980
the answer. What dancer the cancer dancer the cancer that you could be the

108
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:36,620
or you could be the cancer dancer. I guess that's a Leo Ares is a also a

109
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,060
hacker name. Ares is a ram whatever Ares could also be a hacker name.

110
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:46,380
I guess you're a cancer is a crab. Yeah, and Leo is a lion. What is Ares again?

111
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,900
is it a ram ram ram did and then Capricorn is a goat dude last night. I

112
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,620
went to fucking I went to thirty rock or undisclosed reasons to

113
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,740
to see if the tree was on the tree wasn't on. I went to go. I went to go

114
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,400
fucking look at the tree. The tree was completely fucking off man. Yeah, the

115
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,760
tree was there. It is the tree was there, but they hadn't turned the lights on

116
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,180
is pissing me off in a major way. Yeah, anyway, I'd be pissed to did you know

117
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,720
but the

118
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,420
the Christmas tree in Boston is an annual gift from from Canada. No, I

119
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,000
didn't that's from like Halifax or something because we helped them in the

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,020
war. I like when countries like each other and they send us their best

121
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,280
Christmas tree every year. I like when their sister cities, but there's some

122
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,500
fucking bunk ass sister. So that's the sister city of Boston. I discover my

123
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:38,020
Dallas. I think it's Halifax. It's one of them. Do you have a the the whole the

124
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,940
sister city of my hometown was like some fucking spot in Russia. I've never heard

125
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:47,100
move. Yeah, it's always how it is man. I think that's what it was. How come it's never but

126
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,540
listen to the fact that the fact is Hollywood. Yeah, or that that would be sick if this is

127
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
how it was.

128
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,620
It is not like London Derry, New Hampshire's sister city is like a city in like Zimbabwe.

129
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,340
It should be. It should be that all the worst cities get the best sister cities so that

130
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,940
they can be mentored. Exactly. Yeah, their cities can be mentored. You need a bad sister

131
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:12,340
sister city of New York. So I would what is this? It's got to be a lame. It's a

132
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,380
way bro. Yeah, la is just so similar. It's probably la Shanghai, Hong Kong,

133
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:23,220
Tokyo, yeah, probably Tokyo, okay, and all those at once. Apparently, big

134
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,120
family city has lots of sisters.

135
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,220
Apparently, New York City has a good chunk. Yeah, that's what I'm saying,

136
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,180
man. Wait, he's there. I like if la is your city of New York. I honestly would

137
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,460
I would say it would be the evil step sister Cinderella style. Okay, so New

138
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,560
York City sister cities are Athens, Greece, Beijing, China, Budapest,

139
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,060
Hungary,

140
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,740
it's just all the biggest city. Yeah, so far Tokyo, I was like do you want to

141
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,620
be Jerusalem City, but Brooklyn's got bitch fine. Brooklyn's got

142
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,500
Anzio Italy,

143
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,980
the get us the for Turkey, Benny Brock, Israel, Benny Blanco, Benny Blanco, you

144
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,280
years in a weird spot, man, it did pop it out. I did it's my new to the upper

145
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,980
deck. He man I don't do the upper Decker. Why is that's where it belongs? My top

146
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,760
teeth or God gave you a top deck to reason and beautiful

147
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,520
your teeth look like shit. No,

148
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,660
you want to three, huh? You want thirteen one? Thirty? You guys are so

149
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,400
right next to each other. That's crazy. We're saying eleven and one thirteen.

150
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,240
What's yours? Who we are going to find it?

151
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,840
That's sad.

152
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
Yeah, that is sad.

153
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
I'm sorry that you can't find it.

154
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Okay, man.

155
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
The one birthday that's not happening.

156
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,840
Guys, this is a big one.

157
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Yeah.

158
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
The motherfucking sun.

159
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,840
Literally a big one.

160
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,840
The biggest one we've done so far.

161
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,840
The motherfucking sun.

162
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,840
It's not a planet, but it is a star.

163
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,760
The yellow sun, no Bart, man.

164
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
Let's get this shit.

165
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,760
I almost did.

166
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,240
I was going to just dress up like Bart.

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,800
Yeah, that would have been a layup.

168
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,800
That would have been a layup.

169
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
The yellow sun.

170
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,760
I went the road less traveled.

171
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
All right.

172
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,680
Yeah, the lion, which doesn't make that much sense.

173
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,360
Makes a lot of sense when you think of astrological science.

174
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:06,960
I fully did replace this with the normal one before this, but I guess it didn't

175
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,640
take that's funny. The Cameron report with Planet Feta. It's the star report

176
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,460
today. Today we're doing

177
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:19,460
the splendor of the Sun. Wow, a star report.

178
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:26,860
The nearest star system to the Sun is Alpha Centauri. I'd consider Alpha

179
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:44,600
and

180
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,120
a centurion. Oh wow, I can't wait for this. Bit of an outside perspective on the sun. So,

181
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:58,720
here we go. We have been trying to contact our neighbor for some time now. Our neighbor

182
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:05,640
seems very interesting, but I am most fascinated by my neighbor's son. The biggest point of

183
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:13,600
interest in my neighbor's area. Here are some facts about my neighbor's son that I have learned

184
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
from careful research.

185
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,240
There is nothing necessarily unique about my neighbor's son,

186
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,880
but my neighbor's son is still a star.

187
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,960
My other neighbors have sons that are brighter,

188
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,880
or up to 100 times larger,

189
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,520
or hotter.

190
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,120
Some of my neighbors even have two or three sons,

191
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,160
but my neighbor's son is very important

192
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,280
to the people that live in my neighbor's system.

193
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,580
This is because my neighbor's son indirectly provides them with the nutrients necessary for life.

194
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,680
My neighbor's son is currently a yellow dwarf.

195
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,920
It will soon grow and become a red giant.

196
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,560
Then, at the end of its lifespan, it will become a white dwarf.

197
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,440
In billions of years, my neighbor's son will explode.

198
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:10,000
My research on my neighbor's son has taught me many interesting facts.

199
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,680
For example, the hottest part of my neighbor's son is its core,

200
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,620
and it only gets hotter as the years go by.

201
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,280
I make sure to do all my observation of my neighbor's son

202
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,860
from a long distance,

203
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:30,000
so nobody in my neighbor's area realizes I'm there.

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,760
My neighbors would freak out

205
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,240
if they saw me doing experiments on their son.

206
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,680
If my neighbor's son were to die,

207
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,360
My neighbors would only find out after about 8 minutes, and if my neighbor's son died, my neighbors would surely follow suit.

208
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,200
In conclusion, I must say I am fascinated by my neighbor's son.

209
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,960
Someday, I would love to get up close and personal and really inspect it.

210
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:03,880
With the technology and advanced science I have, I think I could even do a better job taking care of my neighbor's son than my neighbor could.

211
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,240
Too bad I'm not allowed to approach my neighbor's son due to galactic law.

212
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,800
That's just how life is in Alpha Centauri.

213
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,040
Wow.

214
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,440
That's amazing.

215
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,680
That's an amazing planet report.

216
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,000
You know, that's kind of that's interesting.

217
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,040
You're talking about neighboring galaxies, but we were talking about sister

218
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,480
after we talked about sister cities.

219
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,640
Yeah. Why don't we have a sister again?

220
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,040
The stars aligning.

221
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,000
We do have a sister planet.

222
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,880
It's Mars. Yeah.

223
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,600
Yeah. Shut up.

224
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,040
Someone didn't pay attention.

225
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,800
I pay attention every day.

226
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,640
Somebody's not paying attention. Can you walk us through your outfit? We didn't even go through yours.

227
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,480
Yeah, me and Pats are kind of pretty clear.

228
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,000
Huh, the lion part is very clear.

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,200
Leo is orange.

230
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,840
All right, let's go. Let's go, man.

231
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,800
You want to know about my shit?

232
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,320
Yeah. I'm a shining star.

233
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,880
No matter who you are.

234
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,840
Justin Bieber. Dude, I am a celebrity.

235
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, you're Lady Gaga.

236
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,800
No, you do look like Lady Gaga.

237
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,280
I'm a Hollywood walk of shame.

238
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,200
I call it shame. The Hollywood walk of shame.

239
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,000
You look like Lady Gaga. I'm Lady Gaga, man. The biggest star in the universe.

240
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:17,280
Can you sing, what's that song? I'm on the deep end, watch as I dive in. I'm never losing my shoes.

241
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:24,880
Wow. I'm stuck on the edge of food. Oh my God. Or it's called something. It's called I'm on the

242
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,200
edge of food. It's a song that I've never seen that movie. I'm on the, I'm on the deep end. Oh,

243
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:37,680
Oh, I just realized what I'm talking about. A star is born. You're kidding me,

244
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,360
dude. This lines up in an amazing way. Everything has been lining up so

245
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,000
perfectly, it's crazy. Okay, walk us through your prison lion outfit. Okay,

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,620
well... It's lining up. Orange here, orange here to represent the orangeness

247
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,420
of the sun. The sun is yellow, man. But then it goes into this yellow here,

248
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,440
which is you mean the beginning of the lion's face and then the outside of it

249
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,180
is the lion's main and then pink and red here, but why a lion? I've said it six

250
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,700
times, but Leo is Leo. Leo is the sun sign. Oh, okay, shit. Well, everyone

251
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,480
doesn't know anything about astrology back in my day. I thought your son sign

252
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,900
was like it was like my son signs. Cancer is sun sign. My son sign is in

253
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,300
Leo right, but your son is not a sun sign. It is it's your son of your

254
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,540
trying bro. You tried to pull a bro. No, I think about astrology

255
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,500
about astrology.

256
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,380
Actually, you probably definitely knows the most. I'm sure he does, but I don't

257
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,780
think what you're saying makes any sense. I thought it's fire. What I

258
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:41,660
thought it was fire water, earth and air. You're thinking of Avatar. You are

259
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,980
thinking of it. I never seen Avatar, so I wouldn't know you never seen Avatar.

260
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:48,300
You've seen Avatar. The blue, the blue Avatar. I love that shit. You never seen

261
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:52,500
I think about that every day when I'm falling asleep, and it gives me fuel for

262
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,380
my life. The Blue Planets, Avatar to the family,

263
00:15:55,380 --> 00:16:00,140
that's what I'm gonna be my family. One day, Avatar to the family, that's what I

264
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,700
kind of is the Avatar to the family. I still haven't seen either bro. I

265
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:08,100
don't come with us to see Avatar to all fucking amazing. So fucking good life

266
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,060
changing Avatar three coming in twenty twenty five. I think twenty twenty five

267
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,900
Christmas that shit ain't never coming out. No, it's coming man. They're in

268
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:17,940
post production already. I think no one filmed it together with two and two.

269
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:23,300
cool. It was only filmed. You know it's a movie I learned about sunshine. Oh

270
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,400
yeah, that one's about the sun. That's about the sun. Is it for real? Eternal

271
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,780
sunshine, eternal sunshine. I had to stop watching that movie one time. Why

272
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:36,180
son of Frankenstein when he goes into the when he goes into the apartment and

273
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,740
everything's crazy. None of us saw that one. I had to walk out of the movie

274
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,940
theater. Still haven't seen that one. I think I see it might be a mushroom is

275
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,100
man. Oh, the shining shining is about the sun shot. What other son? Oh my God,

276
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:50,080
that's why it's called the shining because it's about his son. Wow,

277
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:58,280
Holy Shit! Jack Nickel son. Oh shit and son Shelly and son bitch

278
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,360
son fucking bitches in that movie.

279
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,060
Suddenly Hubrick. Yep, wait and and guess what it's about and it's about

280
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,500
how they faked going to the moon because really they went to the sun.

281
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,580
yeah, that's why they had to fake going to the moon. Yeah, they built this moon

282
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,520
set on the sun. Nobody was going to believe it if they went to the sun. So

283
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,140
they had to say yeah, we actually went to the moon. You need the biggest source

284
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,660
of natural light. Of course, you're going to the sun sun, the art of of

285
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:35,580
stars, the art of store store still are where the where the sun was art of wire

286
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,220
is the sun man in the sky. Oh wait, it's right there. It's always there.

287
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:43,260
was on. I was the first thing you see if you're born outside during the day time

288
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:47,660
and you're looking up at the sky and you don't notice anything else. I guess that

289
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,620
is the first thing you see. That's a really good point. That's a great

290
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,700
camera. Show us your outfit. What do you got man? Well, I got the sunglasses for

291
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,180
the sun. I was going to put some sunscreen on my face, but I forgot to

292
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,980
bring it. I was going to put the light sunscreen on my nose, kind of Larry the

293
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,660
lobster. You can imagine that I got a yellow shirt for the yellow color of the

294
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,700
sun and it's also it's a shirt for a youth summer camp and who do you send to

295
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,120
so you summer camp, you son, you son, yes, and you're not a but my son, the

296
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,780
son is the

297
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,420
or the daughter is the son of the mom daughter's, the moon of the sun. Have

298
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,720
you guys ever tried doing never mind? We never tried signing your butt cheeks

299
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,040
and your balls, sunning no, no perineum do not send my perineum. I kind of

300
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,840
think it might work. I think that that's supposed to remain dark.

301
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,020
I don't think that's supposed to. I think there's a reason that's where the

302
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,260
the sun don't shine. Oh Shit yeah, where the sun don't I think that there's a

303
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,540
completely good invented clothes. The sun was not getting up and no very rarely

304
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:48,300
there. They were not. Imagine you see a cave man, just doggy style pointing his

305
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,700
butt at the sun. I put a bone in it yeah.

306
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,900
If I saw that shit, I'm put I'm pulling up with a bone.

307
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:00,160
Take this bone. I'm hitting that thing with the club. Get the hell out of here.

308
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,400
That's why they invented loin cloth. I came over doing that. I'm sick of this

309
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,240
I don't want to see this. I'm fine with seeing all your hairy chests and man

310
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,540
boobs and whatever, but I don't want to see your asshole and you're sticking

311
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,880
great on all the right now. I'm fucking horny because I saw this cave man's

312
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,520
hairy ass yeah and they the reason they're called loin classes, because

313
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,240
they made them out. They used to kill cave lions and make them out of cave

314
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,080
lion skin. They couldn't spell back then, so they said loin instead of lion

315
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,960
and the lion is the

316
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,520
line is not the animal of the sun man. No again, you go a lion is a Pokemon.

317
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:36,260
think about that. I guess there's a sun lion and Pokemon, but the sun, I would

318
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,160
say the sun animal

319
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,380
there's an electric mouse

320
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:44,080
mythology, though, I would be like, oh, a mouse, that's the electric animal. I

321
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,680
can't touch my face. You can't touch your no, but I do have an itch. Let me

322
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,480
get it. Okay, where you want makeup on your finger? I don't bro. Yeah, I really

323
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,000
don't you really don't. This stuff is toxic. What's the first time you guys

324
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,880
ever saw the sun first time? I ever saw this yeah probably born outside looking

325
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,080
probably when I left the hospital. I guess I can imagine you being born in a

326
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
hot tub. I was looking into the sun for a while. Yeah, I wasn't born. I

327
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,800
like I could imagine I was born in fucking Mount Auburn Hospital, Bro

328
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,920
Mount Auburn. Yeah, that's in Cambridge. You don't know Mount Auburn Hospital.

329
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,680
No fake. I was born in

330
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:22,960
Mount Auburn. I was born in Saint Elizabeth, Brighton, Brighton, then the

331
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,440
sun. I was born in New Hanover County Medical Center,

332
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,500
St. Elizabeth's Hospital Center of the Solar System. Holy shit, this is

333
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,500
getting crazy. St. Elizabeth's Hospital. Burn, burn, yeah, sun, hot. Also,

334
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,860
who was born there? Mike Bloomberg. What does the sun do? Makes those flowers

335
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,700
bloom. Makes the world go round. Melts icebergs. Yeah, it melts icebergs. Mike.

336
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,260
That's why his name is so crazy. Looks like a Mike, looks like this part of

337
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:51,140
the Mike. Do you guys ever get scared that the sun's just going to go out?

338
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:55,100
Yeah, but as I, as a Malfa Centaurian informed us, we wouldn't know for eight

339
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,960
minutes yeah, but that doesn't really help me. That's not very long yeah.

340
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,640
That's not so long. I probably couldn't live the rest of my life in eight

341
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,160
minutes. I'd be able to do something. You wouldn't know in eight minutes. You

342
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,140
would be like you'd be you'd be at your computer. You'd be look you'd be

343
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:10,640
googling funny movies or whatever yeah, you'd see it go out and you're like oh

344
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,160
my God, the past eight minutes I could have been doing everything I've ever

345
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,640
doing eight minutes on IMDB, a minute try not to laugh. If you had eight

346
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,520
minutes to live, what are you doing? First of all, I would sell all my

347
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,060
belongings, so i'll be super rich yeah. Okay, so that's the first thirty

348
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,100
seconds and i buy new more luxurious belongings with the money. That's the

349
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,500
next thirty, which way the same amount of money. Yeah, well, wait. So you're

350
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,020
selling everything. I sell sell everything, so that includes all the

351
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,080
essentials right and i'm using them. I don't need i'm not going to buy

352
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,080
another toothbrush bro. I'm not going to buy. Would you sell you're not going

353
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,240
to sleep again? I'm not going to buy a bed, so all the stuff that i sell i can

354
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,240
buy stuff that i'll use in the next minutes. So you've used like a and you

355
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:52,300
I would I would also sell your hair right. I wouldn't sell my hair man. No,

356
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,740
we're going to die with dignity. Yeah, sorry, shit.

357
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:00,640
I okay, sorry that maybe to be asked me to say what your hair they begged for

358
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,380
me to donate my hair when I got a haircut in Boston. I was like this.

359
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,380
They said fuck that fuck you bro. Every time you can't take my beautiful hair,

360
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,540
beautiful cancerous, walking around with your hair, they have to cut a certain

361
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,100
amount of hair off of your head in order to donate it. Yeah, so they try and

362
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,780
upsell you. They'd be like oh you want it this short. You know if I cut it only

363
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,280
It's five inches shorter, you can donate it.

364
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,740
Like, what the, I don't want five inches shorter.

365
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
What are you talking about?

366
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,940
My high school had the biggest hair donation drive in the state, or in the country.

367
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:30,940
Yeah.

368
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,180
Because the biggest hair, it was the Pantene Locks of Love.

369
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,020
It was a pep rally that we always had to fucking go to.

370
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:39,660
If you skipped it, you got in a shit ton of trouble.

371
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,740
And we had to watch every single girl in the school cut their hair.

372
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:47,380
And it got so bad that every girl was bullying girls for not cutting their long hair.

373
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:51,760
that would have been the most incredible experience of all time for a young boy

374
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,820
with a developing fetish. Definitely

375
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:55,400
definitely

376
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:03,600
every single girl in your school is cutting their hair hair cut in front of

377
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,300
you and the and you're watching in an audience, a crown you're cheering.

378
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,900
There's a teacher whose whole job was pep rallies at the school. This is an

379
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:14,020
entire job. So he wasn't a teacher at all. He was an English teacher, but it

380
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,660
he was mostly there because he loved pep rallies and he loved this Pantene

381
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,200
beautiful links thing so much, and I think that Salina Gomez said good job

382
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,060
and that was big. Big news at the school with Salina Gomez saying great job

383
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:31,080
cutting off all that damn hair. She got big news. She got yeah. There's news

384
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,680
about her recently. She had a face looked weird in a new photo. That's

385
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,740
that's hardly news to me. That's not much. That's what we consider news.

386
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:42,780
Now that's what is, you know, breaking Salina Gomez is stuns in new photo.

387
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,620
because it's the news. Now I never donated my hair that she stunned

388
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,020

00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,460

390
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,860
she got stunned and then her face got a

411
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,480
neti pot and guys I used to use neti pots all the time. I use it this time,

412

because I've been sick for like a month now. Use the neti pot this time. No dice

413
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:16,180

466
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,040
fucking you. They do that at Dallas barbecue. Also, what's that you never

467
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,800
been at Dallas barbecue is in doubt. No, it's in New York. Oh shit man. I

468
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,680
they had I went past that place before they had a desus and marrow.

469
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,280
Collab what happened to these guys, I'm going to desus and marrow. I think

470
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:03,720
there's a serious gap that we might be able to fill in pop culture. Now the

471
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,360
desus and marrow are not doing this shit anymore. Yeah, let's talk to

472
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,720
break out of barbecue. Are that did they get did they I think that they

473
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,400
beefed and then they split they split. Yeah, yeah, which is sad as fuck. What

474
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,200
if each of us tried one of us each tried to pair up one of us got was tried to

475
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,720
be the new part of the new duo with desus. I want to try with marrow to see

476
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,720
see who the real star power was. Then we parent trap them. Oh snap! Yeah. We do a... A deer

477
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,800
and a marrow trap. A deer and a marrow trap, yes. How would we do it man? We'd say you

478
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:38,580
guys should... Well there would have to be fireworks, yeah. We'd have to bring them,

479
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,400
you know, exactly like the parent trap. How do they do it in parent trap? There would

480
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,320
have to be fireworks and stuff. How do they do it in parent trap? Oh the parent trap would

481
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,960
be a really good D&D thing. That would be a great one. That's a good idea. How did,

482
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,520
do you guys think parent trap would have worked with your parents? No, because my parents

483
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,880
have been to get definitely not mine. Definitely would not have worked,

484
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,380
because what they went to the same pool, it would I mean let me it would have to

485
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,220
be a trap. It would have to be a literal spike saw trap where, if they didn't

486
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:07,720
marry each other again, they died yeah and even then the trap was more of the

487
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,520
parent suggestion yeah, hardly a trap, a parent idea yeah, just imagining the

488
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:16,880
saw trap parent trap where it's like hello. You split up and you heard a

489
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,120
little boys Felix yeah thirty years. That's what most of the

490
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,480
movies are about

491
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,060
thirty years ago. A little boy, a little boy got his heart broken. That's a old

492
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:31,000
fucking picture, bro. That is try. I recognize that one, but that was me and

493
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,220
I was a red dude and I'm never ever. Why is this actually from yesterday and

494
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,280
Caleb was wearing a mask?

495
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:39,700
So what I'm safe, who gives a fuck

496
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,980
I'm really conscious about my safety. I couldn't find it because it doesn't it

497
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,340
doesn't exist man. Yeah,

498
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,660
it's not racist to say that you're not the golden. I thought you thought he

499
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,460
said it's racist yeah, that he was calling his racist like he always does

500
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,660
crazy. He calls you racist a bunch. He calls a lot of me man. Yeah, he's never

501
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,620
called me racist once you must be doing something racist. I'm sorry. I showed up

502
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,300
in a sombrero. That wouldn't be racist. That would be that would be

503
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:13,380
cool. That'd be yeah a tribute. Well, I had a shirt on that said I'm Julio and I

504
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,580
was doing this

505
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:22,600
popping shots. I and I'm sorry. That's okay. You were being that mouse. Speedy

506
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,360
Speedy. I was a tentacle.

507
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,760
Do you guys want to see? Okay,

508
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,260
let's do it. So, you know, I've been doing this art shit for some time now.

509
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,760
Yeah, I thought that when you showed up with the glasses and the wig, I thought

510
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,360
you were being Andy Warhol for a second.

511
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,660
First of all, I didn't show up with either of them. Put them on when I got

512
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,960
yeah, I know, but that's what I thought you were doing now, dude and a warthog

513
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,900
more like guys, fuck, I don't like him guys. You know he used to cut his wig

514
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:53,560
and then would show back up with a longer wig at the barber shop. He wore a

515
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:58,300
way he wore a wig. He was a wig cut and then would show back up with a longer

516
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:03,420
wig and get that cut to pretend like he grow it. He used to paint food. He

517
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:07,980
painted soup. He would nowadays he would have an incredible job at Amazon. Yes,

518
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:12,380
thumbnails me food on so whole food before I started this art shit. This

519
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:17,220
different chapter of my life where everything has changed for me. I thought Andy Warhol,

520
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:23,380
stupid piece of crap, ruined art, made it all about food. Art used to be about amazing girls,

521
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:28,700
and now it's about fucking bullshit food and flowers and shit. And I hated that shit. But

522
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:34,660
now I have moved to a world where modern art is so fucking amazing to me and I'm loving

523
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,380
performances and concepts.

524
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,380
Consent?

525
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:42,260
In a way that, and consent. All my stuff is about consent. If you look at any of my paintings,

526
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:45,680
This is about consent. This is about consent. That's just what I do now.

527
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,320
Yeah. What about this one?

528
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,620
That one is definitely about consent.

529
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,620
Okay.

530
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:54,860
Yeah, because it's the little things that count with consent. That's what that means,

531
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,060
too. That's why that little ass painting is that.

532
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,060
Oh, the little one. I see.

533
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,060
Yeah.

534
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,060
I thought you were pointing to the member berries.

535
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,060
Member consent.

536
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,060
I remember it.

537
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:07,180
Member consent. This is planet consent, Mars. But here's my modern art for today.

538
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,180
Okay.

539
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:15,180
Guys, my modern art is Patrick because he's my sunshine. Wow. Give me a smile.

540
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:26,260
I'm not a modern art fan. I think you flopped, bro. You flopped completely.

541
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:32,360
That's my art for today. Upside down cup. Okay, I don't have a fucking painting. I didn't

542
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:37,220
have a painting because I woke up and I had to move my air conditioner to the fucking basement.

543
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:41,520
freestyle a haiku right now. Freestyle haiku about Patrick being my sunshine. Yeah, okay,

544
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:52,860
that's going to you are my sunshine. My only my only sunshine Patrick, you are brilliant.

545
00:33:52,860 --> 00:34:03,660
Hold on wait. Start this one. You are brilliant. Okay, friend. Wow. Oops. I can do haikus all

546
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:08,360
day man. I belong in a different country. I guess that counts as art. They should extradite

547
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:14,760
me to Japan because I'm so good at haikus. It's criminal how good I am. I showed their

548
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,640
shit up in a crazy way that I'm not even from their country. How many times have you, you

549
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:24,400
did a haiku again, you did a haiku recently. I'm about haikus. I'm about that shit. When

550
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:31,660
did you do a haiku last on the other planet? I'll do another one right now. Okay. Cameron.

551
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:44,180
friend. That's five. Oh, hold on. Wait. Yellow face. Son. I think you're thinking of me again.

552
00:34:44,180 --> 00:35:01,460
Oh shit. Wait. Yellow shirt. Amaze. Amazing son. With a big ass dick. Wow. Yeah. That

553
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,700
that was good. Yeah, that was a good one. That was a good one. So yeah, so I

554
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,100
promise that for the moon I'm going to have some installation, which now

555
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,140
nowadays I'm off of watercolors. I'm off of acrylics. I don't do this charcoal

556
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:19,660
shit anymore. I am an installation artist. Oh, what the hell did you just

557
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,740
do? The dropper he's filled his fell asleep, spilled his phone. You better go

558
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,940
better job better go get your next phone bro. You look like a piece of popcorn.

559
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,980
me. Yeah, kind of look like a pop in what way I saw a lady today that you buttery

560
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,900
with Joe Steeves.

561
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,300
Buttery smooth

562
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,900
damn. Do you think that you could fucking pick up a girl at the movie theater

563
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,400
while the movie is blasting loud as fuck war scene from say I would put a fire

564
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
alarm and then

565
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,940
carry her out. Yeah, I'm saving her life. I would pull the fire alarm and then I

566
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:57,200
would be walking out and I'd be I'd be flexing my muscles when I was walking

567
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,320
out and I'd be like, if I catch the guy who pulled the fire alarm, ruin the

568
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,940
screening of fucking Napoleon, I'm gonna rip him limb from limb until he screams

569
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,940
for mercy. And I'm like, "I'm not gonna stop!" And I would. I would go...

570
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,460
'Cause I don't stop. Yeah. You know what? I'm thinking,

571
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:12,900
maybe before that, if this doesn't work, if

572
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,140
I'd pull the fire alarm, do that,

573
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:19,480
if this doesn't work, I'd be sitting in a screening of Napoleon, and then right

574
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,820
when the movie starts, go, "Oh, I thought this was Napoleon Dynamite!" That's

575
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,460
what I'm saying. Try to make a girl laugh so hard that she comes home with

576
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:29,760
it work. Hey, where's Pedro and the girl with the bracelet?

577
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,240
Where's Uncle Rico? This is what the movie theater would sound like right

578
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:35,560
ready.

579
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,240
Hey Napoleon, give me some of your tots

580
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:47,200
yeah, and then we should do that. We should go to mystery size three thousand

581
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:51,720
at I would do I guess what you do is you go to Napoleon. You go Dan, this

582
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,300
shit's boring. It's so boyish. I wonder what the Barbie is for Napoleon like

583
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,300
Barbenheimer, there's doing a barboli and what's the barb part yeah, exactly

584
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,860
and I asked the girl for advice. What do you want to go see the bar part of

585
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,100
barboli and I'd say that

586
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:09,420
I'd walk up. I type girl. Can you tell me you want to go see what the bar part

587
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,020
of barboli and is it like a regal where they have like the reclining chair? So

588
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,980
like you're like tapping her, but you she can't you tapping the chair and she

589
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:20,100
can't tell because it's so soft yeah yeah and I'd say let's go see Priscilla.

590
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,820
Oh, it's Priscilla. I

591
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,260
a trillion. I creep up behind her and I'd say you want to see Priscilla.

592
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:30,440
Do you want to see Priscilla? Do you want to go into a different? So it's

593
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,260
romantic AF.

594
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:35,460
That's about that's what that movie is about is real. It's about romance and

595
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,380
it's about falling in love with a girl. I'm trying to think about seeing a girl

596
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:41,640
and falling in love with her. Have I why there's so many movies named after

597
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,580
girls man Priscilla, Barbie, man, only or Barbie, where are the guys, Sarah

598
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:51,860
Sarah Silverman program, yeah, saving Sarah, so saving Sarah Silverman, which

599
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:57,180
I would save her so you would save her from Zionism. Now I'm trying to sunshine

600
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:59,980
could be a girl. I would save her from her boyfriend. Man, would you guys marry

601
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:05,780
a girl named sunshine? Maybe I would marry basically any girl with legs. I

602
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,620
was asking my girlfriend these hypotheticals last night and

603
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:16,060
it was it was like hypotheticals with very, very poor signal, like very poor

604
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,020
caveats

605
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:23,340
like what would you fuck Peter Dinklage if he was tall?

606
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,060
That's a good caveat. Peter Dinklage is good looking man. Just stuff like that.

607
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:32,420
The height is not a problem for me. Yeah, no, not for me either. If there's any

608
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,380
little people that listen to this shit, your height is completely fine with me.

609
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:40,180
I don't even register. I don't register. I don't register most details about any

610
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:43,380
person. When I look at them, I look right through them and I think about what I'm

611
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:47,820
I dream about tonight, big or tall, nobody matters to me. No one at all one

612
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,060
looks like you're all just

613
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:54,660
a sidewalk or I'm looking up at the sky. Every single person in my vision looks

614
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,500
like super hot. Yeah, my whole world looks like super high. I want to shatter

615
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,380
you glass style, turn you into millions of bits of pieces. Oh yeah, I want to

616
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,500
slow mo crouch down, throw my gun up in the air,

617
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:12,140
been around. I want to play that game again, grab the gun, shoot you, throw the

618
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,180
You all should come over and play VR this week.

619
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,180
Dude, I want to play VR Superhuts so bad, bro.

620
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,180
We should do that.

621
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,180
Oh my god.

622
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,180
Have I ever made you play my fishing game?

623
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
No.

624
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:26,180
That I used to be addicted to? I used to be addicted to fishing in Korea.

625
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,180
Really? That's amazing.

626
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,180
There's a Korean game, or at least it takes place in Korea,

627
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,180
where they put you, it's a VR game,

628
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,180
they put you in real Korean fishing spots

629
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,180
and you can watch YouTube while you catch fish.

630
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,180
Wow.

631
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:40,180
And so I would put on videos of guys playing blackjack

632
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,220
and I would play fishing until four in the morning every night.

633
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,060
I've been seeing there's like people who are using, I think it's the new

634
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:53,380
Quest, and it has like a camera so you can do your dishes and watch YouTube at the same time.

635
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,820
That would change my life. You've never done that?

636
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:58,020
You can't watch YouTube and watch dishes?

637
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,420
Watching it on the headset. What do you mean?

638
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:02,580
Everywhere I look, it's not a dish anymore.

639
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:05,060
Where are you looking while you're washing dishes, bro?

640
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:06,100
I'm looking down at the dishes.

641
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,140
You're going like this.

642
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,460
But everywhere I look, the video is still there.

643
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:14,000
no, they should do it. Where I completely they should do taking a picking up a

644
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,180
plate and turning around to scrub it. What are you doing? Well, I'm turning to

645
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,160
the the rack

646
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,320
to put it on the rack. They should do augmented reality games for chores that

647
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,840
she would maybe get it done. We faster on fucking you have to kill the aliens

648
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,560

649
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,520
now. Please don't make the bad.

650
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:38,120
I would have like a cod zombies. It would be like Nazis in my house and

651
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:40,580
way. Be like we are putting dust on his book.

00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:47,860
Get out of here, you damn Nazi zombies. Nazi fucks who love dust. Stop!

653
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:53,140
He puts crumbs all over the microwave. That's what the game would be called,

654
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:56,700
Dusty Zombies. Yeah. I do that, man. You do the dishes. Dude, it makes your

655

659
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,360
less than anybody else's jizz. Probably the worst jizz on earth. Yeah, it's the

660
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,580
worst. Well, you want jizz that you want on plates. Yeah, but then you got to

661
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,860
you got to give him money to for his likeness. Do you need if you're can you

662
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:28,220

00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,540
just got to do a like kind of a knock off and it'll be yeah, Jeremy Ron. Yeah,

664
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,640
exactly guys got to the easiest name switch of all time and jizz washer or

665
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:37,400
it could just say

666
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,260
it could be like an unnamed man's come who I really do like the idea that it's

667
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,040
that it's like a like Wolfenstein's future Nazis that just that they're

668
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,160
making whatever it is they're just dirtying your house and trying to get

669
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:54,080
you to or like just a one really annoying guy who's like I bet I bet you

670
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:58,440
can't vacuum the floors. You fucking stupid bitch. I bet you can't clean the

671
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,320
toilet today.

672
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,560
make me do it. What one really like put my brother in a permanent implanted

673
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,440
ship in my brain, where I see this guy every day of my life permanently. The

674
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,160
first thing I see when I wake up is him be like I bet you can't go to the

675
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,760
grocery store. I can show you fuck you fuck you David David look at you

676
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,840
sitting on the couch instead of going to the grocery store. How do you shut it

677
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,840
off, though you don't David Holt

678
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,560
you have no if you can shut it off, you're never doing your choice man. It

679
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,040
has to be and then your girlfriend when you wake up has to be roasting you to

680
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,160
and your girlfriend gets back, you're so bad at sex. Yeah,

681
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,400
having it on while you try harder.

682
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,220
That wouldn't make me come. Shut up, David. David, shut up. Who are you

683
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,520
talking to? She doesn't know who you're talking to, but you have the headset

684
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,720
on. You have the headset, you're talking to David.

685
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,420
I think that this is a brilliant idea. Yeah. I think that the thing is

686
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:56,240
about everybody complains in... The big problem in Korea and Japan is that

687
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,600
people play video games way too often, especially in Korea. People play video

688
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:05,200
games for like 24 hours straight. So we need to turn life into a video game.

689
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,100
My life is like a video game. My video game is like my life. You gotta try hard

690
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,300
to beat the stage. Trying hard to beat my wife. Not like beat, but like a boss.

691
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:17,900
Like in a boss sense. Yeah, like she's like, "Trying hard to clean my knife."

692
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:23,000
Oh, yeah, exactly. "When I am doing the dishes." "Nasty's got the dust all over

693
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,000
like this.

694
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
My dish is...

695
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,840
Trying hard to beat the girl, like in a boss lane.

696
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,400
You're resorting to beating women.

697
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,960
It's about what the song is about, video games, beating stuff.

698
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,920
You're turning the song into a beating women song.

699
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,920
It's not about beating women.

700
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,480
Yeah, it is about beating women, but in the terms of like Bowser.

701
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:43,400
If I say I'm going to go home and beat Bowser, people don't freak out.

702
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Yeah, exactly.

703
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,400
They're not like, "Bro, you can't beat Bowser."

704
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,400
This is why they call him Bowser.

705
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,640
Is Bowser just an animal?

706
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,200
Your wife's name is Bowser?

707
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,680
No man, Bowser's a big lizard, a turtle.

708
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,480
I mean he's a turtle. He's a some he I think he's some dragon combination.

709
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,320
Yeah, dragon turtle. He's a dragon slash turtle. He's a dragon turtle. He's a

710
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,620
large. That is his that is his species and what's a Koopa a turtle Koopa Koopa

711
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:10,680
is not a type of Koopa. That doesn't make any sense, bro. Golden M&M. You're

712
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:14,440
a poop. Take a break. Golden M&M. Why don't we take a musical break time?

713
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,240
I'm going out. Why don't we take a musical break? What do you mean with the

714
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,920
new song from OJ the alien OJ the alien. I can't wait to hear what OJ cooked up

715
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,360
for the sun. Did OJ pop off this? I think OJ might have popped off with wait

716
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:34,020
first of all this album cover is crazy. It's fucking amazing. He looks so happy.

717
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:39,960
Where is he? The mall, the mall and the song is called OJ the alien sunshine of

718
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:45,140
the mall in the sunshine of the mall. Now that I'm thinking about it, that

719
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,740
would have been such a good sample flip

720
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,240
but let's

721
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,240
Let's answer it guys.

722
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:54,240
It's OJ the Alien

723
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,740
And I just won a goddamn court case, y'all

724
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:01,240
I'm going to the mall with Dr. Dazzle

725
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:04,240
We're about to go on a male shopping spree

726
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:05,740
OJ the Alien

727
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,740
Me and Dazzle are going to the mall

728
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,240
Gonna get shoes and basketballs

729
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
We're gonna play hoops with the sun

730
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
Oh my god, it's lots of fun

731
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
Go to the mall in Beaverton

732
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
Bought everything but I'm not done

733
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
Gonna go to Best Buy, look at all the Blu-rays

735
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:28,240
I love the beat.

736
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:35,240
I love the beat.

737
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,240
I'm the number one TV commercial guy of all time.

738
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,240
Oh, Dr. Dazzle, it's your turn.

739
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Kick it!

740
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,240
Me and Osher rolling up in the luxurious G6

741
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:51,240
I make a beeline for Victoria's Secret

742
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,240
They told me I was blinged but I'm sure they didn't mean it

743
00:45:55,240 --> 00:46:00,240
I got the Groucho Marx glasses on and a green wig, yeah

744
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,240
And I'm dressed like I'm on safari

745
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,240
the

746
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,240
the

747
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,240
the

748
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:10,240
the

749
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
the

750
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,240
the

751
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,240
the

752
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,240
the

753
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,240
the

754
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,240
the

755
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,240
the

756
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,240
the

757
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,240
the

758
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
the

759
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:37,240
I guess Dr. Dazzle is at Horrorcore this week.

760
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Yeah.

761
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,240
Kind of a weird song to do the Horrorcore angle on.

762
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
What?

763
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
Wait, B-Lack's back?

764
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
Wait, Belak's back?

765
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
On this track

766
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,240
OJ Dazzle, V-Lack 2

767
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,240
Shopping spree and then some food

768
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,240
Spencer's gifts and journey shoes

769
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,240
3 of the cards I got for you

770
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:56,240
Ready to buy anything

771
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,240
JC Penney, wedding ring

772
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,240
Sampling a chicken thing

773
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
So much fun our day will bring

774
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,240
Dazzle always tempting me

775
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
Changing room where friends can see

776
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,240
Different flavors underwear

777
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:10,240
Wow his thing has zero hair

778
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
Think that was an epic fail

779
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:16,840
The jail prison is where I belong, hanging out all summer long.

780
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,840
That's right y'all.

781
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:25,040
I spent all the money that the court paid me on a shopping spree with my male friends.

782
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,040
Oh!

783
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:29,040
This is the best day of my life.

784
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,040
I don't ever gotta look at my dumbass kid again.

785
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,040
Oh, she has a kid?

786
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,040
Fuck you, Venus.

787
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,040
Venus. Oh, I forgot.

788
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,040
Peace.

789
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,040
Damn!

790
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,040
Wait, that was the posse cut of the summer, man!

791
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,420
that might be a summertime class. It was a summer hit. That was a summer hit.

792
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,600
You're about to hear that number. Yeah, they didn't hear that on tick tock. I

793
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:54,380
liked how it had to do with the sun. We need to do with the sun and OJ songs to

794
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:57,320
pop on tick tock. Yeah, I think this one is the one that's gonna. I think that

795
00:47:57,320 --> 00:48:01,720
this has a serious potential for a tick tock. I think I gotta speed it up. I

796
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:04,560
think we gotta speed it up. So it's a little bit faster voices. I'd be way too

797
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,160
high man type. They already have high voices. You can just do change tempo on

798
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,900
not all three of them are very high voices. You could change the tempo. Oh

799
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,760
true and just make it go

800
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,600
and then yeah, the thing could be like when I'm talking to a mouse

801
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,180
when I'm talking to a mouse at the club or when a mouse is

802
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:26,340
on to tick tock. They say like mouse core. Exactly. I wouldn't be like what

803
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,900
I'm talking about. So be like mouse core. They call it mall core, though,

804
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:32,900
to this small core x mouse core, this core crap they got going on on these

805
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,920
fucking apps to drive me out of my mind. I know I can't stand it, bro.

806
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,380
They got this one either. They got this one with the blade runner guys. Yeah,

807
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:43,260
or the guy from that robot core. It's called quarterly core core core. It's

808
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,420
called what yeah, and it's basically what if you had a thought about how sad

809
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:52,060
your life was and what if life was truly banal? Wait, what what are you talking

810
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:54,780
about? Basically, life is, but dude, you wouldn't get it because life is

811
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:55,300
nothing man.

812
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,620
Just about the banality of life

813
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:05,500
core core core core core core. It may pull up core core core core core video

814
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:11,060
at Cork. No, you want to see this. You do ban. This is what Gen Z is doing. Gen Z is

815
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:16,560
now called the Doomer Generation. Please do know because of this, not the Doomer

816
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:20,260
Generation. No, very much the Doomer Generation. I choose life and it's about

817
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:23,840
men's mental health. I choose fucking life, man. I don't want this shit. I'm so

818
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:28,300
interested in analyzing Gen Z's psychology. Wait, no, just Google. Why are

819
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:29,580
you going to take time to find it?

820
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,700
Oh, what the hell is what came up and we want a YouTube video. Yeah, we should

821
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:38,500
probably just look up a YouTube clip of Korkor. It's not the same thing. TikTok and YouTube

822
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:44,300
are different, bro. It's video. But it's so fucking silent. The best Korkor experience.

823
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:58,500
It's... Okay, this is TD Bank Korkor, I guess. Wait, that's a great-ass song. Wow. But he's

824
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,500
crying. That's why man.

825
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
We've laughed at all the good things that have happened since.

826
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
[Music]

827
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
[Music]

828
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,500
Corkor is about touching each other in front of Jimmy Fallon.

829
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,500
Then I get to the end of my life.

830
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:12,500
[Laughter]

831
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,500
Bro,

832
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,500
this is Corkor, Jimmy Fallon, and Theo Vaughn?

833
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,500
I guess.

834
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:20,500
I thought it was like Blade Runner and shit.

835
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:22,500
[Music]

836
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,500

837
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:26,500
[Music]

838
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:30,500
Tommy Shelby. Is that Tommy Shelby? Tommy Shelby vibes.

839
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:34,500
I'm tearing up a little bit. This is already so sad.

840
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:38,500
Not only did I miss out, could I miss out on caring about people?

841
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:42,500
No. Dio, please God. I missed out on feeling probably a lot of the love that people had for me.

842
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,500
Bro, Pacliachi vibes.

843
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,500
Wait, who's that though? Is this from olden times? This core?

844
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,500
It's from an underwear commercial. Yeah.

845
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:59,540
helicopter's landing. I really feel like we don't all comedian because the sad

846
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,620
clown aspect.

847
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:05,140
Okay, we don't need to be watching this. I don't need to watch any more. We should

848
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:08,220
just make I think I fully understand. Yeah, wait, let's go to the line. Let's

849
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:11,380
make some core core right now. Yeah, we need to look up core core background.

850
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,820
Yeah, we need a core core background song. This is about to be this is going

851
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:19,180
to pop in a fucking crazy way. No, it is that song by Duster.

852
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,700
yeah stratosphere or whatever yeah duster stratosphere is good or like a

853
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:27,180
fucking Giles Corey song or something yeah.

854
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:33,860
Wait is about to go crazy. I guess the album all right Patrick we're going to

855
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,260
wait. No don't pick this one. It's what is what is that one scroll down?

856
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,220
Because this is the full album. You can just go to the time stamps.

857
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:45,620
No go up just play this. Okay, this is good. You look lonely. I can fix that

858
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:46,340
one hour loop.

859
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:49,380
Okay,

860
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:54,900
So then it's like slow fade in on me right?

861
00:51:54,900 --> 00:52:01,500
Sometimes it feels like in the modern era we're so disconnected from all the different connections

862
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,700
that we could have.

863
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:11,780
And also it feels like the food at restaurants isn't as good as it used to be.

864
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:14,480
And the music has gotten louder.

865
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,480
Look up the sound wars.

866
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,480
(upbeat music)

867
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:19,040
- Okay, now cut to one of these.

868
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,920
Cameron.

869
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:21,740
- Oh, me?

870
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,580
- Yeah. - I thought you were

871
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,420
going to Pat.

872
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:24,240
- Okay.

873
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:29,040
- The sandwich I ate the other day gave me indigestion

874
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,880
so bad that my whole chest felt like

875
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,440
it was jumping out of my chest.

876
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,900
I feel like I can't even eat turkey ham anymore

877
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,360
without the nitrates going into my system

878
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:42,200
and just totally bubbling me.

879
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,040
I feel like I got bubbles in my stomach and chest

880
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,040
Almost every day I wake up, walk into the train station,

881
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,360
I feel this (gurgling)

882
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,960
I shouldn't have eaten that turkey or that ham, man,

883
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:52,860
or the turkey ham.

884
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:57,040
This stuff is destroying our men and our women.

885
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,040
- I've developed-- - Mostly men.

886
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:01,200
Men usually eat more cold cuts than women.

887
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,920
- On average, on average, okay.

888
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,760
I've developed an adult gluten allergy.

889
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,720
I never thought it would happen to me,

890
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,000
but here I am, close to 27 years old,

891
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,880
And the only bread that I can eat is sourdough.

892
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,040
Sourdough's good for breakfast.

893
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,480
And it's good for sandwiches.

894
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,760
But I can't eat Hawaiian rolls anymore.

895
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,600
Just the other--

896
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,620
Which is one of my favorite savory breads.

897
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:27,040
Just the other day, man, I was cleaning out my humidifier.

898
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,860
It had a heavy mineral scanning, scaling.

899
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,420
Mineral scales were collecting

900
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,160
onto the humidifier's heating element.

901
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,500
I soaked it in a solution of vinegar and water

902
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,880
for about 15 to 20 minutes,

903
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,600
and I started to scrub it with a soft brush

904
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,420
so as not to damage the element.

905
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,720
I was rinsing the brush under the sink

906
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,680
so it wouldn't just have vinegar residue and minerals in it.

907
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,560
I flicked back the bristle.

908
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:51,480
The vinegar shot straight into my eye.

909
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,480
And you know, when you think about

910
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,440
how men are treated in society nowadays,

911
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:05,280
every single, the way that women make us feel

912
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,680
is like we always have to act like Howie Mandel.

913
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,520
We always gotta be thinking about

914
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:15,320
putting a rubber glove on our heads and doing Bobby's World impressions and

915
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,280
talking like gizmo.

916
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,520
But I don't know if I can be Howie Mandel every day.

917
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,400
I don't know if I can make a deal or no deal.

918
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,960
I don't know if I can be the host of America's Got Talent like that.

919
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,040
I don't know if I could have a podcast where I talk to celebrities like David

920
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,840
Spade and ask them about stuff that happened 20 years ago.

921
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,340
Man,

922
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,520
Hollywood has failed us.

923
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:40,960
Chicken Run 2, Donna the Nugget,

924
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,040
will not be showing in theaters.

925
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,280
Straight to streaming.

926
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,560
Netflix, lose out on billions of dollars of box office.

927
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,760
Can't watch Netflix.

928
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,640
Girlfriend's grandma watches it every day.

929
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,600
Locks us out of the account.

930
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,840
I feel like, what's life worth living

931
00:54:55,840 --> 00:54:57,200
if I can't watch The Crown?

932
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,200
The killer.

933
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:02,720
- And I'd be sitting in my room just thinking to myself,

934
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,120
the way that society right now

935
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:07,240
is treating these Marvel movies is terrible.

936
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:15,240
They tried to set up a new, entirely new franchise type thing with Kang and Paul Rudd as the Ant-Man

937
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,540
and it's like nobody even wants to watch it anymore.

938
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:23,560
It's like nobody even is, everyone is just confused, but there's hours of lore that you

939
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:24,560
can look into.

940
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:28,120
Thor Ragnarok, thought that was the funniest fucking movie I've ever seen in my fucking

941
00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:29,120
life.

942
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,800
Yesterday I spent about an hour and a half downloading every Fantastic Four comic ever

943
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,240
published to my hard drive.

944
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,800
About 40 gigabytes.

945
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,800
Holy crap.

946
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,800
Go to copy it onto my iPad.

947
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Select all the files.

948
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,400
Drag them into the iPad on the Finder interface.

949
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:47,600
What do I see?

950
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,600
No progress bar.

951
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,100
Impossible to tell how long it's gonna take.

952
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:54,000
If the copying is stalled,

953
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,700
ended up having to use AirDrop.

954
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:57,800
AirDrop 40 gigabytes of PDFs.

955
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:58,700
Oh.

956
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,800
Took me quite a long time.

957
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,100
AirDrop.

958
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,700
What is it? Is it Bluetooth? Is it Wi-Fi? I never learned.

959
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:08,860
Something completely different doesn't affect it doesn't compress files at all or affect their quality

960
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:13,460
So it's actually ideal when transferring files from a Mac to an iPad and these women nowadays

961
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:18,120
They want you to do all these kind of new type of sexual things like eating the butt from the back

962
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:22,980
They want you to they want you to put you there. Let me eat it from the front

963
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,980
Let me eat the butt from the front

964
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,620
Let me make the but I don't like the front

965
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,020
I don't like the back all these girls want you to do doggy style nowadays

966
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:34,080
So just normal missionary instead of normal mission girl. I want to sell I want to look into your eyes

967
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,080
I want to look at you. I want to have a real connection.

968
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:43,080
The doggy style, also your butt cheeks are too big and the cushion is really whittling down my length.

969
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,080
I'm going to be completely honest.

970
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:50,080
Nowadays women would rather start a OnlyFans than go with a guy to the costume store and try on different costumes

971
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:52,080
and have a kind of makeover montage.

972
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:56,080
Nowadays, what happened to montages?

973
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,080
Men don't get makeover montages anymore.

974
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,080
I lost my way to the exit gate.

975
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:06,480
these flushable wipes, I use them 40,000 probably wipes over the course of a

976
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:10,160
couple months. I use about 10 wipes per butt cheek every single time I take a

977
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:16,880
shit. Get a call from my landlord, "Your bubbling disgusting crap is coming out

978
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,640
of my sink downstairs. Have you been using wipes?" I say, "Yeah, they're flushable."

979
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:26,880
He says, "That's an oxymoron." "There's no such thing as flushable wipes." I said, "What

980
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,880
What about dude wipes?

981
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:30,460
Dude wipes not even flushable, man.

982
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:36,840
We have fully extincted the spotted lanternfly.

983
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,420
Why?

984
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:43,480
We sit around, we tell each other, you know, you see a spotted lanternfly, you stomp it.

985
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,480
They're gone, man.

986
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,060
They're not coming back.

987
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:47,140
That's our fault.

988
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:53,480
With the stress that men have nowadays, it's like, it's like jizz is depleted.

989
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,360
It's like men don't even have enough.

990
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:59,660
stress that men are going through it's like they can't even develop jizz.

991
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,280
Nowadays men

992
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,220
don't even produce a liter of jizz or they don't even...

993
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,520
Nowadays men only produce a tablespoon of jizz. When they do develop it

994
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,800
it's spongy and yellow.

995
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,680
Exactly. Because they're depleting because of our zinc.

996
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,580
Because zinc is depleting from the

997
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:18,440
the American diet. Society laughs and jeers at men nowadays who are

998
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,800
the golden M&M.

999
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,720
It's not accepted to be a golden M&M anymore.

1000
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:28,440
Nowadays your boss shows up to work dressed up like Slowpoke Rodriguez and says, "That's you."

1001
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:33,560
That's you. You look like Slowpoke Rodriguez. You look and act like Slowpoke Rodriguez.

1002
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,200
They haven't yet invented a haircut that can make your hair longer.

1003
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:45,000
Wait, that was actually... Why did that put me in the worst mood I've ever been in my life?

1004
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,920
Why did that make me feel so fucking awful, man? Wait, life is over. I don't want to fucking die.

1005
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:55,300
Oh God, no, I like eight minutes that we just did of that. That's what would it

1006
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:58,760
that's how I would feel. I could do a full episode of that. I really felt

1007
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:02,920
kind of crazy being in that zone. We were on some magic. I was trying to

1008
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:06,980
think of what is even the thing is my life's amazing. I want to be real and I

1009
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:11,800
don't believe any of that shit. So when I'm in that zone, it's okay. Wait, so

00:59:53,160 --> 01:00:00,060
guys this morning. I jumped up out of bed. I didn't brush my teeth until later

1029
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:02,860
because I didn't want to brush them before breakfast and my breakfast tasted

1030
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:03,380

01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:25,280
Oh, my birthday is 113 on the luckiness scale.

1036
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,360
My friend is in town from Mexico and I love him even though he lied.

1037
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,280
Nowadays, you can be a golden M&M.

1038
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,600
They show you the golden M&M store.

1039
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,240
It's a true thing.

1040
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:40,000
My favorite restaurant closed for renovations.

1041
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,400
And guys, two days ago, they reopened.

1042
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,900
I finished my fruits and vegetables puzzle the other day,

1043
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,200
and I left with the last piece for my girlfriend

1044
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,360
and I got to see the happiness on her face as she put it in.

1045
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,860
Wow. I put a new I got a new soap for the shower.

1046
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:59,080
And guess what it smells like?

1047
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,880
It smells like apple matcha.

1048
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:01,700
Actually, it's my girl.

1049
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:04,120
I've been using my girlfriend's soap in the shower.

1050
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,460
I washed the sheets that Julio slept on and now they don't smell.

1051
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:10,600
My dog had fleas and then we gave him medicine.

1052
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,760
Wow.

1053
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,200
I took medicine the other day, allergy medicine, and it helped.

1054
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:21,040
My cat has been doing a new thing where he does a wall run.

1055
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,320
He tried. I pull the string on the wall and then he runs on the wall

1056
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:27,380
after the string. I can fly.

1057
01:01:27,380 --> 01:01:29,960
The graphics on video games gets better every year.

1058
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,320
The electrician that actually never mind that said the electrician

1059
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:37,560
that's working on my apartment currently, his dad almost passed away from COVID.

1060
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:40,460
There will be no more war in the United States.

1061
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:43,960
The war's over.

1062
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,960
Yay!

1063
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,880
The McRib is back at McDonald's this month.

1064
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:53,500
I got to see my favorite color when I looked at my closet.

1065
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,640
Today, I dressed up like a lion.

1066
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:59,600
Last night, I had sushi.

1067
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,800
Me too, but a different sushi.

1068
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:03,140
It was worse, but I still liked it.

1069
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,740
What I had clam chowder for dinner last night.

1070
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:14,060
and my girlfriend got it for me from her work and I looked at the ingredients for it and

1071
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:18,160
the clam chowder actually had coconut milk in it and that made me upset but the fact

1072
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:21,400
that my girlfriend got me clam chowder was awesome!

1073
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:24,620
This year my mom told me for Christmas she's gonna buy me alcohol.

1074
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,620
Whoa!

1075
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:30,040
I got a, I tried a new drink last night!

1076
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,780
It's water with ice!

1077
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:37,380
Last night I ordered a cocktail at a bar and it came with a rim made of chocolate.

1078
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,660
My toilet rim ain't stained.

1079
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,540
I did all my chores in the house.

1080
01:02:41,540 --> 01:02:42,540
Me too.

1081
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:46,500
And every single one of my chores is pretty easy.

1082
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,780
I'm considering buying a new air fryer.

1083
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:49,780
I got 500 likes.

1084
01:02:49,780 --> 01:02:50,780
I'm just kidding I didn't.

1085
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:51,780
Whoa!

1086
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:52,780
That would be amazing.

1087
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,580
I'm imagining 500 likes on Cameron's picture.

1088
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:56,580
Me too.

1089
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,580
Oh yeah, go Cameron!

1090
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:58,580
Nice post Cam!

1091
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,100
My teeth haven't fallen out yet.

1092
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:01,100
Never will.

1093
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,100
The IRS sent me a letter.

1094
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,100
And I ignored it.

1095
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,100
I also ignored a letter from the IRS.

1096
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:09,100
And a letter from Con Ed.

1097
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,100
It's Cyber Monday today, y'all.

1098
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:13,100
Wheeee! The deals are abound.

1099
01:03:13,100 --> 01:03:15,100
My student loans are destroying me.

1100
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,100
No, they're not. Me too.

1101
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:19,100
Until they review my plan.

1102
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,100
My plan that I applied for. What's your plan?

1103
01:03:21,100 --> 01:03:23,100
My income-based repayment plan.

1104
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,100
I'm letting a lot of things go to collections.

1105
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,100
Yipee!

1106
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:29,100
I have no medical problems I'm aware of at the moment.

1107
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:30,660
but that could change. I

1108
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:31,620
scared

01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:36,940
it again. No, I think my mom said I might have a rare heart condition.

1110
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:43,300
Really? Yeah, I don't remember. She said you love too much. You have a rare

1111
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,860
heart condition. It says here on your chart. I've been looking over the test

1112
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:49,860

[beep]

1140
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:29,660
This is the story of Neptune, a Planet Report by Cameron Fetter.

1141
01:05:29,660 --> 01:05:35,660
Once upon a time, 30 astronomical units away from the sun,

1142
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:39,660
there was a blue and icy planet named Neptune.

1143
01:05:39,660 --> 01:05:43,660
One orbit, Neptune woke up and felt depressed.

1144
01:05:43,660 --> 01:05:47,660
"What makes me special?" asked Neptune.

1145
01:05:47,660 --> 01:05:51,260
I feel so average.

1146
01:05:51,260 --> 01:05:54,260
Don't worry, Neptune, said the sun.

1147
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:55,260
You're very special.

1148
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,380
For example, you're an ice giant.

1149
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:04,020
Your distance from me means that you're dark and cold, covered by frozen, icy materials.

1150
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:07,420
A big whoop, replied Neptune.

1151
01:06:07,420 --> 01:06:09,140
That doesn't make me unique.

1152
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:11,540
Uranus is an ice giant as well.

1153
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:14,220
Well, maybe your surface doesn't matter.

1154
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,540
It's what you're like on the inside that counts.

1155
01:06:16,540 --> 01:06:24,100
have a rocky core," the sun said. "Yeah right, so does Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Uranus,

1156
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:29,580
and probably Jupiter and Saturn too. I knew I wasn't special. You're just making me feel

1157
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:34,700
worse. I think I'm going to kill myself." And Neptune opened its desk drawer with its

1158
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:40,340
hand, where it kept its revolver and used its hand to put the gun to its atmosphere.

1159
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:45,340
"I'm done doing this with you!" screamed the sun in anguish.

1160
01:06:45,340 --> 01:06:50,340
"It seems like every rotation you threaten to kill yourself. You think you have it bad?

1161
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:53,340
Look at Pluto. The poor guy isn't even a planet anymore."

1162
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,340
"Even my suffering isn't unique," sighed Neptune.

1163
01:06:57,340 --> 01:07:01,340
"I think I get it now. I was so concerned with being special,

1164
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:06,340
but what's actually special is that I'm so similar to everyone else in my solar system.

1165
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:09,340
It's about togetherness and family."

1166
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:14,340
That's right, said the sun. I'm glad you came around.

1167
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:16,340
Coming around the sun? Yeah.

1168
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:20,340
Coming around me, I mean. The me. The me. Let's eat.

1169
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:23,340
And the planets all started in on their Thanksgiving dinner.

1170
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,340
Moral.

1171
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:29,340
The moral of the story. Okay.

1172
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:32,340
There is nothing interesting about Neptune.

1173
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:34,580
