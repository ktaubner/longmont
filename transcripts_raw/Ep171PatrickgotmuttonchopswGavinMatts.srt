- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:12,480
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,000
- We're recording now.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,880
- I had a pull in spring energy before this.

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,400
- Don't talk about anything except

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,120
your fucking face right now.

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,360
I know that you knew we were recording today

11
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,240
and you were like, I wanna have something,

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,880
I want the whole episode to be about me.

13
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,720
- I have a new joke.

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,360
- And you started shaving your face.

15
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:29,200
- It's not true.

16
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:34,660
I want to look like I have syphilis. I'm gonna get much I've been watching

17
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:39,280
Deadwood. You look like a guy that fucking Sherlock Holmes punches in slow

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,800
motion.

19
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:46,000
Why is that? I reuse my bit from before the I do it. You look like you're you

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,100
just got off a fucking crabbing boat. He was better the first time. Yeah, I know

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,700
He does look like a... You look like you're a Deadliest Catch.

22
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,200
Yeah, you look like a Deadliest Catch. I've never heard that.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,960
We're here with Gavin Matz. What up?

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,040
Gavin Matz is with us, a beautiful, beautiful friend and stand-up comedian.

25
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,040
And Patrick, you know we really wanted to make the whole episode about him.

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,040
And I only have one joke for everything.

27
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,040
So I have to reuse it.

28
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,540
What possessed you to do this?

29
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:22,540
I was looking at the... I was trying to grow out the beard long and then I looked at it

30
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,940
and I was like, it's too big.

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:27,340
- And then you're like, what's the visual gag here?

32
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,180
- Yeah.

33
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,020
- But how did it make this--

34
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,860
- I did, I had it like Lemmy.

35
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,680
I had it like connected and then I fucked it up

36
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,340
and then just like--

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,180
- RIP.

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,420
- Yeah, exactly.

39
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:38,260
RIP Lemmy.

40
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,460
It was my tribute to him.

41
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,020
- So it's not his anymore.

42
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,860
- True.

43
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,680
- Did he kill himself?

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,520
- True, I could take it.

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,360
- Who?

46
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,180
- Lemmy.

47
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,020
- He probably killed himself with alcohol.

48
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:46,860
- Yeah.

49
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:47,680
- Lemmy.

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,520
- I feel like he, I think he overdosed.

51
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,780
- Alcohol's not a funny way to kill yourself.

52
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,620
- No.

53
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,440
- No, it's probably a fun way.

54
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,940
I find it funny. What do you think the funniest way to kill yourself is?

55
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:58,120
Funniest way to kill yourself? Probably a bunch of, probably a balloon.

56
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,480
Yeah. Probably heroin. No, no. You guys don't think that's funny?

57
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,040
I mean, I think, what's his name? The politician guy on TV. Bud Dwyer.

58
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,720
Bud Dwyer, that was funny. I guess it's pretty good.

59
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,720
Yeah. Okay, okay. What do I have about, but this is trademark. Nobody fucking

60
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,800
and steal okay, okay, slip my wrist in a ice bath, full shrinkage. Oh

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,240
whoever finds me there's a one last laugh

62
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,120
like I gave it all his diet dicks.

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Yeah, that'd be a bad version of like the Whitney Houston like bathroom photos

64
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,280
of after you're dead. You just like your little tiny, my little

65
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,520

66
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,080
I usually have to use this one. Yeah,

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:53,240

76
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:29,000

142
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,640

181
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,280
all time. Oh, I just think we got to start putting categories on these pedophiles. Of

182
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,520
course. I just I'm tired of the of the umbrella of putting them all under the same umbrella.

00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:30,040
Right. Yeah. So what are the different types? Sex pedophile, just a regular guy. You know,

199
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,040

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,560
book is really gay. That's like

201
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,180
I feel like a great Tom Sawyer. I think the rest of the book is me fucking

202
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,020
Huck Finn,

203
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,020
bending him over the fence

204
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,120
and me yelling I'm Huck in it.

205
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,320
I've been falling asleep and having dreams about succession where I'm in one of the

206
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,320
brothers.

207
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320

Dude, the dad loves me.

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,320
You're the only son I like.

215
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
I'm Caleb.

216
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
That was your impression of him?

217
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I'm Caleb Roy.

218
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,320
Do that again?

219
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,320
You're the only son I like.

220
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,320
What?

221
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
You're the only son I like.

222
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
That's what he sounds like.

223
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
Listen up, kid.

224
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,320
You're the only son I like.

225
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
He's got a transatlantic accent.

226
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,320
You're the only son I like.

227
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Listen up, kid.

228
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
You're the only son I like.

229
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
He's got a transatlantic accent.

230
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,800
accent. You're one in a million. You're one in a million. You know that accent, that transatlantic

231
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,600
accent, they did it because they were trying to combine British and American accents.

232
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,520
So it was easier to hear on the radio.

233
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,760
For Universal, but now they're just like, whatever, where we make the most money is China.

234
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,560
We'll just dub it.

235
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,920
So you think they should do a new one that's between American and Chinese?

236
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,760
Transatlantic, I don't believe in this.

237
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,520
no

238
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,240
the other i mean it's technically still we could just

239
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,420
combine chinese and american accents and i mean technically is still across the

240
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,400
atlantic

241
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,040
the long way you might be the biggest genius in the world but he's also

242
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,760
transatlantic phobic

243
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,920
sure he's like i hate

244
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,480
i hate jimmy stewart

245
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,040
he did not even know i don't understand it sounds like that when he was born

246
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:26,800
yeah

247
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,280
the put on

248
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,960
making that up

249
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
That's 1920s gay voice.

250
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
Definitely.

251
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,960
Yeah, whatever the actors are doing.

252
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,960
This is really still people, right?

253
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
No.

254
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
This goes to one guy in Minnesota

255
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,960
and he

256
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,960
sends us money.

257
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,960
Hell yeah. He sends us like $16

258
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,960
and a bunch of cookies that his mom

259
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
makes and they're so fucking good.

260
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
I wish that was actually true. I would love to have

261
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
a benefactor. Oh yeah.

262
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
We have a lot of benefactors.

263
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,960
No, I want a benefactor. I want a one rich benefactor.

264
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,440
I want a big Saudi prince who's obsessed with us.

265
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,240
Probably little, but yeah.

266
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,400
You guys don't have? You guys didn't get?

267
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,640
No. You have a benefactor?

268
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,560
No. I want to have a big titty lady that I leave all my money to.

269
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,160
What? You want to have a benefi?

270
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Sure.

271
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,600
What's a benefi?

272
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,480
I'm guessing that's the opposite of a benefactor.

273
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,680
Benefactor's a guy.

274
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,800
If you're the benefactor.

275
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,480
You're thinking it's benefactress.

276
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:36,120
No. Yeah. No. A benefit? A benefit. Oh, whoa, chill. I think they're all benefactors. Yeah,

277
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,320
but I just need, I need somebody to be giving me money for no reason. Yeah. Take me out.

278
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,520
You're looking for like a sugar dad. Yeah, but I don't want to fucking kiss him. Well,

279
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,920
you don't have to with most of them. What? Is that true? Yeah. Some of them just walk up to me.

280
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,960
They're bad at conversation. Yeah. I can deal with that. It's kind of like,

281
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:01,800
they're like a lot of there's a lot of sugar daddies they're just trying to like

282
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:12,800
grind it out like a runescape just small battles in 99 99 persuasion skill no

283
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,000
rich guy would want little old me though I'm so ugly you don't know that I think

284
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,880
I think that's what they like. I said I'm so because I think kids are ugly.

285
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,320
Well I think if you were hot they wouldn't want to be your sugar daddy.

286
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,080
They'd want to fuck you. Oh true. I think they're looking for like ugly people who...

287
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:34,840
I'll financially dominate someone. Yeah. How much money do you have? Hell I could do that.

288
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:41,600
How much right now? Yeah. Like 12 grand. Can I take that? No.

289
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,640
Can I take that? I'm not very good at this. But did you get a boner a little bit?

290
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,560
I also feel like that's not a lot of money to admit that you have.

291
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,560
Yeah?

292
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,560
What are you talking about?

293
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,560
You're lying.

294
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,560
I'm not lying.

295
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,560
You're lying.

296
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,560
What are you talking about?

297
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,560
You didn't lie.

298
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,360
I might as well just say a number and you said the amount of money you have.

299
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:08,200
Like 12 grand.

300
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
That's so much money.

301
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
You're rich.

302
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
You have to leave.

303
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
That's a down payment on a hundred thousand dollar house.

304
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,200
I'm sick of having this one percenter in here.

305
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,640
on a hundred thousand dollar house.

306
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,160
You could buy a twelve thousand dollar sandwich with that.

307
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,960
Yeah, you could buy twelve thousand dollar anything.

308
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:26,280
I know he's taking us to Salt Bae's place after this.

309
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,000
True, or twelve thousand one dollar sandwiches.

310
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,360
Would you rather have a twelve thousand dollar sandwich or twelve thousand one dollar sandwiches

311
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,360
Patrick?

312
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,720
I'd have twelve thousand one dollar sandwiches because I could resell them for a few dollars.

313
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,440
I don't like the keeping the wine thing. People have a wine and they're like, "This is from

314
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,280
the 80s." I don't think the 80s was a great wine making decade. I feel like the expensive

315
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,600
stuff's older, right? It's older? It's like the 50s, right? I don't remember. They had

316
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,980
a big chart on the wall when I worked at the liquor store as a giant and it showed you

317
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:04,200
all the years that you're supposed to drink wine from and all the years you're not supposed

318
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,480
to drink it from. Yeah, because it's all crazy. This tastes good. It's from when people didn't

319
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,120
have rights. Well it's funny because there's like what like spots in the

320
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,360
middle where it's like clean white hands yeah it'll be it'll be like like oh this

321
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,960
is old enough that's delicious or like this is like great but then there's a

322
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,760
spot in between it's like this is disgusting do not drink it. Well yeah

323
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,280
it's like wine the wine is only really good every like six years yeah depends

324
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,520
on like the weather yeah it's crazy yeah all this crazy stuff like the weather

325
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,440
now is climate change the wine is it's all warm yeah it's getting better every

326
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,240
year. What if that just makes it good now? What if like climate change is like only

327
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,560
happening so wine can get better? I don't think that's the reason it's happening

328
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,440
but I do think we'll see a lot of really good things in the next couple of years.

329
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,320
Yeah I think food will get really good. We gotta put our heads together and invent

330
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,160
something. Mm-hmm yeah okay for what? Wine in a can. Need to patent something?

331
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,560
I'm a twenty seven year old man. I need to patent something. I need to trademark.

332
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,480
I mean you're talking to basically an invention master right now.

333
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,580
We do a lot of work with inventions.

334
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,440
I would say maybe like a...

335
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,720
I need to go back in time and invent candles.

336
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,240
That would be fucking killing it.

337
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,240
That would be good.

338
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,880
Even the guy who made candles didn't like get anything out of that.

339
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,200
He did it for the love of the game.

340
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,660
Yeah, well he was getting like a ton of like royalties or whatever and then someone else

341
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:26,520
invented birthday candles and that like fucked him over.

342
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,360
they're like this is technically different yeah yeah what about the

343
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,560
candle maker when like electricity started popping off he's just sitting

344
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:39,520
there like fucking bullshit I'm burning my house down it doesn't smell this is

345
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,960
bullshit well yeah where's the disgusting slime the last time where's

346
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,840
the good nobody's gonna buy this the last candle maker that's a a24 film yeah

347
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,120
that guy kills he's losing his mind yeah yeah I bet those first light bulbs had a

348
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,060
smell to it. It's Willem Dafoe. Oh my god, if you imagine the trailer he-

349
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,780
Oh my god. The ending shot. The music is going to the rhythm of him like chopping up candles and stuff.

350
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,280
And then the ending shot is he blows out a candle. He explodes. Oh my god. Yeah, yeah.

351
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,620
Ooh, after he explodes like some kind of like- Oh, he's a terrorist. Oh yes. He's a fucking terrorist, yes.

352
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:18,020
Everybody's like, oh we're gonna go hang out at this place with electricity.

353
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,060
Bro, my boy Edison's down the street right now. He's like, is he? He's trying to assassinate Edison.

354
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:27,780
yeah yeah and he's using like it be there are guns, but he's using dynamite yeah

355
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,260
like what he's that he invented the candle and he also invented the like the

356
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:43,620
cup on a string telephone the horse carriage yeah yeah just like every

357
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:49,860
yeah he's getting fucked bow and arrow - they're like paving the roads he's got

358
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:55,540
cobblestone. He's like no. He invents everything one day before the better thing comes up.

359
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:04,020
Yeah. I finally got my patent. Ah fuck! Yeah. On cobblestone on the road. Cobblestone's already

360
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:10,980
like been around. He didn't have the intuition or the foresight to just be like are you homesick?

361
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,180
Here's what Ireland smells like. He writes it on the candle. True. Well actually candles started

362
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,880
coming back when they started when people yeah because everyone's homesick now

363
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,260
yeah yeah so here's a candle company that we're all gonna get ads for now

364
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,680
homesick candle yeah yours smells like fish yeah yours smells like the the rust

365
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,300
tinge for a fishing boat so they may water they make those for theme park

366
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:42,680
rides would you say Manchester by the sea yeah they make scented candles for theme

367
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:46,520
park rides. You can get like the E.T. ride at Universal in a candle. Whoa.

368
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:53,560
And like... There's one it's a kidnapping. Yeah. Kidnapping at Small World.

369
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,200
He stole a child. Whoa, that's what I thought that ride was. Never been on it, but I

370
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,080
thought that that somebody told me once that those were like lost kids. Oh yeah.

371
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:10,080
E.T. the ride? Trapped there. No. Small World. Oh, Small World. You ever been on E.T. the ride? I've never been on Universal. Those are all children's lost souls. Yeah, yeah, they're

372
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,520
they're trapped. I mean that's what animatronics are in general. They're

373
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,320
souls trapped into a machine. I kind of believe it's true. A lot of people

374
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,640
died and that's why I mean you ever watch this new Nick. You ever watch

375
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,840
this new movie. You ever watch this new Nick Cage movie where he's he's like

376
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,000
a Chuckie Chucky's Wonderland. Oh yeah, he's Wonderland and then there I've

377
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,560
only seen the trailer, but there's a good I was like I'm not going to watch

378
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,960
this shit. I get it looks cool. There's just there's the one line from the

379
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,800
apparently the girls like he's not trapped in there with them. They're

380
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,940
trapped in there with him. I heard about that. So various they couldn't

381
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,020
they couldn't afford Nick Cage. He doesn't speak a single word in the

382
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,540
movie. He's he's the main character. He has no lines and then at the end

383
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:54,300
they have a needle drop of free bird, which

384
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,740
millions of dollars. He doesn't wait. He doesn't speak at all in the so

385
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:01,040
they could afford to get him in the movie, but they could afford to make

386
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,820
it. Yeah, and then they like it had to that's what people are saying like

387
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,000
probably money like like an insanely expensive like like it's just like they

388
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,380
were like finishing out the budget with like the most expensive song of all

389
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:15,320
yeah, they're like yeah, we'll get in the cage, but he won't talk that's so

390
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:20,280
sick for a speaking role crazy three birds only song Patrick listens to

391
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:27,560
you. That's a visual joke. You look a little confetti did yeah, yeah, we

392
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:31,720
paid a great yeah, my show in Portland last week. There's a guy came to the

393
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:38,040
he was a PA on pig nice and one of his jobs on the movie was every day he told

394
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:41,840
me every day he had to bring a new rotisserie chicken to Nick Cage's room

395
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:48,240
at his hotel. I was like this guy's awesome that's sick no wonder Willy's

396
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,440
Wonderland couldn't afford him. They didn't have fish.

397
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,440
- I'm doing Mr. Bean all the fucking things.

398
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,980
- You got full chicken wings.

399
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,540
- Yeah, that's why Mr. Bean never talked to you.

400
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,380
- He's full.

401
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,740
- You need a hundred more pounds for me to talk.

402
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,580
- Yeah, exactly.

403
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,500
- Can I get a hundred more pounds?

404
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,720
- Dude, rotisserie chicken a day,

405
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,420
that is a grown man's diet.

406
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:12,260
- Oh yeah.

407
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:13,080
- Yeah.

408
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,700
- I haven't had one in a minute.

409
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,540
- Dude, I'm on day--

410
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,740
- I'm honestly, I'm thinking maybe find a spot

411
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,420
that has rotisserie chicken after this.

412
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,620
I worked at a deli for like three months and one of my jobs was to do the

413
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:25,340
rotisserie chicken, so I was like I can never eat this again.

414
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,740
Everybody always says that but then they always worked at like the most delicious

415
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,180
place ever. Safeway. Yes, you like Safeway. People will be like oh yeah I worked at

416
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,380
Cold Stone I can never eat the ice cream there. It's like dude it's just I mean

417
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,660
like why? It's ice cream. Of course there's like huge amounts of milk and like

418
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:47,020
disgusting shit in it. It's still good. It's ice cream. The one I will say I never want to

419
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,140
work at McDonald's. You haven't even worked there and you're oh you're saying

420
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,860
because you don't want your food ruined. I do feel like if you

421
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,620
see the process that they make food with at McDonald's and you're like

422
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,780
surprised, I think you're stupid. Yeah, well I mean just like I don't

423
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,820
want to know how long like the chicken McNuggets sit in the little heater.

424
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:14,020
That's what I mean if you're like you should assume that it's all like three

425
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,660
years old and made from mold. If I see it, it ruins the magic. I'm not getting

426
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:23,380
surprised. I go search out the videos.

427
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,580
Every few weeks a tweet will go viral. It's like this is how

428
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:32,140
they make the food at Burger King. They take a burger out of the freezer and

429
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:38,060
people are like whoa. It's like yeah come on. It's obvious.

430
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,540
The Little Caesars one went viral but it's like how the fuck else do

431
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,740
think you get a $5 hot and ready. Yeah. They had like two like a drill that had

432
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,380
like a big spin thing like a big like whisk attachment. It's called hot and ready it's

433
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:56,680
not hot and ready and fresh. Yeah. Yeah exactly. It's like a hot and good. Shake things literally

434
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,480
you fucking idiot. Two adjectives that's all you get. Well I fell asleep watching that

435
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,660
McDonald's movie where the guy eats 30. Super sized meat. Yeah I fall asleep I start dreaming

436
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,780
I'm fucking this guy while he's housing down Big Macs.

437
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:16,340
That one is that's a movie so many so many they used to show us that in health

438
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,500
class. Yeah, they would show it to like probably like once every other week and

439
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,780
health. I go I'm gonna go get some McDonald's right now. That's exactly

440
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:27,860
what I mean. Yeah, right. Funniest thing is there's a guy who so there's a guy

441
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:32,740
who did like a rebuttal documentary that was called like super lie to me or

442
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,540
something and he goes to McDonald's every day, eats every meal there but loses

443
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:42,500
weight and he's like, "See, it's because I'm, you know, McDonald's is healthy but

444
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:47,560
he's eating like a salad and like a tonic water and that's it."

445
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,460
Every single meal and it's like, yeah, you're eating 800 calories a day, of

446
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,860
course you lose weight. Yeah, and he's like, "See dude, McDonald's is

447
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,780
fucking beast." I love when there's anything happens and then someone's like,

448
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:01,980
I'll do the other thing and then they're like defending a company.

449
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,980
Yeah, that's exactly what it was.

450
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,580
Yeah, same with Doug Benson.

451
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,180
Yeah, he was defending.

452
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,060
He was defending. He was defending McDonald's too.

453
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,620
I know, but then it's like, whoa, have you ever talked or listened to Doug Benson?

454
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,340
Right.

455
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,140
Shit sucks.

456
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,420
I'm anti-weed now.

457
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,540
Yeah, that is kind of how that movie makes you feel, because also it's like this guy,

458
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,500
his brain has been so rotted by weed that he honestly thinks that like people want to watch

459
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:33,860
just like an hour and a half of a high vaporizer and I've been on getting dug

460
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,220
with high I did like this like 420 show and that's like the last time I smoked

461
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,260
weed because I was like I can't be around this guy. You were like I hate getting dug.

462
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:53,260
I hate weed. Look at what this weed is. I hate getting dug dude. I'm never getting dug again. I got dug hard. This guy's dugging me out here.

463
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,460
I look like a goddamn fool.

464
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,660
I know a lot of people have gone on that show and had like full-blown panic attacks. They

465
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,660
get so fucking high.

466
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:07,580
That used to be a form of entertainment. You'd be like, you'd want to get so high that you

467
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:09,260
just like, man, I was so high.

468
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
Yeah.

469
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,940
That's crazy. And that was like our lives.

470
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,940
Yeah.

471
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,460
But that was before all weed was evil.

472
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,460
Monetization.

473
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,860
Yeah. Like every dispensary has like the most evil strain of weed of all time.

474
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,860
Yeah.

475
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,460
It's like GMO weed or some shit.

476
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,140
- If I buy weed, I mostly just buy it

477
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,820
from the gas station near me.

478
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,660
- Yeah, you get like a--

479
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,500
- 'Cause that I know is--

480
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,420
- You get like the Thanos Runtz pack.

481
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,460
- Is guaranteed to be bad weed.

482
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,500
- You're like, I need some shake.

484
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,340
- Exactly.

485
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,540
- I can only smoke shake.

486
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:41,100
If I smoke that gas, dude, I'm like--

487
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,940
- I can't.

488
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,540
- I grew up on gas.

489
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,500
Like, I don't smoke that BC Bud.

490
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,740
I don't smoke that Seth Rogen.

491
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,820
- You gotta try shake, dude.

492
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,620
- So that's why I was like, I'm done with weed.

493
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,700
I smoked it all.

494
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,540
- You gotta try shake.

495
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,620
- Everyone's like, weed is crazy.

496
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,940
I was like it's always been crazy. No, I took like I did just hit in the bong one

497
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:01,860
time and I took I took eight t3s Tylenol with codeine and I sat in an electric

498
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:07,380
drum set for four hours just playing one with one hand my other arm was in a

499
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,300
sling and just playing like don't don't like I and I was laughing because I

500
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:17,780
thought it was the law and order theme song. I was like this isn't productive.

501
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,780
That's gonna ruin my life.

502
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:28,780
It is so awesome when you're like, when you're a kid and you're getting like just insanely high and then you sit down at like a keyboard or like a drum set or something and you just think you're Dr. Dre.

503
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Like I feel the music dude. I understand the 808s now.

504
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Dude I used to like, I used to get like, like one, like pretty much like one nug of weed and then like not break it up and just like smoke that through a can.

505
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,780
So cool dude.

506
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,780
That was, that was the only time I ever felt good getting high.

507
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:46,820
- Smoking through cans.

508
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,660
- Smoking through an apple.

509
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,500
- I did apple.

510
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,900
- Making a third bong.

511
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,500
- Oh dude, I did apple way too long.

512
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,260
- Like the Shasta Cola three liter bong.

513
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,100
- Yeah.

514
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,540
- That shit, I made so many of those.

515
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,980
- We used to smoke out of a guy that I knew at a hookah.

516
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:00,820
- Smoke out of a guy.

517
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,640
- And we would do it.

518
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,480
(laughing)

519
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,820
- With the weed in his mouth.

520
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,300
- No, come on, are you serious?

521
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,140
You think I'm sucking dick?

522
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,960
- That's nasty.

523
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,180
- No, smoking out of a hookah,

524
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,860
the straightest thing you can do.

525
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,740
- Bro, the human body doesn't even work like that.

526
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,580
- It doesn't, you don't even know about it.

527
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:16,340
so long for it to go yeah what do you think this is one of those bugs bunny cartoons?

528
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:20,100
well dude it goes into the belly of the cat. You let the smoke blow out of bugs bunny's cock?

529
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,940
it's the best way to smoke it i heard i heard that on getting dug

530
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,540
with hi just calling it getting dug is

531
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:36,660
dude because the name is backwards yeah he's so high he can't even spell a couple of junkies

532
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:45,660
down at the Myrtle Wyckoff stop getting dug. I was so dug dude. Me and my boy Nebby

533
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,220
we we rolled a bunch of joints like 30 joints and we're going to a concert so

534
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,260
we put them in our fucking boxers so we could sneak him in but we were real high

535
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:59,100
and then we were in line for Wiz Khalifa and we were just like let's just go and

536
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:05,940
we left. We went and ate food and and watched Looper. We scalped our tickets.

537
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,140
Did you forget about the weed in your underwear?

538
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,340
No, I smoked the rest of it.

539
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,940
Oh, damn. Okay. Sick.

540
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,840
And I'm like, that's what weed does.

541
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,340
Make you--

542
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,240
You miss out on experiences.

543
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:15,740
Yeah.

544
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,940
No, I would say I've never had a single good experience smoking weed.

545
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:20,440
No.

546
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,940
And I probably smoked weed a thousand times.

547
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:25,240
Yeah, it was bad high school weed was the only time I had a good time smoking weed.

548
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,540
It was the best of all time.

549
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:29,240
Yeah, when I was smoking weed during quarantine, it was all dispensary weed.

550
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:29,740
Yeah.

551
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,740
And it made me schizophrenic for months on end.

552
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:32,840
And I was like, what is this?

553
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,800
and I looked it up in the stream is called Durban poison.

554
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:41,220
I was like I can't have this anymore. Yeah, I got over. I got some real

555
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,380
fucked up like good weed at one point and then I was waking up and I was like

556
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,200
waking up like still high and then like going to my

557
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,940
into my bathroom and like barely being able to open my eyes in the morning

558
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:56,900
and then your eyes are like heavy yeah, yeah, horrible. The only time I'll get

559
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:01,340
back on the gas is if Seth Rogan acknowledges me this guy from the same

582
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:05,260
Did my my the for a friend of mine, the shanky guy came into his work. He

583
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:09,420
works at a restaurant and my friend showed him the island boy video and I

584
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,940
said he was like why are you

585
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:26,060
Island boy. What do you want me to ask you for a photo? No, I'm going to show you this

586
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,020
beanie. You have to take stuff in your own hands. You have to make sure certain people

587
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,020
are aware of certain things. I just don't want you to fucking lose touch now that you're

588
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:41,380
all Hollywood. And then that guy told me that the Shang-Chi guy got canceled because he

589
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:46,860
he said like gay people are mentally disabled. He was on like an incel reddit or something.

590
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:52,740
He's on incel reddit. Really? What's his name? Similu. Yeah, he was on like some like incel.

591
00:34:52,740 --> 00:35:00,180
He's a fucking legend. Leave him alone. He's young and then Chinese cultures were very

592
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:04,660
misogynist. You just said he's Canadian. Huh? You just said he's Canadian. He's Chinese

593
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:10,580
as well. You got to pick. You got to pick one. Yeah. No, you can be a couple of things. Trans

594
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:16,980
Atlantic. True. That's true. Trans and Atlantic. Wait, not the main guy, right?

595
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:20,100
Trans people came out of the Atlantic Ocean? What's up? Not the main guy from Shang-Chi,

596
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,620
right? Yeah, the main guy. Shang-Chi was on an incel subreddit saying gay people were like

597
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:31,220
people with Down Syndrome. Really? Yeah. I know you're not telling the truth, but I'm not gonna.

598
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,980
it's true. No, I'm thinking not the guy I'm thinking of the main guy.

599
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:44,260
Okay, the guy from fucking see me Lou. Okay, you got the 10 rings from his dad

600
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:51,700
in the movie. It's it's pretty good. There's some pieces. That's that's a nice story. Come on,

601
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:56,660
come on. You gotta know. I'm sorry. This I gotta see this movie again.

602
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:02,820
I kind of I should have seen it. I didn't even I honestly didn't even know it already came out.

603
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,580
I felt like I just there was there was some

604
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,180
This is very anti-Asian.

605
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:06,420
No.

606
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:07,780
No.

607
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,460
I'm very pro-Asian.

608
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,340
To a fault actually.

609
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,500
Six weeks to get released.

610
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:12,980
Yeah.

611
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:16,660
Like Eternals is like oh like it's out now not really.

612
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:17,220
Yeah.

613
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,420
It's out tomorrow.

614
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,220
I also thought that Shang-Chi was one of the Eternals.

615
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,660
Shouldn't that have been out forever?

616
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,820
Come on.

617
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,780
Dumbass movie.

618
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,260
That's right.

619
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:30,140
Fuck you, Kingo.

620
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,260
You never return my calls.

621
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:37,980
Everybody online, why do you get Jack just to shoot stuff out of his fingers?

622
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
Because he's rich.

623
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
He wants to look good.

624
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,980
That's right.

625
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
His wife's sick.

626
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,660
He should have gotten ten times fatter for the role, I think.

627
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,660
That would have been funnier.

628
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,660
That would be sick.

629
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
That would be so cool.

630
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,660
If he was just like a bowling ball.

631
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,660
Honestly, dude, I bet Kumail 100%, bro.

632
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:59,460
was dude yeah. He got fucking picked out to be a monster. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah,

633
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:03,280
he was just like some nerd. That's why everybody hate you still hates nerds.

634
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,900
Yeah, you know that's how

635
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:10,960
nerd to job, but then everybody's like yes. Now he's a jock. We can all hate

636
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,820
him. You know, nerds kind of had to accept him because he's like they're

637
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,180
well. Yeah, shining. See, I feel like a pro jock. I feel like he just he picked

638
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,700
a bad point in time. Like I feel I mean, I guess I could be wrong, but I don't

639
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,140
see like Kingo being like the next like Iron Man really you know what I mean?

640
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,380
What are you talking about?

641
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,380
Kingo is an iconic character, Kingo.

642
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,820
You don't, oh fuck, you must have not seen the movie.

643
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
You saw the movie?

644
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
No.

645
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,220
I just love Kingo though.

646
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:42,300
Yeah, if they had Kingo in like the first Captain America movie, now that could have

647
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,300
been something.

648
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,300
I think he should be the Hulk.

649
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,300
Yeah, he could be the Hulk.

650
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,420
He would make a good Hulk.

651
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:48,420
We need a brown Hulk.

652
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,420
They need a new Hulk.

653
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,340
Well there's a she-hulk is coming out and she's black I think.

654
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:53,840
Really?

655
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,340
Yeah.

656
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:55,340
She's green actually.

657
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,340
Whoa.

658
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,340
When she's in Hulk form.

659
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,340
The first green Hulk.

660
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,340
The first green Hulk.

661
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,340
I think it's racist.

662
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,340
I think it's racist.

663
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:02,340
You think it's racist?

664
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,340
I don't think black people are angry.

665
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,340
Well the Hulk is.

666
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:09,340
Well the thing about she-hulk is she can't go to a movie.

667
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,340
God damn it dude.

668
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,340
What is it getting to?

669
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,340
What?

670
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,340
Two times in one.

671
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,340
It's been fucking 25 minutes.

672
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
I'm sorry.

673
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,340
I'm sorry.

674
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:17,340
I'm sorry.

675
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,340
I'm sorry.

676
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,600
(laughter)

677
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:25,060
- Oh, that would be problematic.

678
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,900
- No, I--

679
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,080
- Boy, oh boy.

680
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,920
- I don't think--

681
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,700
- Well, let's get to the list.

682
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,180
(laughter)

683
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:33,300
- This is best places to have sex.

684
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,180
You like to have sex, yeah?

685
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,020
- Yeah.

686
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,660
- You strike me as a guy who likes to have sex a lot.

687
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,140
- Sure, I'm a sex addict.

688
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,700
- Yeah, that makes sense.

689
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,860
- I used to cheat a lot.

690
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,060
- Nice, dude.

691
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,660
- No.

692
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,500
Edit that.

693
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,760
(laughing)

694
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,120
- He leaves in the whole thing.

695
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,380
(laughing)

696
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,960
Edit out that part.

697
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,020
- Here's the best places to have sex.

698
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,740
What do you prefer, ordinary or extraordinary?

699
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,180
Nice or wild?

700
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,220
- That's a good question to start out with.

701
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,840
- That is a good opening question.

702
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,220
- Probably ordinary but wild.

703
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,060
- True.

704
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:15,700
- No, ordinary but like the idea that it's wild.

705
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,700
pretending it's wild.

706
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,700
It's like, "WHOA!"

707
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,700
"I need you!"

708
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,700
It's like when people roleplay and they're like,

709
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
"Yeah, we're roleplaying," but then it's like, when they fuck,

710
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
it's just like missionary.

711
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,700
That's like 90 seconds of being like,

712
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,700
"I'm a baby."

713
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:34,700
Anybody that needs a roleplay,

714
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,700
they're always like, "We gotta spice up nothing."

715
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,700
And then they just like,

716
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,700
narrative.

717
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:42,700
What if I wore doctor clothes first?

718
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,700
What if I had them on first for a minute?

719
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:48,000
first for a minute. You're not you're not fucking like you were laying in bed.

720
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,700
Doctor is a fucking that's that guy knows everything about the human body.

721
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,160
He's way but doctors way better. I would not let a doctor fuck me. No dude,

722
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,980
he's going to he's going to feel me. Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to I'm

723
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,720
going to overload my body. What if it feels a lump on my nut? Well, I did

724
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,800
role play as a doctor once and I held an exacto knife up to

725
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:10,480
I'm going to get my Vegas nerve stimulated bro. I don't want that yeah,

726
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:14,740
that's going to I'm going to be surprised. I was a fucking doctor. I

727
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,700
circumcised my

728
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:23,540
number one is bed and here's the top comment. The place I had sex for the

729
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,200
first time.

730
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,400
It was in my boyfriend's house. His dad was gone for two weeks and we had sex in

731
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,600
his dad's king size bed. It was amazing. So I don't use someone else's bed. You

732
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,720
know, I seen I seen I seen a bed,

733
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,880
a screenshot of a bed from Facebook marketplace and it had a kennel

734
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,920
underneath. Whoa. Oh yeah. I'd like to have sex in that bed. Yeah. Under the bed.

735
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:51,920
I'd like to be in the kennel on my computer and not have to have sex. Yeah.

736
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,920
I'm just under there. I got my comic books down here. I'm reading. The door's

737
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,920
locked. The lock is on my side. Nobody can get in. Reinforced steel on top so I

738
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:08,920
can't even feel the squeaking. Yeah. I'm on big headphones. I'm on LiveLeak.

739
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:15,320
Yeah. First place I had sex was a couch. Shout out to my mom's apartment. Nice.

740
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,600
In Mayfair in Wilmington, North Carolina. That couch was so leather. It stuck on my

741
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:27,880
knees and I got a rash. Yeah. It's an old leather couch. Yeah. Was it like peeling too?

742
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,440
It fucked up my knees for a long time. Yeah. It was a cheetah leather couch.

743
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,440
Because you were on your knees the first time you got fucked?

744
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,240
on the couch. Yeah, I was. Yeah, I mixed it up. It was I couldn't remember who

745
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,120
fucks who and it was a coin flip. So, you know, yeah. Peggy, 16.

746
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:53,440
Yeah, where I really hope people are doing it. Seriously, some of these items

747
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,400
are insane. The beach in a pool, we are such a weird generation.

748
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,640
In a pool?

749
00:41:59,640 --> 00:41:59,640
True.

750
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,240
That's true.

751
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,840
Sex in a pool, not good, dude.

752
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,440
No, well, I was trying to play and she drowned.

753
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,480
Yeah, that's the fear, right?

754
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:12,720
She came up, she had water in her nose.

755
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,920
You could put your penis on one of the hot tub jets, that's a pretty good feeling.

756
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Yeah.

757
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,800
Yeah, when I was a kid, I, like, before I ever did any drugs, I used to, like, any time

758
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,160
I was in a hot tub, I just put my, hold my breath, just put my face in front of the jets

759
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,000
for a long time and I come up and it made me really dizzy and I was like, "I'm going

760
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
to do drugs in two years."

761
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,880
That's a good drug, yeah.

762
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,360
And pushing your hands onto your eyelids to see those colors.

763
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,360
Oh, yeah, yeah.

764
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,360
So many things like that.

765
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,360
Oh, my God.

766
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,880
like hold your breath, take a bug, a bunch of deep breaths and then like stand up

767
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,200
and down really fast and you just pass out. No, I used to do that all the

768
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:53,040
addicted to that. I used to get dug on standing up. It was so cool. Yeah,

769
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,840
I can't really like this where I'm saying this is a common one. Yeah, the

770
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,720
bed. This is common. I don't understand how this could be the number one did

771
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,760
This is pretty boring.

772
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,760
Perfect. I mean, are we going...

773
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,760
Is this maybe the 10th?

774
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,760
10 to... No, this is 1.

775
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
We started with the best. Oh, shit.

776
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,760
Yeah. Yeah.

777
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:16,760
It says, "Perfect for being naked."

778
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,760
Nice place to do it. Someone just said,

779
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
"Same." Someone said, "Lie down and

780
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
make love, baby."

781
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,760
"Truly the best sex is in bed. There is

782
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,760
so much room. I have a queen-size bed,

783
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,760
and it's amazing how much room there is to have crazy

784
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,760
good sex in."

785
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:35,840
I guess I've always been any time I've been doing it. I'm like this is bad. We

786
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:40,560
need more room. I need to we need to be in a convention center right now.

787
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,760
Let me read that.

788
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,560
I especially love it when the bed makes sound. And then this one, this one too.

789
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,760
Oh nice. There's another good one, the final one. I don't know. One was

790
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,160
rocking with this comment. You just take out your clothes and kiss the bra.

791
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
Biggs just joined the show.

792
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,200
Yusa!

793
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,200
Yusa just take the clothes off and kiss the brow!

794
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
He should have been one of the eternals, honestly.

795
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,200
Jar Jar.

796
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,200
He would have crushed.

797
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:14,200
He basically was, I mean,

798
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,200
you add all those people up, it's Jar Jar.

799
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Pretty much.

800
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
Can you make a Jar Jar show where he's actually a Sith Lord?

801
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,200
Yeah.

802
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,200
Number two.

803
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,200
Nah, not a fan, bro.

804
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
Too much water, dude.

805
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:31,720
turn the water off. If you turn the water off, it's nice.

806
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:32,900
And then you're cold, though.

807
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,600
But then you feel like a fucking lying down at the top.

808
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,320
Yeah, you feel like an idiot. You turn the- you start having sex, the water's

809
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,740
annoying, you turn it off, and then you're like, we're just in a room now,

810
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,460
and I'm a little wet.

811
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:45,920
Yeah, and then when you pee, it's like still, it doesn't get washed away with

812
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,840
the water.

813
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,940
Exactly, yeah.

814
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,660
When you pee at the end of the sex, it doesn't leave.

815
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,980
No, dude, that's squirt.

816
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:56,120
No, I'm squirting on your leg in the shower.

817
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:00,140
I don't understand the like obsession with like, oh, sexy is wet.

818
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:01,140
Yeah.

819
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:02,140
I don't like being wet.

820
00:45:02,140 --> 00:45:03,140
I like dry.

821
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,140
I like dry pussies.

822
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,140
No, just like, my whole essence is wet.

823
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:08,140
Yeah.

824
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,140
Nobody has ever said my whole essence is wet.

825
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:12,140
No.

826
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:13,140
I swear to God, dude.

827
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,140
People are always saying my whole essence is wet.

828
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,140
People are always saying their essence is wet.

829
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,140

00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:36,140
He is a bit more sexual than I used, than I was used to, but he helped me channel my inner crazy side.

835
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:39,140
One time he convinced me to do this even though I didn't want to.

836
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:42,140

837
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:46,140

846
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,340
would never have sex with an evil angel.

847

From an old lady.

863
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,920
Oh.

864
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,920

865
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,920
Congrats.

866
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,920
That's cool.

867
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:02,920
Call that American Pickle, dude.

868
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,920
Yeah.

869
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,920

Gives new meaning to drive me baby.

871
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,800
Who's, what?

872
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:11,560
Anyone see the Doritos ad?

873
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,600
That's not related to like sex at all.

874
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,600
No, it's just like--

875
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,600
Dude, what's up with these ads?

876
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,000
The Doritos Super Bowl ad was so funny.

877
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,840
No, I think these car ads--

878
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:22,640
I just need to talk about it.

879
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,920
I was 19 and I had sex with my friend's single 47-year-old mom in my car.

880
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:27,920
Oh, this is cancer.

881
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,920
Then three months later--

882
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:29,920
I'm going to tears.com.

883
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,880
I did one of my 18-year-old classmates in the same car.

884
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,880
Whoa.

885
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:37,160
My husband likes to kiss me in the car, but we have never had sex in the car.

886
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,160
That counts.

887
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,160
That does count.

888
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,160
That counts.

889
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,160
Kissing is sex, in the car at least.

890
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,880
number four is beach

891
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,440

I've never had sex on a beach.

897
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360

898
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360

00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
Yeah.

903
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,480
This is a beach just for me.

904
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,040
That's why we had a beach wedding.

905
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,800

906
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,800

907
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,800
That sounds amazing.

908
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,920
Oh, I hope I can do that one day.

909
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,960
Dude, I just don't, the sand, I do feel like I would get sand all in my pubes.

910
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:31,960
Yeah.

911
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,960
Yeah.

912
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,960
And that's like, you know how you go to the beach one time, sand popping out of your...

913
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,600
I don't even like getting sand in my shoes.

916
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,440
- Sand coming out of every hair on your body for weeks.

917
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,540
- Oh my God.

918
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,440
- My mouth completely filled with sand,

919
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,760
stuffed with sand, can't talk, can't breathe.

920
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,600
- I'm on the beach, I'm having sex,

921
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:47,440

922
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,480
- Swallowing so much sand.

923
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,960
- I'm burying my head like an ostrich

924
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,800
while I'm having sex, dude. - Oh my God.

925
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:51,620
- I'm eating so much sand.

926
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:52,460
- It's not even awful. - It's so annoying.

927
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:54,040
- I fucking nut, I look up,

928
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:55,880

929
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:56,840
- Exactly, yeah.

930
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,600
He thinks it's food 'cause he'll eat anything.

00:48:58,600 --> 00:48:59,440
He's eating my cum.

932
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,280

984
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:48,240
this it's fun. That's mostly the pool part that's fun.

985
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:57,440
It's all the fun of sex and all the fun of a pool. You ever been in a goddamn one of those little basketball hoops?

986
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:04,520
I was jumping into the fucking pool. I'm going to ask the ball back and forth with ten friends

987
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,520
and all landing in a pussy.

988
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,040
Got one of those like flamingo like floaties around you just so you can like stay up in

989
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,040
the water.

990
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:11,040
Water wings.

991
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,480
This is some Hugh Hef shit. I will say that. This is some Hef shit.

992
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,480
Alright.

993
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,080
Dude, you know Hefner was every day in the pool. At some point the buoyancy is the only

994
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,040
thing that could give him an erection.

995
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,040
I can see you underwater.

996
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:24,040
What do you mean I can't get up?

997
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:25,040
Yeah, exactly. Check this out.

998
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,040
It's like a water weight.

999
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,800
the water way, just floating, just jumps in the water pool.

1000
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:37,160
Number eight in bathroom. That's where my shit and piss lives. It makes for

1001
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:40,600
easy clean up. It's even nicer if you turn off the light. What?

1002
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:46,360
Bathroom with the lights off? Just pulling your whole like medicine cabinet

1003
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:49,520
down. Yeah. Just destroying everything in the bathroom. Stumbling into the

1004
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,440
shower curtain and then they think you're a ghost and they kill you. True.

1005
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,160
I never done the bathroom. No, it doesn't seem fun and well

1006
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:02,400
I may have, but I mean I'm with a girl now. I'm in a loving relationship now.

1007
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,380
Yeah, I mean you guys met my girl. Yeah, yeah, she's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1008
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,340

1009
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:10,640
when I was just a bad guy,

1010
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,840
there's this girl and we're like we're like making out and then we're like in

1011
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:20,560
New York like walking and we're trying to find a place. It's like two AM and

1012
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,540
and she's like I got to go to the bathroom. So she goes into this random

1013
00:54:23,540 --> 00:54:28,020
bar and then she texts me. She's like come here and I'm like, well,

1014
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,860
there's something going on. Is she okay? So I go into this bar and then I go

1015
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:35,460
and it's like the bathroom's like down these stairs at the back and it's like a

1016
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:38,620
long hallway and then I see her like poking her head out of the bathroom and

1017
00:54:38,620 --> 00:54:43,060
she's like waving me and then she was wearing overalls and and she had like

1018
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,060
and when I get to the bathroom, she has like the overalls kind of slinged off

1019
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,180
her shoulders and she like wants me to have sex with her in the in the bathroom.

1020
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:55,500
Wow, but it's like two AM at a New York bar and we weren't there, you know yeah

1021
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:00,660
and it just as soon as I like get to the door, it's just like stinky. I was like

1022
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,140
I'm not doing this. I never talked to her again.

1023
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:08,940
Ruined with the smell of shit dude. Yeah, yeah, I know that would like she

1024
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,260

1026
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:21,700
pooping in there. And it's late at night, you know, this bathroom's been taken care of.

1027
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:25,420
People are pissing everywhere, doing cocaine. I was the previous tenant, dude. I'd be blowing

1028
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,180
up the bar bathroom, dude. One sip of beer. The nice thing about the bathroom is you can

1029
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:37,540
put the square where it belongs. Yeah. And the shower. Number nine is tent. Oh yeah, I've

1030
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:40,620
I've done this, but I was role playing is unhoused.

1031
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:48,860
There's one comment here from Roger McBeloney. It says, Oh yeah, in a tent in

1032
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:53,980
the woods, that's hot. And then it says, definitely come to a national park.

1033
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:55,880
Hey,

1034
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,740
Roger,

1035
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:02,740
alien man. Let me know if you're planning to come to a national park and

1036
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:07,060

1037
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:12,020
campsite log cabin right about one light on I don't know who lives there though

1038
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:15,780
I'm having sex in the tent next thing I know I'm camping next to the dimensional

1039
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:23,500
kidnap camp next to the pit in the ground yeah I don't have giant shoes I

1040
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:28,700
can kick a whole tent into it the thing about sex is that it's also so dangerous

1041
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:34,700
it's true dangerous sex is the best sex dude yeah on top of a building right

1042
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:45,700
next to a sign that says caution. Wet floor. And a giant vat of oil. Yeah that's good.

1043
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:51,540
Yeah. Volcano. Having sex in Hawaii is a trip. Oh my god. Anytime, any given moment you could

1044
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:57,620
be fucking Pompeii'd. True. Like that fucking guy who's jacking off in the Pompeii thing.

1045
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,620
Oh my God. He touched this thing.

1046
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,620
It's cool that he got his last.

1047
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:03,620
He's the real eternal.

1048
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:06,620
He's outliving all of us and he's just got his hand on his cock.

1049
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,620
Let's be real, that guy was a prankster.

1050
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:09,620
Definitely.

1051
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:11,620
Because you hear an explosion in the distance,

1052
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:13,620
you know, of a volcano erupting.

1053
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:15,620
If you're jacking off, you stop.

1054
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:17,620
If you're not jacking off, you pretend you're jacking off

1055
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:19,620
because you're going to get preserved forever.

1056
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:21,620
If I wake up in the morning, I'd fucking open up my shades.

1057
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,620
His body's shards melting in front of him.

1058
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:24,620
Yeah.

1059
00:57:24,620 --> 00:57:26,620
He's like, "I'm going to be like this."

1060
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:33,820
I if I wake up, I open up my shades. First thing I see is a pumice just just

1066
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:56,760
if someone's in danger, yeah, it's like an instant, you know, like if you can

1067
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:01,220

1078
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:50,280
I just keep sucking my own balls and not acknowledging them at all.

1079
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,280
There's that one.
