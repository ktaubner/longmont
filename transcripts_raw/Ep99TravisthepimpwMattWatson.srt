1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,580
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,120
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,960
(laughing)

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:12,800
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,000
- Matt are you ready man?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,520
We've been talking big shit.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:16,360
We've been here.

9
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,880
- I am ready guys.

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,240
I drank my protein this morning.

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,840
I'm ready, I'm pumped.

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,120
- Oh my God, what kind of protein did you drink?

13
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,440
- Yeah, I drank this high testosterone,

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,440
like testosterone boosting protein.

15
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,960
Cause I think honestly that's probably the best defense

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,440
against COVID right now.

17
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,200
- It's just being so manly that it's scared of you.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,840
- Well, it's proven that the higher your testosterone levels

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,760
are the more protected you are against COVID-19

20
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,920
which is why so many women are getting it.

21
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,200
- Wow, that's insane.

22
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,760
That's why. - Sorry ladies.

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,560
- Why have I been worried about anything?

24
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,400
- Yeah. - Yeah.

25
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,400
- I don't think you guys have anything to be worried about.

26
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,880
- No, I mean. - I got too much tea.

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,920
Yeah, I have so much tea that it pushed all the hair out of my head.

28
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,920
Yeah.

29
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,920
That's true.

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,440
I don't know if that's true though.

31
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:06,760
I think that's maybe like a cope that people have.

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,200
I think that's kind of a lie.

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,440
But people say like, yeah, sometimes you have so much testosterone that it turns you into

34
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,600
a bald gay baby.

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,240
And every guy who is bald looks so shitty.

36
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,240
I actually lost all of my hair because I have too much testosterone.

37
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,360
You know, like there's just so much of this manliness

38
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,920
flowing through me that I lost all of my hair,

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
but you know, it's just a side effect of being so masculine.

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,160
- Exactly, yeah, it's a give and take, you know.

41
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,520
- It just fries your hair from the inside.

42
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,080
- I actually look like The Rock.

43
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:42,520
- All the male thoughts just fizz inside your head

44
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,480
and they fuck up your follicles

45
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,920
and all your hair shoots out.

46
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,860
It shoots out like a darts.

47
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:49,880
- But it's a good trade because like,

48
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,640
yes, on one hand, I have so much testosterone

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,480
that the hair, I don't have any hair,

50
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:57,600
but I also can't cum or get a bone or two

51
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,120
as a side effect of having so much testosterone in my body.

52
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,960
You know?

53
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,880
- Yeah.

54
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,040
- So that's good.

55
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,120
- My hair's gonna be gone in two years.

56
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,320
That's what I'm giving it. - You have two years?

57
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,480
- Me too. - Probably, yeah.

58
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,760
It's starting to thin, I can tell.

59
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,480
Like I look in the mirror, I see it's going up.

60
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,480
I'm like, uh-oh.

61
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm 24 right now, so I'm guessing by 26 it's gonna be gone.

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,960
- Dude, my shit started going when I was like 17.

63
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,600
- Yeah, you were like going bald when I first met you.

64
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,480
- Yeah, dude, God hates me. - Your hair used to look crazy.

65
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,600
Your hair was awesome.

66
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,280
Back when you were like trying to deny

67
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
that you were going bald.

68
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,260
- Yeah, I held onto it for a long time, Matt, don't be me.

69
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,240
You have beautiful hair.

70
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,400
You have beautiful little boy hair.

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,720
- No, no, no, no, it might look like that on camera,

72
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,800
but it's actually very thin and greasy.

73
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,280
- You have little baby hair.

74
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,600
- Yeah, you look so, you have such like tussle-able hair.

75
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,800
I just want to patch you on the head. I'm all sweaty. I went skating so I look like oh

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,560
nice

77
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,960
Patrick just revealed his hair and

78
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:07,380
No, no that was it that was a that was that was in ooh because he was a he's a skater boy and that impressed me

79
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,380
Yeah, are you a skater Matt? I?

80
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:16,920
I dabble when I was in like fourth grade. I I tried skateboarding nice. Yeah, that's the best age to start

81
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,160
What did you start hurt myself?

82
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,160
You hurt yourself in fourth grade?

83
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Yeah, I hurt myself doing what? You go down a hill?

84
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,160
Yeah, I went on a ramp and I fell.

85
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,160
And I smacked my head and I passed out.

86
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,160
I don't want to skate anymore.

87
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,160
And then when I was in about seventh grade,

88
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
I decided I wanted to pick it back up

89
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,160
and my next door neighbors,

90
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,160
they were like a couple years older than me,

91
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,160
they were maybe like 16, 17,

92
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,160
I thought they were really cool.

93
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,160
And I saw they were skateboarding,

94
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,680
I was like, "Ah, fuck, I'm gonna go join them."

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,080
So I got my skateboard out

96
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,920
and I started skating towards them

97
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,640
and I hit a rock, like a little rock,

98
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,000
and it just made the skateboard stop

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,180
and I flew off and I smacked my elbow

100
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,000
and I was trying so hard not to cry.

101
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,560
I was holding back tears and they were all looking at me.

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,720
I just got up and went back inside.

103
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
Since then, I haven't skated that much.

104
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,240
- You haven't hit double boards since?

105
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,960
- I skate a little bit, yeah.

106
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,000
- You should try it when there's no rocks,

107
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,080
there's no pebbles.

108
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,840
Yeah, you should skate on the beach.

109
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,080
Yeah.

110
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,880
Exactly, that's the best spot.

111
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,960
You should try your kitchen floor or something.

112
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,840
They filled up Venice Park with a bunch of sand.

113
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,520
You can just go there now and just fucking--

114
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,680
It's the perfect time, yeah.

115
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
Yeah.

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,640
It's a surfer's paradise.

117
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,560
Exactly.

118
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,280
A ski park with sand?

119
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,400
Yeah.

120
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,840
Oh my God.

121
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,200
Dude, it's awesome.

122
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Go in there with some Johnny Cappahalla 2 board.

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,560
Just fuck that place up.

124
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,960
I don't know what shit you're talking about.

125
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,800
Exactly.

126
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,420
- Disney movie, Johnny Tsunami 2?

127
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,820
- Oh, okay.

128
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,900
- Yo, I've never heard of Johnny Tsunami until this week,

129
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,460
and then it's weird that now you bring it up,

130
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,780
because earlier this week, I was in Ventura

131
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,700
and I had a cocktail called Johnny Tsunami,

132
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,380
and I was like, oh, that's a funny name.

133
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,380
And then now, I'm hearing that name again in the same week,

134
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,900
I'm thinking there might be some kind of weird

135
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,140
simulation glitch going on.

136
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,180
- God damn, dude. - Oh my God.

137
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,660
- Johnny Tsunami broke the damn sim.

138
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,140
- I had a-- - Yeah, that's what did it.

139
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,060
- I had a giant simulation glitch today.

140
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,060
I posted about this, but I went to Dunkin Donuts,

141
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,940
as you can see, and I had a high, I pulled up,

142
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,880
it's a, so far, to the point where I order my drink,

143
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,460
it's a completely normal experience.

144
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,820
I get a cold brew, it's 3.19,

145
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:31,100
but then I get up to pay for it,

146
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,100
and I see that my cashier's name tag says her name,

147
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,660
her name is Meech Creech.

148
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,920
(laughing)

149
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,780
That's what they said and I was like, I had to give my fiance...

150
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,180
- You had to give your ID.

151
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,540
(laughing)

152
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,340
To buy Dunkin' Donuts.

153
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,980
- Is your name also MeechCreech?

154
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,220
- You get 10% off if your name is also MeechCreech.

155
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:03,140
- I was uncontrollably laughing

156
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,740
as soon as I looked at her name tag.

157
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,540
Just like in this woman's face.

158
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,860
And so I had to have my fiance pay for the drink

159
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:19,860
I couldn't even look at it. I had to hand her my card and be like, "You have to hand this to MeechCreech."

160
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,860
My thing is... Oh, go ahead.

161
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:29,860
So that's nobody's name... Nobody's name is MeechCreech, first of all.

162
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:36,860
But also, her first name had to be MeechCreech, because you don't put your last name on a name sheet.

163
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,860
Yeah, that's what I was about to say.

164
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:44,420
I was about to say your last name doesn't go on it so her first name is just Meech Creech.

165
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,420
Meech Creech Wilson.

166
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,900
Or maybe it's like an Ichiro situation.

167
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
It's a what?

168
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,140
It's an Ichiro situation where they put Ichiro on his jersey.

169
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,140
Oh maybe.

170
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,420
It could be an Ichiro situation.

171
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,260
I'm gonna go back to Dunkin Donuts tomorrow and be like excuse me ma'am.

172
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
Is this an Ichiro situation?

173
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,220
Yeah is this an Ichiro situation or is your first name two words, one of them being Meech

174
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:16,100
the other being Creech. You're gonna go back there tomorrow and be like, "Oh, can I, I

175
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:22,060
had a question for Meech Creech," and they're gonna send you to a mental hospital. I just

176
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,660
want to call and be like, "Has there ever been anybody, not even who works here, has

177
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:33,660
there ever been somebody named Meech Creech?" I'm gonna look this up real quick. I just

178
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
I wanna look this name up.

179
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:36,420
- MeechCreech? - Is it M-E-E-C-H?

180
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,860
- M-E-E-C-H-C-R-E-E-C-H.

181
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,500
- It's a catchy name, I will say.

182
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,340
- Yeah, Ryan.

183
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,140
- Oh, I found someone on TikTok named MeechCreech.

184
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,140
- So I also found that earlier because I was like, okay,

185
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,100
to confirm that I'm not just completely going crazy,

186
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,380
I need to see if this woman exists.

187
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,500
But she doesn't have like a Facebook or like an Instagram,

188
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,260
at least not under the name MeechCreech.

189
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,300
but she does have a TikTok @meachcreach.

190
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,580
- Yeah, I thought, is that her?

191
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,500
It's like a girl that looks like

192
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,700
she might work at Dunkin' Donuts.

193
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,140
- Yes, yeah, it is her.

194
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,540
I confirmed, it is her.

195
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,780
- Yeah, her name's Meachcreach, yeah.

196
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,260
- Her name is Meachcreach.

197
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,900
Also, she was the only person in the Dunkin' Donuts

198
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,780
whose name tag was handwritten.

199
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:25,140
Everybody else had a typed one.

200
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,980
(laughing)

201
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:30,260
- They refused to print that shit.

202
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,060
They were like, no, you want that on there,

203
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,180
make it yourself. It's not even that the computer just won't print that.

204
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:42,340
It's not a valid name.

205
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,820
Error. MeechCreech is not a name. Yeah. Got a 404 on that one.

206
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:53,620
Oh yeah man that was um that was fucked up. It's awesome. That's fucking ridiculous. Yeah.

207
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,780
You know Covid, you know these quarantine times got everyone going a little crazy.

208
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:02,260
Yeah how have you been? You just uh you're in LA right? We didn't even introduce him.

Yeah, we're here Matt Matt Watson from Super Mega everyone. How's it going Matt? Hey, it's gone great

211
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,260

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,560
I said who's that handsome man, and how can you sit that out? Well my way into his world?

224
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,600
Yeah, yeah, and then you did you did a good job. Yeah. Yeah, somehow did yeah somebody

225
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:24,520
Yeah, somebody who I know who's a big fan of yours. I guess notice that you were a 14 year old boy

226
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:29,000
It's a it's 14. It's a yeah. It's one of my 14 year old boyfriends that I play

227
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,720
old boyfriend so for boys they could be 19 they could be 14 year old boyfriends

229
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:09,680
no I feel like I'm caught up in a web of lies but it's but I don't have

230
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,880
boyfriends or teenage fuck you guys I was thinking we do have I feel like our

231
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,340
- I think both our, both the fan base,

232
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,040
or your fan base is the exact kind of people

233
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,780
that we make fun of on this show.

234
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,680
- Yeah, yeah.

235
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,480
- 'Cause we go on a website called the Top Tens

236
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,940
and it's all just kids who probably have

237
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:34,920
like a super mega quote in their bio.

238
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,880
And we're just like--

239
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,000
- I love, I think about putting a super mega quote

240
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,360
in my bio as well, you guys should too.

241
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,080
- Yeah, I might throw one in.

242
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,280
Give us a, anything out of your mouth is a super mega quote.

243
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,120
- That's true, yeah.

244
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,720
- So go ahead and give us one for our bios.

245
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,040
- Yeah, you can just grab any one out of this entire podcast.

246
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,880
It's free to use.

247
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,700
- And just snip it, okay.

248
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,540
- Yeah, just snip it, snip it please.

249
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,080
- All right, good to know.

250
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:58,440
- Or put the date I noticed you on Twitter in your bio.

251
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,680
- Yeah, Matt followed.

252
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,360
Matt followed for whatever, whatever.

253
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,260
- 'Cause like we have a lot, like most of our fans are like,

254
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:10,000
I'd say like above 18, but then there's a big,

255
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,700
a big loud minority that's like 14 to 16.

256
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,000
- And kids are a minority.

257
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,220
We've been arguing for quite a long time.

258
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,060
Kids are--

259
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,140
- We're pro kids, we're anti-principal on this podcast.

260
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,540
- Anti-principal, anti-parent.

261
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,580
- Anti-homework.

262
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,400
- Pro lunch and recess.

263
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:35,540
Anti-class, anti-gym, honestly.

264
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,380
- Lunchables for all, that's one of our platforms.

265
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,100
- I had a dream last night, I was buying Lunchables.

266
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,500
- Damn, I got one the other day,

267
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,220
I got a ham and Swiss Lunchable.

268
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,060
- Man.

269
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,420
- Those are actually my least favorite.

270
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,260
- Really?

271
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,080
- No, the ham and Swiss, yeah.

272
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,260
- Turkey and cheddar.

273
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,100
- Yeah, I don't know.

274
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,980
I don't know what particular,

275
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,300
like it was just a particular day

276
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,760
where the ham and Swiss hit.

277
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,820
I don't know.

278
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,260
- Swiss is just such a bland tasting cheese.

279
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,780
- Doesn't taste like shit, dude.

280
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,620
- No, the Swiss, it didn't taste like Swiss at all.

281
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,440
- Yeah, man, you wish it tasted like shit.

282
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,280
- No, I don't.

283
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,100
- Yeah.

284
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,940
- No.

285
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,700
Swiss tastes like you are remembering what cheese tastes like

286
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,460
and you get like a little,

287
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,180
you're like, oh yeah, kind of.

288
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,660
- All right, yeah, there's something there.

289
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,500
- A memory of cheese.

290
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,180
- Like a faint neuron passing in your brain.

291
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,420
- Yeah, exactly, just like a synapse,

292
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,340
the cheese synapse is going like, is firing.

293
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
- It tastes like a picture of cheese.

294
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,420
- Yeah, exactly.

295
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,840
It tastes like how a picture of cheese tastes.

296
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,060
I was thinking about kids cuisine the other day.

297
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,980
How fucked is it that they give you a frozen brownie?

298
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,860
- Oh, dude.

299
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,740
- That was my favorite part,

300
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,800
and actually this sounds weird,

301
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,100
but I think that sometimes,

302
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,260
you know how like the corn would kind of

303
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,140
end up in the brownie?

304
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,660
- Yeah, under the fucking brownie.

305
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,660
I liked that shit.

306
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,660
No, I liked that shit.

307
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,660
It was pretty good.

308
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,780
That's why they put it in the Hungryman.

309
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,660
I expect this kind of behavior from Patrick, but you...

310
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,540
I mean, come on, dude.

311
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:58,160
I'm glad Matt and I agreed on that, like almost instantly.

312
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
It's not bad.

313
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,160
It's really not bad.

314
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,820
And I love how Hungryman's just the grown-up version of Kid Cuisine, but they still were

315
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,320
like, "We'll put the brownie in there."

316
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
We need that fucking brownie in there.

317
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,500
It's a transitioning food from kids to adulthood.

318
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,280
- Hungry Man was like, they were,

319
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,000
they originally called it abusive husband cuisine.

320
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,420
(laughing)

321
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,280
But then they were like, I guess we'll go Hungry Man.

322
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,500
- See, you know what I mean?

323
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
- Fucking like 45 year old dude in a tank top

324
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,180
sitting in front of his TV, eating one of those.

325
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,760
And the chicken, the chicken was my favorite,

326
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,860
but God damn, it was so soggy every time.

327
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:29,700
- Dude.

328
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,080
- Flip it over, the underside's just smooth and soggy.

329
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,180
- They, I think one time I ate a feather out of one of them.

330
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,100
Like I swear to God, I ate, I swear to God,

331
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,780
I pulled a fucking feather out,

332
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,620
unless it was some kind of muscle tendon

333
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,460
that looked like a feather.

334
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,060
- And then you ate it, you pulled it out and ate it?

335
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,180
- I pulled it out of my mouth and I put it in the tray.

336
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,500
- Oh, and then you put it back in your mouth.

337
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,580
- I ate the rest of it, I fucking paid for it.

338
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,420
- Yeah, the rest of the feather.

339
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,780
- You got a feather and a hungry man?

340
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,460
- I think I did.

341
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,940
- Jesus Christ.

342
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,500
- It was when I was in community college.

343
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,340
- Oh.

344
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:03,180
- You got a little more than you paid for, that's a burden.

345
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,140
- Ooh, I got the whole damn bird.

346
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,940
I think the most piss poor excuse of a Lunchables is the nachos one, because it's like, that's

347
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,420
not a meal, that's just a bunch of little tiny little circular chips and some horrible cheese

348
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,220
sauce from a 7-Eleven like pump.

349
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,220
Yeah, that's baby food.

350
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,860
Have one of those fucking hot dogs.

351
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,300
But they are pretty good I will say.

352
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,900
You gave me little chips and slop, and you expect me to do things with this?

353
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,900
Uh-uh.

354
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,460
That's not a Lunchable, that's a snackable.

355
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
Yeah, that's right.

356
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,460
God damn.

357
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
That's fucking right.

358
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,460
That's a snackable bitch.

359
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,460
Go off, go off camera.

360
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,460
- Go off, Cameron. - King.

361
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,460
- Yeah. - Why fucking have one?

362
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:43,460
- They have Lunchable, like, extremes now.

363
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,460
- What does that mean? - Those are for the bullies.

364
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,460
- Yeah, the bullies.

365
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,460
- Those are the bullies' food.

366
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,460
- It's just like a burrito, though.

367
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,460
- Yeah.

368
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,460
- It's just like, slightly one step up from the shitty nachos.

369
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:00,460
It's like, we have several tiers of Lunchables food.

370
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:03,460
You can have some circular corn chips,

371
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,460
or you can have a really shitty burrito,

372
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,260
is gonna be classified as extreme because this is one step higher on the food chain.

373
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,500
Exactly. Also, with the burrito, you can eat that and skateboard.

374
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,220
That's true. Remember, there was a Lunchables kid, right? There was like a mascot.

375
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,780
Yeah, it was you.

376
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,820
No.

377
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,860
It was you. You ate all of them. That's why you're like this now.

378
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:27,780
That's what, yeah. No, but he like looked, it was like some claymation kid. He kind of

379
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:32,180
looked like the Fruit Punch guy, but the Fruit Punch guy's wearing a hat. So I don't know,

380
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:36,620
like I like this hair looked like the fruit punch guys at I'm gonna Google

381
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:44,900
Lunchables mascot yeah it was Rob Dyrdek for a little bit in 20 like 13 was the

382
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,180
Lunchables guy yeah that's what directly landed him as his job in the fantasy

383
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,660
factory was after that they said this guy's so fucking good in the Lunchables

384
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,120
commercials we're gonna give him his own factory we're gonna we're gonna make him

385
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,500
the foreman of the fantasy factory there was so there there was a there was a

386
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,260
line of Lunchables called Lunchables Uploaded.

387
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,180
Oh I remember that yeah.

388
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,980
Yeah and Rob Dyrdek was the spokesman for Lunchables Uploaded because of

389
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,620
ridiculousness and stuff.

390
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,500
I connected that as a YouTuber. I like it a lot.

391
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,340
It's the only ones I eat.

392
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:20,020
All that's coming up with for the Lunchables mascot is a

393
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:24,940
platypus and a jackalope for Lunchables Mixed Up.

394
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,380
Mixed Up Challenges it says.

395
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:37,180
mixed up my tongue. Here's Rob Dyrdek and the Jabberwockys for Lunchables uploaded.

396
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,840
How many fucking iterations of Lunchables were there? I have no idea. They went

397
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:48,940
through a lot. And the platypus is just, the platypus is just a real platypus.

398
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:53,800
Yeah. It's not like the apple jacks mascot. It's like taxidermied. Yeah. My least

399
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,800
favorite fucking mascot in this this type of realm is the SpaghettiOs one. Oh the SpaghettiO?

400
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,880
That big fucking ring. Yeah. Yeah. Cause like I don't know like. What does he do? Cause he's

401
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,800
he well it's like an open ring but they make it look like it's his mouth. Oh yeah. It makes

402
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,760
literally no sense. He's got a tongue coming up like under his chin. Yeah it makes no sense

403
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,480
and then I remember they got in a lot of trouble cause they did that uh was it the Pearl Harbor

404
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,480
Yeah, with Pearl Harbor.

405
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Did a Pearl Harbor SpaghettiOs tweet?

406
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Yeah, with him holding an American flag.

407
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:29,480
And it says, "Take a moment to remember #PearlHarbor with us."

408
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,480
And that's a picture of SpaghettiOs mascot holding an American flag.

409
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
Oh my god.

410
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,480
That was one of the best times to be online.

411
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,480
That day.

412
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,480
I remember when that happened.

413
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,480
That was one of the most beautiful moments of the internet.

414
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,040
moments of the internet that when American Airlines tweeted out the the

415
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:54,920
picture of the woman with a model airplane in her vagina. That had to be intentional.

416
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,960
Yeah that was back when like the like the pictures didn't like like have a preview

417
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,400
so you had to click on it to open it. It was a twit pic or whatever. Yeah and then

418
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,120
you had to click the link and it would open in the app. Yeah man Wendy's ruined all

419
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,040

432
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:28,020
just like dope fucking women deserve 70 or 80 percent of the since it's like you

00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:37,340
a fucking yeah you let him go around the country to schools he's in size me going

434
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:41,380
to a fucking school telling kids how hard it is to lose weight there's so many

435
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,540
pictures of him at movie premieres I found yeah what the fuck yeah go yeah

436
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:51,960
you can use it a bunch of Avengers movies I think and he was that maybe the

437
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,900
Scooby-Doo movie there's like a bunch of a bunch of stuff he's a real hero in

438
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,300
movies? He wasn't in them, he was just not invited to the premieres. He was in Super Size Me, yeah, with Morgan

439
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:06,460
Spurlock. I'm surprised Morgan Spurlock didn't convince him to stop being a pedophile with his

440
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:12,340
brilliant wit. Yeah, so what if Morgan Spurlock makes a documentary called Super Pedophile Me?

441
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:20,100
Yeah, and he's a pedophile every day for 30 days, and he sees how much weight he loses.

442
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:26,860
He sees how much weight he loses and he also he has to convince Jared Fogle to stop being

443
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
a pedophile.

444
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
Yeah, that's pretty smart.

445
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,460
And we made this in 2008.

446
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,980
It would have killed honestly before Obama got elected.

447
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,620
That would have been like, that would have been like.

448
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,460
Thanks a lot Obama came around and ruined everything.

449
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,500
We can't make, we cannot pedophiles anymore.

450
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,140
I know, yeah.

451
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,380
God damn it.

452
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,380
Damn it.

453
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,260
before Obama you could make what was that movie with with like Morgan Freeman and

454
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:53,700
it was right after March of the Penguins came out and it was called like fuck of

455
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:02,260
the shit penguins and it's whatever it's the same footage from March of the

456
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,400
Penguins but it's just Morgan's part or Morgan Freeman being like suck my pussy

457
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,380
you stupid penguin yeah yeah Bob Saget's in that dude it's good man yeah came out

458
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,500
- I hated that fucking movie.

459
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,180
- Which one, March of the Penguins or Farce?

460
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,020
- March of the Penguins.

461
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,580
I didn't see Farce, I should have seen that.

462
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,460
I've never even heard of that.

463
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,900
But March of the Penguins was one of the,

464
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,420
I saw it in theaters, one of the most boring movies

465
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,500
I think I've ever seen.

466
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,540
- Yeah man, I was young.

467
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,080
I was homeschooled at the time,

468
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,900
and my mom was like, 'cause when you're homeschooled,

469
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,500
you're not schooled at all.

470
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,340
And so my mom was like,

471
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,720
"Today we're gonna watch a movie for school."

472
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,900
And so we just went to the movie,

473
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,900
and I was like, "Fuck, I rather would have been doing math."

474
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,500
fucking boring ass stupid penguin movie.

475
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,620
What a shit, they should have done a movie about tigers.

476
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,460
- Yeah.

477
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,660
- That's what they figured out with Planet Earth,

478
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,100
was they were like, oh you have to show things getting eaten.

479
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,020
- Yeah, right.

480
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,060
- You can't just have a penguin sitting on an egg.

481
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,900
- I mean honestly--

482
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,620
- And walk at like two miles per hour

483
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,240
and just waddling and that's it.

484
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,080
- Yeah, slowest walk ever.

485
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,980
- In a bleak white background.

486
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,460
- Yeah, penguins are the most boring thing to choose for that.

487
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,820
they're just like slow birds that can't even fly

488
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,180
and there's walk around and it's just snow

489
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,320
is nothing

490
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:20,800
exactly they could have just made like that they could have made that movie in

491
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,060
a gmod map

492
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,940
(laughter)

493
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,660
they could have just done that, would have been more interesting, you could have had a heavy weapons guy in there

494
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,260
a more interesting movie would have just been like march of the guy and they

495
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,820
just follow a guy around for a year

496
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,380
because guys do stuff

497
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,320
yeah exactly. March of Daniel. Yeah and then he went to the he went to the to the

498
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,460
arcade. Today Daniel went to Dave and Buster's. He went yeah he went to Dave and Buster's and he

499
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:55,080
put his name on the game as A.S.S. Yeah. I was like that's actually kind of funny.

500
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,100
When I got my first cell phone I did that and I took a I remember I took a picture and I sent it to

501
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:05,100
like every one of my contacts. Nice. And I bet it killed. It landed it stuck

502
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,580
It's done. You should send that to Stakehams. Yeah

503
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:15,220
Y'all check this out, and I'm sure Stakehams would would whatever college intern is running the Twitter account would get quite the chuckle out of that

504
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:20,780
Yeah, oh, it's the the address that son. Yeah, it's the executive son. Is it true? Oh, yeah

505
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,960
Oh fuck I just shit talked him. I didn't know it's the executive son. Mm-hmm. Yeah, dude

506
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,500
Every state is a game at Stakehams. Yeah, dude. You just fumbled that bag so hard

507
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:34,260
I just blew the fucking Stakehams deal god damn it

508
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:40,620
Alright, this first list, I sent a link in the Zoom chat, Matt.

509
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,700
This first list is called "Top 10 Stupidest Ways to Defend Yourself from a Murderer."

510
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Okay.

511
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:54,740
And you strike me as sort of like, well you mentioned you use the same microphone as Joe

512
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,740
Rogan.

513
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,620
Wait, like the actual same microphone?

514
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,620
Like the one that he uses?

515
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
Yeah, no, he let me borrow it.

516
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Yeah.

517
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,620
At the same time.

518
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,700
You have to be sort of like a self-defense, karate,

519
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,540
fighting other guys kind of fella, kind of style guy.

520
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,700
So I figured we would do like a self-defense

521
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,520
themed list for you.

522
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,020
Thank you, thank you.

523
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,420
When you see me, do I strike you as the type of guy

524
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,460
that you might get in a fight with,

525
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,300
you might like, you might ball on the street with?

526
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,140
I'll put it this way,

527
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,080
you are not the kind of guy I would try to murder.

528
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,120
You strike me as a--

529
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,200
You know I'm 130 pounds, right?

530
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,080
- 130 pounds of pure lean muscle.

531
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,360
You already fucking said you're taking

532
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,920
testosterone-laced protein at the beginning of this thing.

533
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,520
You think I'm gonna fuck with you?

534
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,000
You kidding, dude?

535
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,640
You'll crush me between your bicep

536
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,180
and your forearm like a melon.

537
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,040
- My big fucking muscles.

538
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,800
- Yeah, I don't know what you're hiding, you know?

539
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,160
- Dude, when I'm really on the testosterone,

540
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,480
when I'm really on the T,

541
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,860

548
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
Yeah, I think you were always red

549
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:42,500
No, you've been pretty red. You've always been pretty red. I've met I was almost never read until I shaved my head

550
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,520

551
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:50,700
That didn't

552
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,820
So top 10 stupidest ways to defend yourself from a murderer

553
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:59,260
Do you have it up? Do you have it? Are you able to have it up Matt?

554
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:03,820
Yes, I I have to google it cuz I don't have zoom on my computer. Hold on

555
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:11,460
Oh, it's not a mom in Twitter or something the defender show should top ten ways to defend yourself in Minecraft

556
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:15,060
No, I'll just send it to you on Twitter. Oh, I got it. I got it. I got it

557
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:20,260
Oh my god, he's a genius with this with the computer, you know, I uh, no, I don't have it actually

558
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:23,940
Oh, yep. There it is. I found it. Sorry. All right, we're good. We're good. All right. Nice

559
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:28,820
Number one, grab their knife by the blade.

560
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Yeah.

561
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:33,820
Yeah, I don't know how that, I mean, come on, that's a rookie mistake.

562
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:34,820
Yeah.

563
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
You know.

564
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,820
That's not one you want to do, I'll tell you that right now.

565
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,820
No.

566
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,820
Be it attacked by a murderer, you grab their knife by the blade.

567
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:44,820
That's the first week, the first month of self-defense classes, they just tell you over

568
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,820
and over, do not grab the knife by the blade.

569
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,820
That's going to be your first instinct.

570
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:55,140
Also, this is a, it's a double as good advice if you are a murderer.

571
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,140
Yeah.

572
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,540
Just don't grab your own knife by the blade.

573
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,460
They're giving away all the secrets right now, honestly.

574
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Yeah.

575
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:04,300
Even a chef's apprentice don't do that.

576
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,700
Yeah, anybody who messes with knives, you know, a little kid.

577
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Anybody in general, honestly.

578
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,900
It doesn't even matter if you're messing with the knife.

579
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,860
So far it's more just life advice than anything else.

580
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,340
Matt, have you ever been murdered?

581
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,340
Once, once back in like eighth grade.

582
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,340
Back in eighth grade?

583
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
Yeah.

584
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,340
And did you survive?

585
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,340
No, I didn't.

586
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
I hate to hear that.

587
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,340
Yeah, no, it sucked.

588
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
It did.

589
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,340
It sucked.

590
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,340
It was kind of a really shitty day, but you know, I got past it.

591
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:40,340
Just as you're starting to love somebody, they get murdered in eighth grade.

592
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,340
I'm in that situation right now, so.

593
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
I'm sorry to hear that.

594
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:46,340
Somebody said, "Don't trigger Trash Kid."

595
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:53,820
There's kind of a rotating cast of 13 year olds on this website who we see in every single

596
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,540
list and this is one of them.

597
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,740
And he says, "I got bandages."

598
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:03,060
Shit, he's got answers to everything, dude.

599
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,060
This guy's a problem solver.

600
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:11,180
In the middle of being stabbed, he's going to rip out some bandages and tape his hand

601
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:12,180
up real quick.

602
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,180
That would be the ultimate "fuck you" move to the murderer.

603
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:20,900
Sorry buddy, I have a health pack on my wall, like Halo Combat Evolved.

604
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,940
I'll just grab that and we're good.

605
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:27,500
I got a pocket full of gauze he just pulls out and unravels and wraps around his hand

606
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,660
right after grabbing the blade.

607
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,340
Yeah, sorry buddy, I have a self-revive.

608
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
That's right.

609
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,100
I'm overhealed.

610
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,100
You only hit my shield.

611
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:39,460
You only hit my shield, you didn't even do that much damage.

612
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,460
Yeah, you broke one bar of shield.

613
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,460
You didn't do fairly any damage to me, buddy.

614
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,460
I still got 56%.

615
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,460
I actually get to make a counterattack, actually, now.

616
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,460
I actually parry you.

617
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,460
It's my turn now.

618
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:52,460
You attacked, it's my turn.

619
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:59,460
Somebody else says, "If you were to grab this incorrectly, it would result in your hand bleeding.

620
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:05,460
But if you were able to grab the knife at the correct angle, it may be a possibility to get it from the burglar without cutting yourself."

621
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,460
I'm the only...

622
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,460
You just pinch it.

623
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,460
Yeah.

624
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,460
Yeah, like a...

625
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:13,460
You have to have really strong fingers to do that.

626
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,460
What other part of the knife is exposed?

627
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:19,460
You'd have his hand all the way around the grip.

628
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,460
Yeah, you just use two fingers and pinch the 5mm of grip that's exposed outside.

629
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Maybe you do... maybe you clap it.

630
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,460
You clap the knife like this.

631
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,460
A clap might work.

632
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,460
And then pull it away.

633
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:32,460
Honestly? Pull it towards you.

634
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,460
Yeah, you clap it and then you pull it towards you.

635
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,460
You pull the knife towards yourself.

636
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,380
Yeah, you pull it right here.

637
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,380
Yeah.

638
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,300
And that's gonna cut your third eye right open and then you can do some psionic attacks at

639
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,300
it.

640
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,940
Yeah, you can unleash the DMT that's actually in your body.

641
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,940
Yeah.

642
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:49,940
By dying.

643
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,940
Your naturally occurring DMT.

644
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,580
Yeah, the naturally occurring DMT.

645
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,580
There's another -

646
00:30:54,580 --> 00:31:00,340
There's another comment, there's a pair of comments here that says, Sir Sheep comments,

647
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,220
why would this be a problem?

648
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,140
And then someone responds, "@sirsheep, you might hurt yourself with a blade like that.

649
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,140
The dark one.

650
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
221B."

651
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:10,140
That's a terrifying username.

652
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:14,500
Oh, dude, he has a clapback, though.

653
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,220
Sir Sheep has the fucking clapback.

654
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,220
You see that?

655
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Oh, the internet.

656
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,100
The place where you must explain every sarcastic comment.

657
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,700
Sometimes I forget that I'm not saying these things to people in person.

658
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,700
Oh, shit.

659
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
God damn.

660
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,700
Oh my god, dude.

661
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Some ice for that burn.

662
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:30,900
Yeah, sometimes people take the gloves off in these comments, man.

663
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,900
Yeah.

664
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:36,940
Number two, you headbutt their weapon out of their hands.

665
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:37,940
That seems fine.

666
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,940
That seems like, I mean, if you headbutt the weapon out of their hands, if it works, that's

667
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,340
good, right?

668
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,980
Firemist in the comments brings up a great point.

669
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,100
You'll shoot your head.

670
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:53,980
That's actually, I didn't think about that.

671
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:59,500
Because I forget that so many guns have another trigger on the barrel just in case somebody

672
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:05,260
headbutts it and it automatically shoots them. That's that little thing on top of the revolver

673
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:09,060
that little the little fin on top of like the little thing that little sticky thing that

674
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,540
sticks up. Yeah. The sticky thing that a cowboy oh no no the thing at the oh okay the thing

675
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:18,180
at the front. That's the second trigger. Yeah. Yeah. You hit that smack that bad boy with

676
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:22,380
your head you're gonna get you're gonna get popped. Yeah. Yeah. But if you can get the

677
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:26,460
murderer to headbutt the weapon if you can trick them into headbutting it. If you can

678
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:30,020
and send murderers are so susceptible to dares.

679
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:30,860
- Yeah.

680
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,700
- That if you just say,

681
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,300
- Dare you to headbutt the weapon out of your hands.

682
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:34,340
- You can say, what are the odds?

683
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,180
What are the odds you headbutt your own gun

684
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,740
and shoot yourself in the brain?

685
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:39,060
- They're betting people.

686
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,180
- One in five.

687
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,620
- Yeah.

688
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,800
- And you count it down

689
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,060
and that's actually a pretty high chance he's gonna get it.

690
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:46,220
- That's a pretty good chance

691
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,860
that you're gonna get off scot-free too.

692
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:50,260
'Cause you also can't get in trouble for murder

693
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,740
if it was on a bet.

694
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,580
- If it was a fair, what are the odds?

695
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:56,380
Then I could see that holding up in court.

696
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,380
Exactly, yeah.

697
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,260
The judge will be like, "Well, it was the odds."

698
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:05,940
And if it doesn't, you can just ask the judge, "What are the odds that everything is dropped?"

699
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,780
I'll give you one in eight.

700
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,540
Three, two, one, seven.

701
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,540
Everybody goes seven, you fucker.

702
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,900
I'm free.

703
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,900
And guess what?

704
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:19,900
I'm going to do it again.

705
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,900
Yeah.

706
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,700
I'm going to do this over and over.

707
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,460
And it doesn't matter that I'm saying this in court.

708
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,540
I can do it as many times.

709
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,420
- That's how Casey Anthony got off actually.

710
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,260
- Yeah.

711
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,220
(laughing)

712
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,620
- What are the odds I didn't kill my kid?

713
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:37,900
- That's also why she did it in the first place though, Seth.

714
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,140
(laughing)

715
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,300
The kid could only count to one.

716
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,860
(laughing)

717
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,900
What are the odds?

718
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,740
One.

719
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,580
(laughing)

720
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,780
- Ah, shit.

721
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,620
- Fuck.

722
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:51,440
- She didn't wanna do it.

723
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,280
- She didn't wanna do it, but she's--

724
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,860
- What are the odds though?

725
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,740
Yeah, she's somebody, she respects,

726
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,660
if you're with Casey Anthony

727
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,340
and you are walking out with your parents

728
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:01,940
from the grocery store and you call shotgun,

729
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,580
she's not gonna say blitz,

730
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,900
she's not gonna try to steal that from you.

731
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,340
You get to ride shotgun.

732
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,160
Yeah.

733
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:09,000
She's gonna honor that, no matter what.

734
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,260
She honors it.

735
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,100
And that's why I respect her a lot.

736
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,620
She's an honorable person.

737
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,620
Yeah, yeah.

738
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,200
Number three, tickle them as a distraction.

739
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,260
I feel like this one would actually work.

740
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,380
It could work.

741
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,220
Yeah.

742
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,060
I don't think so.

743
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:25,060
So what if you're being murdered by a kid?

744
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,060
Mmm.

745
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
One of Caleb's 14 year old boys.

746
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:31,060
No.

747
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
No Matt.

748
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,060
No. Not.

749
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,060
You're gonna say not at the end of that.

750
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,060
Yeah, then you're in trouble because there's 14 of them.

751
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,060
Exactly.

752
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:43,060
You can't tickle them all at once.

753
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,060
Yeah I can.

754
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,060
You can tickle 14 boys at once.

755
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,060
No, no I can't.

756
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,060
I can tickle no boys.

757
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:58,900
Fuck dude, um, you just set yourself up you set yourself up for that dude. Yeah, you set yourself up on 14 dates

758
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:07,100
It'll work if I'm being killed by a tickle me Elmo. Oh

759
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:12,220
But not much else. Yeah. Yeah, or a tickle me Caleb

760
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:16,380
Or a tickle me. It's just normal me. That's pretty ticklish

761
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:23,480
guy that'd be the most looking thing I think the tickle me Caleb yeah it was

762
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,400
like a bald kids boy that's covered in tattoos I look like a cat has the face

763
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:38,440
apt monkey face yeah every time I think about tickle me Elmo I think about that

764
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:45,460
poor woman that got her face ripped off as a result of yeah Travis yeah friend

765
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:50,340
the show. Oh yeah, Charlotte Nash did. Yeah, all because she was holding the Tickle Me Elmo.

766
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,180
Yeah, it was a Tickle Me Elmo and she also had got a haircut so Travis didn't recognize her

767
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:03,380
and also she gave Travis Xanax. Oh yeah, Matt, you just stumbled into like one of our biggest

768
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:09,860
knowledge bases I would say, that us three share. White women that have been attacked by chimpanzees.

769
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:18,020
Yeah, we have one. It's fun. They do an interview with her like every two or three years on NBC.

770
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,620
Oh, I thought you meant Cameron and Patrick. You were like, yeah, they do an interview with her

771
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:28,260
every year. We do. That's pretty sweet. Every couple years, she gets like a new surgery and

772
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:32,740
they do a new interview with her. And every year it's like a little longer because she's a little

773
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:40,180
more like easy to look at a little longer. But recently, like they they gave her eyes,

774
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,680
- Damn. - Which is huge.

775
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
- Whoa. - 'Cause she, for a while,

776
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:46,100
she just looked like, she looked like Keanu Reeves

777
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,140
in the Matrix when they take his mouth away,

778
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,540
but for his eyes also.

779
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,220
- She looks like, yeah, she kinda looked like

780
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,660
the putty guys from Power Rangers.

781
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,380
- She looks claymation.

782
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,620
(laughing)

783
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:06,460
They're getting close to making her really giant.

784
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,020
(laughing)

785
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,020
One of these days.

786
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,020
One of these days.

787
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,020
She's going to be so fuckable.

788
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,420
Oh my god.

789
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,980
One of the surgeries is going to be a big old tit job.

790
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Yeah.

791
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
Before.

792
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,140
That was the first one they did.

793
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:28,340
She didn't do anything.

794
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,660
Travis didn't touch any part of her body except her hands.

795
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,260
Travis did you a favor.

796
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Yeah.

797
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:41,860
grass we put some huge fucking from B's to D's yeah we got you

798
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:53,580
Charlotte Nash has absolutely bolted on tits now. Oh Charlotte if you would have come on and set the

799
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:57,860
record straight by showing us that you don't have. I'm sure she's an avid

800
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,100
listener and I'm sure that I'm sure that that is that also this conversation she

801
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,540
would approve of. Well yeah she's a total whore for attention I mean I told you

802
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:13,860
she keeps going on TV bragging that she doesn't have any hands. I mean just...

803
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:23,380
I just knocked my phone off my desk. She's a huge super mega fan I don't know.

804
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,480
she's always commenting on the videos

805
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:48,320
I'm sorry sure what it is it makes me want to be so mean to you it's cuz you're

806
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,440
it's cuz probably the face yeah I look like I look like Travis and I as my

807
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,480
reflection and I feel the need to defend him. He actually did it because he was on

808
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,480
Xanax and apparently in chimpanzees that causes paranoia and hallucinations. Yeah

809
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,360
I don't know why you would give a monkey a human drug. Well first of all

810
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:15,600
it would be very funny. Like that video of that monkey smoking weed? Yeah. Well

811
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,800
yeah you know that monkey fucking just disemboweled one of those guys

812
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,120
immediately after. Nothing's funnier to me than monkeys smoking cigarettes

813
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,080
that's one of the funniest things in the entire world to me.

814
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,680
It's funny that they know what to do with them. Like they get a life cigarette.

815
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,520
Yeah, it's like they immediately know what to do with a cigarette. It's crazy.

816
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,200
It's in our ancestral memories. You can like...

817
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,920
That's right.

818
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,080
Yeah, you can meditate and the caveman knowledge will come back to you how to

819
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,240
correctly smoke a cigarette if you don't know how.

820
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,680
It's true.

821
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:46,920
Yeah.

822
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,480
Do you imagine a caveman cigarette all covered in like...

823
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,000
Yeah, man, it was a mammoth tusk.

824
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,960
Yeah.

825
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:52,680
It was a giant...

826
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:57,720
Hollowed out man. It's a giant spike. No, not even hollowed out. It was a leather wrapped cigarette.

827
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:05,640
It was a saber-toothed tiger tooth dude. Just smoking leather. Smoking that wheel. Yeah.

828
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,800
Smoking that caveman wheel. Yeah. Yeah. Let me hit that wheel.

829
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:18,840
Number four, hit them with a pillow. Could work. Somebody says uh,

830
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,440
How about a pillow of rocks?

831
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,440
Whoa!

832
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Yeah.

833
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,440
That's a really good point.

834
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,640
When I was a kid, I thought, I heard that like people in, like people have socks full

835
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,640
of quarters as like a defense thing, and so I would walk around my house with one.

836
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,640
I just thought it was cool.

837
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,640
You're defending it's your mom giving you chores.

838
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,640
I would just have dad comes out and yells at you and you can swing it around.

839
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,640
Yeah, how about you try doing the dishes, Nathan?

840
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,480
Like a greaser standing on a corner with a chain just kind of spinning it around.

841
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,480
Yeah.

842
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,920
There's a comment by Trigger Trash Kid that says, "No, I have candy stuffed in it."

843
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,920
What?

844
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
Wow.

845
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:04,200
In the pillow, not the pillowcase.

846
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
That's what I did.

847
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,760
I used to trick or treat with a pillowcase.

848
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh, me too.

849
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
Yeah, me too.

850
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,760
That was the best way to do it.

851
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Yeah.

852
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,760
You can get the most volume.

853
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,440
Exactly, yeah.

854
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,560
I think I've talked, I probably posted about it before, but there's like a, here's another

855
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,560
Patrick story.

856
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:26,040
I did a, I, we, we went from like my mom, my aunts were my neighbors or were my neighbors

857
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,820
and we like had like a bowl out that said like, take one.

858
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:35,020
So like, as soon as I like got to my house in the neighborhood, I filled up the bowl.

859
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,800
I filled up my bag with the bowl and then I went in the house and then just filled it

860
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,400
up with microwave burritos and put it out on the porch.

861
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,540
This is when I was like 11 and I only got caught because my cousin took one and tried to make

862
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,700
one as soon as he got back to my aunt's house.

863
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:57,060
Did you guys ever do like a, do you have any super problematic Halloween costumes in your

864
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,060
past?

865
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,340
Ooh, I don't know.

866
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,140
I don't think so.

867
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,300
One of my uncles, there's an old picture of him dressed up as Sambo.

868
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,300
What?

869
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:12,820
Which I won't elaborate on.

870
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:17,740
Not a specific guy, just like, he did like old school blackface.

871
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:18,740
Yeah.

872
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,740
Ah, damn dude.

873
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,740
Wow, that's crazy.

874
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:21,820
Yeah dude, Boston's awesome man.

875
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:25,900
One year I went as Jamaican Jackie Chan.

876
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:30,900
How did that work?

877
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
What did that look like?

878
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,900
Can you do it again?

879
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:33,900
Can you do the impression?

880
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,900
Yeah, I can do the voice.

881
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:44,140
do the impression? Yeah I did, I was dressed up in my Taekwondo gi and then I had one of

882
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:51,900
those Rastafarian hats with the dreadlocks and I was also a year that I

883
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,940
brought a, instead of a pillowcase I brought a trash bag because I was

884
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:01,300
like, but that was pretty ambitious. Right you got to get the, you got to bring the

885
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,860
pillowcase you can't bring a trash bag because then like they're throwing away

886
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:09,300
to get you're expecting you to get more candy rush hour would have been so much

887
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:15,540
funnier if Jackie Chan was doing a Jamaican voice that entire time. Jackie Chan in hard

888
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:21,300
blackface the entire movie yeah yeah and Chris Tucker just the whole time

889
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:28,980
like hey man what are you doing come on fighting crime this is not helping no

890
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,180
Just creating tension between the two of us.

891
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,180
Number five.

892
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:37,580
They're just so mad at each other in the car.

893
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,140
They won't talk.

894
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,140
Like all the witty banter from Rush Hour or whatever.

895
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,140
Just gone.

896
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,140
It's just the two of them just sitting in the car and Jackie Chan looking at them like.

897
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,700
Yeah, and Jackie Chan, he doesn't understand why he's mad.

898
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,940
Just can't wrap his mind around it.

899
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,940
Yeah.

900
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:54,940
Number five.

901
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,980
Offer to play a video game with them as a distraction.

902
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,980
Whoa.

903
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,660
Hey, I know you wanted to shoot me dead, but how about we play a little Minecraft instead?

904
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,660
Yeah.

905
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,980
How about, do you have Jackbox Party Pack?

906
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,460
Because, man, that thing is funny as hell.

907
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,460
Yeah.

908
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:15,620
I don't know, it might work.

909
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,900
Here's what I would do.

910
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,700
I would tell them to delete system 32.

911
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,700
And then they'd be so distracted.

912
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:27,620
I'd be like hey before you kill me take out that to get that Lenovo

913
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:32,460
You got a strap to your back and delete system 32. It'll really speed up your computer. Yeah

914
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:38,620
Yeah, oh man. Well. I'm always looking for a way to speed up my computer. Yeah, I heard you'll be able to try force

915
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:44,100
After you delete it. Yeah, if you run a magnet over your computer over your hard drive

916
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,140
Just run a magnet over your dad's hard drive, and then you can come kill me

917
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:52,760
Just do that first hold on getting a call from your dad. Yeah, he says

918
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,240
you need to put a magnet on his hard drive before you can come kill me.

919
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,240
Yeah.

920
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,240
Number six.

921
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:02,320
I'm tired of dealing with the geek squad.

922
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:06,240
Number six is put a plastic bag over their weapon.

923
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
That one might work.

924
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,480
Yeah, you can't see it.

925
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,480
The top comment here says, like, surrounded in asterisks, like an action, house catches

926
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,480
on fire.

927
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,120
What does that mean?

928
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,520
What kind of weapon would putting a plastic bag over it make your house catch on fire?

929
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,520
They're coming at you with a torch.

930
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,560
- Yeah, they're a...

931
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,480
- It's like an Indiana Jones torch.

932
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,160
- Yeah, I like Trigger Trash Kid says,

933
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,820
"I would wrap it with toilet paper."

934
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,760
But then it's, to me that's even scarier

935
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
'cause then that's like a mummy gun.

936
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:36,440
- Yeah. (laughs)

937
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:37,920
- It's terrifying.

938
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,400
- That shit could be haunted.

939
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,680
- Yeah, you know, I mean, and you just know

940
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,400
with this whole COVID thing that mummies

941
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,440
are having a rough go of it with the toilet paper prices.

942
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:47,280
- Yeah.

943
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,580
- Am I right, folks?

944
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:54,780
mummies are they haven't had a change in quite a while yeah you can say that

945
00:45:54,780 --> 00:46:02,860
again they see that he has to use toilet paper yeah a mummy with paper towels it

946
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:09,060
just feels different yeah it's sopping wet brown a copy of printer paper mummy

947
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,540
have you seen the the reusable toilet paper well I've seen it in your bathroom

948
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:18,840
No. Yeah, where you use it. No. Yeah. No! I've heard of this.

949
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,340
And he's never cleaned it either. I saw it on Etsy. Yeah, it's called "Your Hand."

950
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:27,840
Oh, shit! Goddamn. I don't use Matt's hands to do that.

951
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:33,340
No, I'm talking to you, Patrick. No, I don't use Matt's hand to wipe my ass.

952
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:38,340
Patrick, I... That would be crass. You can wash... There's soap, dude.

953
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,340
Hands are made to be washed. You know what I'm saying?

954
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,100
That's why God gave us hands.

955
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,500
That's why God took them away from one Charlotte Nash.

956
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,620
He's like, "I've been watching what you've been doing.

957
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:52,300
I'm not a fan of this.

958
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,420
We're going to have to change some things around here."

959
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,900
I like to imagine she has OCD and now she goes to wash her hands and just holds them

960
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,900
in front of the water 30 times a day.

961
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:11,380
I've hit my limit on Charla Nash.

962
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:12,380
I can't.

963
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,380
That's the most in an episode.

964
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:17,380
You're going to be walking down the streets of Boston and a chimp's going to escape from

965
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,900
the zoo in like in the true karma fashion.

966
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,700
It's going to directly target you and rip your face off.

967
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,700
No man, he's going to shake his hand.

968
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:24,700
He's going to say thank you.

969
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,300
He's going to think it's his brother.

970
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:32,100
Thank you for your activism.

971
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:43,140
just gonna think that Caleb is Sharla Nash. I see the two of you together I

972
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,460
wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Yes you would dude I have beautiful

973
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:56,820
hands and I don't have big fat pretty tits. Number seven set fire to your house

974
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:01,820
that's a that is dumb this is definitely this should be number one this is one of

975
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,660
the stupidest ways I can imagine.

976
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:06,500
- Yeah, unless you're not inside your house

977
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:09,660
and the murderer is, and you--

978
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,620
- Unless the murderer is your parents or roommate.

979
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:13,460
- Yeah.

980
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:15,620
- And also you have a fireproof room.

981
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:19,580
- Yeah, or you have another house that you could go to.

982
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,900
- Yeah, joke's on you.

983
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,900
I have two houses.

984
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,900
- Yeah.

985
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,060
- I like the first response from firing this.

986
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:26,060
That's pretty funny.

987
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,900
- Go ahead, you can do what you're allowed to say.

988
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,940
- Oh, I can read it?

989
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:32,140
- Yeah, you can do it.

990
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:33,220
- This is Bob.

991
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:34,420
Bob says hi.

992
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,400
This is Bob when his house burns down.

993
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,500
Bob is homeless now and probably dead.

994
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,100
- Whoa, that's one of the saddest stories I've ever heard.

995
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,380
- This is how they-- - It's pretty epic.

996
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,140
- This is how they try to kill Michael Myers

997
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:47,980
in the 2018 Halloween.

998
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,820
I just realized.

999
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:49,940
They do it in a movie.

1000
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,500
So it's gotta be work then, right?

1001
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,420
- No, true. - If it's in a movie, it works.

1002
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,820
I mean, they wouldn't-- - Did they kill him?

1003
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,580
- Well, it's a cliffhanger ending.

1004
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,420
- You don't know.

1005
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,180
They filmed that in my hometown in South Carolina.

1006
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,020
- Really?

1007
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,100
- Oh, forget your,

1008
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,860
somebody told me you were from South Carolina.

1009
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,180
You know where I am right now?

1010
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,020
- Where?

1011
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:12,300
- North Carolina.

1012
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,460
Just one, just one spot up, baby.

1013
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,900
- You guys are state brothers.

1014
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:16,740
- Yeah.

1015
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,940
- One step over.

1016
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,020
- Yeah.

1017
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,860
But I go to South Carolina sometimes.

1018
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:23,860
I go to Boardwalk on the Beach at Myrtle Beach.

1019
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:26,100
- Myrtle Beach is so great.

1020
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,340
- I love it, dude.

1021
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,940
Oh my god, the Hard Rock Cafe in Myrtle Beach.

1022
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:30,980
Ooh, I'm gonna go.

1023
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,880
That's where it pops off, dude.

1024
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:37,120
Man, I used to have a Hard Rock Cafe Tel Aviv t-shirt.

1025
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,520
I don't know where that went.

1026
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,440
(laughing)

1027
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,860
I gotta find that.

1028
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,780
I fucking, I need to go hit up the Hard Rock Cafe

1029
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,360
in Myrtle Beach, do the karaoke night,

1030
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,900
perform Rap God in its entirety.

1031
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,740
Yeah.

1032
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:50,560
(laughing)

1033
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,540
Yeah, but change it to Rock God

1034
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,860
and watch the crowd go absolutely wild.

1035
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,980
When are they gonna make a Hard Rap Cafe?

1036
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,980
That's what I want to know.

1037
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,300
- Yeah.

1038
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:02,140
Yeah, the hard rap cafe.

1039
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,060
- Yeah, music is changing.

1040
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:06,100
- Graffiti everywhere.

1041
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,660
Oh my God, it'd be so cool.

1042
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:08,500
- Yeah.

1043
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,300
- Surrounded by police officers with guns drawn.

1044
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,100
- Oh, your waiter is a police officer.

1045
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,820
- Hip hop fries.

1046
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:20,660
The signature burger is just called the N word.

1047
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:23,500
With a soft A.

1048
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,780
that Jackie Chan in the kitchen with a black face on,

1049
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,100
cooking some shit up.

1050
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,060
He does stand up there in black face.

1051
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:34,780
- Yeah, he does Def Jam stand up.

1052
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:39,080
The hard rap cafe.

1053
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,620
Number eight, fight them off using a water pistol.

1054
00:50:42,620 --> 00:50:45,220
Well, I got two words for you, buddy.

1055
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:46,780
Good luck.

1056
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,780
- Oh, you could do this though,

1057
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,540
if their knife is made out of paper mache.

1058
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,180
- Or if it's hot water.

1059
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,220
- Yeah, if they have World's Sharpest Paper Mache Knife

1060
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,660
from those videos that guy makes

1061
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:03,000
where he sharpens like a B until it turns into a big knife.

1062
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,860
I love those videos.

1063
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:06,980
- Those are awesome, dude. - Oh man, those are the best.

1064
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:08,940
- World's Sharpest Dog Shit Knife.

1065
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,780
- Yeah.

1066
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,500
- It's just two hours of a guy.

1067
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,540
- He's melting it down on his stove.

1068
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:16,340
- Melting dog shit, putting it in a mold.

1069
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,860
- He's just stirring it with his finger the whole time.

1070
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:21,620
- Trigger Trash Kid's got a bit of a clap back.

1071
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,780
He says, "I'd rather use a .45 Defender."

1072
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,780
Whoa, true to his name.

1073
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:28,780
Yeah.

1074
00:51:28,780 --> 00:51:29,780
Oh yeah, yeah.

1075
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:31,980
Fuck, I don't want to get in a fight with him.

1076
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,980
Right?

1077
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:33,980
He has guns, dude.

1078
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:34,980
Fuck it up.

1079
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:40,220
Siri, O-P, Siri says, "Someone tried to rob a bank like this."

1080
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,900
Wait, Siri wrote this list?

1081
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:43,900
Yeah, C-Y-R-I.

1082
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,900
Siri from Apple?

1083
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:45,900
Cy-R-I.

1084
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:46,900
Cy-R-I.

1085
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,900
Sorry.

1086
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,680
Cyri said that someone tried to rob a bank by defending

1087
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,060
Themself with a water pistol

1088
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:59,180
Rob a bank by defending themselves, uh-huh

1089
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:03,540
Yeah, luckily the bank. Yeah, all the tellers were witches

1090
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,780
rubbing

1091
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:13,580
Robbing the bank and saying this is in self-defense. Yeah. Yeah, your honor. It was a self-defense bank robbery

1092
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,820
They were trying to make me do it.

1093
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:22,420
Yeah, they were trying to not give me money and I had to defend myself.

1094
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:27,420
They're trying to not give me money to death and I had to defend myself with my gun.

1095
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:29,140
I had no choice.

1096
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:30,700
Number 10 slapped their butt.

1097
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:36,220
Yeah, one of my basketball coach, one of my Caleb's basketball coach at Halo Hoops at

1098
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,340
Myrtle Grove Christian School in 2006.

1099
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,340
No.

1100
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,340
No

1101
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,740
That's the answer no

1102
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:53,840
Someone says him and I we're gonna date after we're engaged Wow the D smile that's from oh, woo woo. Oh

1103
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:57,740
Mom sweet. Oh, it's gonna have the ending. Yeah

1104
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:03,440
And then you get into the contenders. This is when this is when you get the real gold on these lists, man

1105
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:08,020
You get stuff like number 12 flick their nipple. Oh

1106
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,620
Oh fuck yes.

1107
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:10,620
Yeah.

1108
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:14,100
They gotta have, I mean, to do that from a safe distance, they gotta have one extendo

1109
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,100
nipple on them.

1110
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,100
Yeah.

1111
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,540
You know, just a long hard nipple.

1112
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,020
One big noodle coming out.

1113
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,580
Yeah, one big pink noodle.

1114
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:24,820
Have you guys seen that picture of that dude that is like 40 years old and he's used like

1115
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,420
a nipple pump.

1116
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,380
He's got such erect nipples and he's like too much long.

1117
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:31,380
Oh my god.

1118
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:32,380
Yes.

1119
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:33,380
Yes.

1120
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,380
I think I've seen it.

1121
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,380
The guy with the cigar.

1122
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,060
- He's got a very, like a real faint grin,

1123
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:41,540
but like it's a grin of satisfaction.

1124
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,780
Like he's very proud of himself.

1125
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:44,780
- Well he does that, you know, he does it for him.

1126
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,620
I would love to have--

1127
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:46,820
- Jamie, get the nipple pump.

1128
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,060
(laughing)

1129
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:51,820
- Yeah, Joe Rogan is one inch tall,

1130
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:54,180
but he puts himself in a nipple pump every morning,

1131
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,880
and that's why he's so red and big now.

1132
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,580
- He's nipple pumped himself up,

1133
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:02,460
and he takes all those, like, he smokes DMT

1134
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:11,980
so he can see people normal but yeah I smoke CMT the channel yeah yeah

1135
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:20,020
no not Caleb's Me Tiny that doesn't make any sense dude I'm smoking BMT dude no

1136
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:27,540
Caleb's Caleb's Mary time you didn't think about that did you think I'd have

1137
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:32,740
something perfect Mary time yeah that's when you dress up like Mary from fucking

1138
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:38,900
you do with your boyfriend's dudes. You all dress up as your favorite hobbits and you guys run around.

1139
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:45,540
Our favorite hobbits? There's like four. There's enough hobbits. You guys could do the seven

1140
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:53,940
dwarves but do 14 dwarves instead so you can have double the dwarves. And Caleb plays Snow White.

1141
00:54:53,940 --> 00:55:01,780
I would probably play the guy in the movie. No. You play the wit dude. You'd be dopey because

1142
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,860
'cause you got his dumb ass ears.

1143
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,600
- No, I don't, my ears are normal and not huge

1144
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,300
and they don't stick out of the side of my head.

1145
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,940
No, I would play probably the guy

1146
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,540
or the hot version of the witch.

1147
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,860
- You'd play the poison apple

1148
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,780
'cause your head is perfectly round and red.

1149
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,820
(laughing)

1150
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,700
- No, no.

1151
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,300
If I did play the dwarves,

1152
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,080
I would be in this situation of them all stacked up

1153
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,840
in a trench coat because I'm so tall.

1154
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,220
I could never play a single dwarf.

1155
00:55:31,220 --> 00:55:33,220
You can play all the dwarfs.

1156
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,220
With like the most handsome dwarf at the top.

1157
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,220
Uh...

1158
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:39,220
Which one is the most handsome?

1159
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:40,220
Me.

1160
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:41,220
So you are a dwarf.

1161
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:42,220
No. Which... sexy.

1162
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:43,220
Yeah, so you've admitted.

1163
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,220
We got him again.

1164
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,220
No.

1165
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,220
You don't have me.

1166
00:55:48,220 --> 00:55:49,220
I do.

1167
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,220
No, back to the contenders.

1168
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:54,220
Politely ask for them to put down the weapon.

1169
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:56,220
Yeah.

1170
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,220
That might work actually.

1171
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:02,580
Tricky trash kid just says, "Thanks for the advice."

1172
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,420
[laughter]

1173
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,420
Nice.

1174
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:13,220
Number 15's not like a bad option, actually.

1175
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:14,820
Yeah. Scream.

1176
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,220
Yeah, just yell.

1177
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,420
But then somebody says, "It's rude to scream at people."

1178
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,020
[laughter]

1179
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,820
That's a good point.

1180
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:25,820
I was about to be murdered.

1181
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:31,180
I was about to be murdered but thank god I didn't scream otherwise I'd be so fucking rude.

1182
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:31,680
Yeah.

1183
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:35,020
I'm gonna skip ahead number 20 here.

1184
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:38,060
Threaten to tell on them if they shoot.

1185
00:56:38,060 --> 00:56:45,260
Okay, you know, um, I just can't in good conscience endorse this one.

1186
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:51,100
I mean, telling, tattletailing is one of the, I mean, I would rather die before I tell on somebody.

1187
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,160
Yeah.

1188
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,220
I feel that, I really do.

1189
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,580
What if he gets grounded?

1190
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,260
What if he goes to detention? Yeah, what if he gets detention?

1191
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:04,860
You know, or they take his toys away. His toy pistol. I feel like I can't,

1192
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:08,620
I would have to, yeah, agree with Caleb on

1193
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,620
this because I have a past of snitching and I'm

1194
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,420
trying to move past that. When I was in fifth grade, I was

1195
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:20,620
sitting at a table with this girl and this is right around

1196
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:24,460
the time when Justin Timberlake's sexy back came out and

1197
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:31,240
And she was singing it to herself and I heard her under her breath say the line, "Those

1198
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,140
motherfuckers don't know how to act."

1199
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,900
And I remember I looked at her and I was like, "Are you serious?"

1200
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,880
And I told the teacher.

1201
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,680
And she got detention, lunch detention that day where you had to walk the perimeter of

1202
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:45,680
this big oak tree.

1203
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:46,680
I was like, "Detention?"

1204
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:51,440
Everyone got in a line that had detention and had to walk the perimeter of the oak tree

1205
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,280
for the entire duration of recess.

1206
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,040
And I remember she came back, she came and she sat back at the table and I remember she

1207
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,520
looked at me and it was just this genuine question of like, "Why did you do that?

1208
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,400
Like why'd you tell on me?"

1209
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,040
And I felt bad after that.

1210
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,400
I've never snitched on anyone since.

1211
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,920
You are never invited on this podcast ever again.

1212
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,200
Y'all, y'all, I know, I know, that makes me sound like a little piece of shit but I

1213
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:17,680
was fifth grade, I changed after that and I remember being out on the playground and

1214
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,120
seeing her walk the perimeter of the tree and I remember I was like, "Fuck, shit."

1215
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:25,200
- That sounds like a medieval torture method.

1216
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,160
That's like, just making some--

1217
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,720
- Since then, Matt has been witness to over 30 murders,

1218
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,160
but he won't speak up.

1219
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,360
(laughing)

1220
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,600
- Can't go to the police.

1221
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:37,400
- No, listen, I have principles.

1222
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:38,600
I used to be a tattletale too.

1223
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,080
One time I tattletaled on myself, because--

1224
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,060
- I did that shit all the time.

1225
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,960
I saw porn by accident and I told my mom.

1226
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,200
(laughing)

1227
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,040
- By accident.

1228
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:56,920
One of my most impressive tattletales was I was watching My Bloody Valentine 3D.

1229
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,920
Oh yeah.

1230
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:03,440
And then it was right when I can't, it was like this shitty remake of like some slasher

1231
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,440
movie.

1232
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
2009.

1233
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
Yeah, 2009.

1234
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,240
And I was at my friend's house and we were watching it.

1235
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:12,680
We rented it while his mom was out of, was like at work or whatever.

1236
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:13,680
On a bender.

1237
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,240
She was on a bender, probably.

1238
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:21,400
there's a there's a section with nudity and I got up and I stood in front of the

1239
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,520
TV like did like a superhero pose and I was like guys I'm not sure we should be

1240
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:29,440
watching this movie and they were like okay like if you're gonna be weird about

1241
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,560
it like we don't have to watch it and I was like yeah what's your mom's phone

1242
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:39,000
number and I was like yeah miss we were watching a movie with breasts in it but

1243
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,680
yeah we turned it off and she was like okay I'm at work at Waffle House like I

1244
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,680
I don't care.

1245
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,680
I don't care.

1246
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,680
Dude.

1247
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,360
I did that the first time I ever smoked weed.

1248
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,120
Oh my god, you self told?

1249
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,960
Yeah, okay, here's the worst part about this story.

1250
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,120
I was a senior in high school.

1251
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,120
Whoa.

1252
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:03,640
And I used to have, okay, so no, but there's context.

1253
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:13,480
I had a form of OCD where I like would feel hyper guilty if I like did anything like bad

1254
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,240
And I was a huge Christian when I was in high school.

1255
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,000
And I was like, "Shit, smoking weed is like,

1256
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,200
"it's a high sin, punishable by like going to hell."

1257
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,620
And my friend came over with a fat bowl

1258
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:27,040
and went on my back porch, my parents were in a home.

1259
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,680
And I was like, "Are you gonna smoke that?"

1260
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,200
And he's like, "Yeah, dude."

1261
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,600
And he lit up this bowl and he took a fat rip

1262
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,440
and he passed it to me.

1263
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,200
He was with a girl I kinda had a crush on too.

1264
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,480
And I was like, "Okay."

1265
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:41,560
And I took a rip of the bowl and then they left

1266
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,820
and I called my mom and I was like,

1267
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,820
"Mom, I just smoked marijuana."

1268
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:46,320
*laughter*

1269
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:48,320
My mom was like, "Okay."

1270
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
And she's like, "Hell yeah!"

1271
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
"Hell yeah, playa!"

1272
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:55,320
"My son's finally cool. I thought you were a poser."

1273
01:00:55,320 --> 01:01:00,320
"Finally I can have sex with you, son. You're finally kind enough for me to fuck."

1274
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:07,320
That was going on plenty before that, 'cause the marijuana had nothing to do with the first appreciation.

1275
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,320
Yeah, you said you were super Christian.

1276
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,320
Yeah, I've been there.

1277
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,320
close family.

1278
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:19,520
The first time I ever smoked weed, I just ate a whole jar of peanut butter.

1279
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:24,360
I was like 14 and there was a brand new jar of peanut butter and I was so freaked out

1280
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:28,080
that I was like, I think eating, I think I read somewhere that eating helps you not be

1281
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,080
high anymore.

1282
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:33,960
So I ate a jar of peanut butter and then my brother was like, he was like, "Did you just

1283
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,960
eat my whole jar of peanut butter?"

1284
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,300
He was so mad and I had to explain to him, I mean he was like, he smoked weed every second

1285
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,780
in the day and I'd be like, no, you don't understand I'm high.

1286
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,540
And he's like, who cares?

1287
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:49,000
And then I watched the Avengers.

1288
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:49,840
Oh, nice.

1289
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:50,660
Yeah, dude.

1290
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,500
I was still out in theaters.

1291
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,860
And I remember I was at the,

1292
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:54,700
while I was at the movie theater,

1293
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:57,380
I spilled my giant Pepsi all over the place.

1294
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,300
And I just, I just left it.

1295
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:01,340
I just didn't even try to get another one

1296
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:04,580
and tell anybody just like while walking into the theater,

1297
01:02:04,580 --> 01:02:06,780
I just like spilled it in the lobby

1298
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:08,180
and then just went into the movie.

1299
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,020
I was like,

1300
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:09,860
Oh, it was like in the lobby on the floor.

1301
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:15,860
the lot I had I had literally just filled up a 64 ounce and then I walked and I

1302
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,660
just like it just dropped out of my hands like I just forgot to hold it and

1303
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:24,260
meanwhile meanwhile and pick up a Nash is going to going to see her first movie

1304
01:02:24,260 --> 01:02:29,860
since the incident because she can't see she slips in this giant yeah her also

1305
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:39,620
dropping a Pepsi because she's like oh I forgot I don't know oh man this is just

1306
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,860
It's a Sharla Nash themed episode now.

1307
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:45,220
Really, we should have found a Sharla Nash list.

1308
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:46,220
I think that was enough.

1309
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,220
Funniest Sharla Nash.

1310
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:48,220
Sharla Nash themed.

1311
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:51,020
I gotta pee real bad.

1312
01:02:51,020 --> 01:02:52,300
I'll be back.

1313
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,300
We're almost done, Patrick.

1314
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,300
What are you doing?

1315
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,300
Just sit down.

1316
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,300
Dude, I gotta pee so bad.

1317
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:57,300
You can hold it.

1318
01:02:57,300 --> 01:02:58,300
I cannot hold it, dude.

1319
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,860
Let's just make fun of Patrick when he's gone.

1320
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:02,860
Alright, fine.

1321
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:03,860
You can make fun of me all you want.

1322
01:03:03,860 --> 01:03:04,860
I got some things to say.

1323
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:05,860
Alright, say them.

1324
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:06,860
Go ahead.

1325
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:07,860
Talk your shit, man.

1326
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:10,740
Does he have a hairless cat?

1327
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:12,700
He has two of them.

1328
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:14,980
Yeah, dude, fucking believe me.

1329
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:17,340
Now I know what type of person Patrick is now.

1330
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,740
Yeah, a rich person.

1331
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,340
Those things cost like, what, $50,000 each?

1332
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:23,220
Yeah, fucking expensive, dude.

1333
01:03:23,220 --> 01:03:24,220
I know.

1334
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:26,700
And they're named Fucker and Yoda.

1335
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:27,700
Really?

1336
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:28,700
Yeah.

1337
01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:29,700
Yeah.

1338
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:30,700
Those are the names.

1339
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:31,700
Goddamn it, sorry.

1340
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,100
I just got a Twitter notification from Pete Buttigieg.

1341
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,700
Oh no.

1342
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:42,700
I have an alt Twitter account that my friend and I use to follow fart fetish Twitter accounts.

1343
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:43,700
Nice.

1344
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:47,360
Because we kind of went down a rabbit hole one day and found all these fantastic ones

1345
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:51,880
so we created a Pete Buttigieg fart roleplay account.

1346
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,440
I followed him on the account while he was still in the race and I'm not even signed

1347
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:02,040
into this account anymore but for some reason every time Pete tweets I get a notification

1348
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:05,640
on my phone and it's so god damn annoying and I don't know how to make it stop because I'm

1349
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:07,480
not even signed into the account.

1350
01:04:07,480 --> 01:04:11,080
Damn, that's uh he's getting revenge on you.

1351
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,640
Yeah, it's nice though because at least once a day I can have a little moment of inspiration

1352
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,200
when I can see a tweet from Pete Boothrow.

1353
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:23,840
Yeah, Matt, we should mention Matt is wearing a t-shirt that says "Boot Edge Edge" long

1354
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:24,840
after he dropped out.

1355
01:04:24,840 --> 01:04:26,520
He's still repping the man.

1356
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,600
And I got a "Gays for Pete" sticker on my car.

1357
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:32,280
Yeah, and a straights for P1.

1358
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,800
Just keep in all the, all bases covered.

1359
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,640
Um, alright, we read patrons?

1360
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,720
Oh yeah, we have some patrons to read, Matt.

1361
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,280
You can either stick around or you can fuck off, it's up to you.

1362
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,280
Yeah, I'll stick around, man.

1363
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,280
I love patrons.

1364
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:48,880
Why don't we just do it after?

1365
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,880
Because he's already here.

1366
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,880
We already said yes, we already tricked him.

1367
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,200
You want me to leave Patrick?

1368
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,560
No, I'm just saying, I don't want to...

1369
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,200
Patrick, you just left to take a pee, you don't have any opinion.

1370
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:02,720
Whenever you leave the microphone you lose all the say you have in any decision.

1371
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:05,720
It's just disgusting ball sack looking cats.

1372
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,720
Yeah that's right.

1373
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:07,720
No.

1374
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:08,720
Yeah they're all balls.

1375
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,120
Here's my, here's my, let's make fun of Patrick more.

1376
01:05:11,120 --> 01:05:12,120
Here's a Patrick story.

1377
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,120
Okay.

1378
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:14,560
This is Patrick telling a story.

1379
01:05:14,560 --> 01:05:19,060
You know the other day I was looking at my cats rolling around on their beds and it reminded

1380
01:05:19,060 --> 01:05:24,440
me of in high school I printed out a picture of a skateboard.

1381
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,920
Fucking beasted on them dude.

1382
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:33,100
Fucking gone. That is not what I sound my man. I'm a sicko mode on Patrick. Yeah, dude. You just went you just that's the cipher right?

1383
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:38,500
There yeah, just you just hopped in the cipher and spit bars. I mean sometimes you have to take him down a machine gun

1384
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,500
Kelly them dude

1385
01:05:40,500 --> 01:05:47,260
Yeah, I was thinking the other day about how funny it is that a guy was just like man fuck

1386
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,260
What's my rap name be?

1387
01:05:49,260 --> 01:05:51,580
How about machine gun?

1388
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,840
(laughter)

1389
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,820
- Machine gun Kelly.

1390
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:01,900
- There was probably like a few iterations before that.

1391
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:02,740
- Yeah.

1392
01:06:02,740 --> 01:06:04,740
- Kelly.

1393
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:07,340
- Kelly the Rapper.

1394
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:09,140
- First he tried Kelly and people were like,

1395
01:06:09,140 --> 01:06:09,980
that's not tough enough.

1396
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,020
- Normal gun Kelly.

1397
01:06:11,020 --> 01:06:12,880
- I need a tougher name than Kelly.

1398
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,940
What if I just add machine gun to the front?

1399
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:16,780
- Knife Kelly.

1400
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:17,620
- My first name is Kelly.

1401
01:06:17,620 --> 01:06:19,300
- Yeah, yeah.

1402
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,620
Bomb Kelly.

1403
01:06:20,620 --> 01:06:22,960
(laughing)

1404
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,660
- Napalm Kelly.

1405
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,860
- That one's, Napalm Kelly's way better.

1406
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:29,140
That's like, that sounds way cooler than Machine Gun Kelly.

1407
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:30,040
- Like he wanted to go with it,

1408
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,660
but his grandfather fought in the Vietnam War

1409
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:35,360
and suffers from extreme PTSD.

1410
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:37,100
- Yeah, Agent Orange Kelly.

1411
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:41,660
- MK Ultra Kelly, see that sounds cool.

1412
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:43,420
- MK Ultra Kelly's way cooler.

1413
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:44,780
- Vietnam Kelly.

1414
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:47,100
- Vietnamese Kelly.

1415
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:49,100
- Viet Cong Kelly.

1416
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:50,100
Mr. Vietcong.

1417
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,240
Yeah, I might as well go for it.

1418
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,240
Just VC Kelly.

1419
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:53,240
Vietnamese, that's it.

1420
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,240
No name, just...

1421
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:55,240
Vietnamese is the rapper.

1422
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:56,240
Hold up, it's Lil' Vietnam.

1423
01:06:56,240 --> 01:06:57,240
It's Lil' Vietnam.

1424
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,240
Go ahead and spit, Matt.

1425
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,240
Lil' Vietnam, go for it.

1426
01:06:59,240 --> 01:07:00,240
Let's hear that shit.

1427
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:01,240
It's Lil' Vietcong up in the house.

1428
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:02,240
Oh shit.

1429
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,240
Yo, I feel like I should stick around for Patreon though because I haven't posted on Patreon

1430
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:04,240
in like a month and I feel really bad about that.

1431
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,240
So, this might in some universe make it to the top.

1432
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:06,240
I don't know.

1433
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:07,240
I feel like I should stick around for Patreon though because I haven't posted on Patreon

1434
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,240
in like a month and I feel really bad about that.

1435
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,240
So, this might in some universe make it to the top.

1436
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:15,040
Yo, I feel like I should stick around for Patreon though because I haven't posted on Patreon

1437
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:17,000
in like a month and I feel really bad about that.

1438
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
So maybe this might in some universe make up for that.

1439
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:21,000
Oh, okay.

1440
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000

- I got the Patrick pricing.

1520
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:11,620
- Oh my God.

1521
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,460
- Whoa.

1522
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:14,600
- Wait, thank God, because Ben Contio,

1523
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:18,700
the guy who had the $45, just edited it back to $5,

1524
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:21,260
- First, 'cause we already hit 1,000.

1525
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:23,700
So, huge thank you to Super Vega.

1526
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:25,540
- Wow, Super Vega. - Absolutely.

1527
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,180
- But we still got more.

1528
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:28,780
We missed something. - Oh, Corgimatic.

1529
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:30,100
- No, Black Coolman. - Black Coolmatic,

1530
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:31,580
thank you. - Black Coolman

1531
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:34,460
went up to $25.01.

1532
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:35,420
- Whoa. - Whoa.

1533
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,300
- And I think Black Coolman was maybe our first patron ever.

1534
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,380
- Black Coolman was our first patron.

1535
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,200
- That's true.

1536
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,700
- Shout out, special shout out to Black Coolman.

1537
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,140
Change your name, but--

1538
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,940
(laughing)

1539
01:11:47,940 --> 01:11:49,980
What's up, it's Black Coolman.

1540
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,500
Oh, we have him here, Black.

1541
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,260
So thank you so much, Black.

1542
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:59,140
It's so nice to personally give you our appreciation.

1543
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,740
Can you say one more thing?

1544
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:01,580
(laughing)

1545
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:02,940
Can you say it with your voice?

1546
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:05,800
I'm actually, I'm regretting that one a little bit now.

1547
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:09,940
So I think I'm gonna pass on the Black voice.

1548
01:12:09,940 --> 01:12:12,580
No, that was the cool man voice.

1549
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,960
I thought you were really leaning harder

1550
01:12:13,960 --> 01:12:14,800
into the cool man part.

1551
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:15,620
Yeah, that was the cool voice.

1552
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:16,780
Nah, it was a cool voice.

1553
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,260
It wasn't even initially charged.

1554
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:20,700
- All right, and that's it.

1555
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:22,140
Matt, thank you for coming on, man.

1556
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:24,180
- Thank you so much. - Shout out to Super Mega.

1557
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:25,420
Watch Super Mega.

1558
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:29,140
Let's get that average age on Super Mega up to 14 1/2.

1559
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:30,700
- Yeah! (laughing)

1560
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,220
- Let's boost those numbers.

1561
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:33,540
- Let's raise it up, guys.

1562
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,020
Let's get it up there.

1563
01:12:35,020 --> 01:12:35,860
- All right. - All right.

1564
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:37,180
- Thank you guys for having me.

1565
01:12:37,180 --> 01:12:38,020
- Of course. - Yeah, of course.

1566
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,460
