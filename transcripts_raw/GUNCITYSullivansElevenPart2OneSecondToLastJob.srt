00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,880
Hi, what's up? It's Cameron. I have some big exciting news

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:10,820
We are doing a D&D live show on Thursday March 31st

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:14,840
It's in Brooklyn, New York at Union Hall

00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:20,280
And if you are listening to this episode on the day that it comes out Monday, February 7th

00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,160
Then tickets will be on sale at noon Eastern today

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,160
And if you're listening anytime after that

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,960
tickets are already on sale and you're going to want to buy a ticket to this

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,680
because it is going to be

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,760
swag as hell. I'll put a link to buy tickets in the description of this

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,360
episode and I'll also put it

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,560
on Twitter @podaboutlist

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,160
it's called

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,480
"Hopperation Frogtastic Voyage"

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,880
and Sullivan the Frog will die if you do not buy a ticket to the show

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,240
so you're gonna wanna do that and here's the episode

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Well, after an auspicious start, I knew we needed to set a plan in motion in order to

17
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:10,840
get our money back, er, get their money back. After we convinced Barry Gee and Travis to

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,480
join us, we had to deal with the ICUP charity compound. But first, the team.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:22,200
Blotos Pierce, teleporter extraordinaire. Patrick Yoda, mind reader and force user.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,440
Ray William Johnson, computer guy.

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,600
Barry Gee, explosions expert and face.

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,480
Travis Asinat, muscle and deagle expert.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,040
And me, Sullivan the Frog.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,080
I think they told me I was the driver, but I don't, I don't, I just kind of did a lot

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,080
of stuff.

26
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:43,940
Um, anyway, the ICUP charity compound, formerly the Papi Chuko's Technoslime Addiction Treatment

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:49,040
and Recovery Center, was a highly secure location, even by Papi Chuko Technoslime standards.

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,660
And it seems after getting their independence from the company they maintain that security standard

29
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,380
multiple floors made entirely of hyper-cauterized techno slime

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:06,100
Staffed by elite corporate agents who still are getting paid by Papi Chuko's corporation because of a billing error and also technological security

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,580
Concentrated EMP rays to destroy rogue electronic devices biometric scans and ID checks

32
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,800
It's uh, it was it was gonna be a tough job

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,840
But the building was large and maintenance doesn't really have that much value behind it, so there were other access points.

34
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,760
Once we got the blueprints of the facility and staked it out, we just needed a few other components.

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:36,120
So we knew that the ICUP had a vault and in that it had donations that were represented as hard digital currency.

36
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,000
That's right, currency you can actually download rather than existing as a series of transactions in the unreachable quantum blockchain.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:51,360
Most institutions don't do this but regulations around charities that stipulate they do everything less efficiently out of respect is an advantage for us

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,860
After about five days time however the vaults contents will be invested into the quantum crypto market

39
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,160
And then we won't be able to access it so we're gonna have to figure out how to do it

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,940
The way that the way that what we knew about the vault was that we needed to at the very least get credentials

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,880
So that we can as quantum crypto investors so that we can download

42
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:19,120
The files we had to get inside the vault to do that on the same network as the ICUP

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:27,940
And we needed to get past security including using a double golden deagle trick shot with perfectly weighted golden bullets for that

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:35,100
And we also needed to make sure we passed a pyometric scan that was for Fantima Von Kissyface

45
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,120
we also would need love slime to build a

46
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,160
UOAB, the uncle of all bombs, to open the vault door

47
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:48,600
So in order to do this, well first we were gonna have to get that blueprint so

48
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,140
I consulted the gang about what they thought we should do

49
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,160
Guys

50
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:07,660
All right, everyone's showing their credit cards on stream

51
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,660
*laughter*

52
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,660
*laughter*

53
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,660
*laughter*

54
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,660
*laughter*

55
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,660
*laughter*

56
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,660
*laughter*

57
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,660
*laughter*

58
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,660
*laughter*

59
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,660
*laughter*

60
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,660
*laughter*

61
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,660
*laughter*

62
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,660
*laughter*

63
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,660
*laughter*

64
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,660
*laughter*

65
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,340
anything about pulling a heist it's probably there's probably a made up of

66
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,740
several rooms connected in different ways probably a vault that we have to steal

67
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,060
from and there's probably a blueprint that shows it all and if there's

68
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,860
anything I know about a heist it's every step of it and I don't need any of you

69
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:59,700
and I'll go do it myself well all we have to do is go to the basement of the

70
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,180
charity and look for a blue piece of paper and that should give us a map of

71
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:11,140
the entire area. We need a blueprint expert. We need to recruit a blueprint expert. A brand

72
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:17,900
new character. Voiced by a new person. Let's find someone who has the thing we need and

73
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:26,220
make him give it to us. I think that's probably a very solid idea, Travis. The question is,

74
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,660
I mean I imagine there was probably an architect or something who designed it. Okay, him. Okay,

75
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,660
Yeah, okay him right now

76
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,460
Don't think I'm instantly call him

77
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,940
To the discord call. I mean the meeting I can't well look to get to that guy we I

78
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,660
Can't just find the architect for this maybe

79
00:05:47,660 --> 00:06:00,900
We're in your Scarface mansion without you for some reason I mean, where are you where are you zooming in from?

80
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:09,140
them. Space. That tracks, yeah. You're in space. I hear you guys need an architect.

81
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:20,540
I know a guy. I know one guy. Who's that? His name is John Architect. Okay, is he the

82
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:26,940
architect of the building that we're trying to steal from or is he just an architect?

83
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,940
He built that building.

84
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,940
He built the building too.

85
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,940
Okay.

86
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Well, let's... where can we find him?

87
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,940
At his house.

88
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,940
Wow.

89
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940

I got plenty

103
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:30,800
Okay, why are you here a search on Quora - that says how many friends do you how the few friends can a person have before?

104
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
they die

105
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:36,500
Okay, and then I'm going to say a similar search right after where you replace person with frog

112
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,220

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,500
Okay, wait, let's just not draw attention to the cops

115
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:45,300
Very key very key if you know where this John guy is I say we go talk to him

116
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,260
About the building maybe he can give us maybe he could tell us about it or has blueprint for it. All right

117
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,980
Let's let's just go to his house while he will say

118
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,020
building

119
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:59,860
Shit

120
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,940
Who go ahead me go ahead while Sullivan was saying that

121
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,620
Yeah, Barry we can hear you just send over the thing what you say the

122
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:25,180
Opinion mm-hmm while Sullivan was saying all that stuff. I just bought like a bunch of

123
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:34,500
That I bought it I bought a print of that I bought a print of Barry G with makeup on his eBay account

124
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,940
using his his Apple pay

125
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:40,180
Okay, that was

126
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,940
That's so old you have such a shitty phone that still has Apple Pay on it

127
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,420
This is an iPhone 5c. I can call people who cares, you know, that's all I care, you know

128
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:57,900
Your call history, okay, so there's a call to 9-1-1 five minutes ago. It looks like that's it

129
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:01,740
Yeah, it's still got a flappy bird on this thing. You're actually

130
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,060
a lot of money

131
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,220
To sell your phone, okay, so first

132
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:31,540
I didn't pick it up again. It's not

133
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,620
Reflective of my ability to play flappy bird and also if you look at the call history

134
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,500
I've called you guys every week and a half and then I would space it out about a month

135
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,100
Just in case I was being bothering you and you can see a lot of me trying to call you guys

136
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,740
so that happened to

137
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:54,340
How much you use your phone for something useful and find out where this fucker is? Okay. Thank you

138
00:10:54,340 --> 00:11:00,460
Barry G for sending it and yeah, he finds the the the address of John architect and

139
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,020
Yeah, I mean you guys can head over there if you want to

140
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:23,980
the

141
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:39,060
the

142
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,060
I came with you.

143
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,060
I'm just kidding.

144
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,060
Okay, this is starting to make some serious sense.

145
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,060
Let's go to that guy's house on planet E-Bomb.

146
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,060
Yeah, sure.

147
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,060
Which is the planet that we're on.

148
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Which I think is maybe where all of us are.

149
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,060
Let's stay on the same planet.

150
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
I don't want to leave the planet.

151
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,060
Yeah, for some reason.

152
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,060
So yeah, you guys drive across Gun City

153
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:11,520
city to John Architect's house. It is, uh, it looks like the house in

154
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,220
bling ring that just like perfectly clear box house. Um, yeah. And you

155
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,240
see him. Oh yeah. Wow. Doing stretches, uh, um, completely

156
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,380
clothes. Are those crazy, awesome teens from bling ring in there too?

157
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:33,100
Nope. They're not. They're not helping him stretch. Nope. Nope. Are

158
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:38,100
those Ross they are no no they are helping them stretch

159
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:42,180
your old helping instruction there way more of us than there are patches you

160
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,060
can see there are enough of us now that we can just make the story

161
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,860
slowly becoming becoming us obsolete yeah okay so the teens from from bring

162
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,020
bling-ring are there and they're helping them stretch and we walk up to them we

163
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:00,140
blast their brains they're 18 years old that's first that's for stealing all

164
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:04,740
those celebrities fucking shit you pieces of shit yeah you're not allowed to do

00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:14,420

Oh yeah, what's up?

171

I was gonna say "Um, E-Bomb."

172
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
[Laughter]

173
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,900
We're gonna get through so much plot.

174
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
[Laughter]

175
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,900
[Laughter]

176
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,900
Alright.

177
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
John Architect answers the door.

178
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,900
And you guys I guess are carrying...

179
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
Are you guys...

180
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Is Barry Gee zoomed in or no? Not yet.

181
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
I'm eating basic combos.

182
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,900
an iPad that we have.

183
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Yeah.

184
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,300
Wait, Caleb, can he be on your computer screen?

185
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,300
Oh, yeah.

186
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,300
Oh, yeah.

187
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Yeah, okay.

188
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,940
Yeah, he replaces my Teletubby screen in the middle of the demon.

189
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
Yes.

190
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:08,100
Instead of the normal two green dots for eyes and four green dots for a smile.

191
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,060
Just what you see.

192
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
Yeah.

193
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,500
You see Barry G in makeup.

194
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,260
Yeah, on the line with Barry G.

195
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,260
the

196
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,300
the

197
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
the

198
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:23,300
the

199
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
the

200
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,300
the

201
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,340
the

202
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,340
the

203
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,340
the

204
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,340
the

205
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,380
the

206
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:39,420
the

207
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,420
the

208
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,560
I think I'm gonna fuck out of him

209
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,840
If I'm a bit confused so you're welcome to come inside

210
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,980
I'm gonna kill you

211
00:14:53,980 --> 00:15:02,300
No, we need a we need blue we need some blue I'm gonna have sex with you

212
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,860
No, we need some blue from you

213
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,860
We need the blue paper. I'm gonna blow him

214
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,820
No close

215
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
I blew him?

216
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
I guess I'll have blown him.

217
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,420
I've blown him before.

218
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:24,740
When we leave here you're going to be saying I blew him, but not right now.

219
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,960
Got it, okay.

220
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:38,460
So we have some, we're interested in the recent redevelopment of the iCup compound and your

221
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:44,060
work on it and we wanted to know if you had the blueprints for that.

222
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,300
It's not called a blueprint you idiot it's called a blue piece of paper stupid ass shirt.

223
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,660
Yeah and I blew him? No.

224
00:15:51,660 --> 00:16:01,660
This is sort of like I'm playing D&D alone and we're here to distract you.

225
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,660
I'm actually answering them.

226
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,660
I have like five people just making fun of me while I play D&D by myself.

227
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,660
You're like Jordan Peterson and we're like five Joe Rogans.

228
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Yeah.

229
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,660
Because he's crying.

230
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:20,660
Okay.

231
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:27,660
And yeah, I mean, John the Architect answers me and he says, "Oh, well, the blueprints,

232
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,660
Um, I mean I have some

233
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,220
sketches, but the official blueprints I

234
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,780
Like everything it got possessed by

235
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,580
Um black rock real estate and development division. Yeah, he blueprints his black cock

236
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:48,540
Yeah, why don't why don't you roll roll roll persuasion on that let's have you roll something

237
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,780
Let's see if that made him laugh. He rolls. Can we can we do a perception check on whether or not?

238
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,860
John, architect is a black male

239
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:58,540
Or not even that, just if his cock is black.

240
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,020
- Well, they all need hair. - No, no, I just said princes.

241
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,980
All of you, yeah, all of you roll insight to see if you can tell...

242
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,460
- It was like the anime needs jokes. - ...if he's got a black penis.

243
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,860
I think Gun City needs a new skill roll called "joke."

244
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,220
And if you make a joke to a character, you have to roll that.

245
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:16,700
And I think my character has +100.

246
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,300
Mm-hmm.

247
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,260
And I think Patrick's character has -7000.

248
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,700
I'm only 20.

249
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Yeah, you could tell that his penis is the color of whatever his skin is like you can tell pretty sure

250
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,580
It was it is it is white like all my characters

251
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:37,140
Thank God, yeah, oh and in walks the

252
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,060
Morgan Freeman

253
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:45,640
Hey just got back from the white surgery store

254
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,940
And yeah, so I mean he says it's in like this Blackrock facility. I mean you guys would know that

255
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,780
Blackrock eventually became more

256
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:05,100
Aggressive and being a development and real estate company. So they probably developed some or at least contracted John

257
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,740
architect to develop

258
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,940
the the

259
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:15,260
Facility as you would know it and so that is the place that would have the blueprint

260
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,380
But you know, you can't really just go in there and

261
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:28,620
Ask we gotta go in there. I asked for a blue proprietary blueprint. Okay, I think we need to break in there

262
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:31,060
But first we'll need to get the blueprint

263
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:41,620
Actually, no and we'll need to go recruit two people who are willing to join us on this heist John architect

264
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,820
Do you know who designed the blackrock facility?

265
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:51,540
I'm not I'm not entirely certain but I can sit I let me I guess I can

266
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:56,220
For he was British the entire time. I had no choice

267
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:59,980
I was forced on the spot to make a character and I was like he's got to be different

268
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,300
And so I chose this and he is different from Leo the collector. Oh

269
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:13,500
Yeah, Leo the collector is very different. Yeah, do both of those voices at the same time. I can't do two voices at once

270
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,020
the

271
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,020
the

272
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,020
the

273
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:23,020
the

274
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,020
the

275
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,020
the

276
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,020
the

277
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,020
the

278
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,020
the

279
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:35,020
the

280
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,020
the

281
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,020
the

282
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,020
the

283
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
the

284
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,740
And he lives and he he knocks up one floor right above me

285
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:55,040
You see David architect who's also stretching in the clear building. This is all so easy so far

286
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,300
Yeah, yeah, and he breaks the glass floor and just comes down and lands on his face. I want to say

287
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:05,420
Glass floor you must be a very good architect

288
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:12,880
And he says he says it all it bruv I'll go another British accent for you

289
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,920
And he hands you guys the blueprint to the Blackrock building and then he kills himself

290
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:28,600
The Blackrock building was developed by by David architect and it shows they have glass floors everywhere we can bring right in

291
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,160
Does not have glass for all floors

292
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,560
It has glass floors and ceilings and walls and doors

293
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:41,320
Glass that have no door are just a door frame. It has doors made of paper and windows made of water

294
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
This is gonna be the best heist ever!

295
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
Made of nothing!

296
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,320
There's no ceilings on it either, yeah.

297
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,320
And it's as small as my hand!

298
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:59,320
It's perfect!

299
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
And it's right here!

300
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Yeah, it's in his back pocket!

301
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Okay, no. We're gonna do a heist on that place.

302
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Yeah, you will.

303
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:24,360
the

304
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:39,840
the

305
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
But you can see that there is at the very least a main entrance.

306
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,280
And then you know that if you go up two floors, somewhere in that third floor,

307
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:57,840
there is a computer terminal that contains a full list of the blueprints inside of them.

308
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:08,160
It's hard-coded in there, it's not replicated anywhere, it's meant to be not accessible except by personal download.

309
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:20,540
the

310
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:35,620
the

311
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,220
you can roll investigation for that. Yeah, go for it.

312
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:44,980
I'm, yeah, while he investigates that, I would like to case the joint by dressing as an arcade

313
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:47,140
repairman. Okay, yeah, of course.

314
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,980
Walking into the front door. Very good.

315
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,100
I got a 20 on my investigation. Okay, cool. So,

316
00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:00,420
all right, so, so yeah, I would say there's kind of like a synergy here because,

317
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:17,280
Cam, if you as an arcade repairman are kind of useful in that you can kind of distract the guards here while he's casing the joint, because it's pretty conspicuous to see a demon with a computer on its back, sort of like observing a building up and down.

318
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,780
So I think we should play out that scene to see if you're kind of ample at distracting them.

319
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,280
Yeah, I used my master disguise ability, by the way, so I have a perfect disguise.

320
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,280
Yes, as an arcade repairman.

321
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Yeah.

322
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,440
All right, so yeah, you're coming up to the to the guards what's going on

323
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:40,080
Hello. Hello. Hello. What's all this then? I'm the arcade repairman here to repair

324
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,600
Machines

325
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,640
Yeah, I guess let's start with

326
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah, uh, you know what no, it's let's let's play this out and then we'll figure out where you're gonna have to roll

327
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,380
You see the guard there is like I don't remember we don't sorry. Did somebody call you for the building?

328
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,380
The machines are broken!

329
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:04,380
Oh, you're the guards, you're the guys who schedule the repairs, you're the ones who remember who calls who.

330
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,380
No, no, we don't schedule the repairs.

331
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,380
I tried playing the games earlier and I complained because they were all broken.

332
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,380
[laughter]

333
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,380
I, I, I, uh, just, just, hold on, let me, let me just check at the front desk.

334
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,380
I can't believe this.

335
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,380
Travis, how close to the scene are you? Are you-

336
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,380
I'm shouting!

337
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,920
(laughing)

338
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,180
- You're 20 feet away, cupping your head,

339
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:29,300
hands around your mouth, okay, yes.

340
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:32,580
- And yeah, one of the guards goes inside.

341
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,580
- I'm losing valuable time here, okay?

342
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,780
- One of the guards goes inside to check.

343
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,020
- I've never been made to wait this long in my life!

344
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:43,420
- While the guards inside, I walk out,

345
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,540
I turn the corner in like a guard uniform

346
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:50,100
that's way too big for me, 'cause I'm a Yoda.

347
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,340
It's like little kid wearing dad's clothes.

348
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,420
Mm-hmm, and I go sit where he was sitting

349
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,520
You see the other guard turn to you go. Hey, what?

350
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:14,660
While Patrick Yoda's standing guard I walk I would say oh, hey guard you mind if I walk inside

351
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,100
Wait, and I'm stuck out here

352
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Hold on, hold on.

353
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,600
What the fuck is this?

354
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
What the f-

355
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,100
Let's do a couple of rolls.

356
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:30,600
I mean, Patrick Yoda, I guess first do Deception with disadvantage.

357
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,100
Real quick, sorry. How do we do these rolls again?

358
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,100
For sure.

359
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,100
I only got a 25.

360
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:43,600
So on roll 20, you'll just hit the thing that has to do with whatever the roll is.

361
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,600
So like if you look at the skills-

362
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,100
Open up your character sheet.

363
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,100
Yeah, open up your character sheet.

364
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,100
Yeah, I'm on my character sheet.

365
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,100
Yes, yes, yes.

366
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:56,100
that

367
00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:14,100
the

368
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:21,540
Also I'll say with that 20 you also can tell that somebody's been through there recently.

369
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,100
I'm a guard!

370
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,100
I'm starting to do, I'm doing that thing where I like, I hear, I've heard a funny voice and

371
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:34,340
I start accidentally mimicking it just because I think it's funny so I'm going like, I can't

372
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,900
believe I'm waiting here!

373
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,580
I can't believe you're keeping me waiting!

374
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,780
I can't believe you were waiting too!

375
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,300
I can't believe, I can't believe I'm waiting!

376
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,500
You gotta stop awaiting!

377
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,500
I got to stop waiting. You got to stop waiting. You got to go in.

378
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
I got to go in. I got to repay.

379
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,500
Oh, he has to go in.

380
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,500
He has to go in and repay.

381
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,500
While they distract him, I die.

382
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
We're distracting each other.

383
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
While they distract him, I die.

384
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Why did you have lunch today?

385
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Oh, what did you have for lunch today?

386
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:08,500
Yeah, yeah. I would say you guys are able to get in through the side door pretty easily.

387
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
The guard does eventually come out.

388
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:25,580
the

389
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:27,580
Did they come with us or are they still out front?

390
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,580
We're still out front. Or at least I am.

391
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,580
Yeah, I don't know if you guys...

392
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,580
Did you guys... Are you guys still out front?

393
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,580
Are you guys still way out front? I'm still guarding, because now I

394
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
now I fully believe this is my job.

395
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,580
Very cool.

396
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
In that case... No, okay, no. You know what I'm gonna try to do?

397
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,580
Mm-hmm.

398
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,580
I would like to purposely

399
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
have my disguise, like,

400
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,580
fail. Like, maybe my mustache falls off a little bit.

401
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:51,580
Mm-hmm. And then I go like,

402
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,580
"Oh no! I've been found out!"

403
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:57,700
found out and I like run I start to run away but really slowly like I'm trying

404
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,940
to lure the guards away so they don't notice what's going on

405
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:15,140
the other guard comes out and says yeah we have no RK repair what is this little

406
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
green man doing?

407
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
He's getting away!

408
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,140
We have to go get him!

409
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,140
I'm running slow motion.

410
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,140
If you see him, he's running away!

411
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,140
I'm running away!

412
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,140
He's running away!

413
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,260
I said he was running away!

414
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,420
The other guard looks at the guard who came back and is like, "I don't really know what

415
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,420
to make of this."

416
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,980
We got the guy!

417
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,660
And he's like, "Alright, I guess, yeah."

418
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,340
Roll persuasion, Pat.

419
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,340
19, nice.

420
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,340
Yeah.

421
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:59,340
the

422
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:14,340
is

423
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,180
I can't come in.

424
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,380
- You will be in the main lobby after that.

425
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,100
So it will be, you'll have to just like figure out what to do

426
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,260
but yeah, you can absolutely do that and figure it out.

427
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,260
- Okay, I'm just gonna, I'm, well, actually no,

428
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,420
that might make them run to the side door though.

429
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,860
So maybe I shouldn't do that.

430
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,580
Okay, I'm just gonna run just slightly faster than them

431
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,620
and go, "Oh, I hope they don't catch me.

432
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,800
"I hope they don't catch me.

433
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,640
"I'm gonna get you.

434
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,180
"I'm gonna get you.

435
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,940
"Don't catch me, don't catch me."

436
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,140
- While I'm in a big guard suit,

437
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:56,520
the

438
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:11,600
the

439
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:24,040
the

440
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:41,960
the

441
00:30:41,960 --> 00:31:00,920
the

442
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:13,300
the

443
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:16,100
further down the hallway, it looks like it's pretty clear

444
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,400
from what you can see down here.

445
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,500
No sign of anybody there.

446
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,000
I mean you could do obviously you can do perception checks

447
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,500
or investigation checks or insight checks into certain

448
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,900
things that you're observing.

449
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,600
Feel free to ask questions.

450
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,700
Can I to clear this section of the hallway?

451
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,900
I'm looking into my backpack and notice that I have a huge

452
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,100
worm and I actually have two huge worms.

453
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,440
is a number two.

454
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,780
You really should start paying attention.

455
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,500
I mean, you already you left the huge worms in there and I did.

456
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,140
You do it now.

457
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,840
So you have to reckon with that.

458
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,780
I don't know how there's two, but go on.

459
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:57,680
I don't know either, but I'm going to drop one, just one.

460
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,180
And OK, I'm going to slap it on the ass like a donkey

461
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:04,500
and watch as it wiggles through and I love that if it falls

462
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,380
into the mouth of any kind of creature.

463
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,180
OK, cool.

464
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:11,000
So you slap the ass of the worm or what you think is the ass you slap.

465
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,300
- He has a big ass.

466
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:14,840
- Okay, cool.

467
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,080
You slap the juicy ass of that worm

468
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,800
and it slithers forward

469
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,560
and you see it start disappearing in the darkness.

470
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:24,120
And then you hear a pop sound

471
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,480
and you see the worm running back

472
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,720
and it looks pretty injured.

473
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,000
And you hear like a, it sounds like an alarm clock.

474
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,160
And then you hear the alarm clock stop.

475
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,480
- Call me your baby.

476
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
I put him back into my backpack.

477
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Yeah, the worm's like whimpering in pain.

478
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,480
Um...

479
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Okay, uh...

480
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,480
This bit of darkness is like, straightforward in this direction, by the way.

481
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
Okay, Sullivan,

482
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
now you, your turn.

483
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
No, no, no, I don't want to do that.

484
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,480
Fine, we'll all, we'll all go.

485
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
But,

486
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
slowly.

487
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
And Sullivan goes first.

488
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
And Sullivan takes point.

489
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
Hey, Sullivan, it's because you're the leader.

490
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:24,480
I

491
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:36,840
that

492
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,840
Mr. Sullivan. Uh oh, I killed him again. I've killed him every episode of this fucking D&D

493
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:52,000
thing. Oh, poor Sullivan. Yep. Alright. I killed him again. Sullivan is moving forward,

494
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:04,120
he's dashing forward because of that great charisma. And a pop sound is heard. And let's

495
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
to Mr. The Frog.

496
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,880
Okay.

497
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,880
Yup.

498
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,880
And then let's see what happens to Mr. The Frog.

499
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,880
Uh...

500
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,880
God.

501
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,880
Oh, well.

502
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,880
How much HP did I give him?

503
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,880
A million.

504
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,880
Not enough.

505
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,880
Million.

506
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Did I kill him?

507
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Uh...

508
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:41,880
outright kill it today is he unconscious or dead? Obviously. He just dies off screen.

509
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:55,040
Literally off screen. A little popping sound. Not even a whimper. Okay. Alright, alright.

510
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:03,360
The worm came back with a bruise. He's not dead but he is, if he got hit like two more

511
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:10,360
he would have been dead. So he is just knocked out. You just hear him go "AHH!" and just

512
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,360
flop to the ground. He can't tell you what he saw or anything.

513
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Sullivan! Quit farting around down there!

514
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:26,360
I guess I'll start doing death saves for Sullivan. If you guys don't act.

515
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,360
Is there a way to take the flashlight and examine exactly what happened to the worm?

516
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:37,440
Yeah, if you can uh, yeah, I would say you can do like a medicine check to see what happens.

517
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Alright.

518
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,360
I'll do a medicine check then.

519
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,440
Hold on, sorry, I'm not great at this.

520
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,400
No, it's all wonderful.

521
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,360
A lot of fucking characters here.

522
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,360
Thank you.

523
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,360
Thank you.

524
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,680
Alright.

525
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,680
You say medicine.

526
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,680
I say ROI.

527
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,440
I say, I look at.

528
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,540
Mm hmm.

529
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,720
Oh, 15. Very good.

530
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,880
And with only a plus one.

531
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,040
So when you're looking at the worm, what you can tell is that it's covered

532
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,520
in some kind of like snot.

533
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,080
Like it looks like a snot bubble blew up on it.

534
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,080
And that's that's what the natural mucus of the worm.

535
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,720
Yes. Like a separate kind of mucus.

536
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,240
That'd be funny if he described that news, like, but that's just normal for them.

537
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,180
That's the natural mucus.

538
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:33,180
It's a good thing you asked that, because otherwise you could be completely led astray.

539
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,680
Yeah, I realize that now, yeah.

540
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,180
You're a fucking nerd.

541
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,180
I didn't have to put an eye on her to know that the worms are slimy!

542
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,180
You're so smart.

543
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:48,180
Hmm, looks like there's some kind of...

544
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,180
I would say, Travis Ocelot, you've been in the field long enough,

545
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:56,680
that let's have you roll in a history check to see if you can

546
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,680
like kind of recall what kinds of enemies do this.

547
00:36:59,680 --> 00:36:59,980
Okay.

548
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:06,180
Very good history.

549
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,680
Yeah, I do 20 nice.

550
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,780
So you would recall that something that has that kind of like

551
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,480
amount of mucus that can cause that kind of like forceful of

552
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:38,480
the

553
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:46,480
So you would know that about them, so you would probably assume that there are a number of them littered throughout this facility.

554
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,480
Right.

555
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Travis, I noticed you staring at this worm.

556
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,480
I just remembered that these are DQIQ DaddyBots!

557
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Oh, oh no!

558
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
Oh, and they snot when you get close to them?

559
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,480
*snoring*

560
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:26,480
I

561
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:33,480
I could walk up and maybe use the bottom of the iPad stand to like shuffleboard him into the next one.

562
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,480
[laughter]

563
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Across the cold, snowy grass.

564
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:47,480
I would say, I mean you have like, with your computer, the computer like, hacking ability involves you having some sort of like detachable wiring that allows you to hook into other things.

565
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,480
He'll die if he goes into another one though.

566
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,480
You could, yeah, he might die.

567
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,380
All right. You know what?

568
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,940
You just gave me a better idea.

569
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,880
I would like.

570
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,840
So they're bots, right?

571
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,380
So they are electronic.

572
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,640
Yeah. So I would like to I would like to hack these electronics

573
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,580
instead of kill the instead of kill the thing

574
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,880
that we put in this to kill them every time.

575
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,480
OK, so yeah, I mean, you could you could try to like seek it out.

576
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,840
You'll have disadvantage just because you can't see it.

577
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,840
But how much how much like can I see ahead of me with this flashlight?

578
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,140
It looks like I got like it's like a like a good amount.

579
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,140
So you can move a bit further and you'll see if you can see it.

580
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,140
Okay, let's do that.

581
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,140
Okay, cool. So just move your character how much further you want to go.

582
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:35,140
As you tiptoe through these sort of sterile hallways.

583
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:41,140
Okay, and let's reveal a little bit more of what's happening here.

584
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:43,140
And I have this guy with me.

585
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
Okay.

586
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,140
Mm-hmm.

587
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:47,140
Travis, would you like to join me?

588
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:48,140
Yes.

589
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,140
So you can see one of the Doatwake daddies.

590
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,140
What does that say?

591
00:39:52,140 --> 00:40:07,220
the

592
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,620
open sort of door, looks like it's in what would be somebody's office.

593
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:14,920
So you can probably try to, uh, saying that I'm gay.

594
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:19,920
So you can probably, uh, try to, uh, you can definitely try to hack it now.

595
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,920
Um, and you're going to be able to hack it automatically.

596
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,220
Oh my god, whoa.

597
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,220
Because it's not really, like, able to resist. It is sleeping.

598
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,220
It is asleep, yeah.

599
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,220
Mm-hmm.

600
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,720
Okay, so I, I, I'm going to hack it.

601
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Nice, cool.

602
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:39,520
So, let's review the hackability, the hacker mode ability.

603
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,280
So, the computer can go hacker mode and on a failed intelligence saving throw, which we

604
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,720
won't talk about, you lodge yourself, your computer tower, into the Don't Wake Daddy

605
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:49,080
and they can do whatever you want as the robot.

606
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,280
So the bot is able to move, so yeah, you do that, and now what do you want to do with

607
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,560
it?

608
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:08,480
is

609
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:22,400
the

610
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,960
more than one close by, it's like, you know, one goes off and then another goes off.

611
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,760
Yeah, could I, I would like to communicate to all the ones in the, in the area and let

612
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:42,520
them know that we have, that it's, it is a pizza party and we have to all meet in the

613
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:46,400
center of the room and run into each other really fast.

614
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,900
Okay, let's make that... So I was thinking about what to give you for hacker checks.

615
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,900
I was thinking we should just do Arcana for you. So roll Arcana.

616
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:01,900
And I'll say that DC for this... Yeah, you have a very good one.

617
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:06,900
I'll say that DC is going to be a 16 for that.

618
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:11,900
You should give him a... To make him... For hacking, you should give him a puzzle that's basically just playing

619
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,820
connect the dots but it's on a black background and it's green so it looks

620
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:21,820
like computers. That's a really good idea. Yeah I got a 26. Yeah so what do you say

621
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:28,700
to the other don't wake daddy bots? Hey don't wake daddy bots like me there is a

622
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:35,860
serious pizza type party in the middle of this room and I'm gonna need every

623
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:48,820
the

624
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,720
pop pop pop pop sounds as they all wake up and you hear them like all sort of

625
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,620
walk towards the center of the room. Okay. And so like I'll reveal a little bit

626
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:04,100
more because you could hear that too.

627
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:09,860
And then I have an awesome plan also. Yeah nice so they're all in the center

628
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:17,060
of the room except the yours. Okay so because it's some it's a bot I mean I

629
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,060
I would assume it has a self-destruct button with a timer, yeah?

630
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,060
[laughter]

631
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,060
I'll allow it!

632
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,060
What are you thinking?

633
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:30,060
Oh, I'm thinking I set the self-destruct button with a timer

634
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:34,060
and then I inject my fucking computer ass out of the back

635
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,060
probably land on Sullivan's dead body

636
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,060
and shoot my bot right into the middle of the room

637
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:42,060
and watch, I mean, sit back and watch the fireworks, baby.

638
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,060
Hey, I like that!

639
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:54,060
Let's do another Arcana check to see if you can hack into the self-destruct function.

640
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:55,060
25.

641
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,820
Yeah, you're the king of this.

642
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,900
And then what we'll do is we'll do a...

643
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,900
Let's do a Dexterity saving throw for you with advantage, because that was a very solid...

644
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,900
You could perfectly time when you want this thing to explode.

645
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,900
So what are you doing?

646
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,900
16?

647
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:14,600
All right, cool.

648
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,100
What are you doing?

649
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,600
Describe it to me because you succeeded.

650
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,900
Okay, so I already described it, but I guess I'll describe it again.

651
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:21,800
All right, man.

652
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:24,600
Set the timer for I mean, I'm pretty fast.

653
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,400
It'll probably only take me like one second.

654
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,100
So I'll set it for one second.

655
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,800
Well, that's too much that it can't go 30 feet in one second.

656
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:35,300
So I'll set it for five seconds and then I'll shoot it.

657
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:43,000
I'll shoot my computer body back out into my demon body and I'll

658
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:48,520
also put a cartoon bomb on the screen on the Don't Wake Daddy bot.

659
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,240
Just as kind of a like, kind of a fuck you, you know?

660
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,160
And also, and...

661
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,840
No, no, I don't have any pizza, do I?

662
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:01,840
No.

663
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:06,040
Okay, I just scrapped the pizza, it was all a ruse.

664
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:07,040
No, what were you gonna do?

665
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:12,600
I was gonna maybe like put like some pizza in the room.

666
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,840
(laughing)

667
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:17,400
- Yeah, this is pizza, no.

668
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,840
- Okay, so it's pizza, so they're like,

669
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,440
they're in the right moments, they're like,

670
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,640
oh, this is awesome, and then they explode.

671
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,040
- Yeah. - All right, cool.

672
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,640
- Then when they explode,

673
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,780
standing where one of the bots was, is me.

674
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,840
And I say, I bet you weren't expecting to see me here.

675
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,240
And then some awesome plot twist music plays,

676
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,320
and it's like a montage of I was running in circles outside.

677
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,520
You see me switching clothes--

678
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,560
- How'd you do it?

679
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,560
Switching clothes with with Patrick Yoda

680
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:46,600
so he becomes the arcade repairman and I become the guard and then he's gonna be

681
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:51,440
Like climbing up the side of the building and going into like the gutter on it

682
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:56,140
And then I'm going through the pipes and then I'm like crawling through the pipes between the floors and then I crawl through the plumbing

683
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:58,140
up inside one of the

684
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,100
We're gonna have you roll a couple stealth checks

685
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,920
He just said

686
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,120
I just walked in the

687
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:19,000
Continuity

688
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,320
All right, they come roll his shit if you want to be such a

689
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:34,320
Okay, what do I have to roll I'm gonna beast it let's do a stealth check to I guess get into events without anybody noticing

690
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:42,640
Okay, well first of all I'm wearing a perfect guard disguise and the guards are chasing Patrick Yoda because I switched with him and second

691
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,720
Of all the ability to turn invisible. So you're wearing a girl. I'm gonna use that instead. You're wearing a guard disguise

692
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,400
Why did you go through the vent I switched?

693
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,560
Because I because I did if I had gone into the side door then I would have come up behind those guys and the plot twist

694
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560
Wouldn't have made any sense

695
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:04,040
I'm gonna make you roll for that then. All right, you just it's like perfect sense. Yeah. Thank you

696
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,560
Alright, so I'll say that we can review

697
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:19,320
Let's reveal more of the room at this point. Yeah, I revealed all this I already saw it all

698
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:26,360
Everything yeah, I pretty much saw everything already

699
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:32,520
Patrick you know, are you distracting the the team the trip distracting the guard?

700
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,300
I took off the arcade repairman suit and I walked in the front door

701
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:40,600
All right, the guards are going to attack you at the me

702
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,920
Why how are you?

703
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:55,640
Arcade repairman suit off. They're looking for an arcade repairman. They know you were the guard the entire time

704
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,040
Green and you're two feet tall. I'm three feet tall

705
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,360
All right, Patrick, just use a plot twist. You won't make your roll for it.

706
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,360
Oh, yeah, okay.

707
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:09,360
The plot twist was I was an arcade repairman.

708
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:12,860
Oh, wait, and I take out the thing that we're looking for.

709
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:16,860
[Laughter]

710
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:22,360
Pat, why don't you-- you could try to explain to them what's going on.

711
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:24,360
Oh, I take off the--

712
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,360
I take off the arcade repairman hat and I look at them and go,

713
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:42,440
the

714
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,880
All right, we're gonna roll initiative.

715
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:46,200
This is one of those just for laughs pranks from 2008.

716
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,000
Oh, okay, you're trying to persuade them.

717
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Okay, let's do a persuasion check then.

718
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,440
13.

719
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,480
One of them thinks maybe you're the just for laughs guy.

720
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,160
The other one is definitely sure you're not.

721
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,280
And you both get $15.

722
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,920
Do you have $15 on you?

723
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,920
I have $100. He needs 30, right?

724
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:08,760
I have $100.

725
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,600
You have $100.

726
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,160
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

727
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:18,320
Okay, I say and you both win an Xbox game because in my inventory I have every Xbox game ever

728
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,520
Okay, roll persuasion again. You get another chance

729
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,280
another 13

730
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:30,040
One of the guards are the other guys like he's giving us an Xbox game. Let's just go just a little freak

731
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:35,720
You know the guards like fine, but if we see you around here, you're fucked. You got it. Hey

732
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,560
Hello

733
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:38,920
ODST

734
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:43,820
So they go back to their post so you try to go to the side door they would probably see you

735
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:48,760
So you might have to just chill outside unless you want to like start something with them

736
00:49:48,760 --> 00:50:00,900
I I'm in it. I walk back and I'm in a don't wake daddy repairman

737
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:07,900
costume. How would you know to get that?

738
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,900
You wouldn't know. So we'll come back to it.

739
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,900
Dress up as a blueprint repairman. That's what we should have done from the beginning.

740
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,900
Okay, that I dress up as a blueprint repairman. So you guys can go to the computer here and

741
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,900
start searching the files. There's no issue getting the information from there.

742
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,200
got the there's no issue because I already hacked it 20 minutes ago.

743
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,400
Okay. Yeah, you get the blueprint for the facility.

744
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,600
Now the dope week daddy bots are gone.

745
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,800
You could pretty easily get out through the side door that said,

746
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,800
you know getting out all at once and getting by the guards back

747
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:49,700
to the car.

748
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,900
I would say you'd have to either move stealthily or kind of come

749
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,900
up with a way around that unless you want to you know again incur

750
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,600
trouble down the line.

751
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,600
Do we have what we need from this facility?

752
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Yes.

753
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:01,600
Can we get the blueprint?

754
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,600
Mm-hmm.

755
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,600
You can just get it from the computer though.

756
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
You're already there and the Doki Parry bots are gone.

757
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,600
Oh yeah, alright.

758
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:06,600
Cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.

759
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,600
Alright, so let's get it from the computer.

760
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,600
Mm-hmm.

761
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,600
Okay, so let's start by logging onto the computer.

762
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,600
Yeah, the computer says, "Here you go."

763
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Oh, no, no, no.

764
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
Okay, you go.

765
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:16,600
Yeah.

766
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:17,600
Okay, let's click log in.

767
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,600
Okay, it's loading.

768
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,600
Okay, it's loading.

769
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
This is taking too long.

770
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,600
I destroyed the computer.

771
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:22,600
And then the Plot Twist music plays in the background.

772
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:23,600
Oh, no.

773
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,600
Oh, no.

774
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600
Oh, no.

775
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,360
And then the plot twist music plays again and I hold up the blueprint that I already printed out when I'm sitting here earlier

776
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:36,000
It doesn't matter. God you saved me from my own rage. Yeah

777
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,520
Now there's a destroyed computer, which is you know, in addition to the don't wake daddy bots Leo. Let's see. All right, cool

778
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,720
So you got it now? Yeah again, you guys can go back out the side door rip up the blueprint

779
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:54,480
All right, you don't have to do copy now

780
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,480
*laughter*

781
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,480
Oh my god

782
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,480
You're a fucking asshole

783
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,480
I'm getting confused between

784
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,480
Heists and

785
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:06,480
Magicians

786
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,480
*laughter*

787
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,480
You're pulling an infinite

788
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,480
string of tied together blueprints

789
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,480
out of your ass

790
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,480
sleeve

791
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
Okay so I think we should get out of here

792
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,480
You can just leave

793
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,480
You wanna leave him there?

794
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:29,480
up

795
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,480
All right, how do you guys want to get out of here?

796
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:35,080
Keep in mind you have to cross by the guards at the front of the building to get out

797
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,160
All right, I pull the hammers back on my golden deagles

798
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:44,580
Yeah, I'm gonna kill them. We haven't fought anything yet. I'm down to kill. Okay, let's go kill

799
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:49,640
Does Travis us let have one golden deagle or two

800
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:54,920
I guess I thought I had two but maybe I only have one I

801
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,560
I mean you said you had two. Let's give you, I think you have both. The golden bullets are what you're gonna need.

802
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:06,080
Oh, right. But I have regular 50 action express. Yes. Yes. Yes.

803
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,920
Yeah, that's tight. Yeah, you're gonna kill the guards?

804
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,000
Yeah, whatever if we have to sure fine.

805
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,720
Okay, you guys want to see me do a trick shot?

806
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:18,880
Yeah

807
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,160
Yes

808
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:23,260
Okay, cool, so you can go up and try to kill them

809
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:28,160
if you want to sort of get the jump on them, you could try to move stealthily to see if you can get like a

810
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:33,380
Sneak attack round. Yeah, let's

811
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,720
Okay

812
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,040
A lot of honor in that I kind of want to line up a shot to kill both of them in one

813
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,520
With one bullet

814
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,520
It's gonna be hard but yeah go for it

815
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,220
So yeah, you guys walk you just guys just walk out and face the guards I'm sneaking I'm sneaking ahead of them

816
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,660
I want to get a surprise round. I don't care what they do. All right, how are you? Where are you gonna hide?

817
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:07,080
Well, I'm also wearing a guard outfit question mark. So maybe I can get a moment of like confusion

818
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:13,320
- out of that I would say if you roll your stealth high enough like yeah, I'm just gonna I'm like

819
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,560
So, I don't know what the layout is, but I'm kind of like I assume they're like out

820
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:22,160
They're kind of like outside the door. They're like, yeah, so I'm trying I'm trying to kind of like sidle in like I've been standing

821
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,520
Behind the desk at the lobby or something. Mm-hmm. Okay, cool

822
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,040
And then sorry, what are you gonna say Ray?

823
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:33,980
I just follow Travis and I'm just like I kind of just want to see him kill these guys

824
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,120
Mm-hmm. I'm not really planning on helping though. Okay, cool

825
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,140
And Patrick Yoda, you're just where are you right?

826
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:48,520
I'm your outside. We know I'm I'm looking through the disguise box and I'm just like no ah

827
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:51,600
No, I wouldn't work. Ah

828
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,440
crap

829
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:57,560
Okay cool

830
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:04,920
Shit you just you sort of square up on these guys and you're like hey, where the fuck did you just come from?

831
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,960
Yeah

832
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,960
I, um...

833
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,960
I'm filming with the

834
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,960
Barry Gey iPad. I'm like, "Come on, Travis, do it!"

835
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,960
"Come on!" I'm recording the call on my phone.

836
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,960
This is such a bad idea for

837
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,960
criminals. Okay, so...

838
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,960
My gym arm is not

839
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:44,640
gripping the Desert Eagle correctly. It's upside down. I'm looking down at it now and realizing that I'm not

840
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,480
poised to do a trick shot because my chimp arm is not as dexterous as I

841
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:55,680
thought it was. But I do just aim my other regular test vehicle at one of their heads.

842
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:01,880
Alright, cool. Let's roll initiative for you and the guards. Can I get a

843
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:06,880
surprise round if I roll a stealth right now? Do they notice me? Let's roll stealth

844
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:26,260
of

845
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:38,700
the

846
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:44,380
I'm gonna lay down good. I'm gonna bury back out. Mm-hmm. I pipe

847
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:47,460
And you're gonna have advantage on

848
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:53,540
Okay, your assassin ability. That's a 23 second one. Definitely hits roll for damage

849
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:57,780
Is it a sneak attack from assassinate if it's on a surprise round?

850
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:06,260
I'm critical. Yes. It's a guaranteed critical. Oh, yeah shit. It is. All right, so that's 16 damage and then I get a second attack

851
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:14,820
Okay, that's 22 damage. Yeah, you just one of them you just like you just pop up out of nowhere and just

852
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:17,940
Beat one of them to death and you hear all the people it's like oh

853
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:24,420
Like screaming as you're like beating this guy as I'm piping him down. Yeah, say that

854
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:28,280
Yeah, Travis Osler that wasn't one you were aiming at so maybe you just move your gun

855
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:37,120
That was the one I was aiming in so now I'm aiming it at the other guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

856
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:56,500
the

857
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,300
(laughter)

858
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:01,300
Did something like intimidating?

859
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:03,300
No, it's blurry now.

860
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:05,300
Oh.

861
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,300
(laughter)

862
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:11,860
He's got self-conscious suddenly about his like, how messy his room is.

863
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:13,860
It just changes his background to blurry.

864
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:15,860
Alright, and now you're up.

865
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:17,860
Uh, um, uh, Travis, sorry.

866
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:23,540
Okay, so I got really nervous and forgot how to do trick shots.

867
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:30,740
So I have my Desert Eagle pointed at his head and I look at Ray William Johnson and ask,

868
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:31,940
"Okay, what would be cool?"

869
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:37,380
You could like, so you just have the gun at his head?

870
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,260
Yeah.

871
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:44,340
So like maybe you do like a battle, a flip first and then you shoot him.

872
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,740
Okay, I'll try that.

873
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,260
Try doing a flip.

874
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:51,940
Okay, so I crouch to get into flipping position.

875
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:53,640
(laughing)

876
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:55,620
- Okay, so I mean, it's looking good so far.

877
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,700
Here, let me put on the slow motion mode on the camera.

878
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,400
(laughing)

879
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:03,420
Okay, now, now go.

880
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,180
- Okay, cool.

881
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:07,660
Do an acrobatics check and then do an attack.

882
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:08,700
Nice, 20.

883
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,220
Yeah, you execute that for me.

884
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,460
(laughing)

885
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:16,380
Roll attack, roll attack with the deagle.

886
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:17,440
- Oh, didn't I?

887
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,740
- You click on the golden deagle roll.

888
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:20,580
- For the damage.

889
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:33,540
the

890
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:46,540
this

891
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:48,540
Yep, you got two attacks.

892
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:56,540
Alright, so I have to put down my other gun so that I can flip the Travis gun around.

893
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,540
This time, could you do like a spin?

894
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:08,540
Yeah, I'll give that a shot. This spin, I'm not going to leave the ground, I'm just going to walk in a very tight circle.

895
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,540
That's cool.

896
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:14,540
Alright, so another acrobatics check.

897
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:17,900
No, if you're gonna walk in a tight circle, I think you got that.

898
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:20,540
Well, 22, it looks really good!

899
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,540
Best spin I've ever seen.

900
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,540
Alright.

901
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:28,940
And, yeah, I tried to put a little English on it with my Krav Maga.

902
01:00:28,940 --> 01:00:30,940
How's that?

903
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:32,940
Yeah, leave that there, that's fine.

904
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,940
Sorry, some guy's knocking on my window.

905
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,940
Try to slip that there, that's fine.

906
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:38,940
Okay.

907
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,940
[laughter]

908
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:42,940
Alright, so I also

909
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:44,940
I also did a grab on him.

910
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:46,940
Yeah, I did a grab on him.

911
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:48,940
Okay, the Krav Maga 2000,

912
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:51,940
that move, uh, you try to karate chop him, I guess,

913
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,940
or with like, I guess the sharp end of a pen.

914
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:55,940
Um, and, uh...

915
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:57,940
No, it's with the gun. I'm holding two guns.

916
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:58,940
I've got no other...

917
01:00:58,940 --> 01:00:59,940
Okay, not Michael, sorry.

918
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,940
Yeah, you miss with the 12.

919
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,940
So you spin in place and then sort of

920
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,940
try to whack him with the gun,

921
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:06,940
and he just sort of gets out of the way.

922
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:07,940
He's like, he's like,

923
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,940
retching back and forth with the ball.

924
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:10,940
Okay, wait, then I want to see if I can

925
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:31,940
can

926
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:33,940
You almost did it really cool.

927
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,940
You sort of do the thing when you're trying to learn how to...

928
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,940
You just watch the circle of Enzkwagas armor.

929
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,940
[Laughter]

930
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:41,940
You do the thing when you're trying to learn how to

931
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:43,940
spit pencils between your fingers

932
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:45,940
and you're just gonna like...

933
01:01:45,940 --> 01:01:47,940
I do the rubber pencil trick

934
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,940
with the Golden Beagle.

935
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:51,940
It's not rubber. It doesn't look like rubber at all.

936
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:53,940
[Laughter]

937
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:55,940
Alright, cool. Ray, it is your turn.

938
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,940
Let's wait. Sorry, Patrick Yoda, did you roll?

939
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:59,940
You didn't roll initiative. Roll initiative.

940
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:05,540
Okay, I'm still looking through the the disguise bin you don't have to fight then. All right, cool. We could just have you just

941
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:08,220
I'm just I'm like pulling my hair out and just like

942
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:14,880
All right, you're up Ray

943
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:22,340
I feel like I feel like Travis has got this kind of like I I really just I mean, okay, whatever

944
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:26,320
I I don't think I rolled initiative though. Did I you did you guys six?

945
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:33,860
the

946
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,300
The guard did really bad, so you're still up.

947
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,500
I'm gonna throw my sexual grenade between them.

948
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,460
I got a 6, he got a 5. This is so fucked up.

949
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,860
Oh, I'm sorry, you're right. You should go.

950
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,980
I'm sorry.

951
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:48,740
Yeah, I mean...

952
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:52,420
I dive in front of the grenade, I cover my body.

953
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,420
Okay, alright.

954
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,420
As a reaction, do you want to take that damage?

955
01:02:56,420 --> 01:03:01,300
As a reaction, I would like to dive toward the grenade and use the guard to cover it.

956
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:06,900
You dive into the guard and put his body on it.

957
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:10,900
And it's technically not a reaction because my turn is before Caleb's.

958
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:15,900
Alright. So yeah, your action. We'll say you did a joint action.

959
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:17,900
Where you held the guard.

960
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:19,900
It's like when we were co-parenting.

961
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:21,900
We did a lot of this.

962
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:27,900
You guys smile at each other sweetly as this guard swallows a grenade.

963
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:29,900
Yeah, a cum grenade.

964
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:49,460
the

965
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:57,700
and I'm like, I got two maracas and I'm like, yo, hello.

966
01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:00,900
Yeah.

967
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:06,940
We're like, we're like, yeah, we're, we're, we're burning rubber and a

968
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:08,540
giant Flintstones car.

969
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:09,660
We're all running.

970
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:15,380
It's all of it's just passed out, um, in the backseat, I guess.

971
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:16,980
Um, wherever you want them.

972
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:32,700
the

973
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,700
I'm not sure what I'm saying here.

974
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:40,140
to do that on the same day. The only issue being that there's definitely a little bit

975
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:48,020
more suspicion around you now that you sort of needlessly murdered two guys. When you

976
01:04:48,020 --> 01:04:52,260
get back and you're sort of, you know, starting to crack open drinks to celebrate, you get

977
01:04:52,260 --> 01:05:00,700
a knock at the door. Somebody got past your guards, Barry Gee, in your absence. Does anybody

978
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:07,700
get the door? I'll get it! No. I got a smart door. I got a smart door that opens up by itself.

979
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:15,620
It's very unsafe. You accidentally bought a fart door and then it farts right in Travis's

980
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:21,220
face. Oh that smells horrible! Oh my god! Why would they even make a fart door? Oh, it's

981
01:05:21,220 --> 01:05:27,220
disgusting. I like the smell of it. I like it. It reminds me of home. I'm running, I

982
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:36,460
run up I'm in the sombrero I have the maracas oh fuck okay what the hell was

983
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:48,020
that it smells it smells bad here oh I think Jesus it solvent gets up it's

984
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:52,940
like a foot nearly still want a lot of a lot of paid and he gets this door he

985
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:59,940
opens it. And who's behind the door? None other than your old friend slash femme fatale,

986
01:05:59,940 --> 01:06:07,540
Mommy Goodlegs. And we'll end it there. Did she make that spell? Holy shit. I need to

987
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:15,740
update my fan theories.
