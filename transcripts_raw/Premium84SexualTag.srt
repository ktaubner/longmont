[laughter]

00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Looooord.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,600
Awwww.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,600
(yells)

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,060
- Aw.

9
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,580
- That's beautiful.

10
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,980
That's beautiful, it's so kind.

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,900
- Aw, look at that, aw.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,780
- Oh, you wanna bring that up?

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,180
- Aw, your microphone, aw.

14
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,700
- You're gonna bring that up?

15
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,540
Yes, I've been wearing my camel hat

16
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:39,580
and I don't know what happened.

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,620
I think it's 'cause it's very old.

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:42,460
- Yeah.

19
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,380
- It gave me a rash.

20
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:51,860
It probably had like, somebody probably smoked Camel cigarettes into the hat for like 20 years.

21
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:55,380
Probably. Whoever owned that hat got it with Camel cash.

22
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,580
They smoked the cigarette through the hat as an extra filter.

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:06,660
Yeah, it's made out of the one material that would sop up cigarette smoke the most.

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,460
Yeah.

25
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,100
Corduroy.

26
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,860
Yeah.

27
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:17,540
And I've been wearing it and now I just have like a huge like the sweat where the sweatband

28
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:22,020
of the hat would be on my forehead just a big red line.

29
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,020
Yeah.

30
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,620
And it draws attention to like my forehead being big.

31
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,060
It's very funny.

32
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,500
It looks like you look kind of like Voltorb.

33
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
Yeah.

34
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Yeah.

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
Maybe yeah.

36
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,460
So I gotta stop wearing that hat for a little bit.

37
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,700
You have to put it through a cleanse.

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,900
Yeah, I did.

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,620
That's the thing.

40
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,220
Their sickness runs deep in that hat.

41
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,220
It's infected.

42
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:49,220
It's true.

43
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,260
It's cursed.

44
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,700
It's the cursed hat.

45
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Yeah.

46
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,980
It's like, you know, it probably like a wizard put a curse on it or something and it has

47
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,660
a bunch of like microscopic spikes on the inside.

48
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,300
Someone probably died of emphysema in that hat.

49
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,300
Yeah.

50
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,820
yeah it wasn't a camel hat before but then somebody there's some of the person

51
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,420
who wore it all the time died of emphysema and they're like we should put

52
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:24,740
the camel look it wasn't corduroy either it like wrinkled up yeah yeah I gotta

53
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:30,020
get I gotta clean that hat I'm worried about breaking the brim of it if I clean

54
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:37,020
it. But then it's like, I mean, that's the whole of my forehead.

55
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:45,260
It looks crazy. It's such a clean line. I feel like most rashes, even if you get it

56
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,940
from something, it won't stop right where the thing is.

57
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,260
I mean, it's like dry skin. It feels like eczema.

58
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,740
I got a haircut too.

59
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,580
Yeah.

60
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,620
So I can't like put my hair over it.

61
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,360
Yeah, you should get a wig.

62
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,380
Maybe.

63
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,860
Oh dude, there's probably a wig store around here.

64
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:05,860
There's gotta be a wig.

65
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,060
There's probably like 10 wig stores on your block.

66
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,060
Yeah, I should probably get a toupee.

67
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,700
Yeah, you should get a big blonde Jimmy Houston wig.

68
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,540
Yeah.

69
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,860
Or like a cut, yeah.

70
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,660
And then you can like kinda,

71
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,880
you can cut it just right above your eyes.

72
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,580
So it doesn't--

73
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,580
So I just have like big bangs.

74
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,580
Yeah, exactly.

75
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,180
Just big white bangs.

76
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,180
Yeah.

77
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,380
That'd be great.

78
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:33,820
And then you put a hat on over it because nobody expects you to put a hat on over a

79
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,820
toupee.

80
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,820
Right, right.

81
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:41,140
See that may be, okay, yet like one of the most realistic, maybe it's like horse hair

82
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,140
or like real person hair.

83
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,060
I think real person hair is probably more realistic than horse hair.

84
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,660
Well, no, aren't most expensive wigs made out of horse hair?

85
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:56,700
I feel like maybe, I don't know, actually now I'm talking out of my ass I think, but you

86
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,700
know I would think that...

87
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:58,700
Yeah, you don't know shit about wigs, bitch.

88
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,060
I would think you're probably not allowed to...

89
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,820
Are you allowed to make wigs out of people hair?

90
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,820
I guess you must be.

91
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820
Yeah.

92
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:06,940
Well, I mean for cancer patients.

93
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,940
That's true.

94
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:14,180
We, in my high school, we had for like, like the big event at our school was we had this

95
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:21,540
pep rally and every year we had this one pep rally where like this guy organized it so

96
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:28,380
So we did a mass hair donation for Pantene, Locks of Love.

97
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:36,020
And for all four years of high school, and in middle school I knew about it because it's

98
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,900
the one thing in our town, all four years of high school I had to go, you weren't allowed

99
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,380
to skip it, you had to go to this, you had to go and just watch everybody get their hair

100
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,380
cut.

101
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:54,480
Like everybody who volunteered get their hair cut and then it was like this weird like stigma thing where it's like girls who had like

102
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:01,580
Long hair, it's like well, why don't you donate and it's like this is the fucking we had hair bullies at my fucking high school, dude

103
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,140
You know, I would you know

104
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,340
I would do the thing like where if you have to take like a urine sample

105
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,920
Telling drug test or whatever I would go into the bathroom and then I'd fill the bag with cat hair

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:16,460
This is my hair, yeah

107
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,460
That's my thing.

108
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,460
No, you do it for the urine sample.

109
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,460
Yeah, that's true.

110
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:27,460
You put cat hair in it, it's like, "No, that's just how I pee."

111
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,460
Yeah, it looks like, you know, I will say there's a significant amount of drugs in here.

112
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,460
It also seems you may be 50% cat based on your DNA.

113
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:43,460
Dude, fucking, uh, what was I going to say?

114
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,460
I just looked up, um...

115
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,880
They have 23andMe for dogs.

116
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,460
Yeah, I know, yeah.

117
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,140
I kinda, that's one of those, that'll trick you.

118
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,420
That'll, I mean, if you're a dog owner,

119
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,380
that's, your brain just gets warped.

120
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,240
It's like, I don't know, it's like,

121
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:04,220
it's like having some kind of like magical artifact

122
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,380
that gives you power and then you like turn evil,

123
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,220
you know what I mean?

124
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,260
Like having a dog makes you into the kind of person

125
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,420
who wants to get 23andMe for your dog.

126
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,860
It's true, yeah.

127
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,700
I just wanna know what kind it is.

128
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,300
It's like it doesn't matter at all.

129
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,740
I've thought about buying that so many times and had to stop myself.

130
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,620
I think it makes sense.

131
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,980
I think I would definitely want to know what breed my dog...

132
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:34,020
Just because of the breed characteristics, like, "Oh, my dog likes to sniff my ass."

133
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,860
He's part bloodhound.

134
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,260
He's part ass sniffer.

135
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,780
You know that German type breed that sniffs asses?

136
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,380
Yeah, he's one of those.

137
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,620
I mean the thing about my dog is like because of her shape you know there's

138
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,420
either a corgi or a dachshund somewhere in there and then beyond that it's probably just

139
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:53,620
like one percent of everything else that's not interesting.

140
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:57,260
Well I think that's kind of cool like knowing that there's like a shit ton.

141
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:03,340
I don't know I just want to get that and then put my own DNA in my own DNA.

142
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,340
That sounds like I'm cumming in the tube.

143
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,340
(laughter)

144
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,340
Sending in your pet 23andMe and you're like...

145
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:14,340
Just your own jizz in the tube.

146
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,340
Yeah, well that would get you in trouble too, because even if it wasn't yours, that might be worse if it's not yours.

147
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,340
Right.

148
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,340
Might be worse if it's your dog's.

149
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,340
(laughter)

150
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,340
I fucking... ah, shit. I... I...

151
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,340
I misread the instructions. I didn't know you were supposed to take a swab of their cheek. I thought it was something else.

152
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:40,860
That would suck if you like jacked off your dog. If you jacked off your dog that

153
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,180
would be so horrible. No, if you put in like your own hair to like send to the

154
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,060
to the to like your the pet 23andMe thing and it came back and you're like

155
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,660
yeah you're one of those you're like one of those um those super inbred like yeah

156
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,100
well you know the ones that has his faces always look like they like just got

157
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,300
stung by a bee they look like really fucked up. Bull terrier? Is it a bull

158
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,140
- Bull terrier?

159
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:06,320
- I like bull terriers, like the target dog?

160
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,160
- Yeah, bull terrier.

161
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,360
But I mean, just imagine if your DNA came back

162
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,860
and they said you were a bull terrier.

163
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,700
- 100% bull terrier.

164
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,520
- That's maybe one of the worst,

165
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,020
one of the worst, what's the worst dog

166
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:14,860
that they could tell you you are?

167
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,460
- No, you know what would be worse?

168
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,220
It would be worse if it said like 99% human, 1% dog.

169
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,660
(laughing)

170
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,100
Like somewhere along the line, like a grandma,

171
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,440
or like an aunt, or no, it's probably a grandma, right?

172
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,280
(laughing)

173
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,020
- Yeah, I mean, I don't think you're aunt.

174
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,420
Yeah, a grandma or something like fucked a dog. Yeah

175
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,620
It'd be gross

176
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:47,560
Yeah, I just I just um, I looked up when we're talking about wigs I googled what is the best wig material

177
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,820
And this is from Oprah's website. Okay, okay for the most natural-looking wig up for one made of human hair

178
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,940
Okay. Yeah

179
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,500
There are two types of wigs human hair and synthetic as you might guess human hair provides the most natural

180
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:04,980
natural look says Faye Norris a hair stylist at Rock Paper Salon because it's

181
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,180
a great name for that's yeah right that's a bird God level pun it just rolls off

182
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:13,780
the tongue because it's real it falls and swings the same way natural hair does

183
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,180
plus it can be styled blow-dried curled or ironed like business as usual but then

184
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,480
we get this next paragraph here still there are different types of human hair

185
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,980
European which is a little finer is the most sought-after and most expensive

186
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,940
Norris Indian which is softer and has more texture is also very popular but a

187
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:37,300
little less expensive and Chinese hair. And Chinese hair which tends to be thick

188
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:43,180
and straight is the least expensive and most prevalent. Oh my god. I didn't expect

189
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:46,780
I mean I think about it I'm like I guess the wig people would probably

190
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:50,820
differentiate that and like probably get weird about it but I didn't expect to

191
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:58,020
read it on this website. What the fuck? Yeah, that's the way the wigs racist. I would expect

192
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,780
to read that in an article that's like, here's the problem with wigs, not how to find your

193
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:19,420
favorite wig. Shit. Yeah. God, I, we need to cancel. I'm not buying a wig. Anytime soon.

194
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:24,460
me tell you that. Not after reading that. Yeah, not after knowing now that wigs are racist.

195
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:30,740
Christ. Yeah, and luckily, yeah, luckily the synthetic wigs are not racist at all because

196
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,540
they're made by Chinese people in sweatshops. But we don't take their hair though, so it's

197
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:44,860
fine. They're made out of like runoffs of like some kind of plastic that's being made.

198
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,940
Like some kind of plastic that they were like they

199
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,340
Accidentally put it in a lathe or something like that. No, I said this kind of looks like hair

200
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:58,100
It's a little bit like you know, yeah, it does give me insane hives whenever I touch it

201
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:05,480
But you know, it's probably fine and everybody who's worked in our factory dies at the age of 30 from some kind of strange alien

202
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
lump

203
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,100
Just like a wig that's made entirely out of Kevlar strings. Yo

204
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,080
You like tighten it up and yeah, you could try to pull it

205
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:23,020
Yeah, when you're like when you're about when you're like in danger you like pull on it really hard and it tightens together reverse Bayonetta

206
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:29,700
Cuz she I've never really played Bayonetta. Yeah, I don't know her doesn't her hair turn into guns

207
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:35,860
I don't know. All I know is her leg goes in a portal and Smash Brothers. That's true. She wears glasses

208
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,260
I know that too. Does her hair turn to guns? I don't know Bayonetta hair. No, it's crazy is

209
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,860
is you've done way more googling than I have ever done

210
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,220
on an episode in the past eleven minutes. I like to google stuff.

211
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,660
I know but...

212
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,940
See that's the thing is I probably google the most. I mean now that

213
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,700
Caleb's not here we can get into the nitty gritty the truth.

214
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,640
Maybe it's because I just type too slow. Maybe that's the problem.

215
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,980
I think also I google stuff. I'm a very fast... I skim very well.

216
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,620
I'm good at it. I don't.

217
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,620
I'm I'm I'm I read it as pace of 1000 words a second.

218
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:18,820
I don't think that she makes her hair.

219
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,120
I can't tell by this Google search and I'm not going to read.

220
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,020
What did you look up?

221
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,120
Does Bayonetta?

222
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,220
I looked up Bayonetta hair guns.

223
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,920
So maybe that's that's probably yeah, maybe type in type in does

224
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,320
Bayonetta hair a gun?

225
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,420
Does Bayonetta hair does Bayonetta have a child?

226
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,920
Is the suggestion.

227
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Okay, look up Bayonetta Lady Pregnant.

228
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,920
Okay, yeah, hold on. Bayonetta Lady Pregnant Bowser.

229
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Okay, ooh.

230
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
Let's see here.

231
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,920
The images here.

232
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,920
You know, surprisingly there's not a single image of this search of Bayonetta Pregnant.

233
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,920
Oh.

234
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
This is very, you know.

235
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,920
Well that ruins the fucking episode.

236
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
Yeah, we don't have anything to talk about anymore.

237
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,940
- I'm in.

238
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,100
Delete the fucking, delete the files.

239
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,100
This sucks.

240
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,420
- Oh, I think, oh, a fan fiction came up.

241
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,380
Oh no, this is not a fan,

242
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,280
this is a page of Rule 34 Bowser porn.

243
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,120
- Oh, okay.

244
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,680
This is probably like the third episode in a row

245
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,980
that we've looked up something like that.

246
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,660
- Yeah, hey, why not?

247
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,220
- I need to stop burping right into the microphone.

248
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:32,540
- Sex games tagged Bowser.

249
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,820
(laughing)

250
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,320
- Sex game, sexual tag?

251
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,800
(laughing)

252
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,120
- Sexual dude, I--

253
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,960
- Sexual tag with Bowser.

254
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,280
- I hate playing sexual tag with Bowser.

255
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,880
- Oh man, you know why?

256
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,480
Is 'cause you always gotta chase behind him

257
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,880
and he's got those spikes on his back.

258
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,720
- Yeah.

259
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,540
- So you gotta fuckin'.

260
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,380
- He gets way overzealous too.

261
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,080
He grabs me and he jumps up in the air

262
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,040
and he jumps down into the, off the screen.

263
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,840
- Yeah, the trick when you're playing

264
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,560
sexual tag with Bowser is you gotta get up in his butt.

265
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,160
- You gotta get in his shell.

266
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,000
to crawl in between his shell and his stomach.

267
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,120
Sexual tag. That is like...

268
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,200
like, 'cause there's like

269
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,000
naked twister

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,160
so I think along those... There's what?

271
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,520
Is it naked twister or strip twister? I don't know.

272
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,100
Both of those sound... I mean

273
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,320
why not just get naked and hug?

274
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,840
No, 'cause there... I know it's naked twister

275
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,440
'cause I think there's a line in Jack and Jill

276
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,560
This is something somebody told me.

277
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,800
I don't think I've ever seen Jack and Jill.

278
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,160
Somebody told me there's a line that says,

279
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,480
Al Pacino wants to play Naked Twister with your sister.

280
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
- Whoa.

281
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,840
- Yeah.

282
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,120
So Naked Twister exists.

283
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,680
- Naked Twister, that's a perversion

284
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,760
of both being naked and of Twister.

285
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,600
That's not right.

286
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,400
- And Twister's already a fucking perverted game.

287
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,020
- Yeah, that's a game that if you're older

288
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,320
than seven years old, you should not be playing.

289
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,680
That's a game to play with like--

290
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:06,040
- If you're like, playing it with your kids,

291
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,360
you're the spinner. - You should, yeah.

292
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
There's something's going on.

293
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,440
- That's weird.

294
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,600
- We're gonna get you in trouble.

295
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:17,840
- I don't know, I think that's an innocent, I don't--

296
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,000
- I think that's a fine game.

297
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
I think that--

298
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,920
- Sorry, sorry, Gilton Bradley.

299
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,760
Sorry that we're talking shit.

300
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,920
- That's an okay game for families to play with

301
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,760
in the family.

302
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,260
That's a family game only.

303
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,000
(laughing)

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000

00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000

306
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000

00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:39,800
Candyland wiki. I don't know if you're there too. If you go to Jolly's page,

366
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:48,620
Um, it says "Jolly title placehold species dinosaur mole hybrid"

367
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:52,060
Oh yeah, yeah he's like a weird fucker. Jolly.

368
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:58,060
He doesn't look like a mole at all to me. He just looks like a creature.

369
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,860
What the hell?

370
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:05,340
There's just all the comments on Jolly, there's just like a hundred comments that just say "nice"

371
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,940
and just reply to each other.

372
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,660
There's all the characters and then somebody wrote "Gaba Ghoul"

373
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,700
smiley face. Oh yeah, I do see that. What the fuck is that? There's no...

374
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:22,060
There's no Capicola in Candyland. Enough redesigns! Stick to this version!

375
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,620
Just quit changing stuff and people will stop complaining. A squirrel could figure that out!

376
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,220
It's true. I think there has been too many Candyland redesigns.

377
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,020
Yeah. I'm gonna be the guy who's really pissed off that they're redesigning Candyland.

378
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,420
Yeah. Oh man. I'm gonna-

379
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,020
They made Gloppi a girl. They didn't do that. I wish they did.

380
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:47,980
What the fuck? I'd love to- I'd love to take her out to the Homecoming Dance.

381
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,380
Oh no. They-

382
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:53,100
Fucking- My brain just shut off for a second there.

383
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,820
Dude, the Princess Lolly character, who's a lollipop, they spell Lolly like the pedophile

384
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,460
anime thing. Oh no.

385
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,380
Oh, don't spell it like that. Respell it!

386
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,380
Come on, it's easy. It's easy to choose a different spelling.

387
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
Respell that thing.

388
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,380
That's not even how lollipop is spelled.

389
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:18,380
Candyland the Great Lollipop Adventure. Is that the PC game?

390
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,380

00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,420
Yes, that is the exact one.

398
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,380
That's the exact game,

399
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,460
and you go to Lord Licorice's house.

400
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,780
- That's a really good tagline.

401
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,540
We should definitely order this.

402
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,220
- Yeah, play it on stream.

403
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,020

404
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,860
- Yeah.

405
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,860
- You could get it used for 20 bucks.

406
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,860
- I mean, in all, we could probably, oh shit.

407
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,740

408
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:00,140

411
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,140
She had peanut brittle.

412
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
She's the one who had peanut brittle.

413
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,140

00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,240
- Were you sunning your perennium?

429
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,360
- No.

430
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,460
- You weren't? - The beach was crowded.

431
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,780
I can't do that.

432
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,060
- You weren't sunning your perennium?

433
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,060
You weren't-- - No!

434
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,660
I do that in the Porta Potties.

435
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,580
- Oh, okay.

436
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,420
- Yeah.

437
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,620
- You were not absorbing the sun's light

438
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
through your perennium?

439
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,620
- No.

440
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,620
- Wow.

441
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,500
- Do you think, do the people who do that put sunscreen on?

442
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
They have to, right?

443
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
- No, no, no, no, no.

444
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,540
They don't believe in it.

445
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,940
- They're gonna be like sterile or something.

446
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,540
- They don't know that.

449
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
- I guess they don't.

450
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:17,260
- God, do you think they like, do you think they just like being sunburned?

451
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,500
- That's freak shit.

452
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,420
Being sunburned is one of the worst things in the world.

453
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,420
I hate it.

454
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,420
- Yeah.

455
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,420
There's no way that like, I mean,

456
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,880
well no, 'cause it's like, I always do this where I say

457
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,580
like there's no way that X exists,

458
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,140
or there's no way that like X will,

459
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,320

The internet like, fucking, oh god damn it,

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,080
and everybody just does everything I don't know yeah I'm tired to let's just

465
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:03,400
keep talking about candy like no but just like the internet like the the amount of

466
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:09,800
information we have now as like boosted the amount of like weird fetish shit that

467
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:16,800
exists now and now there's like people like gun fetishes and like guys who like

468
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:23,400
like their whole thing is like like getting stuck in a bowl of porridge or

469
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,840

474
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:55,500
things like sexually that people like things too much now people like yeah too

475
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:00,020
much sexually and they got it cut it out exactly so I think what Patrick is saying

476
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:07,220
is that sex is designed to be between a man and a woman yes in wedlock and it

477
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,220
It must always result in a child.

478
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:12,900
Yes, that is exactly what I'm saying.

479
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:19,900
Sex should only be for procreation and you should not be putting anything on your thing.

480
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:31,780
Yeah, speaking of crazy fetish stuff, Niko, shout out Niko, she sent me a diaper lover

514
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,140
rock-and-roller Wow you don't expand your musical mind no well I mean it's

515
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,840
It's basically like, you know, it's what, it's like talking in a beat.

516
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,920
So it's like I preferred when someone shreds.

517
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,740
What the hell?

518
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,920
I'm into stuff like Mumford and Sons where people, they shred.

519
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,460
Like I really like Florence and the Machine is one rock and roll band I've been getting

520
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,460
really into lately.

521
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:47,220
You should check out Iron and Wine.

522
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,200
Yeah, dude, Iron and Wine, I mean, throw a little kiss makeup on them and that's the

523
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,860
perfect band if you ask me.

524
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:56,460

date they'd shred did when they when they'd shred into a solo

529
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,220
there's a guy who's in the rock and roll but it thinks he's in a rock and roll

530
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:16,660
but he doesn't know a rock and roll is it also

531
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,420

541
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,140
dude i

542
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,620
When that shit was coming out, like,

543
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,900
Boney Bear and Arcade Fire and shit,

544
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,360
I hated that so much.

545
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,800
- Yeah, and like Vampire Weekend.

546
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,640
Did you like Vampire Weekend?

547
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,460
- Yeah, no, no, no.

548
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,300
- Yeah, no, me too, dude.

549
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,140
All my friends in high school were into it.

550
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:08,180
The thing is, when Vampire Weekend got really big--

551
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:10,180
- I liked A Punk.

552
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,940
I think I liked the first album.

553
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,500
- Yeah, there's some, I mean, they have some nice stuff.

554
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,780
- Right, but I'm not like,

555
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,580
there was people I knew who were obsessed with those bands

556
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,580
Death Cab for Cutie.

557
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,580
Yeah, like I don't give a shit about that.

558
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,580
Yeah, by the time Vampire Weekend blew up,

559
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,580
that was already, like my mom would just

560
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,580
had been listening to Vampire Weekend in the car

561
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
for like a while, like that was just in my brain

562
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,580
that was like, "Oh, that's my mom's music."

563
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:35,580
Yeah. And then it's like, yeah, it's not

564
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
that's not, high schoolers shouldn't

565
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,580
be listening to that. They should be listening

566
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,580
to Power Violence

567
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,580
or Breakcore or

568
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,580
like Ambient.

569
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
They should be listening to Project X Straight Edge Revenge.

570
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,580
straight edge revenge.

571
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,580
That's right.

572
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,340
They should be learning to not drink and do drugs.

573
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,340
Yeah, exactly.

574
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:01,340
I'm as straight as the line that you snort up your nose and I'm as hard as the drugs that

575
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:04,580
you wear on your clothes.

576
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:12,300
Well yeah, that's the thing is that people don't understand these bands like Boney Bear

577
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:16,940
and Vampire Weekend, they all are secret drug references.

578
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,860
And there's references to sex.

579
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,100
I mean, A-punk, you know what the A stands for, alcohol.

580
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,100
Asshole.

581
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,180
Asshole, alcohol, butt-chugging.

582
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,580
And a vampire weekend is actually, if you go on Urban Dictionary, that's a slang term

583
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:39,980
for when you suck the blood out of heroin addicts to get high off their blood.

584
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,620
Yeah, you suck somebody's arm drinks.

585
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,860
Yeah, exactly.

586
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,920
And it gets you so fucked up, they last the whole weekend.

587
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,040
actually what that name means yeah which is you know fucked up for high schoolers

588
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:58,240
to be listening to it's not okay we got a higher an editor to cut out my burps yeah

589
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,720
and I mean the the Arctic monkeys don't get me started oh man you know that's

590
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,120
squiggly on the other cover I do that with cocaine my that was like my that's

591
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:13,680
my brother's like favorite band I do not do not fuck with them do you know I

592
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,080
I can't stand them. I think they have you know I don't fuck with them but I did

593
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,640
like the soundtrack to that movie submarine that the guy the yellow

594
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,800
submarine yeah the one it's like that movie the yellow submarine yeah the

595
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:36,320
Arctic monkeys did was really good but yeah I just like that was like I don't

596
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,040
know those that was a band I just did not fuck with that like you know what it

597
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,080
It was like, I didn't like it because I thought people probably thought I liked it.

598
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,080
You know what I mean?

599
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,080
Yeah.

600
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,600
Like that's why I don't like Radiohead because I feel like it would be too on the nose if

601
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I liked Radiohead.

602
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,600
Exactly, no same.

603
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:57,040
I never got into Radiohead because I ignored them for a long time because I was like, oh

604
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:02,640
like this is, this like I already listen to like Neutral Milk Hotel and Death Grips.

605
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,720
I can't also be listening to Radiohead.

606
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,720
That's like, that's a hard line.

607
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,560
all three when you get all three of those in your fucking like you know that's like a that's

608
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:17,000
not yeah no yeah no good you have to you have to exercise some control you have to get like

609
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,440
you have to have like half of in high school like half your favorite albums have to be mu albums

610
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,920
and then like you have to pick something like you can't you can't do the whole thing it's not

611
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:31,880
gonna work right if you're gonna get you there's the triangle you can have like death grips and

612
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,760
neutral milk hotel and Radiohead you have to like you can only pick two.

613
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,720
Exactly yeah. And it's really gonna affect how you are as a person. Yeah.

614
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,560
Later in life. You're gonna get killed. Yeah by me. Yep. Well the reason I didn't like

615
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:52,920
Radiohead is like people were just so annoying about Kid A and stuff and like.

616
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,960
Yeah no people that the time that we were in high school that was like so that was

617
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,600
like the thing that you like went online and that was all the people that was

618
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:08,480
like the best album meme. Yeah and it was like nuts about it. Like I learned I

619
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,200
listened to Neutral Milk Hotel because I didn't understand why people were

620
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,800
posting pictures of the album cover and then I listened to it and I was like oh

621
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,800
this is pretty good and then I just never like gave Radiohead a chance

622
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:25,000
because I was like I just like yeah I don't care it's not it's not for me I

623
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,600
I just, I don't fucking give a shit.

624
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,720
- Yeah, it's lame, it's boring.

625
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,080
When a guy who has a radio for a head,

626
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,800
they did that in Transformers.

627
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,120
- I'm sure it's good.

628
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,120
I'm sure it's probably one of the best things

629
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:38,960
that you can listen to.

630
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,520
- Probably the best thing ever, actually.

631
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,360
- It's probably really good.

632
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,840
- Probably the best band ever.

633
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:46,680
- Yeah, I might think it's the best band ever

634
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,280
if you show it to me at the right time.

635
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,740
But if you show it to me, I'm gonna kick you.

636
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,480
- I'm gonna hit your phone out of your hand

637
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,520
into the sewer.

638
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,320
I'm gonna swing kick, I'm gonna fuckin' spin around

639
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,800
like I'm Ryu.

640
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,640
- That's right.

641
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,960
- And I might pull out a fireball.

642
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,640
- Yep, I'm gonna Hadouken you.

643
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,480
- Yeah.

644
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,840
- I have, yeah, I've been, you know,

645
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,600
I've been watching some Mortal Kombat tournaments

646
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,440
and I might stomp the ground like Tremor

647
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,920
and send a little earthquake after you.

648
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,080
Knocked you in the air.

649
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,640
- I've been playing Injustice, God's Among Us.

650
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,400
Look, I got--

651
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,160
- Yeah, I can't lie.

652
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,120
I might jump up on your shoulders like Catwoman and slash your face with my sexy claws.

653
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,120
Mm-hmm.

654
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,120
Could happen.

655
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,120
I might become sexual at you.

656
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,120
I might...

657
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,960
We might end up in a sexual situation.

658
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
That sounds bad.

659
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:37,960
That, I take...

660
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Duh.

661
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
I don't like saying that.

662
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,680
I did not like saying that.

663
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Yeah, that...

664
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,360
That was all fake.

665
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Yeah.

666
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,880
I'll become sexual at you in a positive way.

667
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,120
(laughing)

668
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:57,320
- Yeah.

669
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,400
- That fixes it, right?

670
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,920
- Yeah, that fixes it.

671
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,000
I actually wrote you a poem.

672
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,840
- Really?

673
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,580
- Yeah, to read to you.

674
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,920
Now that Caleb's not here, I feel like this,

675
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,380
I can read like a kind of a friendship poem

676
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,220
that I wrote.

677
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:17,400
It's called Cameron and Patrick Friendship Poem.

678
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,040
Okay, here it goes.

679
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,440
- I'm ready, I'm ready to hear it.

680
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,220
Okay, here it is.

681
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,760
This is a poem from my friend Patrick.

682
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,080
His smile is golden and his loveliness is magic.

683
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:29,920
- Wow. - Together,

684
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,180
we are always playing.

685
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,080
- There's more?

686
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,640
- You're my friend, I'm always saying.

687
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,080
We like to eat in restaurants

688
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,960
and scream when we see a ghost that haunts.

689
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,400
I like to hang out with him in a house.

690
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,800
I like to hang out with him with a mouse.

691
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,120
I like to hang out with him in a box.

692
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,800
I like to hang out with him with a fox.

693
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,640
Would you, could you, in a car?

694
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,560
Eat them, eat them, here they are.

695
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,520
I would not, could not, in a car.

696
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,100
You may like them, you will see.

697
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,740
You may like them in a tree.

698
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,580
I would not, could not, in a tree.

699
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:02,460
Not in a car, you let me be.

700
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,160
I do not like them in a box.

701
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,960
I do not like them with a fox.

702
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,520
I do not like them in a house.

703
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,240
I do not like them with a mouse.

704
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,900
I do not like them here or there.

705
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:11,740
I do not like them anywhere.

706
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,680
- Candace, green eggs and ham.

707
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:14,520
- I do not like green eggs and ham.

708
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,260
I do not like them, Sam I am.

709
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,560
I thought you wrote me...

710
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,840
I did, yeah.

711
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,640
Well, so...

712
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,840
You wrote like the first half of a poem.

713
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,920
Well, yeah, so I mean I needed a reference for how, like, I didn't know how to

714
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,560
like write a poem really so I kind of copied and pasted the text from...

715
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,000
Well, you know, I replaced stuff at the beginning and I kind of, you know, as it

716
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,800
went on I figured... Did you forget to do the rest? Is that it? Well, I thought maybe you would get the

717
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,040
gist of it by the beginning and I didn't need to... I didn't know, you know, the backspace

718
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:48,240
keys broken so I couldn't get rid of the other stuff I already pasted so I

719
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,560
figured maybe stop reading I thought you would written me a well I can't what I'm

720
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,720
not gonna stop in the middle I thought you had written me a whole thing I wrote

721
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:04,320
I mean I press ctrl V on a lot of it so and I was doing it line by line so it

722
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,560
was a lot of stuff took a long time I was copying and pasting each letter I

723
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,040
I really thought you'd like it.

724
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,040
- I guess I'll take what I can get.

725
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,320
- So where's your poem for me?

726
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,920
- I didn't know that we were writing poems this episode.

727
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,400
- I figured that it made sense as a thing to do, right?

728
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,280
That's what you do when you talk to your friend, right?

729
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,360
- No, I...

730
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,120
- You really don't have a poem for me?

731
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,440
- I don't have a poem.

732
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,960
- All right, well, then I'm glad

733
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,880
I didn't change the second half.

734
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,720
- Why?

735
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,520
- I said it.

736
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:47,140
sucks. I thought this was going to be different. Ok, here, I'll read it again and I'll just

737
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:51,720
read the first part this time. No, don't. Ok, I'll just read the second part then. Don't

738
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,560
read the poem again. Do you want to see the pictures I drew to go with the poem? Ok. Ok,

739
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:07,560
one second. And these better be pictures that you drew. Green eggs and ham images. What?

740
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:11,480
No, you're looking up green eggs and ham. I'm sending you a picture right now

741
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,880
Click on this

742
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:18,280
You're gonna like this. That's doctor. That's the cover. That's the cover of green eggs and ham

743
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,920
anyway, my

744
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,480
My poem has um is actually been greenlit to to become a Netflix series

745
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,680
Yeah, it just has no it hasn't it has it says um it says right here

746
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,440
Patrick's friendship series from Ellen DeGeneres to debut on Netflix in quarter from Ellen

747
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,400
After more than four years in the works Netflix TV adaptation of dr. Cameron classic

748
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:55,560
Actually it already came out in 2019 look at that I

749
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,680
Mean and listen to this cast

750
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,000
Adam Devine divine

Michael Douglas, Diane Keaton, Ilana Glazer, Eddie Izzard,

752
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,100
Tracy Morgan, Keegan-Michael Key, Daveed Diggs, John Turturro, Jeffrey Wright, and Jillian Bell.

753
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,580
This sucks.

754
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:18,000
This sucks. This has nothing to do with my friendship poem.

755
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,820
I thought I was gonna have a beautiful friendship poem today. I thought you were gonna like my poem.

756
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,200
Well...

757
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,120
What about the part about the ghost that haunts? Did you like that? I did. I'm worried I got haunted.

758
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,680
I'm worried I'm haunted.

759
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,800
Did you ever get haunted before?

760
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Have we talked about this?

761
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,080
I went to a movie screening.

762
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,160
I went to a cemetery last night for Xavier.

763
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,080
Shout out to Xavier.

764
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:48,520
His screening of his movie.

765
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:52,040
It was in a cemetery.

766
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,960
And the whole time, I thought a Dracula might come out.

767
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,160
Yeah, might come out of one of the graves.

768
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Yeah.

769
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,160
Yeah.

770
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,700
Well, the way you can avoid that is you look at the graves you're sitting near and if any

771
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,660
of them say Dracula or Vlad on them, you change seats.

772
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
Good point.

773
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,660
Yeah.

774
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:14,780
The shitty thing about sitting in the cemetery is like you go, you know, you move one seat

775
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:23,900
over and then it's like, "Oh shit, this one, this one is Walter Ulfman.

776
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,900
Walter Ulfman."

777
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,900
It's like, "Oh."

778
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:32,300
Oh yeah, well, okay, maybe maybe I mean that just sounds like a normal guy.

779
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:38,740
That just sounds like a normal guy is probably fine and then and then somebody

780
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,500
walks by and blocks part of the name and you go oh no.

781
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,020
Uh-huh yeah.

782
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,980
So you move to the other seat and it's Dr. Frankenstein's grave.

783
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,580
Yeah when you say well he's I mean he's not the scary one it was the monster.

784
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,860
Yeah so you know I don't have much to worry about here I guess he was just a

785
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
a scientist.

786
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:57,860
Man.

787
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,860
Yeah.

788
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:07,140
If I got haunted for the rest of my life, I don't know what I'd do.

789
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,460
Yeah, it would be tough to be haunted.

790
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,460
Yeah.

791
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,660
I think I'd probably suck it up.

792
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,260
Probably take it.

793
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260
Exactly.

794
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,020
Lift yourself up by your bootstraps or whatever.

795
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,620
I wouldn't let my haunting define me.

796
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,620
Define me.

797
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,700
I wouldn't let the haunter find me.

798
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,520
i would hide

799
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,100
uh... doctor

800
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,060
i think that's a good look at the ghost could be a dracula

801
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:39,060
it should be a walter offman

802
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,380
the scariest thing about walter offman is uh...

803
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,740
his crimes

804
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,380
yet though he's done terrible things

805
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,040
yes

806
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,940
here you know it's almost

807
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:53,100
you know he's almost a large size of the worst guy when he's not aware of the

808
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,740
than when he is. He's done. I know it's just like the werewolf powers made him

809
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:01,220
you know even worse as a person. And the contempt he showed in court he was so

810
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:06,140
disrespectful to the judge. I've never seen somebody flip off the judge at the

811
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:11,140
courtroom before. I know and I mean he you know he has a good sense of smell

812
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:16,100
being who he is and I have not ever heard anybody described with such accuracy the

813
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:22,820
exact way in which the entire jury smelled bad. He told a gentleman in the

814
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:29,620
back of the jury box they could smell the come on his hoodie

815
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,760
and they took that juror out of the courtroom

816
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:36,300
because he was he was supposed to be wearing a hoodie he was wearing it under his button

817
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,460
down shirt

818
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,340
because he was afraid he would be cold

819
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:46,980
and they had to declare the whole thing a mistrial

820
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,860
that's how he got away with all of his crimes

821
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,140
Just too good at smelling.

822
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,140
Exactly.

823
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,140
He would...

824
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:56,100
Yeah, he smelled...

825
00:41:56,100 --> 00:42:01,460
He could smell that the judge's wig hadn't been washed.

826
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:08,900
Dude, I wish, I fucking wish we had some stupid court system like they do in the UK.

827
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,900
Like their judges wear powdered wigs.

828
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,500
That's so fucking silly.

829
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,500
That is like...

830
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,780
It's awesome.

831
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:24,940
That's like if like I know there's nothing else like that.

832
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
That's like yeah.

833
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,780
I mean we're a powdered.

834
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:30,580
I mean the and they also they have fucking Bobby's.

835
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:33,380
Yeah they still wear Bobby helmets and shit.

836
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:34,380
Right.

837
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,380
Like that.

838
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:36,380
It's so that's so fucking stupid.

839
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,260
I think I think Bobby still wear the hats.

840
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,100
I think maybe if you're a constable you wear it.

841
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,780
They still have constables.

842
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,260
Yeah.

843
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:53,100
guards still wear them I think like imagine if you worked at McDonald's and

844
00:42:53,100 --> 00:43:00,700
yeah you had to wear like a chef hat and like a whole chef outfit to work at

845
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,820
McDonald's yeah that's the same as making a judge wear a powdered wig yeah

846
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:10,020
it's just like a child's understanding of like what that person would look like

847
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:17,060
we should make politicians wear like like old sash yeah like a sash and like but

848
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,940
like dress up like old politicians like they have to wear like like five layers

849
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,220
of clothing and like a petticoat to like and just like so they're because I mean

850
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:29,140
the thing is they're all so old if they had to wear that many clothes 80% of

851
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:33,260
them would die of heatstroke immediately yeah just sitting in Congress or

852
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:40,060
whatever I mean hey these clowns these clowns couldn't take a hot car these

853
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:43,420
These clowns wouldn't last two minutes in a microwave.

854
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:46,540
I locked all my clowns in a hot car.

855
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,660
Oh no.

856
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:55,700
Yeah, well it's like you're walking through like the grocery store parking lot and you

857
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,820
see like a golden retriever like locked in a hot car and you're like, "Oh my God," and

858
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,020
you like look around, you can't tell who owns the car, so you go and you like break the

859
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:07,620
window and then like 500 clowns climb out and the guy comes out of the grocery store

860
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:09,620
like only bags he's like really possibly

861
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,620
you're like fucking clowns

862
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,620
what did you do to my clowns?

863
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,620
so I'm never gonna be able to get them back

864
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,620
they're all they're scattering

865
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:23,620
that's what happened when there were all those clown sightings

866
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,620
in like 2016 or wherever

867
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,620
whenever that was

868
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,620
man that's I mean

869
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,620
so remember that fucking shit

870
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,620
so fucking stupid did you ever like encounter

871
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:35,620
a clown? yeah yeah there was one

872
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,620
There was one in downtown Boston.

873
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,120
Yeah?

874
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:40,120
He was standing outside of one of the dorms, dude.

875
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,120
Oh, that's right.

876
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:44,120
You were in the dorms then.

877
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:48,120
I was in the dorms and there was a big glass window like on street level.

878
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:50,120
And there was a clown who was just like walking around the street.

879
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:54,120
And then, if I remember correctly, there was also a guy in a Mario outfit.

880
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:56,120
Which made it a little less scary.

881
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:58,120
Yeah, I mean it was around Halloween.

882
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:02,120
It wasn't close enough to Halloween to be wearing costumes.

883
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:05,120
I don't remember exactly when it was, but I remember being like...

884
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,360
"These guys are up to something.

885
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,200
"You can't be doing this."

886
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,240
- There was, I was in community college at the time.

887
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:15,040
I was at the place where I was living in Laconia,

888
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,000
and there was a clown sighting there.

889
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,440
Someone was in the parking lot.

890
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,840
So it's obvious, it's like,

891
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:23,480
"Oh, that's somebody who lives here."

892
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:28,480
But kids on the floor that I was living on were like,

893
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:30,800
"Yo, there's a fucking clown out there."

894
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,640
- Yeah.

895
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,560
- And they were like, they all got ready

896
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:36,200
to like beat the shit out of whoever it was.

897
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,840
Like, I think they like, somebody like saw the clown guy

898
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,100
and like screamed at him and like ran downstairs

899
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:44,580
and like the clown ran away.

900
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,620
But it was just like a stu, like, it's like,

901
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,240
that could be just like your roommate.

902
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,400
Like that's like, that's so fucking stupid.

903
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,700
To run after a clown?

904
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:58,040
Who paid me to run after a goddamn clown?

905
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:02,900
- I'm on the Wikipedia page for 2016 clown sightings.

He was a clown, dude.

00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:04,540
Yeah. Bro, you're trash.

00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,540
You're trash. You're a fucking clown, kid.

922
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:08,540
You're a clown. Yeah.

923
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,540
Just like talking to a, like,

924
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,540
in 2001, talking to Osama, like,

925
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,540
like the way that, like, a FaZe Clan gamer

926
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,540
trash talks.

927
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:19,540
Yeah.

928
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,540
Wow, kid, you're fucking trash.

929
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:23,540
Clown.

930
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,540
You're a clown, dude.

931
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,540
You're a bitch maid.

932
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:30,540
Bitch maid doesn't get thrown around a lot anymore.

933
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,540
No, we gotta bring that back.

934
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,540
Yeah, that was something some kid called.

935
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:37,540
The evil clowns were bitch maids for real.

936
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:40,540
I heard someone call someone that in high school.

937
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,540
And I was like, oh man, that's...

938
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:44,540
That's just wrong.

939
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:47,540
That's cutting. That's like for a high schooler to call another high schooler that.

940
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,540
You were made by a bitch?

941
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:51,540
Yeah.

942
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:55,300
who gives you an evil shiver down your spine just to hear it

943
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,620
reported bin laden sightings

944
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,260
yeah what's the deal with this

945
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,380
is this like a

946
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,320
slick up

947
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,920
well i'm sure

948
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,260
was a and i'm not looking at yet

949
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,940
and then we'll be sending very well-meaning and serious about her

950
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:13,260
current concern told emergency dispatch

951
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,380
badgers that she encountered osama at a seven eleven

952
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,780
- Oh, baby.

953
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,720
- In Utah, so that was probably some fucking Mormon lady

954
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,640
who just thought every, I shit on Mormons too much.

955
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:28,300
I'm sorry to all of our Mormon listeners.

956
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,180
- I don't care about our Mormon listeners.

957
00:48:30,180 --> 00:48:31,340
Don't be Mormon.

958
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:32,260
- Yeah.

959
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,860
- I don't give a fuck, I don't give a shit about you, dude.

960
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,700
You better be an ex-Mormon.

961
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,860
- How many times have I talked about Mormons on here?

962
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:40,700
- They're evil.

963
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,060
- Probably a lot.

964
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,140
It's a weird, I mean, I got called,

965
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:56,100
I made a joke on Twitter about Mormons and I got called a religious bigot.

966
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,460
They're not a religion, they're a demonic collective.

967
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,460
I guess it makes sense to, I don't know, I don't want to justify this person calling

968
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,460
me that.

969
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:12,420
But it's like, I guess you could say the same thing about Scientology to people, like if

970
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,580
like shitting on Scientology because it is technically a religion.

971
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:20,380
Yeah I mean but then you just get into the you know.

972
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:22,860
I'm trying to be more open.

973
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,520
The like Reddit atheist territory where it's like yeah everything it's all technically religions

974
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,660
but it's you know it all sucks.

975
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:30,660
Yeah.

976
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:31,660
Hey man.

977
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,740
Hey have you ever thought about how religion is a crack of shit?

978
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:35,740
Yeah.

979
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:36,980
Check out my new movie Religulous.

980
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,580
It doesn't even sound like Bill Maher.

981
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,200
they need to check out my new movie

982
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,000
religious yeah

983
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,180
do you have any how many different title

984
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,640
ideas do you think he went through he's

985
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,520
like rigidly did she kill us ridiculous

986
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:00,900
drink rich rigidly ridiculous it because

987
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:02,800
what it's supposed to be a pun on

988
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,900
ridiculous it doesn't work at all it

989
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:07,800
does not it doesn't work at fucking all

990
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,980
and that movie is so it's so funny and

991
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:16,580
just how much of it is just him being just a smarmy piece of shit.

992
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:22,140
There's a scene of him just talking to a guy dressed up like Jesus and the whole of the

993
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:27,780
conversation is just him going "but really?"

994
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:30,180
He loves that dude.

995
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:32,060
He's a really guy.

996
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:38,060
Let me see if there's any interesting trivia here on IMDB.

997
00:50:38,060 --> 00:50:43,280
Yeah, that's probably a good... I mean, how many times do you think he almost got the shit

998
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,920
kicked out of him?

999
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,540
During the sequence set inside the Dome of the Rock, Bill Maher and his guide were approached

1000
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,860
by two men who were upset and then proceeded to speak in Arabic and supposedly talk about

1001
00:50:54,860 --> 00:51:00,260
how Maher is "not funny". In actuality, what they said was "We don't normally hang out

1002
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:07,060
here" and "The boss only gives us five minutes".

1003
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:09,060
What a fucking asshole!

1004
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:11,060
What a fucking asshole!

1005
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,060
What a loser dude!

1006
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:16,060
They were just walking out like, "Man, I wish I had a better lunch break."

1007
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:20,060
And he's like, "These religuliculars are..."

1008
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:25,060
"These Muslims are mad at me for being too funny."

1009
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,060
"Isn't that Islamuliculous?"

1010
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:35,060
Yeah.

1011
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,580
I was gonna say, is Islamabad a thing?

1012
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:40,380
That's a city, I believe.

1013
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,780
Oh, then the joke would have worked.

1014
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,620
That's the capital of Pakistan.

1015
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:48,140
Oh no.

1016
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:52,700
All of the S's on the DVD's closed captioning are dollar signs.

1017
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,180
Whoa.

1018
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:58,100
All the captions, they just made the captions unreadable.

1019
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,100
Yeah.

1020
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,060
Why dude, that's not even like sending a message or anything.

1021
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:04,060
No, not at all.

1022
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:10,360
That's the most annoying thing you can fucking do yeah, they just had a unicode mix-up when they were writing the captions

1023
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:19,540
Yeah, I mean what a what a guy oh man bill are demands of viewing

1024
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:24,520
For one thing he makes it so clear how illogical the mass amount of people can be

1025
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:32,780
Illogical fucking who wrote that review Spock come on true yo

1026
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:33,780
Yo!

1027
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:34,780
Come on now.

1028
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:35,780
Come on.

1029
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:36,780
Yo!

1030
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:39,940
Who's writing these movie reviews?

1031
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,420
Is it Spock from Star Trek?

1032
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,940
I mean, come on.

1033
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:48,500
We should make a documentary that goes around to prove religulous wrong.

1034
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,500
Religulousalist.

1035
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,500
Yeah, religulousalist.

1036
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:55,780
And we just go to everywhere that Bill Maher went and talk to the people and we're like,

1037
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,780
"See?

1038
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,860
It's actually pretty cool."

1039
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,860
This guy's a nice guy.

1040
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,860
This guy's pretty cool.

1041
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:00,860
Hey, man.

1042
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,500
Hey man, this church is pretty cool.

1043
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:08,540
They didn't let me skateboard at this church, but I did have a good conversation with them

1044
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,500
about God.

1045
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,860
You know, the creationism museum didn't like reading any of the placards.

1046
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:20,900
Some of the statues they got are pretty cool.

1047
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:21,900
Great worksmanship.

1048
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:27,220
We went to Mecca and we had no problems.

1049
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:28,780
yeah got a say a bit

1050
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,460
the chilly dogs at the food truck outside the creationist community

1051
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:36,860
absolutely delicious bill maher has no idea what he's talking about

1052
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:39,020
he was blinded by his atheism

1053
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:41,820
he couldn't enjoy a simple hot dog

1054
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:47,540
so you probably think god created this hot dog what are you talking about

1055
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,300
man i don't know i don't work at the museum

1056
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,820
yeah i don't know i don't work at the museum what are you talking about in the

1057
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:53,380
closed captions say like

1058
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:56,540
i am your enemy

1059
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:58,540
I shall strike you down with my sword of faith.

1060
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,540
Speaking perfect English.

1061
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,540
Yeah.

1062
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,540
Oh man.

1063
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,540
Man,

1064
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:08,540
Bill Maher,

1065
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,540
You're the sucker of the week.

1066
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,540
Bill Maher, I got one

1067
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,540
finger for you.

1068
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:16,540
My ring finger. That's right.

1069
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,540
Bill, if you're hearing this,

1070
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,540
I love you so fucking much.

1071
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:22,540
And I know it's a long shot,

1072
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:24,540
but it would mean the world

1073
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:31,500
to me if you would take my hand in marriage and together I I mean we

1074
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:37,620
wouldn't be married in a church right maybe a secular ceremony an unholy

1075
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:42,820
matrimony oh yeah you will listen bill I got one finger for you too and guess

1076
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:49,820
what is my pinky and I'm gonna make you smell it after.

1077
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:55,820
I'm just gonna put it in a vat of hot dog water.

1078
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,820
And you're gonna smell it.

1079
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:01,820
Oh boy.

1080
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,820
Oh boy.

1081
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:05,820
Alright dude, home stretch.

1082
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,820
Five minutes left.

1083
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,820
Yeah.

1084
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:15,420
minutes left yeah then we can both go to sleep I'm dude I have a I have the

1085
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:23,100
second half of a Cubano in the fridge yeah I'm like I'm waiting for that yeah

1086
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:30,300
so good dude it's it's like clear that Caleb and I both like that sandwich

1087
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:35,980
because we like the movie chef a lot yeah I still never seen chef but I mean

1088
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,700
I mean, it's the perfect sandwich, I think.

1089
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:40,640
- I think that just looking at the food on Chef

1090
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,940
will make me throw up.

1091
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:42,780
I don't want it.

1092
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,940
I'd rather eat a Cheez-It.

1093
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,460
That's all I'm gonna say.

1094
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,940
Dude, if they open up a food truck

1095
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,720
that sells Cheez-Its and Goldfish.

1096
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:53,960
(laughing)

1097
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:58,840
- Dude, it's just like a restaurant,

1098
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,340
a food truck for picky eaters.

1099
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:03,920
- A food truck that sells Goldfish

1100
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:09,240
I go up to it and they hand me a handful of goldfish and I throw it on the ground because

1101
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,240
it's flavor blasted.

1102
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,920
I wanted these plain!

1103
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,920
Where the fuck are the pretzel goldfish?

1104
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,720
Oh, I hate those ones.

1105
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,720
Yeah, they suck.

1106
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:20,720
Just eat a pretzel.

1107
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,160
Pretzel, I know, just, there's like too much air in the pretzel goldfish.

1108
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,360
Pretzels and hummus I think is maybe one of the best snacks of all time.

1109
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,360
I'm not-

1110
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,520
And making it into a goldfish is kind of-

1111
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:30,520
I'm not too big into hummus.

1112
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,520
Really?

1113
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,520
Mm-hmm.

1114
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,520
I'm a big hummus fan.

1115
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,060
Yeah, I think in terms of like...

1116
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,560
Hummus is one of the number one components of the straight edge stoner mindset.

1117
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:41,560
Yeah?

1118
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,560
Yeah.

1119
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:48,200
That's, instead of, you know, instead of sitting around and hitting a dab pen and like, and

1120
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:54,400
reading, like watching like YouTube essays about 2001 A Space Odyssey, you sit around,

1121
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:58,760
you shovel hummus into your mouth, and you read about Pokemon or something.

1122
00:56:58,760 --> 00:56:59,760
And that's gonna change your life.

1123
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:07,760
Straight edge stoner mindset, you eat a handful of baba ganoush, you don't smoke a bong and

1124
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:08,760
watch roosh.

1125
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:09,760
And go sploosh.

1126
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,760
Yeah.

1127
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,760
Yeah, exactly.

1128
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,760
Hey man, I'm wearing all tie dye, you'll never see me high high.

1129
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,760
Man.

1130
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,760
Yep.

1131
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,760
Man.

1132
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:25,600
- Man.

1133
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,680
- I think hummus unfairly has dominated

1134
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,920
the Mediterranean dip marketplace.

1135
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,560
- I know you're a tzatziki guy.

1136
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,200
- I think tzatziki, number one dip.

1137
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,240
- It's very good.

1138
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,120
Yeah, but the thing is that that's like--

1139
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,280
- It's very filling.

1140
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,120
- Yeah, it's also like--

1141
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,340
- And it's not as light as hummus.

1142
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,920
I get why hummus is.

1143
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,880
I think more people--

1144
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,440
Hummus is more accessible.

1145
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:49,800
- Hummus is also, I think, you know,

1146
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,620
for what I would put in hummus is like pretzels

1147
00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:54,040
or carrots or something.

1148
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,600
which i don't know you could do that i guess you could do it

1149
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,720
feels weird with pretzels presence is he is good

1150
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:03,560
is it maybe i'll get some susie

1151
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,340
i can barely find susie

1152
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,560
no grocery store

1153
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,120

forty five seconds before they realize i'm walking around without pants like

when he the poo

1163
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:40,080

they usually does let me keep whatever i have i'm holding up to

1165
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,820

1174
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:12,840
i i remember we were we're at the we're at neil's lake house and we went to a

1175

shop right

1176
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,060
and

1177
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:19,300
I saw a lady leaving on one of them and I was like limping around the store and I was like

1178
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:25,140
Why the fuck didn't I just do that? That would have been so fun. Are you kidding me?

1179
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:28,900
I can't drive. I'd be going around the store like a fucking gta

1180
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,540
online character

1181
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:38,580
Just like fucking driving into everywhere. I would topple over rubber banding from from leg. Oh my god, dude

1182
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,220
I'd go

1183
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,940
I'd be on that i'd be in that store doing missions. Yeah

1184
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,200
(laughing)

1185
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,040
- You gotta go--

1186
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:50,040
- Yeah, going up to the deli counter

1187
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,160
and they're like, "Man, we don't have any missions for you.

1188
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,880
"Please, this is, it's a deli counter."

1189
00:59:55,880 --> 01:00:00,040
- I would ask the people I was with for some missions.

1190
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:02,000
I'd be like, "Oh, you need me to go get hot dog buns?

1191
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,200
"All right, set up a ramp for me."

1192
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,600
- 45 minutes later without hot dog buns.

1193
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,640
