- Live. - Welcome to game night,

13
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,880
everybody.

14
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,700
- Woo!

15
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,160
(laughing)

16
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,700
- You didn't even do it on camera.

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,960
- Do what on camera, hurt our necks?

18
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,800
- No, we hurt our necks.

19
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,480
- I hurt my neck a few days ago.

20
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,760
- I fell down some stairs.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,000
- And I was lying in bed and I got up too fast

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,120
and I hit my head on the wall.

23
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,240
- Those are very stupid ways to hurt your neck.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,760
But I hurt my neck and just compared to those,

25
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,560
a very, very cool way.

26
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,400
- Yeah.

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,220
- So, uh.

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:22,540
- It's not really a competition about,

29
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:24,380
it's not a competition about who hurt their neck

30
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,220
and who didn't.

31
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,040
- Yeah.

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,860
- You guys also, you went,

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,260
you guys bought prop neck braces that are way nicer

34
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,620
than the one that I have on,

35
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,180
that I bought for my real neck.

36
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,740
- These aren't props.

37
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,860
- These are real, we hurt our necks.

38
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,700
- Yeah, we got these from the doctor.

39
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,860
- We went to the doctor to get them.

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,340
- Mm-hmm.

41
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:47,580
- I was sleeping over Cameron's house

42
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,260
and I fell down his stairs.

43
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:54,640
Uh-huh and when I heard him fall down the stairs I set up really fast and I hit there's stairs

44
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,180
Have you not but there's there's a few or three stairs. He doesn't know in my entryway

45
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:03,420
Now I'm done on my fucking location. Everyone's gonna find an apartment. There's two or three stairs in the entryway

46
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,860
Maybe I don't know because I have a head injury from what I can't even look over here

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,060
Yeah, my shit hurts so bad. Actually. This is it's actually doing numbers for my back pain three numbers. I

48
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,080
I actually feel pretty good not having to move my neck.

49
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
His back pain's doing numbers.

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,580
This is just... you guys have just thrown a biggest wrench

51
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,080
into everything that I thought was going to happen today.

52
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,580
I was like, "Man, this is going to be amazing.

53
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm going to sit here, barely move, barely talk,

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,080
and I just get to basically take the day off and kind of just sit here."

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,580
And now you've ruined it.

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,080
And now I have to... now we're all on a level playing field.

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,080
And it's pissing me off.

58
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,080
We all hurt our necks.

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,880
- Yeah, we all hurt our necks, I don't understand.

60
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,620
- Okay, well then how did you?

61
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,960
- I told you, I fell.

62
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,660
- Ow, just stop.

63
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,880
How did you hurt your neck?

64
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,320
- I fell down the stairs at Cameron's house.

65
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,200
- And you, Cameron?

66
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
- I hit my head on the wall, I guess.

67
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,100
- You guess?

68
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,200
- Yeah, that's what I heard.

69
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,680
- Because you got knocked clean out.

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,920
- Yeah, I was completely knocked out.

71
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,080
I went to the doctor and they said,

72
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,360
well, based on the type of neck pain that you're having,

73
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,200
I would have to imagine you hit your head on the wall

74
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,000
after being scared by your friend falling down the stairs.

75
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,800
I was so worried about my neck brace causing alarm that I put on this Dodgers

76
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,200
hat because I was like, "I'll have a second thing."

77
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,480
So that I can be like,

78
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,720
just redirect all the attention to my new hat. Yeah, that's not a new hat

79
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,280
though. That's an old hat. It's new to my head. Not new to your head,

80
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,040
you've worn that around. You're trying to say stuff that's false so we'll

81
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,480
shake our heads and hurt our necks. Yeah. You want me to...

82
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm on to you.

83
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,760
It hurts to laugh because of my neck.

84
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,760
Ow!

85
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,760
Oh my god.

86
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Do you guys realize that this is-

87
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,680
And my throat hurts too because I was glizzy gulping.

88
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,280
This is basically the same as some kind of racist thing.

89
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,360
This is not the same as some kind of racist thing.

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,680
This is you being racist to me.

91
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,080
Yeah, you're being racist to us.

92
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,080
You're saying like you're not a real person whose neck was hurt.

93
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,240
Not all injuries are visible.

94
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
But if you-

95
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Man.

96
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,740
If you really feel that way about it, maybe, if for once in your life you took a knee and

97
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,240
you prayed, I would feel better.

98
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Yeah.

99
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
And I wouldn't have to wear this neck brace anymore.

100
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,620
No, I'll take a knee.

101
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,620
I will.

102
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,620
During the national anthem.

103
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
Come on, man.

104
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,620
Don't do that.

105
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,620
Because I'm the anti-Christianity.

106
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:27,000
That is disrespectful to God and the truth.

107
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,240
You're literally making me clench my jaw right now.

108
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Fuck God.

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,240
That's how I got in this situation in the first place.

110
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
I'm going to have to wear a jaw brace.

111
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
Ow.

112
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,240
I want to look at Patrick because I love him, but I can't.

113
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,240
What you should do is this.

114
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,560
Oh, yeah, I forgot I have my back so you guys

115
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,320
That's actually that's not funny. That's what I've had to be doing

116
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:48,500
Multiple days in a row comedy comes from reality. It's observational. It's tragedy plus

117
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:56,040
Tragedy guys what's happening in the world you guys don't even know what happened to me. I don't know what happened

118
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,920
You just went like this

119
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,080
But do you know why he got it get stronger ghetto gagged? I was at his neck. Oh, yeah

120
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,640
- I heard you were the throat goat.

121
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,000
- Yeah, no.

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,840
You took too many--

123
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,800
- I heard you were the throat goat.

124
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,760
I heard, I heard you were the complete throat goat.

125
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,200
- No, I'm not the throat goat.

126
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,120
- You're in an alley smoking a cigarette,

127
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,560
a guy comes up to you and you're like,

128
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,720
hey, I heard you're the throat goat.

129
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,480
- That actually happens a lot.

130
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,440
- That's not me.

131
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,280
- No, I'm not the throat goat.

132
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,480
- I'm not the throat goat anymore.

133
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,320
- Not anymore.

134
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,960
- I hurt my neck.

135
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,960
- Ever since I hurt my neck in the big throat competition,

136
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,720
the deep throat contest.

137
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,720

- It's kind of a pun, rocky pun.

167
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
- You used to be a sucker.

168
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,640
You used to be a slurper.

169
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,060
You used to be the champ, the throat goat.

170
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,000
Remember what I first told you when I brought you in here.

171
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,580
You're gonna suck my penis.

172
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,600
(laughing)

173
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,760
- No, no guys.

174
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,880
That's not how I hurt my neck.

175
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
I hurt my neck. - How did you hurt your neck?

176
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,480
- 'Cause I went to the gym.

177
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,840
- He tried to do a back flip.

178
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,640
- I tried to do a back flip and I landed on my neck.

179
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,480
- Are you serious?

180
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
- No, a guy, I was starting my workout

181
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,520
I didn't have that much time.

182
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,360
And then a guy I know came in,

183
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,400
Christoph came into the gym.

184
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,720
And I told him this,

185
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,880
I talked to him about this last night,

186
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,220
I completely blame him.

187
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,740
Just having somebody you know at the gym

188
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,080
just makes it a little bit different.

189
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,880
And he set up his bench right behind

190
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,480
where I was doing upright rows.

191
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,640
So I grabbed a way heavier weight than I would normally do.

192
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,720
And I started to do them and I did two of them

193
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,640
and then I immediately broke my neck.

194
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,960
But then, it hurts so bad.

195
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,040
But he was right behind me, I'm like,

196
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,120
Like yell out in pain, so I just kept doing it, and then I did like three more sets

197
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,600
Oh, and I did the rest of my workout - gee and I went to the locker room

198
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,300
And I laid on the floor for about 15 20 minutes. Oh, you're dumb as hell for that

199
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,960
Why the hell would you keep going you fell off stairs?

200
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,400
So that is dumber pets. That's not dumb. That's why I was coming

201
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,160
I'm the only one who I broke my neck and a peaceful. I mean a nice

202
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,800
I mean a cool way Cameron eats banana peels throws them shits around in his building

203
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Oh, yeah

204
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,820
Yeah, I took me a second to process. It's a banana eats a banana throws that damn peel on the floor

205
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,820
He doesn't give a fuck. Well. It's

206
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:44,640
Compostable apartment yeah the whole apartment is compostable smokes in his way to get new furniture every few months because it biodegrades

207
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,440
Banana that was on a cigarette

208
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,840
But under a bunch of them like it had like it was a bunch of little stick ball bearings. Yeah

209
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,780
You believe your ball bearings everywhere - well. I'm not good. How what am I supposed to do hang them on the wall?

210
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,840
No, it's not possible you get a magnet you put in the middle of the floor then all your fucking ball bearings

211
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:07,500
Room but with a magnet on top you get my you could get your bearings off my balls

212
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,340
And tell which way

213
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,860
There's no

214
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:21,740
Yeah, you're like being in a white cuz they're so full yeah, they're right there push their swirling yeah like dough

215
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,220
Yeah, rising dough. They look like my head

216
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:27,020
Your head is less smooth.

217
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,360
- If you put your balls on a skillet,

218
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,360
you could probably fry 'em like pita bread.

219
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,700
- Oh yeah, where they get that nice,

220
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,920
those little pockets?

221
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,760
Yeah.

222
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,800
- Do you know what always makes me laugh?

223
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,060
That whenever I think about pita bread,

224
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:42,560
that I can't figure out how this even,

225
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,280
how do you, what do you do with this?

226
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,440
So I'm just gonna tell you.

227
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,280
- Okay.

228
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,220
- To imagine somebody who's at the grocery store,

229
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,520
and they're looking at pita bread,

230
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,560
and they look at a package of pita bread,

231
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,320
and it says pita bread, and they are reading it,

232
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,120
and they go, "Oh, peanut butter bread."

233
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,240
(laughing)

234
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,440
And then they buy it,

235
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,560
and they think it's peanut butter bread.

236
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,500
- Peanut butter bread?

237
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,200
- They read pita as peanut butter.

238
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,280
(laughing)

239
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,600
- Well, this is just nonsense.

240
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,600
- It's nonsense, that's what I'm saying, it's nothing.

241
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,680
- It makes no fucking sense.

242
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,520
- You've thought about that before?

243
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
- I think every time I see pita bread,

244
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,280
I think about that. - You might need a--

245
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,280
- You think about that every time you see pita bread.

246
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,120
- The neck brace-- - Well, I don't think about

247
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,360
when I don't see or hear about pita bread,

248
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,320
so I'm not crazy.

249
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,400
- You are not, you don't have a neck affliction.

250
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,200
You have something deeply wrong with you in your brain.

251
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,200
I don't think you're right.

252
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,200
Yeah, you need a helmet, not a brace.

253
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
A helmet is not going to help me.

254
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
I have a helmet over there somewhere.

255
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,200
You want to wear that?

256
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,200
I'll wear that.

257
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
I can't wear that with headphones.

258
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,200
I still can't believe this.

259
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,200
You could just put it on.

260
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,200
You guys don't know what it's like.

261
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,200
I had to--

262
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,200
Oh, I don't know what it's like to get an injury?

263
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,200
It's not about the injury.

264
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,200
It's about actually wearing the neck brace in public.

265
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,200
I had to--

266
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Or at home.

267
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,200
I took mine off before I went and ordered my sandwich,

268
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
and I just sat there in pain because I didn't want some little--

269
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,200
You have no idea--

270
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
It hurts when you take it off?

271
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,200
Everything hurts all the time.

272
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,200
You have no idea.

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,440
I used to wear a neck brace all the time when I was a younger. Yeah, I lived in a bubble

274
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,840
Yeah, I wore a neck brace all the time in a Tony the Tiger t-shirt why I'd say

275
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:09,440
The store we are kind of giving a trio of Tourette's guy vibes yeah

276
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,640
Fucking what yeah, what the ass?

277
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,040
Yeah, I've dressed what

278
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,840
Wait, what?

279
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,640
Hold on.

280
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,520
[LAUGHTER]

281
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,200
I'm Tourette's guy.

282
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,480
Yeah.

283
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,320
He clearly did not have Tourette's.

284
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,820
No.

285
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,080
I think he had a neck problem.

286
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,880
Here's what he had.

287
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,380
Yeah.

288
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,800
[LAUGHTER]

289
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,160
He had a sense of humor.

290
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:36,660
Yeah.

291
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,240
That's what he had.

292
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:37,240
There you go.

293
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,320
That was a funny fucking video.

294
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,000
I told you about that.

295
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,840
I used to give a shit, then I got fucked.

296
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,480
Remember that one?

297
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,360
That was the best one.

298
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,960
That's fucking poetic.

299
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:47,360
If you like F word and S word, there is no--

300
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,240
stop.

301
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,160
Look no further.

302
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,000
Tourette's guy has you completely covered.

303
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,960
He had a video, there's one really funny photo of him in the back of a car,

304
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,560
and it says, "This is the second time I've been fucked by Dairy Queen."

305
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,040
It's a car moving really fast, and he's got ice cream all over his face.

306
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:04,600
Oh.

307
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,360
That one still makes me laugh.

308
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,600
He was funny.

309
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,640
Some of those old videos, man.

310
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,360
He made light of a disease.

311
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,200
Tell you what, anyway.

312
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,720
He made light of a disease that everyone thinks is already very funny.

313
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,480
Yeah.

314
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,440
Nobody thought it was funny before him, though.

315
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,200
That's the thing.

316
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
People thought it was he was the one who yeah, it was a

317
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,240
South Park a big year for Tourette's in 2008

318
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:26,040
Yeah, maybe

319
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,280
It was a microchip

320
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:34,460
Situation that was getting more people Tourette's in that year that could be that's why we get videos like that

321
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,720
This to my conspiracy minded

322
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,900
You have a fucking conspiratorial brain

323
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:47,680
Something else exciting is that now Jubio can talk say hello. Jubio. Hello to everybody

324
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,880
Hello, Jibya.

325
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,880
Do we have a camera that you can...

326
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,680
He's right there.

327
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,180
What do you mean?

328
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,180
He's right... yeah, he's right up there.

329
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,180
Can we cut to him right here?

330
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,680
Can we cut to him right here?

331
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,180
Can we cut to him right here?

332
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:56,680
Can we cut to him right here?

333
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,180
You are both...

334
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,680
Can we cut to him right here?

335
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,180
Can we cut to him right here?

336
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,680
Okay, you are actually acting injured,

337
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,680
which maybe I'm realizing that you always have the

338
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,180
kind of body movement of somebody with a neck injury.

339
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:05,680
I always have in trouble.

340
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
He is moving around...

341
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,180
He's moving like Chris fucking Farley right now.

342
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,680
I said I always have trouble.

343
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,680
Look at the way that he...

344
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,180
He's like...

345
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:15,680
Nobody could move that fast if they had a neck injury.

346
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,040
You are like doing a terrible representation.

347
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,320
I think that when I die and they dissect my body,

348
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,800
which is what they're gonna do,

349
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,560
they're gonna find out that 24/7 I was in greater pain

350
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,420
than anyone has experienced in their life

351
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,040
and I just had such a high tolerance

352
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,920
that I didn't realize it. Wow.

353
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,720
And that all along I was experiencing

354
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,000
like 10 child birthing mothers

355
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,080
combined with 100 goalies getting hit in the balls

356
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,560
with a ball, combined with slicers.

357
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,000
- Isn't it fucked up that girls have a higher tolerance

358
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,840
for pain?

359
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,660
- It's not true.

360
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,500
- That's not true at all.

361
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,520
- No, it is true.

362
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
- No, it's not true.

363
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,660
- Listen, I would really like to say it's not true.

364
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,120
It's completely true, dude.

365
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,720
- What, have you been testing it out?

366
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,080
- Yeah.

367
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,000
I've been testing it out.

368
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,120
I've been hurting a lot of women

369
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,880
and hurting a couple men as well.

370
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,680
And the women, it doesn't hurt those.

371
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,920
- They just need to stop.

372
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,880
They need to stop fucking around.

373
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:08,800
- The women do?

374
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,160
- Let me finish.

375
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,280
What are you laughing about?

376
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,180
'Cause he thinks everything is funny 'cause he got a fucking necklace on.

377
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:15,680
Everything's a joke to you.

378
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,180
Look at this.

379
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,780
Everything's a fucking joke to you.

380
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,080
Look at the way he's moving.

381
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,380
It's actually making me so mad that if I did not have a disability, then I would attack you.

382
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,180
They need to stop fucking around, and they need to come up with a real unit for pain

383
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,680
that's not a bunch of half-assed fucking emojis.

384
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,280
Scoville.

385
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,780
Do you know how, like a Scoville-

386
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:38,580
They use ten emojis that say "I'm happy" versus "I'm sad" or "I'm in pain."

387
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:41,280
Do you know what is the worst part about this, man?

388
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:41,780
What?

389
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,880
is walking down the street and feeling like,

390
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,820
I can't protect myself.

391
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,820
- Damn. - Because normally,

392
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,860
I feel like how people feel when they have a gun.

393
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,020
My body is a gun. - Yeah.

394
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,440
- I'm a human gun. - Deadly weapon.

395
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,740
- Yeah, like I'm so strong and so vicious

396
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,620
that I can attack anybody for any reason

397
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,020
and probably not go to jail.

398
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,140
- Yeah. - But then when I

399
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,220
am walking down the street and have this neck brace on,

400
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,140
people are saying, "That guy's a pussy.

401
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,220
"That guy's a nerd.

402
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,060
"That guy's a dude." - You know, you could,

403
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:08,900
no, they think you got hurt.

404
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,080
- You could get like some attachments for it,

405
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,080
like spikes.

406
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,400
That could be cool.

407
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,440
You could get studs on my neck.

408
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,920
Like a spike.

409
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,560
You know, you get spikes.

410
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,560
Spikes.

411
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,800
And then maybe a little tag that

412
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,280
says like, don't fuck with me.

413
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,760
And then also my owner's address.

414
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,720
You know, I think the worst part of

415
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
having this neck injury is,

416
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,720
for to me, the worst part of this

417
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,720
neck injury is I

418
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
don't even feel human.

419
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,320
I'm just I'm like less than I'm not even I'm as as someone who's disabled right now

420
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
I feel like I'm not even a full person for me. It's that soda hurts

421
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,480
When I'd sip when I sip a soda through a straw that's it - soda at all

422
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,740
Because I fucking can't oh yeah

423
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,760
Because it hurts so bad

424
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,400
Yeah, I'm fine

425
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,960
What are you thinking about it does just suck that like I'm thinking

426
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Wow, that's what I'm thinking. That's not true. I think that we're even stronger.

427
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,480
I'm a person with a neck injury and I can say that. You can't tell me not to say that.

428
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,480
You don't have, the jig is up, okay? Right before we started, you

429
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,480
put this neck brace on, and you did as well now that I think about it,

430
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,480
and you're both liars.

431
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,480
I guess because I can't

432
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,480
shake my head to say no. You don't understand how much, how tight

433
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,920
I'd have to have this thing and how much it raises my blood pressure.

434
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,640
It makes me even more mad about every single part of my life.

435
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:45,400
When somebody gets their cast on their arm sawed off and they grew a bunch of worms onto

436
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,360
their skin in like months or whatever.

437
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,760
Yeah, they grew a bunch of them, yeah.

438
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,280
I think that's going to happen to me when I take this off in two minutes.

439
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,280
Oh yeah, there's going to be a worm.

440
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,920
I did have a guy who had a bunch of black hairs that grew on my neck.

441
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,760
You guys don't even understand the nightmare that I had last night.

442
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,760
What happened?

443
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,120
I had a nightmare that I was wearing my neck brace and then I took it off in the mirror

444
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,460
and my neck was this thin.

445
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,720
(laughing)

446
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,400
'Cause my neck had gotten,

447
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,560
I'd been wearing the neck brace so long

448
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,000
that my neck shrank.

449
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,940
And it really scared me when I woke up.

450
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,000
(laughing)

451
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,320
And that's why I was late.

452
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,160
'Cause I sat there going,

453
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,280
oh my neck is gonna be small.

454
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,160
My head is so, like a baby.

455
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,720
- It could be anything under there.

456
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,200
It really, so you could have gotten something

457
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,760
rolled on there. - You know what you could do

458
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,260
is get a white turtleneck to put under it.

459
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:36,500
- I thought about the turtleneck thing.

460
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,700
I also thought about getting flesh, like latex flesh.

461
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,540
- Oh, that's pretty funny.

462
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,900
- And just making it look like I have a giant, crazy head.

463
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,740
- Yeah.

464
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,700
The turtleneck is nice,

465
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,060
but you shouldn't put the turtleneck under it,

466
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,780
you should put it over it.

467
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,100
- That's what I was thinking.

468
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,940
- Yeah.

469
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,220
- And it just says puffy.

470
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,780
- Yeah, I was gonna say my neck's swollen

471
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,620
'cause I was gulping.

472
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,980
- On the neck, you're right.

473
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,980
You're right, puffy shit.

474
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,900
- Well, you can say whatever,

475
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,540
but you might wanna say I was goated.

476
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,540
Why not say I was stung by a bee?

477
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:04,540
Well people aren't gonna believe that about you.

478
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,540
I have hydro-neck-ful-ous.

479
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
You just want to say the most simplest thing so it's not...

480
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,540
I gulped a glizzy, you think that's the simplest thing?

481
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,540
People...

482
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,540
Have you ever seen somebody who's a gullible gizzler

483
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,540
who fuckin' has a fuckin' giant neck?

484
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,540
Well I'm just saying it's about you, like

485
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,540
people, if you say like

486
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,540
I got stung by a bee, people are gonna be like

487
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,540
why was he around a bee?

488
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,540
Why did he let the bee land on him?

489
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,540
Why did he...

490
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,940
- How did he get stung, versus if you're like,

491
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:35,940
I was goaded throatly, I was sipping on some penis,

492
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,400
people will say, oh yeah.

493
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,420
What's funny?

494
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,340
- It's not funny.

495
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,580
- What, I say yeah, what's funny?

496
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,500
It's nothing funny. - First of all,

497
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,340
I'm laughing 'cause of all the medication

498
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,340
that they put me on.

499
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,020
- What are you on?

500
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:53,300
- I'm on both Vyvanse and

501
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,980
Fentanyl?

502
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,780
Yeah, I'm kind of giggly too. They put me on Vagisil.

503
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,220
They put me on Fentanyl and Vyvanse.

504
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,860
The Vyvanse so I can stay awake at my job.

505
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
And then the Fentanyl.

506
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,420
Exactly. They weren't going to give us Vyvanse.

507
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
And then we were like, we need to podcast.

508
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,580
Yeah. They were like, oh, right this way.

509
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:12,860
Yeah.

510
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,260
They took us into like an armory.

511
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,580
It's like a room with red curtains and gold trim.

512
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,980
They had one that is like the Altoids, the double-sided mints.

513
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,180
The one that's for you and then the one to share.

514
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,700
They just pop open the to share.

515
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,820
- They should have that for meds.

516
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,340
That's an incredible idea.

517
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
- I agree.

518
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,020
- 'Cause you're supposed, when you get

519
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,400
any kind of stimulant prescription,

520
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,260
you're supposed to share it with your friends.

521
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
- Yeah, that's pretty much what happens.

522
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,100
- Yeah.

523
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:43,020
- Oh, you know what I wanna take?

524
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,860
- What?

525
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,900
- I really wanna get magnetic brain therapy done.

526
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,740
- Yeah.

527
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,340
- That sounds so fucking fun.

528
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,600
But I would be worried that I would have metal in my head

529
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,740
and it would be like--

530
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,700
- I think you do.

531
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
Why?

532
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:03,940
What I would be worried about is if I got magnetic brain therapy and they were putting

533
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,620
the magnet on my head, I'd worry that I would flip and I would become Noramak and I would

534
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,960
be kind of like an evil version of myself.

535
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
That's a really good point.

536
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,140
And they wouldn't be able to stop me unless they magneted me.

537
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,460
What if I go under the magnet, right?

538
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:21,020
And then I start going by Pat, not Patrick.

539
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,020
Kid Trap.

540
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,020
No, just Pat.

541
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,020
I don't think you'd do

542
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:31,320
They reverse your name. Do you guys believe in ground shrink you'd grab all the other letters. Yeah

543
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:35,980
By Rick

544
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,660
If you went by Rick, that'd be actually pretty amazing

545
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:43,160
My uncle my little brother goes by my uncle was named is named Rick

546
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,700
And he gave my brother a brick for Christmas one year and then the next year he gave him a broken baseball

547
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,340
baseball bat. Rick's brick. Those are the two presents he ever gave anyone in my family.

548
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,820
A brick and a broken baseball bat. A brick and a broken baseball bat. Was it from Babe

549
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,820
Ruth? No, it was from him. He broke the bat at his softball league and gave it to my brother.

550
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:04,060
That's pretty cool. Yeah, he was amazing. I don't think I have anyone named Rick in

551
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:08,980
my family. Richie, how about Richard? Oh yeah, there's several Richards. My dad is named

552
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,020
Rick. Yeah, I guess you're right. Wait, is that? Yeah, it is. My dad is named Eric and

553
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,620
My little brother is named Eric, but not Eric jr. D. I'll call him Rick and we used to call him

554
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,580
We being chowder would call him little Ricky shut the fuck up the chowder

555
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:28,120
Can I say something right around a motherfucker tonight? This is kind of a topic change, but can I say something yeah?

556
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:31,760
I'm ready to go mainstream. You should do a topless change

557
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,420
Did you even hear what I said?

558
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:41,540
Yes, so I say it again. I'm ready to go mainstream really cuz I'm are you have you lost the fucking plot

559
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,880
And I don't care if you guys come with me or not, but I'm ready to hit the big-time

560
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:49,980
Ever loving mind mate. I'm ready

561
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:57,840
Gone mental I haven't gone mental you've gone mental. I'll be mental. Yeah, you've gone mental. Don't call me mental

562
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,260
I don't like it if you call me mental so what you're gonna go mainstream try to get

563
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:07,180
Try to pick up the beep you're trying to get on the BBC - I want to just set the trend

564
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,640
You're trying to you're trying to attract birds of all sorts. Yeah, I'm ready to take my place in culture

565
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,740
You want to do the Joker dance on the apples and pears me the Joker dance you're gone

566
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,220
He's lost the plot. How are you gonna go mainstream? I?

567
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:25,700
Think just through the podcast that is daft that is completely bad

568
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,580
Yeah, you were acting I hate to agree with him because he has a fake neck brace on but you're acting completely completely daft

569
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,580
What that what is this bloke on about?

570
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,260
Hurt my chin you did

571
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,420
(laughing)

572
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,260
- I just hurt my chin.

573
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,100
- You just put your chin into your braces.

574
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,340
- You guys called me mental and I bit down on my chin.

575
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,180
I mean I--

576
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,020
- I can do that too.

577
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,660
- You look crazy.

578
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,420
(laughing)

579
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,260
- I can't push my neck that far back

580
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,100
because I'm gonna have an actual injury.

581
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,540
- I look like Cooking with Jack.

582
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
- I'm sorry.

583
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,200
(laughing)

584
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,180
- See you just have a toy.

585
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,020
- Yeah.

586
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:56,840
- You have a toy.

587
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,680
- I like toys though.

588
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,420
Look I can rest my mic here.

589
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,260
I can hold it like this.

590
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,100
- Oh wait.

591
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,140
- Do you think this is what people want?

592
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,140
This is actually what the neck braces were.

593
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,140
They want you making fun of a fucking guy with a lifelong maybe disability?

594
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
It's not gonna be lifelong.

595
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,140
This new mic style isn't working.

596
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
No, it's not working at all.

597
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,140
This is a terrible, terrible mic.

598
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,140
This is horrible.

599
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,140
You basically, you've ruined the entire podcast.

600
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,140
You just ruined the momentum. I think we were about to hit it mainstream for a final year.

601
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
We were about to do the thing.

602
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,140
You know what? I did it on purpose.

603
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,140
That's shit.

604
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,680
What he just did is fucking shit.

605
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,780
- I ruined it on purpose, 'cause you know what?

606
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,880
- Ain't no way Cameron's going mainstream.

607
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,500
- Oh, look at this. - Oh, it's permanently on.

608
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,320
I can't take it off. - No, it's on the other side.

609
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,440
No, sorry, Caleb, it's permanently on.

610
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,160
- Got you.

611
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,480
- Here, do you want me to take yours off?

612
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,320
- No.

613
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,720
- Fuck it, though, I'll take mine off.

614
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,560
- Are you sure?

615
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,880
- No, I can't reach.

616
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,000
I have to spin it around.

617
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,200
- Are we all gonna take them off at the same time?

618
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,280
- Yeah. - Okay.

619
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,560
- Okay, three, two, one.

620
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:12,120
I guess they're off. No, they're not. Leave me alone. I will push through the worst pain

621
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,800
I've ever had in my life to strangle you to death. How are you going to get to my neck?

622
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,280
That's a good point. God damn it. You know who should have warned this? Bart Simpson.

623
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:29,800
Bart Simpson should have warned this. He would have had a better life. His life would have

624
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:36,520
Way better. Yeah. Is it worse though to know that your father is so ineffectual that he can't even strangle you?

625
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,840
Your dad is imagine that dude. That's how what you'd feel so bad cuz you're like wow I've neutered my dad

626
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,200
He's not even a man anymore. Is there green or red splotches?

627
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,980
I hate to say this your neck is the size of a noodle. Your neck is completely green

628
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,040
I think there might have been that might have been fake gold

629
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,520
Can I have that because that is a much better neck brace than the one I have

630
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,700
Exposure to air is burning how much did you spend on these?

631
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,340
$1000 how much was it you don't want to know tell me how much they were 70 bucks

632
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,860
each of the both of them were

633
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:14,180
$30 each of them were 30. Yeah, you spent 60 bucks on these neck braces 30 altogether

634
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:22,540
Put - oh yeah here when it comes to neck brace put two on

635
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:30,020
This is gonna protect your neck protect your neck Asher Roth vibe actually feel a little bit better brace put two on

636
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,700
All right, but we didn't just come here today to be

637
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:42,380
To belittle your friend to belittle our friend. We weren't belittling you we it was a show of solidarity

638
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,760
first off and second off it was

639
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,780
Honestly it does feel better

640
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,540
- I would, second of all, because you didn't get--

641
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,380
- I have a punching cable.

642
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,860
- I have three neck braces on.

643
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:57,980
- You didn't get that,

644
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,700
that, because you didn't get that neck brace

645
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,980
from the doctor, you just bought it.

646
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,060
We're, in the eyes of the universe, we're basically equal.

647
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,460
- Yeah. - 'Cause we both bought them.

648
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,580
- I guess you're right.

649
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,260
- So, using logic.

650
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,420
- Even if you go to the doctor,

651
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,260
though, you still have to buy it.

652
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,340
- Another fucking logic bomb from Cameron.

653
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,060
- But the doctor isn't, the doctor's different.

654
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,140
- Up top. - Oh.

655
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:21,540
- So today, before they decided to make my life a living,

656
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,940
- Fucking hell shit.

657
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,600
- No, you did that at the gym.

658
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
- You did that at the gym.

659
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,500
- Bitch.

660
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,340
- Whoa.

661
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,160
- Sorry.

662
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,000
- He's gotten hostile.

663
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,460
- I think he's a little too tight on his neck.

664
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,060
- I think my carotid artery is being, yeah.

665
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,500
- Yeah.

666
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,620
- My vagus nerve is being pinched right now.

667
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,460
- I would.

668
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:43,940
- It's really hurting, it's stopping a flow of chakras.

669
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:46,540
Do you guys believe in grounding yourself?

670
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,380
- No.

671
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,860
- Where you need to make sure that your electricity

672
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,700
is going into the earth?

673
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:50,660
- Didn't you know a lady that grounded herself?

674
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,660
I knew a lady who had a, yeah, when I worked at the museum,

675
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,740
I knew a lady who had a, she had a ground wire

676
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,180
that she plugged into the electrical.

677
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,700
- Well, what did it plug, what did she plug it into?

678
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:04,740
- Her clothes. - Her butt.

679
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,760
- I think that's something in a thousand years

680
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,220
they'll say actually you're right about that.

681
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,060
- I agree.

682
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,100
- 'Cause the whole body, human body's all electrical.

683
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,260
- And she seemed so happy, man.

684
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,100
- Yeah.

685
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,420
- Another logic bomb from Cameron.

686
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,740
- Also, she was a swine.

687
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,980
(laughing)

688
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,240
(laughing)

689
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,300
- I'm gonna keep said so.

690
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:26,460
- Guys, guys, what night is it, you piece of shit?

691
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,900
- Game night. - Game night.

692
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,220
- It's game night. - Game night.

693
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,860
- Guys, what's better than game night,

694
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,340
except for sex night and food night, I guess?

695
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,180
- Water night. - Movie night.

696
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,220
- I like water night, too.

697
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,860
- Water night is pretty good.

698
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,740
- Movie night. - Vacation night.

699
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,980
- Yeah, vacation. - Debate night.

700
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,180
- Night and-- - Debate night sucks.

701
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,300
- Speaking of movie night, night and day.

702
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
- Night at the museum. - Tom Cruise.

703
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,540
Night of the Museum is good.

704
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,220
- Yep, not Night of the Living Dead.

705
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,620
We don't like that. - Night of Too Many Stars,

706
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,460
Comedy Central.

707
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,420
- That was good. - Too Many Cooks.

708
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,260
- Too Many, Night of Too Many Cooks is good.

709
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,140
- Adult Swim. - Cartoon Network.

710
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,700
- Anyway. - Cartoon Neck Work.

711
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,780
- Neck don't work.

712
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,660
- Moving on to the next words.

713
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,300
The, we are playing some games tonight, right?

714
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,220
- Yeah, right.

715
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,600
So you keep talking 'cause I'm gonna shuffle these.

716
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,440
- Okay. - You gotta shuffle

717
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,280
the deck of cards. - We wanna play

718
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,500
our first game first though.

719
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,580
We don't wanna play that game.

720
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,980
- What was our first game? - Parts that we made.

721
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:22,140
- Oh. - What?

722
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,100
- Oh, we wanna do, I thought we were gonna do that

723
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,860
after this. - No, we're gonna go--

724
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,540
- We can do that, yeah, okay, fuck it.

725
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,380
- Maybe first? - 'Cause I was figuring

726
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,180
'cause the other game that we have,

727
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:33,380
the third game, feels like it makes sense

728
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,900
to be together with--

729
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,020
- Okay, all right, you're right.

730
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,140
- Am I right? - Yeah.

731
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,100
Let's play our first one.

732
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,420
- Okay. - Guys, what, so--

733
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:42,620
(laughing)

734
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,620
- In 2000 and something, 2009, 2008 style year,

735
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,740
some complete bloody lunatics had the idea.

736
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,700
They were like, card games are already so fun.

737
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,460
They're already so fucking fun.

738
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,700
- But the problem--

739
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,700
- The problem is there's no cussing in it.

740
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,340
- The problem is they're too humane.

741
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:05,380
- They're too much for humanity.

742
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,180
What if we made a set of cards that were both black and white

743
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,620
that were completely against all of humanity.

744
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,780
- He wanted to show off his shuffled skills so bad.

745
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,020
- I didn't show it off, I messed up two times in a row.

746
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,260
How's that showing it off?

747
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:20,820
- Let me see that shuffle you showed me

748
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,620
that one time that was cool as fuck.

749
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:26,020
- If you ask me, the other, the real cards

750
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,300
against humanity are--

751
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,740
- The one that they do for card tricks?

752
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,620
- Yeah, the cool one you do.

753
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:31,860
- It's called the Hindu shuffle.

754
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,700
Is that racist?

755
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,540
- Let me see it, is it racist?

756
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,360
- Well, I have to see it first.

757
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,460
- We're against humanity right now.

758
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,880
- Yeah, so we don't care.

759
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,220
- Holy shit, that is the most Hindu thing I've ever seen.

760
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,120
Well not really, I guess I've seen Hindu guys before.

761
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,340
- Yeah, they do that for card tricks.

762
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,820
- Listen, we basically are gonna be playing

763
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,360
Cards Against Humanity today with a little bit

764
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,160
of a custom set of cards, which we're pretty excited about.

765
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,640
So let's go ahead and dole out--

766
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,400
- They're so custom, even the back of the cards are custom.

767
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,120
- Yeah, it says what do you meme on the back of them.

768
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,540
- And that's not 'cause we couldn't find a deck.

769
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,820
of Cards Against Humanity,

770
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,260
which must not be doing very well

771
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,020
if they're no longer in Barnes & Noble,

772
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,700
but what do you meme is?

773
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,980
- That wasn't even in Barnes & Noble,

774
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,540
that was in Walgreens.

775
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,700
- All right, pass a couple of these out.

776
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,620
How many should we do in,

777
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,020
how do you do Cards Against Humanity?

778
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,860
- It's seven.

779
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,500
- Seven? - Seven's too many.

780
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,900
- Five. - No, seven feels like,

781
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,740
okay, five is, yeah.

782
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,180
- Five is a knive for me.

783
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,540
- Five is enough for me.

784
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:27,620
- Five is knive.

785
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,700
- Did you guys ever play Cards Against Humanity growing up

786
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,460
with your most fucking savage friends?

787
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,820
- I've never played it in my life.

788
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,660
- Really? - I played it with my

789
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,900
fucking mom and dad.

790
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:40,680
Yeah, so I'm gonna have to play my fucking brother and sister as well and basically my shithead grandma

791
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:47,180
All right guys, so how this is gonna work is Juvio is gonna give us a prompt right

792
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,260
That's how we decided to do it

793
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:55,220
Do you be able give us a prompt and then we will answer and whoever has the funniest one or the most raunchy?

794
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,660
Okay, let's go most mother fucked up

795
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:04,460
Yeah, the most most fucked up believe funny or funnily fucked funnily raunchily fucked up is basically gonna

796
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,140
- Oh man, I'm already seeing these cards

797
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,780
and even just looking at them is making me laugh.

798
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,540
- Yeah, and also when you put your cards out,

799
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,820
face them this way, guys.

800
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,220
- I have six cards.

801
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,060
- Put one back.

802
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,340
Something happened to me when I was counting.

803
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,740
- That's fine, I'll put this one back.

804
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,260
It just says Lizzo.

805
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,520
(laughing)

806
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,500
Okay, all right, here's the first one, guys.

807
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,260
I just made a huge salad,

808
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,340
and the main ingredient is blank.

809
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,980
- Okay, guys.

810
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,260
All right.

811
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,100
- Easy.

812
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,180
- Wait, I actually did have, wait, I miscounted.

813
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,340
- Oh no, wait, wait, wait.

814
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,300
Do you want Lizzo best?

815
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,580
- No, I'll take a different one.

816
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,220
- You cheated.

817
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,820
- All right, wait.

818
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,260
- Also, why is it so transparent now?

819
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:50,700
That's probably for the best.

820
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,780
- Okay.

821
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,100
All right, guys.

822
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,500
Here we go.

823
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,340
Are we ready to--

824
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,340
- Do we wanna shuffle them?

825
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,580
I guess Jubio has to pick which one is the best.

826
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:04,780
- Yeah, Jubia, you pick whatever one is the best one, okay?

827
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,540
All right, I'm gonna flip these over one by one.

828
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,380
- Okay.

829
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,700
- Okay, whoops, I'm doing it the wrong way.

830
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,540
All right.

831
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,380
I just made a huge salad, and the main ingredient is

832
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,340
Leslie Knope.

833
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,100
(laughing)

834
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,140
- What the hell?

835
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,900
- The fuck is wrong with that?

836
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
- What kind of fucked up salad would that be?

837
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,620
- That'd be crazy.

838
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,460
- That's fucking bizarre.

839
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,300
- Especially a huge salad.

840
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,120
- It'd be funny, though.

841
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:27,960
- Not a side one?

842
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,320
- I just made a huge salad, and the main ingredient is,

843
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,160
- What's it gonna be?

844
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,240
- The turd I crapped this morning.

845
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,800
Now that's a classic style.

846
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,280
That is a classic style against humanity one.

847
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,080
Okay, I just made a huge salad

848
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,240
and the main ingredient is poo poo and pee pee from a homo.

849
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,500
(laughing)

850
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,720
Okay.

851
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,240
- I like these cards.

852
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,360
- I think that says po poo.

853
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,920
- Po po and pay pay from a homo.

854
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,560
(laughing)

855
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,960
Okay, so those cards, I would say all three of them were definitely,

856
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,360
were certainly against humanity.

857
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:04,760
Definitely.

858
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,260
But which one is the funniest?

859
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,560
Jubio, do you have an answer for us?

860
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,960
Leslie Nope.

861
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,060
Leslie Nope.

862
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,760
And guys, that was mine.

863
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,660
Wow.

864
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,160
How do we want to mark points?

865
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,560
I guess...

866
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,260
With my fingers.

867
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:17,760
Okay.

868
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,460
Everybody hold up how many points you have.

869
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:19,860
Yeah.

870
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,260
So you guys hold up zero.

871
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,160
And then we draw another card now, right?

872
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,060
Okay, Jubio, give us the next, the next prompt, please, while we,

873
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,760
while we look for our next card.

874
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:31,420
- Oh shit.

875
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,900
- Oh hell no!

876
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,460
- Some of these are motherfucking amazing.

877
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,420
- What the fuck?

878
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,260
- Okay.

879
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,780
- Let's see this next prompt, GBO.

880
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,980
- I would like to play this.

881
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,060
I've never played this before,

882
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,760
but this does seem like the perfect thing

883
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,700
that I could play at a party.

884
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,540
- Yeah.

885
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,380
- It is a bit of a party game.

886
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,220
- Yeah.

887
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,820
- But not with normies.

888
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,980
- Any, well yeah.

889
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,820
Basically normies--

890
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,100
- I'd have to play with sick puppies.

891
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,380
- I'd have to play with sick fucks

892
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,220
with sick and fucking twisted people

893
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,860
who are 15 years old or under.

894
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,540
- Well, if you're hanging out at a party

895
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,820
and you're looking around and you're like,

896
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,580
man, there's a lot of broken toys here.

897
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,500
- Yeah. - Right?

898
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,820
- Island of Misfit toys. - Island of Misfit toys.

899
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,040
That's where you get this,

900
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,940
you pull out that black box of amazing cards.

901
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,780
- Yeah, and you say,

902
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,820
I'm gonna blow y'alls mother-loving minds.

903
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,380
- Okay.

904
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,100
The only thing that can stop Joseph Kony's

905
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,100
child militia of Christian fundamentalist terrorists is,

906
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,500
All right, guys.

907
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,300
I knew that one from the get-go.

908
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,060
This is pretty, this one is already, I mean.

909
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,860
Yeah, this one is gonna get a little weird.

910
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,540
All right, okay, you guys ready?

911
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,100
The prompt is already pretty weird.

912
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,940
All right, the only thing that can stop

913
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:39,660
Joseph Kony's child militia

914
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,340
of Christian fundamentalist terrorists, Pedobear.

915
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,820
Oh! What the heck?

916
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,380
That is not-- I am going,

917
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,860
I'm going home. I can't even handle that.

918
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,140
Wait, what is that? Ew!

919
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,820
Yeah. Wait, what is that?

920
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
We're gonna kick this, buddy.

921
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,660
We're getting rid of that one.

922
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:55,340
- You came back hard to the curb.

923
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:57,500
- Your mind has not been warped by fucking 4chan.

924
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:01,780
- The only thing that can stop Joseph Kony's terrorists

925
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,380
is when you're watching Chopped

926
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,020
and the chef decides to make a vinaigrette

927
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,360
with less than a minute left

928
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,860
and it's made from olive oil, lemon, shallot,

929
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,620
balsamic, sherry vinegar, a neutral oil,

930
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,160
honey, salt, and pepper.

931
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,000
Wow.

932
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,240
(laughing)

933
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,080
Okay.

934
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,300
I think that's a prompt.

935
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,300
No, I think that's an answer.

936
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,300
Okay.

937
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
The only thing that can stop Joseph Coney's

938
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,300
Child Militia, JubioTV.

939
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:35,300
Wow.

940
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
Wow. Okay. Now before Jubio votes on this,

941
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
I did just realize something a little

942
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,300
fucked.

943
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,300
Yeah, we have Pedobear twice.

944
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
Oh my god.

945
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,300
But something where my brain went is maybe

946
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Pedobear would be the perfect

947
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,300
thing to fight against children.

948
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,300
Because he'd fucking molest them

949
00:34:53,300 --> 00:35:00,180
Damn and maybe that's just cuz we're playing a game like this that I thought that cuz normally I don't have thoughts

950
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:07,940
About child armies or militias alright, so Juvio, can you give us an answer?

951
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,880
The the chop one that's the best one

952
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:20,840
So you have one point Wow alright everybody draw a card draw another card and you'll get our next one up there

953
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:29,720
I can't wait to see what my car is gonna be oh I think I might puke okay this

954
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:45,000
prompt is there's there's too many blank in my neighborhood this is like a real

955
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,040
Um, alright guys, are you guys ready for this one?

956
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
Yeah, I'm putting mine down.

957
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,040
Alright.

958
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Should...

959
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Somebody else read these ones.

960
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Oh, I have to read, yeah.

961
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
If you win, you have to read.

962
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,040
We should be, let's go on a circle.

963
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,040
Let's just go on a circle.

964
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Let's go on a reading circle.

965
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,040
Okay.

966
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,040
Let's go on a reading circle.

967
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,040
I thought mine was good.

968
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Just go ahead and read them.

969
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,040
Okay.

970
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,040
And remember to read the prompt.

971
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,040
There's too many "my anxiety and depression and AIDS in my neighborhood."

972
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,040
Anxiety and depression and AIDS?

973
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
Wow.

974
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:18,680
here. There's too many Adolf Hitler's wickedly evil souls in my neighborhood.

975
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,640
Okay. And this last one, there's too many the fly on Mike Pence heads in my

976
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,400
neighborhood.

977
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,320
All right.

978
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,600
What kind of crazy person wrote all three of these cards in the same

979
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,560
handwriting and color? Who would do that? These are all fucked up.

980
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,440
We're going to give it to this one, I think. The fly on Mike Pence head. Am I

981
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,160
right, Jubio?

982
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,000
Yeah, I agree.

983
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,440
Also, because it's just kind of fucking true.

984
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,440
That was mine.

985
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
Really?

986
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,940
And there is too many flies in my neighborhood.

987
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
You're a motherfucking expert at this game.

988
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,440
We each got a point, I think.

989
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Wow, expert.

990
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,940
So we can just reset it to zero, zero, zero.

991
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,940
Yeah, yeah.

992
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,940
Because we all got points.

993
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Okay, let's keep going.

994
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,940
Let's get another card here.

995
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,940
Okay, I just pulled my own name.

996
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:58,940
All right.

997
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,940
You can't say that out loud.

998
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,940
Well, who wrote my name down?

999
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,940
I don't know. Why don't you look at the handwriting?

1000
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,440
Cameron, it was Cameron.

1001
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,440
Oh, this is a two-parter.

1002
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Okay.

1003
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,940
Oh, this is a double?

1004
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,440
This is a daily double we hit.

1005
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,600
Alright.

1006
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,800
My blank just died.

1007
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,640
Hey, what are you doing?

1008
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,360
We're going in a circle, I didn't even get to read any yet.

1009
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,200
Okay, then read one.

1010
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,400
Chill, I'm waiting for him to finish typing.

1011
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,240
This guy fucking loves reading all the time.

1012
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,000
You're rushing, and now he put a green on the screen.

1013
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,960
You love reading.

1014
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,120
I love reading, I didn't get to read it all yet.

1015
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,400
Is it done?

1016
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,120
My blank just died.

1017
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:33,000
In their will, they left me a blank.

1018
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,320
So this is a two-parter.

1019
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,300
So we'll do the first blank on top, I guess.

1020
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,080
- Okay, all right, I got mine.

1021
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,220
- All right, start here.

1022
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,600
So this one's on top.

1023
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,880
My Dr. Poop just died.

1024
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,640
In their will, they left me a T-Pain with no auto-tune.

1025
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,480
Damn.

1026
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,320
- Damn.

1027
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,320
That is crazy.

1028
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,040
- That is pretty crazy.

1029
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:05,960
A little weird.

1030
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:11,100
My a penis slash cock just died.

1031
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,940
- No.

1032
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,420
- In their will, they left me.

1033
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,380
When you realize you just watched Kylie Jenner

1034
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,840
make a pancake on Snapchat for 15 minutes

1035
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,560
and you get a fucking boner.

1036
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,060
- Yep.

1037
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:25,420
- Okay, and then the last one here.

1038
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,020
My a dozen sperms just died.

1039
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:28,980
- No!

1040
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,600
- In their will, they left me, enjoying music.

1041
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,340
- Okay.

1042
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,980
Man, this game is actually kind of fun.

1043
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,220
I'm having a good time right now.

1044
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,460
I'm starting to kind of forget that the cameras are on

1045
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,540
and the microphone is on.

1046
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,980
I'm kind of just playing the game.

1047
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,480
I know.

1048
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,380
I think maybe it's not that good of an idea.

1049
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,740
Who won that round?

1050
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,300
Who won that round, Juvio?

1051
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,300
The Kylie Jenner one.

1052
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,980
That was me.

1053
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,820
Oh my god.

1054
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,380
Two points.

1055
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,100
Respect.

1056
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,780
And we're not the type of game night group

1057
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,340
who tears each other down over points.

1058
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,180
Oh, hell no.

1059
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:03,420
And whenever one of us earns a point, we all get the point.

1060
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,060
You know what?

1061
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,220
That's the new rule.

1062
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:07,860
So right now we're all at four points.

1063
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,580
Or three points or something.

1064
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,420
Okay, I'm drawing my two new cards.

1065
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,240
Okay.

1066
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,080
Okay.

1067
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:17,980
Yo, yo, yo, I'm yo mom, and I'm fat as blank.

1068
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,740
(laughing)

1069
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,300
Oh, I think I have a good one here.

1070
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,380
Is it okay if I play a political one with you guys?

1071
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,220
Yep.

1072
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,220
Okay, I'm gonna play a political one.

1073
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:28,780
Okay, I got mine as here as well.

1074
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,300
All right, Pat, go ahead.

1075
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,580
Yo, yo, yo, I'm yo mom, and I'm as fat as

1076
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,100
Vladimir Putin's homosexual proclivities

1077
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:43,140
So that's a holy fuck. That's a little yeah, that's political idea yo yo yo

1078
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,620
I'm yo mom, and I'm as fat as Patrick motherfucking Doran

1079
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:50,980
That's cold

1080
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,140
He put it down

1081
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,260
I'm as fat as Homer giving Marge a blowjob

1082
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,380
Homer is pretty fat

1083
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:07,760
Why is all these this weird guy who has this weird hand right? This is all the only cards are getting played

1084
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,280
Yeah, I will say Pat

1085
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,280
Why did you play because I know that he did the political one and I know I did the Homer one

1086
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:19,140
Why did you call your own self fat in this answer?

1087
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,120
so no one else would I

1088
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,720
Don't have that card

1089
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,600
Once Patrick my fucking

1090
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,020
Okay, well, that's why you know sometimes people

1091
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:40,120
They have to reduce usually should parody or stereotype in order to get a laugh damn. That is so sad

1092
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,960
Yeah, I'm pretty huh. I'm pretty are you?

1093
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,240
Okay, let's do

1094
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:56,000
After this one. Let's get all new cards. We go through the cards a little faster. Yeah, my cards are stinkers. Yeah, I do

1095
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,480
I can I show a stinker on camera

1096
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:58,980
Yeah.

1097
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,980
Then I know who made it and I kind of want to call them out.

1098
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,480
Yeah.

1099
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
Nobody can see that.

1100
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,480
I know, well he put, just put it in the, put the green screen back on. Why'd you take it on?

1101
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,480
That is just a Korean word.

1102
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
It's just in Korean.

1103
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,480
What does that say, Patrick?

1104
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
What does it say?

1105
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
Tell me what it says.

1106
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,480
Why did you use Google Translate?

1107
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,480
I think it's for the audience to find out.

1108
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,240
I don't think people know you told us what it said. I think is it white slave is that what I know

1109
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:36,280
No, you put white slave and I did not write white slave in Korean. You did that says Stan Jim in

1110
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,960
What's that?

1111
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:42,360
One of the ones he wrote down it was a white slave

1112
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:52,560
All right, I hate writing the bus and I take anyone from that one yeah, I hate writing the bus because I keep seeing blank

1113
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,000
Okay, okay

1114
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,760
This one when you read mine you could it's I know the thing says I hate riding the bus

1115
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,880
But you could also substitute. I love riding the bus

1116
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,160
Okay, all right, so if you want to substitute it. I hate riding the bus because I keep seeing okay. This is

1117
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,360
- No! - That one's an Easter egg.

1118
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,120
- Okay, just tell me what that one means,

1119
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,920
and then we might give you points for that.

1120
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,000
I hate riding the bus because I keep seeing

1121
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,280
amazing AF consensual sex.

1122
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,160
This says Frog Sullivan, okay.

1123
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,840
- And that one you could switch out love

1124
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,320
if you wanted to. - You're right.

1125
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,680
I hate riding the bus because I keep seeing

1126
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,160
the rat bastards who threw soup on the Mona Lisa itself.

1127
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,520
- Damn! (laughing)

1128
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,560
I think that one wins. - I would not wanna see that

1129
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,400
on the bus if I'm being real.

1130
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,240
- Yeah, that doesn't sound good.

1131
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,080
- If I'm keeping it 100.

1132
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,000
- All right, let's get all new cards.

1133
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:56,840
- Okay, all right.

1134
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,640
- I actually have some fire cards.

1135
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,400
- Yeah, just take as many as you want.

1136
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,480
I'm just gonna take a handful from over here.

1137
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,240
(laughing)

1138
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,360
- I'm pretty excited about the ones I pulled, actually.

1139
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,480
Oh my God, I got all the best cards.

1140
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,180
- We only have one card left now.

1141
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,240
Oh, you fucking did something crazy.

1142
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,080
- We'll do that at the end.

1143
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,900
- That's not right.

1144
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,740
- No, we'll do that at the end.

1145
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,560
- Why do you get every card?

1146
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,160
I got like seven.

1147
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:23,820
I got this one.

1148
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:27,120
You have way more than seven.

1149
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,880
That you can write down whatever you want.

1150
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,240
That's a blank.

1151
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
That's a blank.

1152
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,800
All right, give us the next one.

1153
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,880
Oh, another two-parter.

1154
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,360
Can we do a five-parter?

1155
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,200
Yeah, just start adding-- just start adding--

1156
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:39,680
No.

1157
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:39,920
--this one.

1158
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:41,520
--just start adding ingredients to it.

1159
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,880
If I had to eat it-- here, wait.

1160
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,920
You read it, Cam.

1161
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:46,840
If I had to eat a sandwich made with blank and blank,

1162
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,640
I'd barf.

1163
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,640
Hmm.

1164
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,840
Oh, I have a perfect one.

1165
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,200
Will we do top down again?

1166
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,040
- Yeah.

1167
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,960
- Oh my God.

1168
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,440
This one is like it was made for my-

1169
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,240
- Yeah, mine are pretty good as well.

1170
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,080
I'm pretty excited about this one.

1171
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:04,920
- All right.

1172
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,840
- All right, go ahead.

1173
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,100
- I'll start on this end.

1174
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:09,440
If I had to eat a sandwich made with-

1175
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,680
If I had to eat a sandwich made with

1176
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,560
chocolate that tastes disgusting,

1177
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,840
wait, that's not chocolate.

1178
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,840
and I have depression y'all, I'd barf.

1179
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,080
(laughing)

1180
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:33,320
- That's one of those like quirky meme answers maybe.

1181
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,160
Maybe that's from the original game.

1182
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:41,840
- If I had to eat a sandwich made with jizz and a chungus,

1183
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,440
(laughing)

1184
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,280
I'd barf.

1185
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,520
(laughing)

1186
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,780
(laughing)

1187
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,880
- I would not want to eat a chocolate sandwich.

1188
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,400
- Me neither, especially with jizz on it.

1189
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,800
- If I had to eat a sandwich made with popo and pee

1190
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,800
and jizz from a fucking dinosaur with COVID-19, I'd barf.

1191
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,880
- That is the type of deliciously random stuff

1192
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,600
that this game is all about.

1193
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,920
- God, that is just hauntingly against humanity.

1194
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,520
That is just, on the next level of raunchy.

1195
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,760
Read that one again.

1196
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
From a fucking dinosaur with

1197
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:23,040
19 god damn that is next level if I could mix and match here

1198
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,200
I would just put a shungus twice me too if I had to eat a sandwich made with a chunk of center chungus

1199
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,120
Yeah, what's that make I?

1200
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,760
Can't this is perfect for the chocolate one - wow

1201
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,040
All right, and then the last card

1202
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:40,960
You let's see. Oh, no, we'll finish all of our cards, and then we'll do the last card. All right

1203
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:45,000
I think that's the move. Okay, give us another one. Yeah, I need some some of my car

1204
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:49,400
You guys took too many cards. No, I didn't you guys both had wanted me to fail

1205
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:58,940
Okay, I know this one for Caleb's birthday on April 17th. Thank you. I'm going to get him blank

1206
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:08,560
Come on guys, what are you gonna get me for my birthday? Wait, I got this

1207
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:13,600
Slamming that one down

1208
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:20,280
Okay, I'm shuffling these up. Mix those up. Alright guys, for Caleb, that's me, for my

1209
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:26,560
birthday on April 17th, I'm going to get Caleb when there's no toilet paper left so you have

1210
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:38,680
to twerk and you're crap on the fucking toilet seat and it makes you jizz. Okay, that's another

1211
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,140
- That's a good one.

1212
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:42,860
For Caleb's birthday on April 17th,

1213
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,860
I'm going to get him a reciprocating oral sex for hours.

1214
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:50,500
(laughing)

1215
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:55,260
For Caleb's birthday on April 17th,

1216
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,180
I'm going to get him doing consensual cum shots.

1217
00:46:58,180 --> 00:47:00,620
(laughing)

1218
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:05,620
Yep, those are some raunchy AF fucking bars.

1219
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:07,620
- Here's the problem.

1220
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:09,300
I think they all win again.

1221
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:12,020
Yeah, this is a clear tie, I think.

1222
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,540
From reciprocating oral sex for hours,

1223
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:19,140
doing consensual cum shots, I mean, it's all just good, man.

1224
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,340
Yeah.

1225
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,500
Oh, fuck, okay.

1226
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,300
So that's another point for all of us.

1227
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:24,140
Okay.

1228
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:24,980
All right.

1229
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:25,800
All right.

1230
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:26,640
Pat, you get this one.

1231
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,620
Adolf Hitler really liked.

1232
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:29,860
Damn, you guys are really fast.

1233
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,460
When you read mine, you're gonna fucking scream.

1234
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:33,300
Yeah?

1235
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,300
Yeah.

1236
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,260
You're gonna scream.

1237
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,100
I'm ready to scream, I think.

1238
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:38,900
It's like someone wrote a joke.

1239
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,180
It's like the joke was just written all the way through

1240
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,020
without randomness involved.

1241
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:47,020
- Adolf Hitler really liked smoking crap with a bad bitch.

1242
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:48,180
- That is some real shit.

1243
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,880
- Adolf Hitler really liked--

1244
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,100
- The cards are getting harder to pick up.

1245
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:54,340
- Justin Bieber.

1246
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,180
(laughing)

1247
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,780
Adolf Hitler really liked when you hear someone say moist.

1248
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:00,700
(laughing)

1249
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,940
- That's just a real card.

1250
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,380
No one even fucking wrote that.

1251
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:06,820
That was printed by the company.

1252
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:07,820
This one wins.

1253
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,820
You're giving it to the most-

1254
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:09,820
Woo!

1255
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:10,820
We didn't even fucking make that one!

1256
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,820
That's mine!

1257
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:12,820
Yo, what's your problem?

1258
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:13,820
That's my card.

1259
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:14,820
That's bullshit.

1260
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,820
The Justin Bieber one deserved to win.

1261
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:16,820
I don't know whose that was!

1262
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,540
Okay, wait.

1263
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:20,540
I know this one.

1264
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,540
Cameron, you get this one.

1265
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,140
Yo, yo, yo.

1266
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:30,820
I'm a thug gangsta and I love blank.

1267
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,900
I never thrown a card down that fast.

1268
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,700
I don't know.

1269
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:36,700
Maybe I gave Cameron too many of my cards.

1270
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:38,700
Oh no.

1271
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:40,700
Um.

1272
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,700
Can I add a word?

1273
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,700
Yeah.

1274
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,700
I can add a word. I know it's mine so I'll just read.

1275
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,700
You'll see.

1276
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,700
I think it'll be okay.

1277
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,700
Yo yo yo, I'm a thug gangsta.

1278
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,700
And I love mumble rap.

1279
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,700
Puke emoji.

1280
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,700
No.

1281
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,700
Yo yo yo, I'm a thug gangsta.

1282
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,700
And I love Cameron's man boobs.

1283
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,540
- Oh.

1284
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,200
- Who wrote that one?

1285
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,100
Who put that down?

1286
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,940
- Patrick did.

1287
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,300
- Do thug gangstas really like that?

1288
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,220
- They really like it.

1289
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,060
- They might.

1290
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,040
- They like when you wear just a lace top

1291
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,160
and you're just walking down the street

1292
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:14,220
and the thug gangstas go, "Damn."

1293
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,900
- I think you should dress like Ice Spice.

1294
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,200
- I'm gonna add a word to mine now.

1295
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,940
Yo, yo, yo, I'm a thug gangsta

1296
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,140
and I love being a Slytherin.

1297
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,020
- Damn. - Whoa.

1298
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,820
- Thug gangstas really, truly are

1299
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,220
the Slytherin of the streets.

1300
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:29,000
(laughing)

1301
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,840
Yeah.

1302
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:34,260
- Basically, the homeless people are the Ravenclaws.

1303
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,100
- Yeah.

1304
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,460
- The police are the Gryffindor,

1305
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:37,940
the gangsters are the Slytherin.

1306
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:40,060
- And then me walking to school, I'm a Hufflepuff.

1307
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,220
- And I'm straight Hufflepuffed out.

1308
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,060
- Yeah, I'm Hufflepuffing it up.

1309
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:43,780
- Huffing and puffing.

1310
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,100
- Damn.

1311
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,420
Okay, all right.

1312
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,260
- Slytherin wins.

1313
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,420
- Slytherin wins, that's right.

1314
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:50,860
But I'll split my points with you guys.

1315
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,700
We can just get a three.

1316
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:52,860
- How many cards do you have?

1317
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:53,700
- Three.

1318
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,520
- I have four.

1319
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,620
Do you want one?

1320
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:56,460
- How many do you have?

1321
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,660
- If you have three, just take,

1322
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:00,220
this will make it equal if you take one from me.

1323
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,540
You have three.

1324
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:05,780
You have three.

1325
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:07,900
He's doing his talk his way through a math problem.

1326
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:10,340
Well, you have three and he has four.

1327
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,260
And you had two.

1328
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,900
[LAUGHTER]

1329
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,780
I thought you had one more.

1330
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,700
I don't know why.

1331
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,940
Oh, man.

1332
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:21,620
By the way, all of the ones I have right now are Patrick's.

1333
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,140
And they're--

1334
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,740
Mine too.

1335
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,940
[LAUGHTER]

1336
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,420
All right, this is a double.

1337
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,300
This is good.

1338
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:29,780
You thought I was feeling you?

1339
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,020
That blank a blank.

1340
00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:33,660
- Oh, oh, oh.

1341
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:34,940
Top, top down again?

1342
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:36,580
- Man, mine don't make any sense.

1343
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:40,060
- Mine make a surprising amount of sense.

1344
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,020
- All right, wait, I gotta.

1345
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,300
Okay, all right, ready?

1346
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,540
- Yeah.

1347
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:46,240
- You thought I was feeling you?

1348
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,580
- That's, wait, wait, other way.

1349
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,420
- Okay.

1350
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,780
- All the other ones are the other way.

1351
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,100
- You thought I was feeling you?

1352
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,060
That me when I bat the rotten asshole of a roadkill,

1353
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:59,820
When I eat the rotten asshole of a roadkill skunk

1354
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:01,740
and I down it with beer,

1355
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:07,100
a Karen who joined the Taliban.

1356
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:09,420
Wow.

1357
00:51:09,420 --> 00:51:11,380
That, that one was good.

1358
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:12,820
- That is against humanity.

1359
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:13,660
- All right.

1360
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,020
- That is fo' sho' against humanity.

1361
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,540
- You thought I was feeling you?

1362
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,140
That horny teacher fucks janitor pegging style

1363
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,860
a Caleb's Mangina.

1364
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:26,740
Don't have a Mangina, that's not a very funny card.

1365
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:29,900
That was for humanity, if anything.

1366
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,820
OK.

1367
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,620
You thought I was feeling you?

1368
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:37,540
That the left shark at the Super Bowl, a Karen with AIDS.

1369
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:39,940
[LAUGHTER]

1370
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:46,880
All right.

1371
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,660
Karen with AIDS.

1372
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,460
Karen with AIDS.

1373
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,540
All right, we each have one card left.

1374
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,020
Let's just put the cards in.

1375
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,060
And then we'll do one last one where

1376
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,180
we have to just answer with the single card we have left.

1377
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,220
Okay.

1378
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,220
- All right, give us a prompt.

1379
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,540
- Yeah, give us a, we need two more prompts.

1380
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:06,540
- The best thing to pair with cannabis, dot, dot, dot.

1381
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,180
- The best thing to pair with cannabis.

1382
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:11,180
- The best thing to pair with cannabis, y'all.

1383
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,700
So we're getting a little illegal on this one.

1384
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,540
- Okay.

1385
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:16,380
- I'll mix 'em up.

1386
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:19,580
The best thing to pair with cannabis,

1387
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,140
consensually enjoying your partner's body.

1388
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,380
(laughing)

1389
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:26,620
(laughing)

1390
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:31,020
- The best thing to, Thiyong, to pair with cannabis,

1391
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:35,480
a fucking Hitler who is Korean, O underscore O.

1392
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,580
That has to be the worst thing to pair with cannabis.

1393
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:38,420
- Yeah, that would freak me out.

1394
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,260
- I would have a bad trip.

1395
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:40,080
(laughing)

1396
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,920
- But is it against humanity?

1397
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,960
- I'm a fucking Korean Hitler, dude.

1398
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,060
That's ruining, that would ruin a cigarette.

1399
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,660
- Is it against humanity, though?

1400
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:47,500
- Yes, yes.

1401
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,280
- I hate to admit it, it's completely against humanity.

1402
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,500
- The best, Thiyong, to pair with cannabis

1403
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,500
When you eat something

1404
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:58,120
That is fucking crazy, okay

1405
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:04,260
Give us one more final final prompt final prompt put it in the middle. Okay. I'm scared. I'm terrified

1406
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,960
Oh, actually I know exactly what really

1407
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:15,100
Yeah, is it gonna give us another prompt? Let's see this final prompt. It just need we just need one card make it a really good

1408
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:21,260
I'm really getting fucking nervous to be oh, why don't you we sent them to you? Why don't you copy and paste them?

1409
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:26,260
There was a movie about the Titanic starring blank.

1410
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:28,980
- You guys ready?

1411
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:29,800
- Yeah.

1412
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,800
- There was a movie about the Titanic starring as the ship.

1413
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,300
- Lizzo.

1414
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,300
- Lizzo.

1415
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,620
- Or the iceberg, come on.

1416
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:43,220
- Damn. - Wow, what a game.

1417
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,060
- That was amazing, dude.

1418
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,020
- That was amazing.

1419
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:48,180
- We really should be professionally doing that, I think.

1420
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:49,580
All right, what's the next game in Game Night?

1421
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:50,420
What's this?

1422
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:52,420
Smart

1423
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:55,180
That's right, we got a fucking copy of wine smart

1424
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:02,420
Episodes about to go sideways guys, and if you're wondering what did Mario Batali say about wine smarts

1425
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:09,780
Well, I'll tell you right now wine smarts is the greatest game ever for wine snobs wine geeks cork dorks and even nascent eno files

1426
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,920
Wasn't he in an eno file? No. He was a

1427
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,100
Rape a rapist he was a rapist. He's a sexual

1428
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,700
misconduct er

1429
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:26,260
Bad guy do you know the difference between a Barbara and a burgundy would you like to read wine list with more confidence?

1430
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:31,660
Well, here's the thinking person's drinking game with lots of interesting and useful wine facts to expand your wine knowledge

1431
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:35,160
It's got a ribbon. It does have a ribbon. That's how you know red ribbon next level

1432
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:41,800
That's how you know this an expensive game work. I think it's just questions and answers. Okay, okay, maybe we can each take

1433
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,060
one I

1434
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:46,160
Think I have all the grape questions

1435
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:53,980
Mario Batali did guys all right this one is a wild card ready uh-huh true or false French wine

1436
00:54:53,980 --> 00:55:00,700
Regulations require winemakers to age wine in French oak barrels false

1437
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:02,900
Let's say false

1438
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:10,500
Answer false yes, and you have yes Mars while the French require many things specific grape selections refraining from adding acid to the wines

1439
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:14,060
Etc they do not require winemakers to use French oak barrels

1440
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:20,040
I have one. This is the real Cards Against Humanity. This is way better than Cards Against Humanity.

1441
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:26,480
If you buy a California wine with a 2003 vintage, what, and this is for the math heads, what

1442
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:35,480
percent of the grapes must have been harvested that year? A, 51%, B, 68%, C, 95%, or D, 100%?

1443
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:41,320
100%. 51%. Okay. That's my guess.

1444
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,720
It's 95%. Dang.

1445
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:44,720
- Dang. - Let's split the difference here.

1446
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,880
- Okay, you guys can each have half a point.

1447
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,720
- This game's fun.

1448
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,560
- Yeah. - Okay.

1449
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,920
- But let's just do a couple more cards from it.

1450
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,860
- Which of these red grapes is known

1451
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,820
for its tannic structured wines

1452
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,720
with tastes of chocolate, blackcurrant, and tobacco?

1453
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,060
- Merlot.

1454
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,280
- Cabernet Sauvignon.

1455
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,000
- A, Cabernet. - Merlot, Merlot, Merlot.

1456
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,920
- B, Merlot.

1457
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:06,080
C, Grenache.

1458
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,040
- It's Merlot all day. - Grenache.

1459
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,760
- Just show me-- - Or D, Zinfandel.

1460
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:11,600
- Cab Saff. - Oh yeah.

1461
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:14,600
Oh yeah, that's right. You are like a wine master.

1462
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:18,600
I'm a wine-minded fellow. I'm gonna do one last one.

1463
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,600
I think we're running out of cards.

1464
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,600
The one thing I want to point out, he worked at a liquor store for like a year.

1465
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,600
Not even a year.

1466
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,600
Okay guys, which champagne is most likely the driest?

1467
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:33,600
Brut, Cuvier, Demi-Sec, or Extra Dry?

00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:37,600
I'm saying Brut.

1469
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:38,600
Just as a...

1470
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:39,600
What are you saying?

1471
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:40,600
Extra Dry.

1472
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:46,440

00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:57,600
broader trivia questions wait oh shit we fucking do we do have broader trivia

1475
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:01,040
that's right we kind of prepared some trivia for each other for game night

1476
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,360
because I figured we didn't want it we'd had the wine game but we want to do some

1477
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,640
other styles of true yeah cuz not we don't know that we're not all about wine

1478
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:10,640
I'm being honest. Okay, who goes first?

1479
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,640
Uh, Cameron can go first. No, I'll go third. Get that outta here!

1480
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:17,640
Well then I will go second. So Patrick will go first.

1481
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,640
No, I'll go first. Okay, we'll just go round robin here, okay?

1482
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:24,640
Yeah. Alright guys, you have 15 seconds on the clock. Ready?

1483
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:28,640
Okay. What is a lucky Pierre?

00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:33,640
A. An average looking man who miraculously gets the hottest guy in the club.

00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:36,920
B, the middle man having sex with two other men.

1486
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,340
C, a very attractive French man.

1487
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,580
- I'm gonna go with B.

1488
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:44,400
- Okay, B. - A, A.

1489
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,080

1490
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:47,920
- Yes.

1491
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,600
- B, the middle man having sex with two other men.

- Wow. - Which could be,

1494
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,360
I was thinking maybe like,

maybe they look like pieces of bread,

1496
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,400
the two white penises. - Well, it's 'cause

of the Eiffel Tower.

1498
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:05,480
- Oh, that makes a lot more sense.

1499
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,040
I was thinking it was two beautiful,

1500
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:09,040
long, baguette-style white penises.

1501
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,920
- No.

1502
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,080
- But I guess you're right.

1503
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,480

Jin, Jungkook, J-Hope, or Jimin?

1508
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:23,840

- Whoa! - Whoa!

1511
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:28,360
- Good shit.

1512

- It's actually D, who can say?

1520
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,800
We don't actually know what happens to your soul.

1521
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,640
- People haven't figured that one out yet.

1522
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:59,040
- Two points for skateboard P.

1523
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,680
- Skateboard P got two points.

1524

- Oh, I know this one, I know this one, I know this one.

00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:16,000
Don't even read the answers, I know this one.

1531
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,340

- A, no reason, but don't worry about it.

1537
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,480

1538
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,840
Guys, the answer is A, you both get 10 points.

1539
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,840

00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,880
I totally was guessing, by the way.

1542
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,400
- Yeah, we didn't say I know this one.

1549
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,120
Cameron gets the point.

1550
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,320
- Fuck me, man, I suck at fucking trivia.

1551
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,160
- I'm so good at trivia.

1552
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,480

- Yeah, you'll--

1554

- D. - D.

1564
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,480
- That's correct.

1565
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:29,320
- Really? - Wow.

1566
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,320
- Oh my god. - He actually really knows.

1567
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,980
- Okay, guys, what is an otter?

1568
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:38,540
A, a hairy man with a slender physique.

1569
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:41,560
B, a sex toy to be used in the bath.

1570
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,920
C, a gay man with lots of pets.

1571
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:48,520
Or D, a water animal.

1572
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,440
- D, I'm gonna go A and D.

1573
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,080
D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D.

1574
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:54,040
- It was both A and D, he was right.

1575
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,560
He gets double points. - Oh my god.

1576
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:56,520
And I get single points?

1577
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,200
- A hairy man with a slender physique.

1578
01:00:58,200 --> 01:00:59,440
You don't get a single point.

1579
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,680
- What I guess was right.

1580
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:01,960
You said A and D.

1581
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:02,880
- You have to get 'em both.

1582
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,080
- You have to get both of them.

1583
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:05,640
- That's a trick question.

1584
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,440
- Oh, he's never played trivia before

1585
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:09,360
and realized there's something called a double answer.

1586
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,640
- You'll get this one.

1587
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:11,480
- I don't like you.

1588
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,720
I'm gonna rip your neck off.

1589
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,200
- Don't threaten him right now 'cause you'll get this one.

1590
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:21,200
- How many kids does quizzes.com user Anna W's mom have?

1591
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,080
- Zero.

1592
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:24,760
- One, two, three, or four?

1593
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,000
- Two.

1594
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:26,920
- I'm gonna say three.

1595
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,820
She's a middle child.

1596
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,660
- One.

1597
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:30,480
- It is four.

1598
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:31,320
- Four, four.

1599
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:32,160
I said four.

1600
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:32,980
- You said one.

1601
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,060
- Well, I was thinking four.

1602
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:37,760
- Well, that's fair.

1603
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,600
Give him the points.

1604
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:39,420
- Yeah.

1605
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,260
(laughing)

1606
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,100
- All right, let's hear this next one.

1607
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,420
- When I said one, I meant I have one answer.

1608
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:44,440
And this is my last one.

1609
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,240
- Okay, I have two more after this.

1610
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,520
- Okay, so Cameron, you do yours,

1611
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,200
and then you can finish both of yours.

1612
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,040
- All right.

1613
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,240
And this, like I said, they're getting easier as they go.

1614
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,280
What shape is the universe?

1615
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:58,080
A, a vast disc.

1616
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:02,240
B, shapeless and formless, an infinite ocean.

1617
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,800
C, a minuscule point in a sea of nothing.

1618
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:08,560
Or D, we don't know, who can say?

1619
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,960
- D.

1620
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:10,840
- D.

1621
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,360
- It's actually a vast disc.

1622
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:13,200
- Wow.

1623
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:14,680
- I've actually figured out that it's a disc.

1624
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,600
- Damn.

1625
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,040
- So you guys are both wrong.

1626
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:17,880
It's all your points.

1627
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:18,720
(laughing)

1628
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,560
- All right.

1629
01:02:19,560 --> 01:02:21,400
- Wait, we have a chance to get him back right here.

1630
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,960
- You have a chance to get him back, they're my questions.

1631
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,760
- He's done, he has zero points.

1632
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:27,680
zero points. But here are my final two trivia questions.

1633
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,040
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

1634
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:33,880
How old is Anna W from quizzes.com's mom?

1635
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:40,960
A 10 B 46 C 47 or D 25.

1636
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,080
I'm gonna say 46.

1637
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,480
I'll say 47 just so we have difference.

1638
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,040
Cameron is right.

1639
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:49,440
Oh my god.

1640
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,120
Why would she make the old the oldest one?

1641
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,940
- You have the chance to win it back.

1642
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,060
I have one more question.

1643
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:58,900
- Okay, I'm set.

1644
01:02:58,900 --> 01:02:59,840
I won it back already.

1645
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,680
I don't even have to worry.

1646
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,200
- Yeah, you do, 'cause if I win this, I beat you.

1647
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,660
- If, yeah, if he wins this, I'm gonna beat you either way.

1648
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,320
- How many friends does Anna W.

1649
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:10,220
from quizzes.com's mom have?

1650
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:16,840
A, two, B, four, C, one, or D, none of the above?

1651
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:19,440
- None of the above?

1652
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,120
That's a horrible thing to throw in there.

1653
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:22,480
- This is pretty scary, 'cause--

1654
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,280
Statistically, it has to be none of the above.

1655
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,480
'Cause there's so many numbers that aren't covered by that.

1656
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,320
- Nerd. - This guy's a nerd.

1657
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,320
- I'm gonna say four.

1658
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,800
- I'll say none of the above.

1659
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,040
- Ooh, Caleb.

1660
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,040
Cameron gets the point.

1661
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:36,880
- No!

1662
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,840
(laughing)

1663
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,760
Ow, my neck!

1664
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:45,800
- Anna W's mom has none of the above friends.

1665
01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:48,440
She had maybe five friends or zero.

1666
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,360
Or three.

1667
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:51,200
- Or any number.

1668
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,080
- Any number that wasn't listed.

1669
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,480
- It's all about statistics, Caleb.

1670
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,400
- This is me, this is the face I'm making right now.

1671
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,240
I'll tell you that right now.

1672
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,060
- This is you.

1673
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,560
- Yeah, that's me, I'm having a complete heart attack.

1674
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:03,760
I'm also this baby with the beanie.

1675
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,600
- This is me.

1676
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:05,440
- And I'm a dog with a thing on.

1677
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:06,280
- This is Patrick.

1678
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,120
- Yep, that's me.

1679
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:07,940
- This is also Patrick.

1680
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:08,780
- Holy crap.

1681
01:04:08,780 --> 01:04:09,620
- This is Caleb.

1682
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:10,440
- Now we just have all these photos in here.

1683
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,080
- This is Caleb as fuck.

1684
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:13,280
This is Caleb.

1685
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:14,120
- Oh, that is me.

1686
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:14,940
- That's our fucking president.

1687
01:04:14,940 --> 01:04:15,780
- This is me.

1688
01:04:15,780 --> 01:04:16,620
- Yeah, this is fine.

1689
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:17,440
- This is Caleb.

1690
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,280
Let's freestyle.

1691
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:20,240
- Oh, this is the most Caleb of all.

1692
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,580
(laughing)

1693
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,360
- Can we freestyle a couple memes real quick

1694
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,820
off these photos just here at the end?

1695
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,660
- Yeah, sure.

1696
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,400
- Yeah, let's do--

1697
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:29,440
- When you're a sexy-ass woman sitting there.

1698
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,280
- When you're about to fuck Caleb.

1699
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,120
- When you're about to go fuck Caleb.

1700
01:04:32,120 --> 01:04:34,520
- Get your fucking shit fucking, get your foot out.

1701
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:35,440
- When Patrick wants,

1702
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,080
when you're a woman and Patrick wants you.

1703
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:40,200
- Damn, get away from me, you fucking creep.

1704
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,600
That's what they say to him.

1705
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:43,200
- Women, when Patrick shows up.

1706
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:44,400
- Yeah, they peace out.

1707
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,760
(laughing)

1708
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:51,840
Girlfriend and I shared our one-year anniversary Patrick what Patrick when he hears these memes Patrick when he strikes out with one of the millions

1709
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,840
Of women that he tries every women when they see

1710
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:58,760
Women after they go on a date with Patrick

1711
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:18,160
Meanwhile woman about to be fucked by me. Yeah, they're like shit. Let's do this thing, and they don't even take their clothes off

1712
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:24,600
Well, that was incredible, and I didn't know nobody said anything about me with these photos, which was Caleb in his neck brace

1713
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:27,040
No, that's both of these are Caleb

1714
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,860
No, this is this is actually me when you're when you're a cat me

1715
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:36,560
When you're not when you're a cat when you're this is when you're a woman that Patrick killed and then taxidermy

1716
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:40,680
