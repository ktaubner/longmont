00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,300
Back on the team.

23
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,300
He's not slim.

24
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,300
Live from the womb.

25
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,300
What about guess who's fat?

26
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,300
And it's... you have to guess.

27
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,300
I'm gonna guess Patrick.

28
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,300
Yes!

29
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,300
Yes!

30
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,300
But, just a guess.

31
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Will, I don't know you that well.

32
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,300
He knows you that well.

33
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,300
I'm sorry, man. I feel bad.

34
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,300
The first time, the first time,

35
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,300
the first and only time Patrick's ever, or Will ever

36
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:55,300
met Patrick though, we were making a documentary

37
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
about Patrick eating food.

38
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:05,180
Yeah, I guess I guess yeah to be fair though you you were projecting just insane alpha status the way you were eating that like

39
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:10,740
Cheddar cheese spaghetti shit. Yeah, I thought you might yeah, I thought you were like 26 28

40
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,220
There's nothing more

41
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,860
We gotta make a documentary about this old guy.

42
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:32,060
But yeah, that's me man.

43
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,420
I don't know what to tell you.

44
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:36,300
We have Will Duncan here.

45
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,300
What's up everyone?

46
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,300
Will Duncan.

47
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:42,700
We had to teach Will how to download Audacity before this episode.

48
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,780
Yeah, it took 21 minutes.

49
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,020
Cam came through because he's the best with computers.

50
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,020
He kept downloading Opera.

51
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,020
I don't know how.

52
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:53,940
I have three copies of Opera on my computer if anybody wants one.

53
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,180
They each cost $8.99 so it's like...

54
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,940
Yeah, we can sell that shit, dude.

55
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,780
You can sell Opera Browser.

56
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,500
Yeah.

57
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,780
I'm an app flipper.

58
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,100
I download apps and I sell them back to people.

59
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,580
Yo, you should write a little sci-fi-esque, kind of...

60
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,620
Black Mirror episode.

61
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,380
George RR Martin-esque.

62
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,940
Yeah.

63
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,460
Kind of Shire-esque.

64
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,100
Yeah, kind of J.R.R. Rowling.

65
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,740
But it's a team of apps.

66
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,820
Yeah, there's a good lot of apps.

67
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,260
The team of apps and they all have to have sex with each other?

68
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,260
Yeah, yeah.

69
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,260
Yeah, and there's a bomb.

70
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,260
You have to figure out how to do that.

71
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,300
And there's a bomb and it's in one of the apps.

72
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,940
They get downloaded at the end.

73
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:34,900
And there's a car and there's a heist.

74
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,420
It's like a version of that Seth Rogen movie about food that once they get eaten, it's

75
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,420
so-

76
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,420
Yeah, apps part of it.

77
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,420
50/50?

78
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,780
Apps want to get downloaded.

79
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,820
What about, what was the fucking Emoji movie?

80
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,900
It was like emojis want to get sent or some shit?

81
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:55,060
they were like yeah yeah I need to be the first in line in the text chamber

82
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:03,300
please send me yeah there's a fuck I forgot they go into the just dance app

83
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,700
and they do emoji dance which is so funny like the just a hit my app Dom's

84
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,620
brother came home from that movie and was like explaining like he saw it with

85
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,460
his friends as a joke and then he came home so mad he was like explaining it to

86
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,400
us and he was almost like crying. I saw that movie in the theaters. It's so sick that just movies that are just

87
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,300
commercials the entire way through. Yeah. Dude. Like not like a Beats Pill and a

88
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:36,000
Transformer movie just the entire movie is a commercial. Yeah. Like the Angry Birds movie. That was a whole fucking like moment I feel like in like Wreck-It Ralph

89
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,700
that movie like Pixels or whatever. Pixels. The Emoji movie. Pixels is an advertisement for video games. The Geico movie.

90
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,700
They were like, "Oh!"

91
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,700
They were like, "Wait, can we just do this shit?"

92
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,700
Oh yeah, we can.

93
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Oh yeah, nobody's gonna notice as long as we get like Hans Zimmer to make a slow-mo underneath the fucking movie.

94
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,700
You know where we are now in this timeline?

95
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
You know where we are now?

96
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,700
We're in the like, movies about candy shit now.

97
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,700
Yeah.

98
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:06,700
The new wave of like, troll movies where every character just looks the same, it's the same troll and you're like...

99
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,700
And you can eat the movie.

100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,700
Sherlock Gnomes.

101
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:16,340
Sherlock Gnomes. We should make a, they should make a just truly a candy movie

102
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,860
just go all out. Candy movie. Skittles versus Hershey's. That would actually be sick.

103
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,420
Versus me and I get to eat all the candy. This is a big naked man at the end

104
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:33,660
eats all of it. Yeah, big naked ball baby. Yeah and like Twizzlers plays like a racist sheriff or

105
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,900
something yeah that'd be good Twizzlers played by Walton Goggins I was thinking

106
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:48,920
I was thinking like Clint Eastwood yeah his final before he croaks before he

107
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,700
ascends mm-hmm that's right to the RNC chair can I just make a disclaimer about

108
00:04:54,700 --> 00:05:00,260
my fart take yeah in quarantine I've developed a pretty bad tick of just

109
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,740
Making a really piercing kind of disabilitating fart sound whenever there's an awkward sounds or just remember

110
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,260
I'm not interested in what someone's saying so if that pops up a lot

111
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,660
That's why that's why that's happening is that you do you want to don't want to be here. Yeah, okay?

112
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,100
All right, I just wanted to make sure just so people know that yeah, I had to move a bunch of stuff around

113
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:25,860
I don't really know you guys. You know it's kind of weird. You know mm-hmm. Yeah, no we hate this, too

114
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,980
Yeah, it's kind of like a Twitter thing. We're doing it for Twitter really yeah

115
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,420
We're doing this to promote your videos where you talk to our friend. Yeah, exactly. Yeah

116
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,500
That's the connection here pretty much and all of the money is actually going towards kovat 19 relief. So yeah

117
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,700
Yeah, so donate

118
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,380
Yeah, just hit my memo it's all going to

119
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:54,140
19 relief. Yeah, the trick is to make your Venmo kovat 19 relief and people just donate all the time. Yeah

120
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,460
That's not a bad. That's what I do

121
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,220
I go I open up Venmo and I just type in whatever I want to donate to I just open up and when

122
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,060
I type in starving children in Africa and send ten thousand dollars.

123
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
That's how it works.

124
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,060
And you hope it gets there.

125
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,860
That's like when people would like buy up websites.

126
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Yeah.

127
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,180
When websites first came out you just buy up any fucking URL.

128
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,180
It's like land.

129
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Yeah exactly.

130
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,180
Yeah.

131
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:16,180
First it was land then it was websites.

132
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,180
Yeah.

133
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,940
Now it's Venmo and cash app accounts where you just call it like at God.

134
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
Yeah.

135
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,940
And then you just get fucking so much money.

136
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Six million dollars.

137
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
Yeah.

138
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,500
What do you do for work?

139
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
My pinball is at God.

140
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,940
I just kind of sit around, rake it in.

141
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
Yeah.

142
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Doing cool shit.

143
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,660
Ooh, smokers lounge for old Will.

144
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,940
Smokers lounge for old Will.

145
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
That's right.

146
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:43,820
Makes me feel like I'm in the airport, you know, 1950s, the good old days.

147
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,140
When weed was legal and you could smoke it at the airport.

148
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,940
And when men used canes, you know.

149
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,940
Yeah.

150
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
Yeah.

151
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,380
Yeah, Patrick, um, yeah, Patrick, go ahead. Before we go any further. Go ahead and do it, man.

152
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:02,140
Just put me in my grave. Put me in the dust. I actually, I don't, I don't have a rap, actually. I've written a poem

153
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,780
in response to you.

154
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,740
So wait, yeah, so last, last premium episode. He's gonna bomb. He's gonna eat shit. Last premium episode,

155
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,260
Caleb did a battle rap against Patrick and it's really pretty vicious.

156
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,420
I just want to get that back in case people didn't remember. It actually, it actually did hurt.

157
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:24,140
It did hurt my feelings and I want to express to you exactly how much it hurt my feelings.

158
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,580
I'm probably not even going to listen.

159
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,340
Well you should, you should definitely listen.

160
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:31,380
He wrote you a poem dude.

161
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,380
Let me read my poem.

162
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,380
So what are you in love with me?

163
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,380
What are you my girlfriend?

164
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
Let me read my poem.

165
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,380
Go ahead.

166
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,380
Okay.

167
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,140
Caleb, when I heard your diss rap it hurt me so deeply.

168
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,620
I've always looked up to you like you were Ned Schneebly.

169
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,740
I've been a loyal friend to you this much I know.

170
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:52,380
That's why it hurts me so much you would diss me on our show.

171
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,540
I would never insult you the way you did to me.

172
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,540
For instance, six months ago when you were fat, I would have never said that you look

173
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:04,380
so fat and racist if you were in prison you would be the leader of a gang called the White

174
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:07,060
Castle.

175
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,900
I would have never told you that you are so fat and racist looking that when you go to

176
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,180
your Ku Klux Klan meeting people think they're at the movie theater because of how big your

177
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,620
white sheet is.

178
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:23,780
Or that you are so fat they declared an Amber Alert on your penis because you're fat and

179
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,340
you cannot find your penis and it is child sized.

180
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,060
I would never have said any of this because I am loyal.

181
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,620
And even now that you're bald and thinner I would never say that you love to replace

182
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,660
the brownie with a piece of poop in your kids cuisine dinner.

183
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:44,780
Or that with your bald head and orangutan features you look like Dunstan checked into the hair

184
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,500
club for men.

185
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,740
Or that you are such a weird little pervert you would ride on the bang short bus and you

186
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:59,400
look like the only baby Jared Fogle would not touch.

187
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,620
I would never say "Caleb you went viral recently for an Obama video, it's too bad that Obama

188
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:08,540
video was not taken from a Raytheon coyote."

189
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,740
I would have never said this to you because I am loyal.

190
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
That's it?

191
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,740
That's my poem.

192
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,620
That was really beautiful.

193
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:18,780
I don't think you can...

194
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,780
I think it sucked.

195
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,100
It did not suck.

196
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,100
I think it was...

197
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,100
It expressed my feelings.

198
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
No, it was not good.

199
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,100
It was nothing.

200
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,100
It was less than nothing.

201
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,100
I took a course.

202
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,100
I took a WLP course in sucking at poems.

203
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,100
He paid $3,000.

204
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,100
It kind of seemed like just a way for you to rose Caleb.

205
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Like a Trojan horse full of...

206
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,100
No.

207
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:40,100
at poems. He paid $3,000. It kind of seemed like just a way for you to roast Caleb. Like a Trojan horse full of kind of roasts that you hadn't used.

208
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:47,100
No, it sucked man. It wasn't even that. These were things I would never say to my friend. You can't, also there's no, you can't diss me for...

209
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:57,100
I wasn't dissing you. I was saying I would never say it. You can't make fun of me for having been fat. That's like me making fun of you for like, you shit your pants when you were a baby.

210
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,020
when you were a baby.

211
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,180
I can't, I'm not gonna come at you for that.

212
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,180
- Were you fat too?

213
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,020
- I wasn't, I wasn't making--

214
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,660
- Yeah, he was fat. - I was kinda fat.

215
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,780
- No, he was pretty fat.

216
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,980
- I also was kinda fat in like eighth grade.

217
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,820
I was like the fat farty.

218
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,020
- This was, this was like a year ago maybe.

219
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,860
- Less than a year ago.

220
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,700
- You can make fun of someone for that.

221
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,580
You can make fun of someone for that.

222
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,340
- Not, no, 'cause it's an achievement.

223
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,100
- It was less than a year ago.

224
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,060
- Yeah, two weeks ago.

225
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,980
It's humongously fat.

226
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,100
- Yeah, I'm fat right now, actually.

227
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,940
- Yeah, it's called Caleb.

228
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,460
I'm being fat right now.

229
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:27,960
Fuck.

230
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,140
Yeah, I actually just got fat.

231
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,900
You know how like Watsky frees--

232
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,460
wait, are you about to come back at him?

233
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,820
No, I already came at him.

234
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,740
This was his comeback.

235
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,860
That's how weak it was.

236
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,660
You know how Watsky like freestyled for like 33 hours

237
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,220
or something?

238
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,720
No.

239
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,220
No.

240
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,100
I don't know anything about Watsky.

241
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,180
Yeah, so really important Emerson grad Watsky,

242
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,980
the fastest rapper alive.

243
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,060
Freestyled for 33 hours or some shit for like COVID relief.

244
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:53,860
That'll stop it.

245
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,580
I really wanted to just immediately challenge and just do acid and energy drinks and stay

246
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,500
up for like three days just spouting gibberish just to be like you lost Watsky.

247
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:08,420
You were for 33 hours and I went for like 42 and I just lost my mind on camera.

248
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,420
Yeah.

249
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,420
I think I could do it.

250
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,420
Yeah.

251
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,420
You probably could.

252
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,540
Dude, fucking, that'd be so much better than.

253
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:19,220
And donate all the money to COVID, not to relief, but to the disease.

254
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,220
To COVID.

255
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,220
Make it worse.

256
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,220
That's right.

257
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,220
Yeah.

258
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,220
He was fucking reading from a dictionary by the end of it. I was like, you can't...

259
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,220
What the fuck? You just...

260
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,220
You can't disrespect freestyle like that, bro.

261
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,220
What the fuck?

262
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,220
Damn, you got Daniel Webster's dictionary on your side, man?

263
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,220
Shit's wag, bro.

264
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,220
Yeah, that's a cheat show. That's a game shark for rappers.

265
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,220
Yeah, you're used to the game shark.

266
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,220
That's fucked up, man.

267
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,220
You're not even rapping at that point.

268
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,220
Yeah, I don't want to get into it.

269
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,220
He's reading.

270
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,540
Yeah, I read all the all of the lyrics from the Lord of the Rings movies just over and over again for 50 hours

271
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,540
I'm with the greatest rappers ever

272
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,620
Heard the dictionary front to back and then I just bent all the words to make them rhyme from memory

273
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:11,860
That would be a better that would be a recite the dictionary from memory then why are you a rapper?

274
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,360
Cabinet can't allow crab

275
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:22,560
He's doing it now boots berries. It's like I'm pretty sure there's a lot of words between

276
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:27,140
No, and also all of a the dictionary's just

277
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,460
He was using the B dictionary

278
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:40,780
Volume B you keep saying boots best of the dictionary

279
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,880
75 hour long dictionary against humanity. That's the dictionary

280
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:55,500
You should we should have will on to respond

281
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:06,480
Absolutely, you can't get through it it's right near it's a brick wall

282
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,480
Patrick I'll have something again for you next week. No, no

283
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,320
No, you know come back. No, I'm actually you know, what is supposed to qua is supposed to quack the beef. Listen guys next week

284
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:29,020
Next week next week on the premium. I'm gonna write us. All right, I'm gonna write a speech to make you guys friends again

285
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:29,920
Yeah

286
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,260
We're gonna get Jon Favreau and all the all the pots of America guys together and have them write a healing speech for no

287
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:38,260
I'm writing a fucking speech. No you

288
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,940
I already wrote it.

289
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,900
You don't even know how to write it.

290
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,100
I have it right here.

291
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
Then just say it now.

292
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
I'm gonna say it now.

293
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,500
Fine.

294
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
This is here.

295
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Why would you save it?

296
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Because it's...

297
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,220
Because otherwise I'm gonna have to come back next week.

298
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,900
Alright here, this will squash the beef between you guys, okay?

299
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
This is a speech.

300
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,180
It's called "Why Can't We All Just Be Friends Again?"

301
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,060
Okay.

302
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:04,380
I hate when my co-hosts fight.

303
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,980
It's like watching two preschoolers do hate crimes on each other.

304
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,340
Why can't you just go back to showing each other your peepees under the play structure?

305
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:17,580
Caleb, just because Patrick's cats remind you of the Asian cats from the Aristocats,

306
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,500
doesn't give you the right to break into Pat's house and go "Wahlberg mode."

307
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,040
And Patrick, just because Caleb looks like Commander Snoke on hormones, doesn't give

308
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,980
you the right to try and blow him up in your XL-wing Starfighter.

309
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,340
Caleb, you are like if Jim Carrey's The Mask joined the Aryan Brotherhood, and Patrick,

310
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,100
You are also like a Jim Carrey movie, but I can't remember which one it was.

311
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,940
Man the Size of the Moon?

312
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,620
The Number 7-11?

313
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,940
Obese Ventura Pud Defective?

314
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,060
Anyway, the point is you guys should try to get along more.

315
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,580
Patrick, just try pretending Caleb's lumpy bald head is a potato.

316
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:57,980
I think you'll discover a newfound ancestral love for him.

317
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,380
You might even start to find it hard to live without him.

318
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,060
And Caleb, just pretend Patrick can write prescriptions for Suboxone.

319
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,140
I'm pretty sure you'll find yourself practically ripping off his ginkos to suck his dick.

320
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,860
Can't you guys see you're meant to be?

321
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,860
You just belong with each other, like PB and J.

322
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,020
Which is crazy because PB and J also stands for your dream jobs.

323
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:24,540
Caleb wants to commit PB, police brutality, and Patrick just wants to J, just eat a shit

324
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,940
ton of food.

325
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,540
You guys have so much in common.

326
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,580
Caleb attracts dozens of gay men online who want to fuck his ass, and Patrick attracts

327
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,860
everything in a hundred mile radius due to his gravitational pull. Caleb has the

328
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,180
face of a chimpanzee and Patrick is the body of an orangutan. And guys, even

329
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,980
though one of you is Italian and one of you is Irish, you're both part of the

330
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,860
same race. The subhuman race. You guys are like two pedos in a podcast. Caleb,

331
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,740
remember when you accidentally locked yourself in a hot car while trying to

332
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,980
record an ironic rant about AOC's feet and Patrick rescued you by unlocking the

333
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:01,060
door with his bizarre car key shaped penis.

334
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,980
And Patrick, remember when you had toxic blue diarrhea

335
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,600
from drinking an experimental new monster energy flavor

336
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,460
you invented by mixing cleaning solvents with cat litter

337
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,740
and Caleb acted as your personal toilet for the day

338
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,660
so you didn't have to get up to go to the bathroom

339
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,820
and pause your game of skate two?

340
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,660
- I remember.

341
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,420
- And come on guys, don't you remember when you starred

342
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,900
in that movie together, the crossover between

343
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,640
Super Size Me and Song of the South

344
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,700
called Girth of a Nation?

345
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:27,660
I miss those days, the good old days.

346
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,220
So let's squash the beef right here right now.

347
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
What do you say, fellas?

348
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,360
Why can't we all just be friends again?

349
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,180
- Now that was a-- - Well?

350
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,380
- All right.

351
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,540
- Is it squashed?

352
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,980
No more rap battles?

353
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,380
- You know, I'm, yeah, I'm over my beef with Patrick.

354
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,380
I actually am.

355
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,580
But I'm starting a new beef with you, Cameron.

356
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,300
- No. - 'Cause that was hog shit

357
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:53,980
in a hole, buddy. - No.

358
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,260
- I'm gonna come at you next week even fucking harder.

359
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
I'm gonna decimate, destroy, and decompress you.

360
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,260
That was friendly, that was nice.

361
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,260
That was not friendly, he was being an arbiter.

362
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
I was being, I was, I was, yeah.

363
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,260
Will, that was friendly, right?

364
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,260
His, his, Patrick's the carbiter.

365
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Sorry.

366
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
You read it in a friendly voice, but it definitely was not nice.

367
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,260
It was, I read it in a friendly voice, so it was friendly.

368
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,260
At least I had the fucking guts to call it a rap battle freestyle battle.

369
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,260
What?

370
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,260
Rap battle freestyle battle.

371
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,260
That's right, a king of the dot freestyle that I threw at Patrick.

372
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:30,100
that I threw at Patrick you know? It wasn't a freestyle. Fuck you. It was a freestyle.

373
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:36,060
No you wrote it. I was using the poetry I learned. Yeah Patrick took a $3,000 online

374
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,540
poetry course to write that. Yeah poetry is kind of like rap and Shakespeare is

375
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:48,580
kind of like the first MC. Alright Chance the Rapper. Yeah he is Chance the Rapper.

376
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,980
yeah I'm gonna say Patrick's Chance the Rapper who's probably like a Jay-Z type

377
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:00,540
Caleb is gonna go probably like an Earl sweatshirt logic yeah that case

378
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:06,540
definitely logic oh no Caleb is Hobson dude yeah yeah I have an orange beanie

the Creator he stole my my swag. Goblin sucks so hard I got blowjobs from it

381
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:22,540
One of the all time lyrics.

382
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,660
One of his best lyrics on rapgenius.org.

383
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:31,020
Oh I thought you were saying one of them and then you did the fart noise.

384
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,180
I was like oh it's probably his lyric.

385
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,180
That's my lyric bro.

386
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,780
Hobson's song I fucked a fart.

387
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,780
I fucked a fart.

388
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:46,540
I actually have not listened to enough Hobson to even make fun of him I'm gonna be honest.

389
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,620
He does a, he did a series, it's called like the mind of,

390
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,460
the Illmindahopson.

391
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,580
The Illmindahopson, that's Illmindahopson2.

392
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,580
Where it's just like him, it's just him taking on

393
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,780
the entire rap game.

394
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,500
The Illmindahopson2's video is him with the white contacts

395
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,340
in his bedroom and there's just a huge

396
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,380
Stewie Griffin poster in the back.

397
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,620
(laughing)

398
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,460
No.

399
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,940
Fucking rock, dude.

400
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,460
Yeah, I'm like, him and like Tech N9ne,

401
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,300
like all those like Hot Topic rappers,

402
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,660
like they just don't exist anymore.

403
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,380
Dude, Machine Gun Kelly.

404
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,700
- Machine Gun Kelly acts now though.

405
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,520
- Yeah, that's weird.

406
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,420
- And he still bills himself as Machine Gun Kelly.

407
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,260
- What does he act?

408
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,100
What does he act as?

409
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:25,940
- Do you have a machine gun?

410
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,260
Have you ever used a machine gun?

411
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,980
He's like, "No, I am a machine gun.

412
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,500
"I'm Machine Gun Kelly."

413
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,500
- I'm a human gun.

414
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,740
- Human gun, Kelly.

415
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,060
- I shoot human loads.

416
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,260
Dude, he's gonna be on SNL.

417
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,100
He's just gonna replace Pete Davidson on SNL.

418
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,940
- Yeah, nobody would notice.

419
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,860
- Aren't they best friends?

420
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,060
- Yeah, they are best friends.

421
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,020
- Yeah, they made a movie about it.

422
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,180
- They got matching tattoos and faces.

423
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,020
- Oh yeah.

424
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,020
it.

425
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,980
Yeah, that's right.

426
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,460
When Will does the self fart noise to his own line, that's next level.

427
00:19:55,460 --> 00:20:00,500
Like you can tell it's not for you guys, it's just for this room.

428
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,180
There's a guy watching you and you're just signaling to him like, "Yeah, that wasn't very

429
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,180
funny."

430
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,580
He's like, "You are roasting them, bro.

431
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,900
You are burning them, bro."

432
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,900
He gets off to it, he's like, "Waka, waka, waka."

433
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,900
You know what I mean?

434
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
Yeah, he does waka, waka, waka.

435
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,900
He's like Fuzzy.

436
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,500
He's like Fuzzy Bear.

437
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,540
He's like, "Ooooh."

438
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:21,660
Yesterday I edited an audio sketch for you guys actually.

439
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,660
Me and Pierce started working on some of that shit.

440
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
I don't know if that's still easy.

441
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,660
Oh yeah, we're not allowed to talk about that yet though.

442
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,660
Alright, that's my bad.

443
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,660
It's alright.

444
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:34,140
Well, yesterday I edited an audio sketch privately for just whatever I wanted.

445
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:37,020
Me and my friend were making an audio sketch just for fun.

446
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,700
Yeah, we just decided to randomly make an audio sketch.

447
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,700
I had to edit a sound of me as a doctor masturbating Pierce, like scientifically.

448
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:54,820
And it's just like a very well edited scene of me like, "Yeah, yeah, into the pan, into

449
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,820
the pan, into the pan."

450
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
And Pierce is like, "Uh huh."

451
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,740
What did you do for the jack off noise?

452
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
Did you go like...

453
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,740
I did...

454
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,220
No, no, that's a good jack off noise.

455
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,140
I did two layers, so I looked up beat...

456
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,100
I looked up meat beating on YouTube, and it's like a...

457
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,220
It's a wet sound.

458
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,560
It's got the slap of beef on the chopping board.

459
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Wait, I like the idea that you couldn't just find audio of somebody jacking off on the internet

460
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
for some reason.

461
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,560
I couldn't look that up, yeah.

462
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,320
Like, that never crossed my mind.

463
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,560
But beat meeting, and I sped it up a little bit because it was pretty slow, and then I

464
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,960
looked up just fapping sound effect on YouTube.

465
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,440
So it's two layers, doesn't really make any sense.

466
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,000
Also in the video I'm supposed to be sucking his dick, so it's just kind of, yeah.

467
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Wait, so it's a sucky dicky sound with a with a sort of fappy jacking off.

468
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
A cartoon fappy jacky.

469
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

470
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Exactly.

471
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Oh, you got an old jacking off noise from a cartoon.

472
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Fappy jacky.

473
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
He got, he pulled it from the Sid Caesar show.

474
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
That's how old it is.

475
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
When Ren jerks off Stimpy's enormous penis.

476
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah.

477
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Um.

478
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Doesn't he fucking like eat his butt in one of those?

479
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Or his nose or something?

480
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Does he eat it?

481
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Yeah.

482
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,500
Wait, doesn't he snuck off his nose and put his pussy on him?

483
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,500
I think there's an episode...

484
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:15,500
He snuck a fart out of his ass and put his dick on his fucking dick, nose, fucking eye, pussy.

485
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Yeah, I think he comes in his own eye.

486
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
That's every episode of Ren & Snimby.

487
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,000
Yeah, and now you have Steven Universe and all these cartoons about depression and being gay.

488
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:32,000
You know the, like, Louis C.K. factor where you, like, you see what Louis C.K. was, you know, me-too'd for and what he did wrong,

489
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,140
And then you look at his comedy and you're like oh, yeah like he talked about it every day

490
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:42,020
It's so obvious that he wanted to actually do that to people now when you look at Ren and Stimpy. Yeah

491
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,740
You're like what the fuck are you talking about? Did you want to jizz in that guy's nose?

492
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,900
You are that's a creator of Ren and Stimpy like a pedophile. Yeah

493
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:56,300
Years later Ren and Stimpy actually did get in trouble

494
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,980
It was right in front of our eyes the whole time. Yeah, it turned out they weren't acting out any of those scenes

495
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,980
They were actually doing them. Yeah

496
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,540
They actually bought a log from a TV commercial

497
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:13,260
So yeah, Ren and Stimpy

498
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:19,780
Done, bro. You can't like it bro. Yeah, no no more no more Ren and Stimpy

499
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:26,340
City Hall, but he

500
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:29,700
Like will just protesting Ren and Stimpy right now

501
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,060
Stimpy no more the devil's program the red cat no more

502
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,900
The red cat

503
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:44,620
It's like I'm gonna tweet that later, that's good

504
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:50,020
They are brothers and they are having sex

505
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:59,260
That is not good. The red cat with its cursed body. Oh, no the Bible says the red cat

506
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,660
sucks the dick of the dog

507
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:07,060
I hate Rocco's modern life

508
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,540

Yeah, so that's just a little

534
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,460
No, I just wasted $150 just then by squirting one of them.

535
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,540
Yeah, because you didn't finish it.

536
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,420
You don't get the money until you finish it.

537
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,860
So you finish the 33 hours.

538
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,740
Well, technically, if you start it today,

539
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:39,220
you can pick it up later.

540
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,060
So, that's true.

541
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
Yeah, it doesn't have to be in a row.

542
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,900
And you're allowed to--

543
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,720
That's true.

544
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,560
It does have to be in a row.

545
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,500
No, it doesn't have to be in a row.

546
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,340
I don't think he said that.

547
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,140
Why would it not have to be in a row?

548
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,980
Why would it have to be in a row?

549
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,800
It just doesn't have to be in a row.

550
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,140
You can go one word at a time.

551
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,900
Yeah, what, so you're gonna say all the words

552
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,200
at the same time?

553
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,520
He was doing one word a minute for a little bit there.

554
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,560
I was watching the whole time.

555
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,600
Like I fucking cheated, bro.

556
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,460
He could just go super slow

557
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,560
and kind of like do like a deep voice too.

558
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,400
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,240
You know?

560
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,060
Me?

561
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,900
No, you could.

562
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,220
Yeah, you could really stretch it out.

563
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:09,440
You could just do "Till I Collapse" by Eminem,

564
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,800
but just stretch it out over 34 hours.

565
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,200
Dude, Watsky came into the cafe I worked at, bro.

566
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,180
Looked bad, dude.

567
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,200
Looked like a Slytherin, bro.

568
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,040
Long hair.

569
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,520
(laughing)

570
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,480
Long hair.

571
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,320
Long hair?

572
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,580
What does he look like now?

573
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,180
I remember him looking like a little boy.

574
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:28,540
- You guys know he went to Emerson, right?

575
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,580
- Yeah.

576
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,940
- Well, I mean, it makes sense.

577
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,060
- I knew that, yeah.

578
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,860
He did a performance or something, I think.

579
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,940
- For COVID in like 2015.

580
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,260
He's like, "There will be a play.

581
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,380
There will be a play, Ren and Stimpy.

582
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,580
This college has watched too much Ren and Stimpy."

583
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,940
- Ren and Stimpy.

584
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,380
- Have you guys heard of the other Tom Hanks?

585
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,220
Tom Hanks, other--

586
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,180
- What? - Or sorry.

587
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,900
No, yeah, Chet Hanks.

588
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:54,740
Yeah, dude.

589
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,560
Not Colin Hanks.

590
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,400
No.

591
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,900
He's like an insanely racist DJ,

592
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,020
just lost cause random.

593
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,860
Yeah, he does the Patrick.

594
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,680
I love Chet Hanks.

595
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,520
Patrick, I would say,

596
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,860
is like a foremost expert on Chet Hanks.

597
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,180
I love, yeah, Chet Hanks.

598
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,380
Have you seen, the other day,

599
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,100
he posted a picture of him in his car

600
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,540
and it says just like,

601
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,100
you, dude, trust me,

602
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,300
right now you need to go listen to Kokomo

603
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,260
by the Beach Boys.

604
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,660
(laughing)

605
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,900
Dude, there's one video,

606
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,780
I forget what he says,

607
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:25,660
He's on the red carpet talking to someone and he's just like, "Yeah mon, welcome!

608
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,660
We f*cking out round!"

609
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:27,660
"Chetana!"

610
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,660
Yeah.

611
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
I love the one where he's drinking the smoothie.

612
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
"Hey, it's your boy Chetana!"

613
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
Oh yeah.

614
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,660
And he goes like, "Buyaka, buyaka!"

615
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:33,660
"Internet went crazy!

616
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,660
Buyaka, buyaka, buyaka!"

617
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:42,580
"I wish so bad that accent was not, like, just offensive.

618
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,820
Like I love doing that with my man."

619
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:46,680
I wish that he, yeah, I wish it was real for Chet.

620
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
I wish he was not.

621
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,680
Oh yeah, I wish his hair was mixed in.

622
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:54,460
Call him out. He's like this just how I don't I had him on the set of castaway. So actually

623
00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:03,280
He just talked to the coconut and then got that. Yeah got that accent. It's natural. It's it's not offensive

624
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,700
He just doesn't know who he is. We had him born on the island so he could do that voice

625
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,200
I got born on island like cast away. Okay

626
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,680
Drive in the Mazda. Oh

627
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,620
Dude the O is really a lifesaver in those moments. Oh, just at the end of every line. Run out of it. Oh

628
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,900
Everyone's like

629
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
He's surprised at his own skill

630
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,540
He's so good at being a mean Jamaican guy

631
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,500
I'm drinking espresso out the Fanta cup man.

632
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,460
I got the bean

633
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,700
That's what Jamaica is like you drink everything out of a Fanta cup. When I went to Jamaica I was like fucking seven years old

634
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,540
I just had beautiful long Aryan hair. I don't support the Aryan nation. Just want to make that clear

635
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:54,300
But that is like I feel like it's an acceptable use of the word Aryan, you know when describing blonde hair of like a child

636
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,300
You'd when you describe a child

637
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:04,380
Innocent beautiful cuz like Hitler could never be like young, you know what I mean?

638
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,340
There's no young people that support Hitler like there's too much. Yeah, there's no young people

639
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,980
Youth or anything

640
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,240
That's not a concept that happened in Germany. So yeah, I was in Jamaica just beautiful hair and

641
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:24,280
Everyone's just screaming at me to braid it like chasing me down grabbing my hair like

642
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:29,100
$15 to braid your hair. My dad was just like please get away from my my darling touch my boy

643
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:35,320
Yeah, I got caught in it when I went to the Bahamas you had you like it. I came back with a couple braids

644
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:40,260
Picture of that I was like 11 or 12 and

Hey Caleb your hair fucking sucks ass you're an idiot. Yeah, I went to an all-jamaican youth group

648
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:04,580

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,800
that was like grown-ass actors who looked like kind of vaguely,

677
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,080
It looks like it was shot in LA and it's like people who are really desperate for money are doing this

678
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,680
Mm-hmm

679
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:04,880
and they dress up as like Elsa and spider-man and the Hulk with like Target just like

680
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,020
Brand shit like really bad costumes and shit and they act out little

681
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:11,160
sketches

682
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,800
For kids that are like 13 minutes long. It's like the classic weird creepy YouTube shit

683
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,720
Yeah in every episode or not every episode. There's a recurring theme of a doctor blue spider-man

684
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,000
He has a blue spider-man suit doctor's outfit and a huge hyperdermic needle doctor blue spider-man

685
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,440
And he always injects Elsa's ass

686
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,160
in like

687
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,160
It's always like a doctor

688
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,120
Yeah, I don't know I forgot about that

689
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:44,180
Here's was on to that shit like so long ago. Just naturally and then this whole exposition came out about like

690
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:51,080
You know companies using algorithms to make shit for kids and the algorithm fucks everything up and makes it horrifying and fucks up their brain

691
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,580
But that shit is different because it's like humans.

692
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,580
Yeah, yeah.

693
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,580
It seems like they're being forced at gunpoint to do it, literally.

694
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
Yeah, there's so many crazy videos like that.

695
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,580
It's disturbing.

696
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
It's just like...

697
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
There was a...

698
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:08,580
I can't find it, but I've just been... I'm realizing my Google searches are just so...

699
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:14,580
It's like literally I'm looking up "White Power Children's Show", "Nazi Children's Show".

700
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,580
God damn, dude.

701
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,580
Just a knock at the door.

702
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,580
Yeah.

703
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
Why? What are you doing?

704
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,080
Yeah.

705
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,080
Hey sir, have you been keeping up with the Nazi children's show?

706
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:29,580
Because the regular Nazi shows are too complicated for you.

707
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
We would love you to work at Google.

708
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,580
Badgers like, know, they're like, okay.

709
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Just don't walk away, don't make another case.

710
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,580
Yeah, never try again.

711
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,580
They just found his address just to ask one question.

712
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,580
They just knock on every door, every day.

713
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
It doesn't matter if you've actually been searching it or not.

714
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,580
or not.

715
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,500
Unless you put lamb's blood on your front door.

716
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,420
They're genuinely just asking, they don't know whether you have or not.

717
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,580
They're just like, "Hey, have you been looking this up?"

718
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Because if so...

719
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,820
Weird timing, but we're the FBI and we were just wondering if you wanted to hang out.

720
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:05,260
We've just been knocking on every door in your neighborhood.

721
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,260
We're bored.

722
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,940
Yeah, we're bored so much.

723
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,300
We like basically solved every problem in the world and we're just kind of knocking on

724
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,940
everybody's door to see what kind of TV they like.

725
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:15,940
Do you want to go play soccer?

726
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:16,940
Yeah, we're the FBI.

727
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:21,620
the FBI. You wanna do like a crossword puzzle or something? I don't know. Wait, what were

728
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:27,060
we talking about right before FBI? Oh, Hitler, like Aryan people? Aryan white supremacists

729
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:31,580
who are just super pushovers. They're like, you should be a white supremacist. Nah, I don't

730
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:38,580
really think so. Like, fair. That's true, it's kinda hard. And I get that, honestly.

731
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:45,580
Pat, what are you doing? You're spacing out. Pat is getting hypnotized by the KKK hypnosis

732
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
I'm getting radicalized.

733
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,580
He's getting hypnotized by a monkey in his room.

734
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
You haven't blinked in like a minute.

735
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,580
I've been watching the-

736
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
I was trying to find this thing.

737
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,580
Because it was fucking insane.

738
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,580
It's shot like it's all 4x3.

739
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,580
And it's all like

740
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
straight up shot like the same shit that I was making

741
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
in like high school.

742
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
You were making that kind of stuff dude?

743
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,580
It's actually the exact same thing that he was making in high school.

744
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,580
I think it's because I made it.

745
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
No, that was one of the

746
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:18,200
I just found it one morning and I like a fit was it on the official does the clue?

747
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,700
No, I don't know to change it was I mean it's been taken down now because people probably like they cook

748
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,180
Let's go and have a terrible website by the way really. Oh, that's probably where I found it

749
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:37,740
Yeah, it's very light. It's like web to camera or Caleb. Are you filming like from the little clitoris on your laptop keyboard?

750
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:42,900
Yeah, we have tight when you type your fingers are just so right. I'm filming from the little red button

751
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,900
The little red button.

752
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,900
Little red button.

753
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Let's see, I'm gonna look at their website.

754
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
I just remember, speaking of racist

755
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,900
kid shit, I fuckin'

756
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,900
I was talking to Cameron.

757
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,900
The movie Little Miss

758
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,900
Sunshine?

759
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,900
Racist kid show.

760
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
I just remembered earlier, my

761
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
fuckin' middle school, I was

762
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,900
talking to Cameron about this, we had a thing

763
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,900
called Immigration Day.

764
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,900
Dude. Where we

765
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,700
We got assigned an ethnicity.

766
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,300
Oh my god.

767
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,900
And they had the whole school set up like Ellis Island.

768
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
And you go in.

769
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,900
Oh my god.

770
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,900
You go in and then there's like...

771
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:28,900
Patrick's one of the officers just saying no to everybody.

772
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,900
Fuck out their names.

773
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
He's like spell your names, just fuck your name.

774
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:37,900
You had to like, you get assigned a name, you're supposed to make up a backstory for them.

775
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,820
them you're supposed to go through the whole Ellis Island thing.

776
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
We are the Hanksees!

777
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,820
We hail from Jamaica!

778
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,820
Castaway Island!

779
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:50,380
Dude I don't know why but that concept, sorry real quick, of like oh a bunch of people's

780
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:55,180
names got fucked up at Ellis Island is so funny.

781
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:56,900
My name got fucked up at Ellis Island dude.

782
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,260
I think about that once a day.

783
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
Anyway back to you.

784
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:05,340
Yeah but they fucking, so they had to, we had to work for like weeks.

785
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,760
Like it was a whole unit, like it was until the end of the year and then like towards

786
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,540
the end of the year we go through the Ellis Island thing and you're supposed to dress

787
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,320
up in little 1910s clothes and bring like food with you and it's like to teach us about

788
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:21,900
like how like some people didn't get in they fucking they assigned you diseases if you

789
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:27,720
didn't do well enough on a paper or something like that and you're supposed to like you

790
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,720
were supposed to you know that like-

791
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
They tested intelligence of all the races.

792
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,720
Yeah.

793
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,520
And they let you in if you did poorly.

794
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
Oh my god.

795
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,760
They like rolled the dice and then whatever number you got, you got that ethnicity.

796
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,880
So like they had like the Asian kids who were like, they were Italian.

797
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,680
Like it was just so weird.

798
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,040
Wait, the Asian kids were Italian?

799
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
They put all the Asian kids?

800
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
No, just like not like...

801
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,040
They kept like racial lines when they just switched them around.

802
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,560
Yeah, they were just like, no, the Asian kids are not allowed to be the Irish people.

803
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
That does not work out.

804
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,440
Everyone's like, why are they Italian?

805
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,680
What the fuck is that about?

806
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
No, they like funny because of Mario

807
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:13,600
Dude, oh you get you get assigned an ethnicity and then you have to go through and then you have to learn the history of like

808
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,540
The immigrants like at the time and it's like oh a lot of like Italian immigrants had whooping cough

809
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,000
So then some people would just get like whooping cough or if you didn't do well on a paper

810
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,620
You didn't do your homework. You had to go into a bag and pick out

811
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,720
the bag

812
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,720
You had to stay in the bag for the day.

813
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:35,000
Dude, when I was in fucking middle school, like fifth grade or whatever, I lived in a

814
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,600
very historic small town, so we had a project that was like, "Everyone is assigned a character

815
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:43,480
from this time period that actually lived in Annapolis, and we're gonna dress up as

816
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,600
them and walk around downtown and tell little stories about where you lived and shit."

817
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:54,080
So we were like, "Okay, my best friend Sammy Stag got cast as Kunta Kinte, who's just the

818
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,400
slave in Annapolis."

819
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,500
He's like, he's roots Alex Haley's roots.

820
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,200
Yeah, that happened in Annapolis, Maryland.

821
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,400
So Sammy stag my best friend is just cast as a slave does not

822
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,100
like we have to make a costume and shit.

823
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,900
Like my mom is really good at sewing.

824
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,500
So we worked up a fucking amazing costume for John Shaw

825
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,400
who like made the first flag or whatever.

826
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,700
I fucking killed that shit Sammy's like parents like just

827
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,500
gotten divorced.

828
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,900
His dad is like a 65 year old New Zealand sailor who looks

829
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,360
like the little baggins just had no concept of how to handle that project

830
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,700
like help your kid make a slave uniform Sammy came to school in a pillowcase

831
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:41,500
with the sleeves cut out straight painted black and my teacher was just like no

832
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,580
you're not allowed to wear that like here's a fucking shirt you're not gonna

833
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,860
to do this project. And we're just like, what the fuck is wrong with you? Why are you even

834
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:55,420
assigned? Like, what the fuck? No, I know. Both sides fucked up. I mean, I also in like

835
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,780
high school, I probably shouldn't tell this story, but there was a day, there was this

836
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:07,220
day called like diversity day, which was organized by like the diversity club. And it just was

837
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:13,460
kind of a like really poorly organized day. Like it, the programming was thought up of

838
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:19,620
by students like twice a week in 45 minute blocks for like two months.

839
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:23,120
So the shit that we were doing was just like really dumb.

840
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,820
But also like the kids doing it didn't also really understand like, like they would just

841
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,840
be like, raise your hand if you're poor.

842
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,940
And it's just the whole school, the whole school is there.

843
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,940
Yeah, just like stand up if you're poor, stand up if you're black.

844
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:41,580
And it's just kind of like, you know, I went to like a mostly white school too.

845
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:45,540
So it felt very just like performative and just like, okay.

846
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,440
So we did that every year and every year was just kind of a

847
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,280
nightmare.

848
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,660
Like student led discussions of 15 people where the person

849
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,140
next to you says the most racist shit you've ever heard.

850
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:59,480
But no one in the room is a like teacher qualified to like

851
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,660
shut that shit down.

852
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:03,900
So that kid just like has a platform and you're like, whoa.

853
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,900
So we like, we skipped one year and we went to this diner

854
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,780
and just fucked around.

855
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,500
And then we all came to school at the same time,

856
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:16,380
a bunch of dumbasses, like 10 of us, and the secretary or whatever was just like, "How

857
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,020
was breakfast boys?

858
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,020
You boys are racist."

859
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,020
Oh my God.

860
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,440
So it's huge disciplinary shit.

861
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,260
My whole friend group got brought in there.

862
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:30,180
Just like, "How disrespectful is it that you guys fucking did that shit?"

863
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,700
You guys are on the hook.

864
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:39,580
The first week of college when I went to, before I transferred to Emerson, when I was at UNCW,

865
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,920
We did like a, you know, like our uni class,

866
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,180
which is like a freshman orientation class basically.

867
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:48,060
They did a privilege walk, which is like a similar thing,

868
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,800
where they line up everybody in the class

869
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,560
and they say like, if your parents like own a home,

870
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,180
like take a step forward or whatever.

871
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,260
And it's like a pretty like poor college.

872
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:02,180
And so everybody was like, I was so far back

873
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,100
that I was like, they didn't plan for anybody

874
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,940
to step that far back.

875
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,420
And I was like, you know, Bush.

876
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,900
(laughing)

877
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:18,260
There was this one kid who like looked like a, um, looked like a, like a fop from like

878
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,260
the 1600s.

879
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:26,180
Like, he had like curly blonde hair and like dressed like a sailor and like, yeah, no,

880
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,860
except he was like 300 pounds.

881
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:32,660
Like he was like, he was like medieval rich where like the fattest guy is the king.

882
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:37,460
And like in my brain, he like, in my brain, he always had like a giant lollipop.

883
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,700
He was similarly in the opposite bush of me

884
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,460
because he was so far ahead of everybody.

885
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,140
But I mean, the thing is, in a situation like that,

886
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,340
I'm winning so much more than him.

887
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,100
Like those are all just like, how far back are you?

888
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,820
Whoever's the farthest back is the king of the game.

889
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,300
- And the king of the game is whoever goes the least?

890
00:43:57,300 --> 00:43:58,980
Whoever is the farthest back by the end of it?

891
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,740
- So it was like, you step back if you are this,

892
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:04,340
step forward if you are privileged.

893
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,420
- And if you win, if you get the privilege?

894
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,940
Yes, you know the winner gets a hundred bucks

895
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:14,760
Dollars if the winner gets a hundred privilege

896
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,620
like you

897
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,300
You all started the same spot

898
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,820
And if you like if you have a house step forward if you whatever step forward and you just started way back

899
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:30,940
And then by the end of it you were like yeah, I'm the least privilege of all of you guys

900
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:37,220
So maybe think they would be like if your parents are divorced take a step back if you're white take a step forward

901
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,220
if your dad is...

902
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,220
And you didn't step forward.

903
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,220
Yeah, and I didn't step forward.

904
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,220
Yeah, I kinda cheated, to be honest.

905
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,220
My shit was like, if you're white, punch yourself in the dick.

906
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,220
If you're gray, like, tie your shoes.

907
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,220
And we were just like, this...

908
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,220
This is...

909
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:55,220
I rock.

910
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,220
I just remember, I went to like a mostly all-white

911
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,220
school too, in New Hampshire, and I just

912
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:01,220
remembered some fuckin'

913
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:03,220
So we were supposed to bring food, to like...

914
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:05,220
Whoa, he's shining the light at me.

915
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,140
Are you guys recording a video?

916
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:07,980
No.

917
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:08,800
No, okay.

918
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,940
(laughing)

919
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,620
Dude, put your pants back on, stop.

920
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,900
We were supposed to, oh, so we're supposed to bring

921
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,780
like a food for like, because like they had food

922
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,780
or whatever, and this kid like brought a box of dry spaghetti

923
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,340
for a market basket 'cause he got Italian.

924
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,860
So sick.

925
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:31,100
I brought like a thing of bread, like a soda bread,

926
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:34,740
'cause I got Irish, I'm fucking Irish already.

927
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,780
I didn't need to be Ira.

928
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:38,420
I didn't know who to go.

929
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:41,420
So I fucking, I watched the kid.

930
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,540
He got so hungry 'cause like we didn't have like lunch

931
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:46,500
that day, like you were supposed to bring food

932
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,340
and he thought you were only supposed to bring--

933
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,420
- There's no lunch in Ellis Island, dude.

934
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:53,260
- Yeah, so he thought you were only supposed to bring

935
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:55,340
the food like you were, like that was gonna be,

936
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,980
he didn't think that like we weren't gonna have lunch.

937
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,420
So he just ended up eating dry spaghetti.

938
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,660
(laughing)

939
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,660
No!

940
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,000
My brother did that shit all the time. I used to eat dry spaghetti and pretend I was a farmer

941
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,400
And it was like a piece of wheat. Oh, yeah, no no not dry spaghetti. I'm really into eating the wheat.

942
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:22,560
Dry, dry ramen. That's like a thing people do. I think I've told that story. I got sold a dry ramen packet.

943
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:30,820
When I smoked K2 by accident. Someone sold you the like seasoning bouillon shit?

944
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,820
It was just like, yeah.

945
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:36,660
He sold me, I, so he lived, like I smoked K2 with these kids by accident.

946
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:37,660
Yeah.

947
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,940
And then we went, I like, we went back to his house and then like on the walk there

948
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:45,580
I was like, man I'm so hungry, we should go to Nutfield, which is like this convenience

949
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,580
store that was like literally-

950
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,580
Can't say, can't say Nutfield.

951
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,580
Yeah, I bet you want to go to Nutfield.

952
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:49,580
No, no, no!

953
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:50,580
You want to go to Feel Nuts, dude.

954
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,580
You want to fucking feel some nuts?

955
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:52,580
You're back as a football field where a bunch of guys, sperms and penises, you know, you

956
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,580
know, you're like, "I'm going to go to Nutfield."

957
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,580
I'm like, "I'm going to go to Nutfield."

958
00:46:54,580 --> 00:47:11,580
a

959
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,160
And this kid was like no I got you come to come to my house. I'll get you some food

960
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:24,000
So I gave him I saved my lunch money that day I gave him two bucks, and he sold me

961
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,760
I'm standing outside of his house. It's Valentine's Day

962
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:40,580
It's not alright, it's the end of winter, but it's still cold, so I'm standing outside

963
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:42,920
I'm outside in the fucking cold for 30 minutes

964
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,640
waiting for this kid to come back and he hands me,

965
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,880
I gave him two bucks, he comes back with a ramen packet

966
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,160
and he's like, yo, put this seasoning in it

967
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,360
and shake it up and eat that shit, dude,

968
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,920
you gonna be on heaven.

969
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,480
You gonna be on heaven, bro.

970
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:00,280
Once you eat this dry ramen player,

971
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,920
you gonna be on heaven.

972
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,800
- When I was in high school, I had this friend named Pencils,

973
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,120
that was his nickname, Pencils.

974
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,160
- Yeah, I bet you did.

975
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:08,760
- Everybody called him Pencils,

976
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,840
teachers called him Pencils,

977
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,240
parents were like Mr. Pencils and shit and whenever there's like an open email

978
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:19,260
account or whatever people would write like "70 virgins must be sacrificed to

979
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,680
pencils pencils is the best" like he was just like a weird urban legend at our

980
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:27,160
school really fucking weird dude but he was big on like black market Silk Road

981
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,440
bullshit and looked up or found out how to like do robo-tripping where you like

982
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:37,440
yeah you pour a bunch of yeah you pour a bunch of that in like a big soda bottle

983
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,000
and then you fill it to the top with water and let it sit overnight and then the DXM

984
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,720
Sinks down to the bottom and collects at the bottom and then you like chop the top of the thing off

985
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,880
Pour the water off and you just have like that fucking much DXM and then you just gum it

986
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,880
So that's the first thing I ever did

987
00:48:53,880 --> 00:49:00,920
Was do that in a parking garage with pencils and Kyle Feldman just fucking

988
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:10,140
Yeah from a sun-kissed thing or whatever nothing happened, and then the next day pencils, and I just woke up in my house like

989
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,920
Absolutely tripping balls, but it's the first time that it ever happened to me

990
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,880
And it happened when I woke up which was so weird and I got lost man. Yeah

991
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,240
Whoa you got lost I?

992
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:28,640
Got lost no far for that one. Yeah, that was just that was real. That's do shit shit

993
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,400
You can't fart for real shit. That was some real pencils ass shit. Yeah, I get it.

994
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:41,600
There you go. I tweeted about this, but I smoked with these kids once that I didn't really hang out with and

995
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,080
We went to this, yeah

996
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,160
We went to this like tree house that this kid knew about on a house that was foreclosed

997
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:52,060
Like their family got kicked out, but they built this like super sick tree house

998
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,040
So we walked in the middle of the like it was pouring rain

999
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,140
We walked to this tree house, and I'm like it's like one of my first couple of times smoking weed

1000
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:05,120
So I'm just smoking way too much too high and this kid is like yo

1001
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,320
Did you know?

1002
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,400
What they were doing in that circle in that 70s show?

1003
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:17,340
Like you know like what they were doing like now like it's like Shaggy and Scooby were stoners, too

1004
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,240
And like people know like and then Shaggy and Scooby just liked food

1005
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,280
He pulled out his phone and started doing the 70 show thing.

1006
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,280
Wait, when I read that tweet, I thought you meant something else.

1007
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,800
Like, did he start filming you guys?

1008
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:37,720
So he recorded himself like this and then turned it to this kid Trevor.

1009
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,720
That's crazy.

1010
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,640
And then once it got to me, I looked at him and went, "What the fuck are you doing?"

1011
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:48,400
I want to find that video.

1012
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,200
I think I kind of bullied him into stopping it.

1013
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,400
Patrick was definitely the Fez of the group.

1014
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,400
Yeah, so I was Eric Foreman because I knew about Star Wars.

1015
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,400
Yeah, you were Eric Foreman's actor.

1016
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,400
It was me, a classic Eric Foreman type with two Fezes.

1017
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,900
That was the problem.

1018
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,400
I'm f*cking Ariana Grande or whatever her name is.

1019
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,900
[Laughter]

1020
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,900
That's right.

1021
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:14,900
Mia Wallace or whatever the f*ck her name is.

1022
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,900
Yeah, Mia Farrow.

1023
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,900
Yeah, what is it?

1024
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,900
She's so good at it.

1025
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:24,820
is Greta Thunberg she's on that 70 show yeah my favorite character in the 70 show is Greta Thunberg and

1026
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:33,860
Mother Gaia and the guy at Korn. I'm actually into Anubis. Favorite gods bro let's go

1027
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,540
Caleb you get top three cuz it's your birthday but everyone else just gets one

1028
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:46,540
I'm on this episode.

1029
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:54,540
I thought yeah, I was like Caleb been like, because we have the same birthday.

1030
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,540
Yes, we're both tourists is ready to do.

1031
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:01,540
You're both sex tourists were sex.

1032
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:04,540
- You're both Aryans.

1033
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,380
- We're not?

1034
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:07,060
No, he is, he already admitted this.

1035
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:08,740
I don't have hair, so you can't ever know.

1036
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:10,700
- I said my hair was, could be described by a Nazi.

1037
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:12,660
- It still is, it still is, dude.

1038
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:14,660
- My hair could be described as a Nazi as Aryans.

1039
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:16,300
- You have surfer hair, Gene.

1040
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:18,940
- Oh, bro, yeah, man.

1041
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:21,200
(laughing)

1042
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:25,060
- You mentioned a kid who did like Silk Road shit.

1043
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:27,940
I knew a kid in high school who similarly was just like,

1044
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:29,220
he just like sold acid and shit.

1045
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:32,020
And he bought like a bunch of sheets,

1046
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,720
he bought like a thousand dollars worth of like LSD sheets

1047
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,880
on the Silk Road.

1048
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,020
And then they arrived and his dad opened the box,

1049
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:42,060
looked at them and flushed them down the toilet.

1050
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,840
- Ooh, you knew what they were?

1051
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:46,140
- Yeah, and then, but I guess he didn't know

1052
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:48,920
how much money his son could make from it

1053
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,020
because when he told his dad how much money

1054
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,640
that he had just lost, his dad started crying.

1055
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,100
(laughing)

1056
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:58,580
- But that shit is so cheap.

1057
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,820
Like you buy a hundred tabs for $10.

1058
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,820
That's what I mean.

1059
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,460
Like it was so much acid and he would have been rich forever.

1060
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:10,380
Dude, that same guy Pencils started doing that in our hometown.

1061
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:16,860
He started dealing acid to like freshman girls, like 14 year olds and just a 14 year old.

1062
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,180
I'm like, "Pencils, you've been my best friend for a really long time, but what you're doing

1063
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:24,740
is morally very wrong."

1064
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:28,100
I could like sense Pencils' effect on my entire town.

1065
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,100
I could see it.

1066
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,580
Will thinks that girls can't handle acid.

1067
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:32,580
Yeah.

1068
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,580
Yeah, I do.

1069
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:34,580
He thinks that it turns them into boys.

1070
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,980
It's a highly masculine experience.

1071
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:39,580
It turns your brain into a boy's brain once you trip.

1072
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,580
That's what it's like being a boy.

1073
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,580
That's what Terrence McKenna would say.

1074
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,980
That's what being a boy is.

1075
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,100
When a girl looks in a mirror on acid, she turns into a boy.

1076
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,100
That's true.

1077
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:51,860
I think we all know the divine power that comes from just being a nine-year-old boy.

1078
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:53,260
You just can't get hurt.

1079
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,700
Yeah, that's true.

1080
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:57,500
You squirt and cum out of every orifice nonstop.

1081
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,940
You're literally just pure life energy, just boogers and cum and scabs and pus and...

1082
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:03,940
That's beautiful.

1083
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,940
You should write a poem.

1084
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,940
Thank you.

1085
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:06,940
Oh, yeah.

1086
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,940
You should write a poem.

1087
00:54:07,940 --> 00:54:08,940
About being... about nine-year-old boys.

1088
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:09,940
Yeah.

1089
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,940
About your favorite nine-year-old...

1090
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:11,940
Yeah, about nine-year-old boys squirting cum.

1091
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:12,940
About how precious their bodies are.

1092
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,940
Yeah.

1093
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:14,940
About how precious and life-giving nine-year-old boy bodies are.

1094
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:15,940
Yeah.

1095
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,940
And how they're full of cum.

1096
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,940
And it's how it's impossible to hurt them.

1097
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:20,940
Okay.

1098
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:21,940
Okay.

1099
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,620
You guys are misquoting me and you're having a little bit of fun with that.

1100
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:24,620
No, we're not.

1101
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:25,620
You said little boys are full of cum and they have beautiful bodies.

1102
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:26,620
I didn't say that.

1103
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:30,980
Say that you did delete this I don't know if you really know we're gonna post twice

1104
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:37,380
Two times in a row. I want you gone. No, you're gonna be gone once we put you in jail for this podcast

1105
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:39,380
Yeah, this whole thing was a sting

1106
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:45,340
Whole thing was a sting. Oh, okay. Why don't you direct labor in my butthole you I did

1107
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,820
Yeah, it was called it was called lady boy

1108
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:52,080
(laughing)

1109
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,500
(vocalizing)

1110
00:54:54,500 --> 00:55:00,380
- You went race car to Jamaica real fast.

1111
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,220
- Race car?

1112
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,480
(vocalizing)

1113
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,320
- Like that.

1114
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,140
- It peaked.

1115
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:05,980
- Sped up.

1116
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,820
- Couldn't hear you hit the tip.

1117
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:07,660
- Fuck.

1118
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,240
- Yeah, I couldn't hear you do the beat earlier either.

1119
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,540
- You couldn't hear me do the beat?

1120
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:12,380
- No.

1121
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,160
- 'Cause when you get too loud it cuts your audio.

1122
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:15,000
- Yeah.

1123
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,540
(beatboxing)

1124
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,740
- Yeah, let's close it out with another.

1125
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:21,340
Let's do a five minute freestyle to close it out from Will.

1126
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:22,940
Okay, let's do the cypher.

1127
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,820
(laughing)

1128
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:26,180
Back to the cypher.

1129
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,780
It's like a OK Go music video.

1130
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:29,820
I actually have to piss my pants so badly

1131
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:31,020
so we didn't this early

1132
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,660
'cause I've been holding a pee in for 30 minutes.

1133
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,500
You guys can let me--

1134
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:35,340
No, you just leave.

1135
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:37,580
You can just leave, we'll keep talking, you fucking idiot.

1136
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:38,540
I'm in the middle of the Matt Watson--

1137
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:39,380
Go do it.

1138
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:40,780
(groaning)

1139
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,700
Just go pee, I gotta get a paper anyway.

1140
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,580
Oh my God.

1141
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:46,420
Fuck.

1142
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:48,420
Will's leaving too?

1143
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,540
- Will's leaving, it's just me and Cameron, baby.

1144
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,380
- Nice.

1145
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,340
- Damn, it's like when you go to KFC

1146
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:55,860
and they got the original recipe

1147
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:57,580
and then they got the spicy recipe.

1148
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:58,420
- Don't know what you're talking about.

1149
00:55:58,420 --> 00:55:59,240
- That's us right now.

1150
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:00,500
We're the spicy recipe.

1151
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,460
- No, you're a spicy recipe, dude.

1152
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:06,060
- When it's you and Caleb, that's original recipe.

1153
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,860
When it's me and you, that's the spicy recipe.

1154
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:11,940
- No, when it's me and you, it's the cool guy in bed

1155
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,340
and ugly guy recipe.

1156
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,300
- All right, now Will's back,

1157
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,340
so now it's not the spicy recipe.

1158
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,760
- You talking about chili?

1159
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,540
(laughing)

1160
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:21,920
- I'm talking about KFC.

1161
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,720
Patrick was trying to tell me how KFC works.

1162
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:26,340
- They said that--

1163
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,400
- They said that.

1164
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,240
- They said that.

1165
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,060
- They said that.

1166
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:29,900
- They said that.

1167
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,740
- They said that.

1168
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:31,560
- They said that.

1169
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:32,400
- They said that.

1170
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,660
- They said that.

1171
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,100
- Yeah.

1172
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,340
- I gotta go to Stop and Shop after this.

1173
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,840
- No you don't dude, shut the fuck up.

1174
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,680
- What?

1175
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,520
- Man gotta go to Stop and Shop,

1176
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:45,120
sounds to me like man gotta go to Stop, Drop and Roll,

1177
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,480
'cause you're on fire.

1178
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:48,040
I'm on fire.

1179
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,880
- Bad fire.

1180
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,580
- Man go to stop and shop, man go to stop and shop,

1181
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,420
like shoppers.

1182
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:54,500
- I gotta find the fucking, they don't have the,

1183
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,380
I think people are panic buying them.

1184
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:57,640
I don't know what the fuck's going on,

1185
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,280
but the Gardein fishless fillets, the vegan fish.

1186
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,740
- I thought you were gonna say Nintendo Switches, but yeah.

1187
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,740
- No, people are fucking panic buying these things, I guess.

1188
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,140
I can't fucking find them anywhere,

1189
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,580
so I gotta go to a grocery store that's like--

1190
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:11,420
- It doesn't exist, dude, you imagined it.

1191
00:57:11,420 --> 00:57:13,020
- 30 minutes away.

1192
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,740
- Like Drew, you invented a type of food in your mind.

1193
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:19,740
I invented this in my head like the Neo-Nazi Kid Show I was trying to find.

1194
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:21,740
You invented this in your head like Fight Club.

1195
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,740
Yeah.

1196
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,740
Yeah.

1197
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:24,740
Tyler Durden!

1198
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:29,740
Tyler Durden on a track like, "Where is my mind?

1199
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,740
Whoa!

1200
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,740
Where is my mind?

1201
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,740
Whoa!"

1202
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:40,740
Dude, when you watch that movie, it's crazy.

1203
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:47,060
never seen a movie where buildings fell down and they played a pixie song at the same time.

1204
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,060
That is mind blowing.

1205
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:50,340
You get goosebumps all the time.

1206
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:55,820
I've never seen a sex scene in full 3D rotational camera vision.

1207
00:57:55,820 --> 00:57:56,820
Between

1208
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,340
Oh dude I forgot about that matrix sex scene.

1209
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:02,780
And there's like the weird echoing like "Huuuuuhhhhhh"

1210
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:08,500
I'm gonna be real bro, fucking Bellatrix Lestrange or whatever her name is, Rihanna, Tim Burton

1211
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:15,500
and

1212
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:30,500
in

1213
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,000
Caleb cuz he's in that little zone. Yeah, he's trying to whizzle

1214
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,380
We'll start a way into Bella Bella tricks list ring

1215
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:42,100
Jack Skellington's he's got a hell in a bottom Bella tricks

1216
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:47,660
Elaine Louise Dreyfus. Yeah, we'll try to turn her into hell and bottom farter

1217
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,740
Whoa?

1218
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,060
It's spreading

1219
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,020
That's the real virus

1220
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:00,660
I'm getting disgusting dog shit out of my teeth right now. Not cuz I ate it not cuz I

1221
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:04,460
Say you went to go pee and you came back with dog shit in your teeth

1222
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:09,080
Get there the dog shit. It was in the toilet and had to clean it out before I could pee on it

1223
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,220
I just drained the toilet water through your mouth

1224
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,500
Honestly checks out

1225
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:13,820
I'm crazy

1226
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:19,720
You have to drink all the toilet water through a straw and then and then spray it out through the gaps in your teeth and it

1227
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:24,220
Leaves on the dog shit. I didn't have to do also let your dog shit in your toilet. I was thinking about

1228
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,420
Last time I was in the ocean I really had to shit and I got I got probably

1229
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,980
92% of the way to just shitting in the ocean

1230
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:35,980
Have you ever seen you sucked it back my my I have not pooped in the ocean my cousin one time

1231
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,700
I was one time I was in the ocean with my younger brother and I was like damn after shit

1232
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,420
and he's like yeah me too and

1233
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:43,540
I was like yeah

1234
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:47,300
And I then he like started making like a shitting face and I was like that's funny

1235
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:51,500
He's pretending to shit in the ocean and then a piece of shit floated up right to my belly button

1236
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:56,500
and then I ran out of the ocean to the beach.

1237
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:59,620
- It's the first time I ran out of the ocean.

1238
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:03,660
I wanna shit in water, that sounds kinda nice.

1239
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,340
- It's kinda like a home birth.

1240
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,000
- He'll shit in a dry toilet.

1241
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,500
He never shits in the water.

1242
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:11,740
- And I scrape it out and like half it.

1243
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:13,420
When I was, I worked at a summer camp

1244
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,220
and one morning I had the day off

1245
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,140
after like three weeks of working straight

1246
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:20,020
and took my time, woke up late, took a nice shower,

1247
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,420
walked all the way up to the like dining hall or whatever, was

1248
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:28,020
getting some food, some breakfast style food and I turned

1249
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:31,520
around and this other co-counselor was talking to me and

1250
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,520
I farted really loudly like as a joke like, you know, I had to

1251
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,320
fart working at summer camp, that shit happens, you just do

1252
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,320
it right in the middle of someone's conversation, you know

1253
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:41,620
what I mean?

1254
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:42,720
It's like that type of shit.

1255
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,820
So I did it as a joke, but it wasn't loud enough for her to

1256
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:48,820
hear and I just completely shit my pants like the most I've ever

1257
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:53,100
shit my pants and I was like probably 21 my pants filled with

1258
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,020
shit I immediately just walk away from her do not leave the

1259
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,960
conversation she's still talking to me I'm just shuffling away I

1260
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,180
go to the little boys cabin and I take my underwear off they're

1261
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:08,820
not there of course and my the underwear I'm wearing is like

1262
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:12,900
blue digital camo underwear from Target like it looks like a

1263
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,180
little boy's underwear.

1264
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,420
it looks like a little boy so i just

1265
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:21,860
filled it's a diaper filled with shit and i just leave it in their trash can

1266
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:26,060
i'm the director of the summer camp and i do that

1267
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:31,020
i just sabotage a kid i just leave shit in their thing go back downstairs

1268
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,940
shower again new clothes walk all the way back up the hill

1269
01:01:34,940 --> 01:01:37,460
so like two and a half hours total

1270
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,220
crazy hand. One time i shit myself this is when me and cameron were working

1271
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:44,360
together cam you definitely don't remember this but you were there

1272
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:51,700
I shit myself on the way to work while riding a blue bike through Massachusetts, and I didn't

1273
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,640
realize the shit my pants got to work.

1274
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:57,280
I was like, "Ugh, I feel something in my pants."

1275
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:03,020
And then our boss was like, "It smells like complete shit in this office."

1276
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,840
And Cameron was like, "Yeah, it does smell kind of weird."

1277
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:10,800
And then I just so conspicuously ran to the bathroom, threw my pants away.

1278
01:02:10,800 --> 01:02:14,240
And my pants threw my pants away.

1279
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:17,520
I threw my underwear away and then nobody was ever the wiser.

1280
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:19,960
Including Cameron, unless Cameron admits right now that he knew.

1281
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:20,960
I didn't know.

1282
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:21,960
I don't think I noticed.

1283
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,960
I think everyone was the wiser.

1284
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,960
Everyone saw your underwear with your name written on it and sh*t.

1285
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:29,600
Yeah, he just left it hanging over the top of the bathroom stall.

1286
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:32,240
No, I left it on Cameron's face actually.

1287
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,240
And he only took it clean for me.

1288
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:34,240
Oh my god.

1289
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,240
Get owned.

1290
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,240
Get owned Cameron.

1291
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,880
I almost sh*t my pants when we did acid that one time.

1292
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,480
Do you remember that?

1293
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:43,920
I think I do remember that.

1294
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,040
We were taking that picture and I was like, "I gotta fart."

1295
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,800
And then I just did, and then I was like, "Oh no."

1296
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:50,800
He shit himself.

1297
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:54,000
I was like, "Everyone needs to leave the bathroom right now."

1298
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You know what was funny?

1299
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,680
It was fucking, there's a picture of me just in the shower and like, Neil's ex-girlfriend's

1300
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:05,840
there and like, I almost shit myself in front of like, God.

1301
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:06,840
You should have man.

1302
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:08,200
That must be like her image of me.

1303
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:10,200
Must be the worst day of her fucking life.

1304
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:11,200
Yeah, I know.

1305
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,200
God, yeah.

1306
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,200
I think about that girl.

1307
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:20,200
worst day of our life. We fucking the whole time to the island. Oh yeah. We were just doing

1308
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:25,200
we were it's the middle like it's winter in New Jersey. What fucking island are you talking about?

1309
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,200
We were staying we're staying. Patrick invented an island in his mind to deal with the trauma

1310
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:34,200
of almost shitting his pants. That's where the trauma lives. Yeah. You guys remember the island we went to

1311
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:40,200
and they had those monsters made of shit covered in pants. The shame monsters.

1312
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:45,560
Yeah, they're like big piles of shit with pants sticking out of them. You guys don't remember we battled them and I almost died

1313
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:47,960
We fought all of them

1314
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:55,160
Swim back in the eye and the back across the toilet lake back to the cabin. That's Scooby-Doo Monster Island

1315
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:02,920
I know you're thinking of toilet island Patrick Doran adventures. Don't shine a fucking laser pointer in my eyes. You're thinking a toilet adventure

1316
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,920
I'm thinking of Will Duncan's

1317
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,000
Will Duncan's dookie pants explosion 2.

1318
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,360
The island of misfit fucking Patrick.

1319
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,200
The island of misfit toilets.

1320
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,440
It was, the island was like this, uh, it was like this thing where you could see like the

1321
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,640
whole lake so we were like, oh let's go see like the entirety of the lake.

1322
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,560
I was wearing like Converse and we had to walk through like a sheet of snow.

1323
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,080
You were wearing a skirt dude, you were wearing a skirt and a baby's bonnet.

1324
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:27,720
I'm trying to find one for the patrons.

1325
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:28,720
Yeah Patrick will never wear a dress.

1326
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:31,720
Do you have a dress you could send Patrick, Duncan?

1327
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:32,720
Yeah.

1328
01:04:32,720 --> 01:04:33,720
Um, nah.

1329
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,720
I have a night dog.

1330
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:35,720
I have no idea why.

1331
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:39,200
Do you have a dress for a 220 pound man?

1332
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,200
Yeah, I do.

1333
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:41,840
People call me Duncan all the time.

1334
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:42,840
That makes sense.

1335
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,840
Really?

1336
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:44,840
You have one of those last names that you can say.

1337
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,840
To me, Duncan is not a first name.

1338
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:46,840
Probably because it's my last name.

1339
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:47,840
