1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
commitment

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,820
uh... that's that's a story

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,220
yeah patrick stems now

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,140
that's a good stem

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,160
let's discuss stemming

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,880
this was a lot of my head about mental health now

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,680
Yeah, which is because autism is a mental illness.

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,280
Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,180
Yeah, is what Patrick is trying to say.

10
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,080
Yes.

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,480
Yeah.

12
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,080
I stim like a... I do excited little hands.

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,380
Yeah, I rub myself.

14
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,380
I do.

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:49,480
Anytime that we do a show, I have to go outside for at least 10 minutes and I have to swing my arms like I'm a helicopter and do stretches.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,080
That's because of your...

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:55,400
the physical, like you need to warm up

18
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,120
because of all the tricks and acrobatics

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,000
you do during the show.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,160
I don't know if that counts as stimming.

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,440
That's more of like a warmup for your like somersaulting.

22
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,280
- That's true.

23
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,960
- Which is a huge part of the live shows,

24
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,640
which I guess, but the time just comes up.

25
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,120
- I do a lot of jumps.

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:13,040
I do a lot of arm swings.

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,960
I do a lot of, I did a jump last show we did.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,240
I did a pratfall.

29
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,600
- He did a jump, yeah.

30
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,600
I did a pratfall and then my stomach hurt for like two days.

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Yeah, because of what you ate during the pratfall.

32
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,600
All the Jenga pieces hit my chest right here and it's still, there's a bruise.

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,600
You fell on the ground and you said you wouldn't get up unless people saw you.

34
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,600
On the inside, there's a bruise.

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
On the inside.

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,600
You keep saying that but that's what a bruise is.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,600
Yeah.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,600
What?

39
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,600
You know when a bruise makes a big bump?

40
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
That's scary.

41
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Oh yeah, it's horrifying.

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I don't like that.

43
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,600
I got that on my arm, I thought I had a thing.

44
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
I gave my brother a concussion once.

45
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,600
Okay.

46
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,600
I was going to say, does he have a bump or bumps are sort of the same.

47
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
I gave him a bump but then you started talking.

48
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,600
I feel rude for interrupting.

49
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,600
Anyway, I dropped a knife in my girlfriend's foot and she has a permanent bump.

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
A permanent bump?

51
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,600
She has a scar and the scar is elevated off of her foot and it hasn't decreased in altitude

52
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
since I dropped the knife.

53
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,600
In altitude?

54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,600
Damn.

55
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Did you drop it like pointy side down?

56
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Yes, Cameron.

57
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,600
Into her foot?

58
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,600
Yes, I dropped it.

59
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I mean, he dropped it like it was hot.

60
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,320
It could have been long, sharp side down.

61
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:26,800
I was saying, like, did it just like, it was a direct point.

62
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
It was a horror movie.

63
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Yeah.

64
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
It was frightening.

65
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Yeah.

66
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
Yeah.

67
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,700
I threw a, the way, I gave my brother a bump and a concussion, because I threw a can of

68
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,040
Old Spice spray at his head when we were getting into a fight when I was younger.

69
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,240
I fucking just whipped it at him and it just like hit the side of his head and I heard a

70
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:53,240
you go yeah and I got in a lot of trouble because he got a concussion.

71
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,340
Yeah,

72
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,240
you weren't in trouble until the doctor said that word. Yeah, I think I was

73
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,940
probably fine. Yeah, yeah, that is yeah. You're almost like what sounded to

74
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,540
make that's probably yeah, you're all dressed up like you're in court and

75
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,540
you're sitting in the waiting room at the doctor's office. Yeah, oh my God,

76
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,660
just doing helicopter was told that he can't yeah that's a weird thing about me

77
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,340
like I just get really nervous and like I always have to like swing my arms

78
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:26,900
around before I go to jail like I get nervous about going to jail yeah just

79
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,700
say straight up yeah I'm not a fan but I always yeah I like have to pace back

80
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,780
and forth and talk to myself like hype myself up in the mirror and stuff before

81
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,180
I go to jail yeah yeah it's gonna be okay in jail you're not gonna be in there for

82
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:44,580
that long. I guess I was about to say an OCD thing which is turning the lights on

83
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,100
and off. I guess that's stimming if you like the feeling of the

84
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,460
light switch. I guess stimming is something you do. Yeah. It's

85
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:59,060
like picking your nose and flicking the boogers stimming. What about going to the bathroom?

86
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:04,020
It depends. Maybe if you roll the booger up into a little ball. But then you keep

87
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,420
rolling. That's when it becomes stimming. Yeah exactly. Yeah. You roll the

88
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,220
a booger up like this and then you're and then people when people ask you like oh,

89
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:14,860
what are you doing? You just say like oh, no, I'm just playing the world's

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,460
tiniest violin to your story.

91
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:22,020
I'm just rolling to my booger rolling the world's tiniest booger. Oh, you're

92
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,740
sorry. So

93
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,740
yeah,

94
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:32,260
I was doing a bit where I was doing the excited little hands autism girl, but

95
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,300
she has Havana syndrome and

96
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,620
It's just the same.

97
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,300
When this part of the song comes on, my Havana syndrome goes crazy.

98
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,300
Yeah.

99
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:45,300
Havana.

100
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,480
What is Havana syndrome?

101
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
It's when you get sick.

102
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,900
Deadass, I have that.

103
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,260
They said they were in Havana and they got hit with a stomach ache.

104
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,360
Yeah, it's like a ray that the Cuban government is hitting people with.

105
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,500
It's not real.

106
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,100
It's exactly the same thing that people who are so schizophrenic that they ride the bus

107
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:09,740
for 12 hours a day say they have yeah yeah a CIA guy in a socialist country

108
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:16,780
yeah going to experience some stomach yeah yeah it is fun yeah I love the

109
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:22,700
stomach a gun is probably the funniest like schizophrenic creation to me I also

110
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,580
do just love heart attack gun I love our tech guns great but I think stomach a

111
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,900
gun is like a perfect improvement on the heart attack gun that's like they're not

112
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,780
trying to kill you or even really hurt you. Yeah, they just want you to like be

113
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,820
uncomfortable, maybe poop weird. In reality, they're almost the same gun.

114
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,860
They're just one is a fatal shot and the other shot is in the gut and they're both a

115
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:50,940
gun that one gun makes you die and the other gun injures you. Imagine the idiot at the CIA

116
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,560
that mixes up the two guns one day. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh yeah. Or he loads the stomachache

117
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,560
bullets into the heart attack gun. I have heartache now. I'm really homesick.

118
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,920
Yeah, I found a guy on Twitter once who believed, who thought he was getting hit

119
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,520
but with the stomachache gun and it was just like a bunch of tweets that were

120
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,480
like, "They are giving me brutal diarrhea. They are causing me pain when I poop." And

121
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,920
just a bunch of stuff like that. Just a guy who doesn't know he's lactose

122
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:24,280
intolerant. It's exactly what it is, yeah. That's fire. Yeah. That's dead-ass fire.

123
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,600
fire. It's dead ass fire. What did you guys get up to yesterday? I don't even know. I

124
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,920
changed all the light bulbs in my apartment. Really? From what to what? For like most of

125
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,600
the time that we've lived there, it's all recessed lights in there and in the kitchen

126
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,400
there was only one tiny blue light that would work and I replaced all, you've been in my

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,040
place you know that like that row of like lights I think right above the stove oh

128
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:58,560
I replaced all those because they they just weren't working I don't know why I

129
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
was like all right today is the day yeah sometimes you just have to pick a day to

130
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,120
do stuff like that yeah but I've been living there for since March I don't

131
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,280
know how many months that is yeah you pretended you're about to count them by

132
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,040
just opening your hand. Yeah. I think it's zero to five. Was it five months? I don't

133
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,080
know. No. Well, you just opened your hand as if you were counting from zero to five.

134
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:31,400
That was five months. Whoa. Whoa. Damn. I basically did nothing yesterday. I figure you're a genius as long as you're not actually trying to do anything. Yeah.

135
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:38,440
Yeah, I basically sat on my couch so anyone think that's cool or like funny or watch TV

136
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:48,280
and one on the computer read a book okay okay food some snacks it's an ice cream

137
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,520
you did not eat ice cream I ate some lactose-free ice cream a were you here

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,160
no we all I do we all got each other surprise snacks oh and I got him a

139
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,040
Snickers ice cream bar cuz I was like I don't haven't had a Snickers ice cream

140
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:08,240
bar in a while but I'm not gonna eat it that'd be a nice thing to give to my

141
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,800
friend and then he looks at me and says no I can't eat that I will shoot diarrhea

142
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,260
everywhere. Well for context it was he it was like five minutes before we recorded

143
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,180
and in any other situation I would eat the ice cream bar and I would take the

144
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:38,180
diarrhea right I do not want to get diarrhea in the middle of recording. I wasn't giving you diarrhea I was giving you an ice cream bar. That would have given me diarrhea. You have two options. I can tell you for a fact. You can take this ice cream bar or you can take this diarrhea that I found.

145
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,180
What were the other surprise snacks? I'm so curious.

146
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,180
It was also jalapeno cheese curls.

147
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:46,180
He also said no, he can't eat those.

148
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,180
I didn't say I can't. Again, the really important part of this is that it was right before we recorded.

149
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,180
He turned down every single surprise snack.

150
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,180
That's not true. There are other ones I would have accepted, but they went to other people.

151
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,180
And you know what? I didn't complain. I said it's fine.

152
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,180
I'm sorry for making you guys give me surprise snacks that would give me diarrhea.

153
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,180
And you guys are my best friends and I love you. And then you guys were like, I hate you.

154
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,180
Yeah, we said this.

155
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,180
Yeah.

156
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
Well, the bacon, egg, and cheeses yesterday were good.

157
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,180
And you ate that right before, I guess not right before.

158
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,180
Yeah, exactly.

159
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,180
See, that's the thing.

160
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,180
That's what I'm saying.

161
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,380
If it had been any other time than two minutes before I hit record.

162
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,780
You guys all got bacon, egg, and cheeses without me?

163
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,780
Yeah.

164
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,780
You were at the doctor.

165
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,580
He was taking a bacon, egg, and cheese out.

166
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,580
Yeah, it's true.

167
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,580
I was at the doctor.

168
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,580
We were putting them in.

169
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,580
He was removing yours.

170
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,580
Yeah.

171
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:36,180
I did get Chipotle and I ate it on the train on the way back.

172
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,180
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

173
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,180
Wait, why is that funny? I don't understand.

174
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,180
Eating a chipotle bowl on the train is...

175
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,180
Isn't that when people say "only in New York"?

176
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,180
Isn't that like one of the...

177
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,180
I guess it's true.

178
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,180
I'm always doing the "only in New York" thing for that day.

179
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:57,180
Whoever sees me, I'm the guy that people think is the embodiment of the city.

180
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,180
Yeah.

181
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,180
Yeah.

182
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Like what? What are you doing that you're making people say that?

183
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,040
Having a really loud argument with a stranger. Yeah

184
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:11,200
I think yeah owning a flamethrower owning a flamethrower. Yeah

185
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,260
flying

186
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,280
Rapidly flying rapidly like Superman

187
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,860
Yeah, it's flapping running down the street flapping your arms. Yeah, I think we have I think I

188
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:41,860
Yeah taking a blonde woman up to the Empire State Building you're swatting down prepare propeller

189
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:47,820
And then kind of like dry humping the Chrysler building yeah

190
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,500
That's yeah

191
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:55,940
Uh-huh laying a lot of eggs laying tons of eggs is only in New York. Mm-hmm

192
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:04,040
digging digging holes becoming a spider in the earth yeah becoming a spider man

193
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:10,860
yo he's digging holes in the earth only in New York and he's like a week season

194
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,500
hmm like I tweak season no who's that this is a guy that walks around and just

195
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,760
films people and says they're part of the tweak Olympics well are they are they

196
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,120
I can't think of any examples of a good video he makes but they're usually very good.

197
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,160
I thought we were going to end up on a YouTube or Twitter only in New York video when we were

198
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:37,160
painted completely blue and somebody was filming us out of their car window.

199
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Oh right.

200
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Yeah.

201
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Yeah.

202
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
But it never turned up.

203
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,560
So if anyone, I mean it's probably out there on somebody's Twitter or Instagram account

204
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,680
there's a video of us blue and dancing.

205
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Dancingly blue.

206
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,640
I think Caleb was singing Informer by Snow.

207
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,140
Yeah.

208
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,480
That is so funny.

209
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
In the blue suit.

210
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,440
We were blue. It was not a suit. It was our skin was blue.

211
00:11:59,440 --> 00:11:59,940
Yeah.

212
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,620
Yeah.

213
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,480
Ugh. Is this episode even working?

214
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,320
I just feel like if Caleb's not here and I'm kind of sleepy,

215
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,240
I'm saying things about New York City. I hate when people do that.

216
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,800
No, you have to say things. You're in New York City now.

217
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,120
Yeah.

218
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,000
So it's like you have to-

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,440
here's lives here and his address is is is is is not saying it he's not saying

220
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,640
the answer is address I mean you have to yeah we're doing a full New York

221
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,320
episode yeah where you only talk about New York okay here's an old man or two

222
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,940
energy drinks before I came here I'm I I was fully ready to have a big high

223
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,520
energy episode and then this little sleepy guy comes in I'm very sad to work

224
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:48,120
York until one am last night after the reason I'm recording this early is

225
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,680
because I have to go back to work at a art department thing. I have to place

226
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,960
and remove stickers off of windows for only in your could that be a job? Yeah,

227
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,180
I actually was thinking that the art job yeah, it was in Cornell Tech on

228
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,380
Roosevelt Island. Well,

229
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:10,960
one am peeling a huge stickers of a window and I was like this is New York.

230
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,980
I'm always going to remember New York.

231
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:16,980
I used to go to Times Square as a kid, but this is what it's really about.

232
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:20,980
It's stickers, yeah. Peeling stickers on an island.

233
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
Where's that island? I don't know anything about New York.

234
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Roosevelt Island is the one that you get to on that big ferry thing.

235
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
So sad.

236
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,980
Or not the ferry, but the gondola.

237
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
So it's an island?

238
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
The gondola.

239
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Yes, there's an island on New York City.

240
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Wait, there's an island here?

241
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Yeah, there's an island in between Brooklyn and Manhattan.

242
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,980
I had no idea how similar New York was to Hawaii.

243
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,980
Yes.

244
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,660
Yeah, because I think of them as complete opposites most of the time.

245
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:46,460
They call Brooklyn the Mahalo City.

246
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,460
No.

247
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:54,380
Well, it's because in New York, I guess now I think about it in Hawaii everyone's surfboards

248
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,340
and in New York everyone's skateboards.

249
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
Right.

250
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
Yeah.

251
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,180
And that's why they call it the Mahalo City.

252
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,180
And in Hawaii--

253
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,020
See, Brooklyn is the town and New York is the city.

254
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,620
Hawaii they have Stitch, but New York they have--

255
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,620
Hitch.

256
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,620
Hitch.

257
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,460
hitch hitch hitch or that I mean Hancock

258
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:23,220
Yeah, every way yeah, it's interchangeable hitching yeah, yeah people understand what you're both superheroes in their own way fuck it

259
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,600
I robot yep. Yeah. Oh my god. I actually did take place here in I robot when he says I'm allergic to bullshit

260
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,460
Do you guys think he was actually allergic to bullshit?

261
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,620
Are you just saying that for the movie what if he said I'm allergic to robots

262
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:51,100
robots. Sorry, I'm allergic to robots. Yeah, over and over and over supposed to

263
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,060
be a robot himself or he has a robot arm. He has a robot arm. I haven't seen

264
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,500
iRobot since I was young. I just remember he I would love to do a shopper

265
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,980
shot remake of iRobot with all of us play every character. I think that's

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,100
If you want every minute of that movie is fucking insane.

267
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, yeah, I don't remember it that well.

268
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,900
Do you know it's the best one is where Will Smith winks to a guy

269
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,000
and then the the clever robot says what is nice and then he

270
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,100
thinks and then Will Smith goes it's a sign of trust something

271
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,100
a robot.

272
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:32,400
It's so funny to make that movie out of like that type of book.

273
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,000
yeah it's just such a great yeah yeah exactly

274
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,760
yeah yeah

275
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,560
uh... i had this is a book of by robot about by isaac asimov okay i mean it's

276
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,800
the same thing but it is no that i guess the main difference i guess what i mean

277
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,760
is it's crazy to put will smith in that movie yeah yeah is what i mean by the

278
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,960
trial of boston that to you know plays all the robots

279
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,240
as that shia labeouf

280
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,880
i don't think so

281
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,880
I don't know.

282
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,520
Shia LaBeouf, he gets a robot for his birthday.

283
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,520
You're thinking of Transformers.

284
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
You're thinking of Transformers.

285
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,800
He gets a robot for his birthday, then Megan Fox fixes it for him.

286
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,600
Those movies are so good.

287
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,600
Right?

288
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,600
Yeah.

289
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,520
Do you know what we need to-- Will Smith is a big truck, a big red and

290
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
blue truck.

291
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Right.

292
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,680
Right, yeah.

293
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,440
I think I remember him now.

294
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,600
I think I remember that.

295
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,200
And the way that Michael Bay does like needle drops in those movies is so

296
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,960
incredible and every movie needs to be doing that just playing the first like

297
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:38,480
ten seconds of a song just five times throughout the movie is every time like

298
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,720
like I think it's a second or third one where you know I mean every all the

299
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,200
first three have a Linkin Park song. Yeah, I always play everyone knows that

300
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,560
but in the second or third one done not that what I've done what I second one

301
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,440
know what I've done is the first one and then it's new divide and then it's some

302
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:59,140
some song some newer. I think the when it plays at the at the credits of the

303
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,300
first one incredible

304
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,360
yeah. Oh my God,

305
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:09,120
but the in either the second or third one, they also they played the intro to

306
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,560
green days, twenty one guns. They play it like three or four times and they

307
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,640
never play the song. They only play the

308
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,600
they just like you start. They always just start to fade it in and then it

309
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:27,740
like fades out again before the song starts. Remember the guitar solo in 21

310
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:33,060
guns how it sounds exactly like the full house theme song? Yeah I could have never connected that.

311
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,620
Yeah.

312
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:48,100
Dude that song bangs though. Oh my god Green Day at their best. They had some song by the

313
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,100
the band him in the Transformers movie and then that when I was a kid that

314
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,540
made me want to see it because I was like whoa yeah whoa that was Michael

315
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:02,460
Bay has a him song this movie that's fucking awesome and then they don't ever

316
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,820
play it it's just on the soundtrack yeah that was me but for a Megan Fox yeah I

317
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:15,020
was just giant robots and I remember I used to go see all that because the

318
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,280
Transformers movies would all come out around July fourth. Yeah, it's my

319
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,980
birthday, so i'd always go see them for my birthday and i remember one year one

320
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:27,520
of them like my friend was like was like like i heard when this move like on the

321
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,460
opening night of this movie when they showed megan fox on in on the screen,

322
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,200
all the men in the audience cheered.

323
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,900
It's like i wonder if that's going to happen again. I really thought that was

324
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:44,300
going to be like a very obvious lie story. Children tell, but of course that

325
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,740
story is one hundred percent true. It's not even worth lying about the

326
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:52,140
funniest part of that is like how do you know it like who would have told him

327
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:57,240
that you know what I mean another boy, but who is there probably is yes yeah

328
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,640
probably is dad says like yeah, I fucking started cheering. I saw boobs

329
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,740
no honey everyone cheered.

330
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:11,740
It was all the men gonna be a star. I'm when they took out Megan Fox and they

331
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,500
in the strange woman. They put in strange blondie who turned out to be a decepticorn. Yeah, it

332
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:23,060
was strangely odd, but spoilers much, spoilers much, Pluto TV plays all the first three Transformers

333
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,180
movies basically on loop, like all day, and I've just been catching like just like five

334
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:32,980
minutes of each movie at a time. The last like three I watched only the Transformers

335
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:38,380
scenes. Yeah? Yeah. The fifth one is like actually incredible. Yeah. I did not expect it. Is

336
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,080
not expected where they say Harriet Tubman was a auto bot yeah a night of

337
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,800
wit wiki. Okay, actually that might be yeah, no that's the that's the fifth

338
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,840
one that's the one where they have Sir Anthony Hopkins yeah and more

339
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,400
wallberg and he's like I think I found it. You know what mark wallberg some

340
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,340
characters name is

341
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,740
is clark cade yeager. Oh,

342
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,740
and then tj miller gets switch by

343
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,400
yeah, if it is, there's they have like they have like he's they have I

344
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,700
forget there's a super British character is like a really obnoxious British

345
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,620
name to yeah and I can't remember what the name is something like honestly

346
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:21,860
something like that some and then yeah saying any English name with the

347
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,060
expectation that there's going to be a last name yeah,

348
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:31,220
but so they have cade yeager the American and this British person and

349
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,200
then there's a and then there's a super there's a French auto button. His

350
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:42,220
his name is hot rod. There's a French Autobot and his name is Subaru.

351
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:48,340
The transformer should just be named, should just be named the name of the cars or vehicles.

352
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:58,660
There's that transformer. There's that one transformer that's like she's a spider woman

353
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,620
and they'd in the cartoons they draw her like like uh...

354
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:04,180
very scantily clad

355
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:09,020
I was reading about this. I don't think she's a spider woman, I think that's Arcee and she's just a normal

356
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:12,380
she's a motorcycle. No, there's a woman who's like... Oh, you're talking about Beast Wars where they

357
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,920
transform into creatures.

358
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:18,340
I don't know but... Well, just think about it for one second because it's vehicles for the most part

359
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,380
and you probably wouldn't have a spider woman. And then Beast Wars that turn to beasts. There's a spider woman and they one of the...

360
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,580
Are you watching Spider-Man? They took one of the animators to a strip club for

361
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:33,420
inspiration of that character and then he drew her crazy he drew a crazy nude

362
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:44,460
holy crap what if this stripper had eight legs like this bug I'm he just keeps

363
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,140
drawing this spider they staring at and they're like no we brought you you can

364
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,140
look at a spider anywhere like this it's a strip club please look around take

365
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,160
inspiration from other it's a house and he draws like a spider a spider again

366
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:58,560
when it's holding a dollar bill. Yeah, it's a spider hole. I would hate that

367
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,660
I would hate if I went to the strip club pole. Yeah,

368
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:07,140
there are some transformers that just transform into oh yeah. When the first

369
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:12,520
movie came out, they made robots that transform into meteors for the first

370
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,760
scene where they're all coming down into space and I remember thing is a

371
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,240
rock. I remember obsessively watching transformers toy reviews of the new

372
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:25,140
by this guy matrix prime who still does it and I remember him reviewing one of the

373
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,940
ones that transforms into a meteorite he just goes it's a decent toy I can't

374
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,920
imagine a child reaching for this toy in a pile of other toys but it does

375
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:38,260
transform pretty nicely and the coloring isn't so bad even though it's mostly

376
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:44,040
gray all right see you next time. How short was the review 30 seconds? No all of his

377
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:47,220
reviews were eight minutes he would begin by talking about the vehicle form

378
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,540
transform. He would talk about the paint and then he would say,

379
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:51,060
let's transform. Let's

380
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:56,860
that's so awesome. I yeah, I there should be more transformers.

381
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,900
There's like a plank of wood. Yeah, a single wheel. Is it

382
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:06,180
opt of or Megatron used to be a gun? Yeah, I know. That's so

383
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:09,260
cool on for you guys. I was talking about. Yeah, we probably

384
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,660
talked about transformers before. I have so many maybe I

385
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,020
taught we talked about this one too, but you know the Dracula

386
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:18,580
transformer. No, there's a transformer who's just Dracula and his name is

387
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:24,780
Dracula's wow and he's he just has a cape and he looks like Dracula for just

388
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:28,220
like I'm talking about like ten years of my life. I just would go on the

389
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,360
computer and look at transformers video reviews and go to transformers web like

390
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,780
I remember my parents and I went on a vacation to like Cosmo or Cancun Mexico

391
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,820
and I just stayed no transformers here. I stayed by the hotel pool and just

392
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,740
to the same website which was Star Wars

393
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,560
Transformers.hazbroke.com. Dude, the website

394
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,180
they have like the I remember that one

395
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,820
you could have them like the animated

396
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,620
gifs of them transforming and just like

397
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,820
yeah it's like Darth Vader transforming into the

398
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,620
Death Star or something. There was one

399
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,220
where you could like take the action

400
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,460
figures and put them onto like a

401
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,060
battlefield and they would walk around

402
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,820
in stop-motion I would do that all the

403
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,300
time. So cool. I just looked up the

404
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,980
spider woman and there are two options

405
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,580
here you could either be talking about

406
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,380
about a rack ned or black arachnia. I think it's black arachnia black

407
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,260
arachnia look up. She doesn't like me like she doesn't look like the face

408
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:18,700
she's

409
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:24,780
purple on the body and face yeah. She doesn't look like she was drawn from a

410
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:28,180
strip club. Really it up look it up. I'm looking at her right now. Look up

411
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,980
black arachnia strip club moment

412
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,980
black or a king through the I'm scrolling through the week. He pays for

413
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:43,820
black arachnia let's see notes yeah I I'm not seeing I guess I didn't roll up

414
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,620
black arachnia stripper moment did you guys ever get like a very like like you

415
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,180
felt disgusting for getting an erection as a child like did you ever become hard

416
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:02,900
at a very obviously disgusting thing I'll start okay so a story yeah there

417
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,580
was a there was one episode of Futurama where Zoidberg is like kissing his

418
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:15,860
like another crab and they're like making out and their weird mandibles are just like

419
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:19,660
slurping it's played for complete disgust like all the other characters are like

420
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:27,940
"UGH!" I remember getting like an enormous burn. From Zoidberg kissing another woman who

421
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:35,100
looks like Zoidberg. From two Zoidbergs kissing. Yeah that was one I think I have about two or three more

422
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:41,900
There was one where I was like 19 years old, like I was an adult at this point and I was

423
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:48,020
working in Starbucks and I was like extremely, I was in like a very lonely, almost schizophrenic

424
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,700
phase. This was when I was like trying to fight off my genetic predisposition for schizophrenia

425
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,460
and I was just sitting in Starbucks at like 7 a.m. where it's very, very dead at the cash

426
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,940
register not doing any tasks that you're supposed to do when you're waiting for customers to

427
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:11,540
to come in and a fly flew into my face and I got hard.

428
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,140
Was there any thought to it?

429
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,700
It was a pure reflex or did you think about something when the fly?

430
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:22,300
So long I hadn't been touched in like ten months by anyone.

431
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,140
That's an exaggeration, but it was a long time since I had been touched by anyone in

432
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,140
a definite way.

433
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
And a fly touching you.

434
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,140
And a fly flew into my face.

435
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,440
I won't say that I got hard, but you know how when your penis like pulses yeah,

436
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,980
how it does that little like yeah, like there's a pulse that goes through yeah,

437
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:42,040
that's what happened to me then in that moment. Oh, and then I think a cat in an

438
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,600
episode of cat dog, an alien blows a fart bubble. I know that one's

439
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:53,000
I would completely believe that that last one. I don't think it's true. I do

440
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,820
remember thinking, oh my God,

441
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:59,580
So I do think there is an episode of cat dog where an alien is is threatening to

442
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:03,820
give cat dog a big sloppy kiss and I thought that doesn't sound so bad. Maybe

443
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:09,340
that had an accompanying erection. Yeah yeah I remember being really disgusted

444
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:16,220
by when I was playing what is which game is it I think it's Yoshi's Island some

445
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,740
it's a Yoshi game for the Game Boy and there's a boss fight where a frog

446
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:24,700
swallow shrinks you down and swallows you and I was like this is the most

447
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,500
disgusting thing I've ever seen. It's like a, the screen goes, it's like a circle of

448
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,620
like the frog's stomach and you have, and it's swallowing stuff and you have to, and

449
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:37,420
then you have to like turn the stuff it's swallowing into eggs and throw it at the uvula

450
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,980
of the frog and the like whole stomach is like jiggling around and I was like, this is not

451
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:47,440
okay. Yeah, they need to take this out of the game. I don't know. I don't know anything

452
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,700
that I've ever been really disgusted. Well, like maybe like poop stuff. I've been completely

453
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,100
I mean I'm thinking of stuff of childhood stuff.

454
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Oh, childhood stuff?

455
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
I mean, this didn't happen yesterday.

456
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,900
Also, this isn't a story about nasty things, it's a story about...

457
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,400
Well, I'm not sure, I don't really have a catalogue in my brain of what I've got a boner

458
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,740
from that was weird.

459
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,540
You don't have like developmental moment boners?

460
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
Not that I...

461
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540
Maybe meat spin?

462
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,540
I'm sure there were a...

463
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,300
Maybe when I saw meat spin as a kid.

464
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,140
I'm sure there were, I had plenty of Zoidberg moments, but I just don't remember them.

465
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,100
I'm not trying to say I don't have them, but I didn't have them, but I don't, I don't, I

466
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:24,100
you can't really keep track of the media

467

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,200
like meat spin was so tame compared to all the other ones.

487
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,380
was just poor just a wiener yeah it's just a wiener there's nothing wrong with a

488
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,900
wiener it's barely shocking but in the other ones on the like lol shock website

489
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:18,940
we're like okay this is this is three guys one hammer there's a guy getting

490
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,180
his face beaten in with a hammer yeah and then this one is a guy putting a jar

491
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:28,620
in his asshole yeah I don't know maybe attitudes have just changed as I've

492
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,260
gotten older yeah it's not zoidberg kissing lady zoidberg I think it's fry

493
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,260
Fry getting sort of molested by a female void bird.

494
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:45,260
That's honestly what- He's got like slimy tentacles.

495
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:49,260
Oh god, ew. Yeah. Yeah, that's not nice.

496
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,260
And Fry is frowning. Frowning Fry.

497
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,260
And he's supposed to be who you're identifying with.

498
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:01,260
They don't show a close up of his pants stretching with sexual lust.

499
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:08,780
they show him saying shut up this honestly is making it I I'm not glad I

500
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,300
wish I hadn't seen that because in my brain you you popped a boner literally

501
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:17,020
just from a close-up of two like tentacle faced lobsters kissing each

502
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,580
other but now that I've seen that it's a fake cartoon woman with lingerie on I

503
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,380
think yeah it's kind of ruined for me also look someone did a fan art of her

504
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,520
Oh my god.

505
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,980
They should have Zoidbergs.

506
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,740
What if they discovered aliens tomorrow and it was Zoidbergs?

507
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:39,940
If it was Zoidbergs, I'd probably laugh my fucking head off.

508
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:42,820
Yeah, he has some funny quotes.

509
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,820
I'd probably be like, "Hoh hoh."

510
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,460
Why is my microphone popping?

511
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,680
I don't know.

512
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
It's popping?

513
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
It's making a pop sound.

514
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,460
Yeah, I can hear it on this.

515
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,620
Oh my gosh, it's crazy.

516
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:59,620
We got to buy a new XLR. Yeah, we have to buy a bunch of new XLRs. This is the one

517
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:05,980
that works though, supposedly. Why don't we throw out the ones that don't work? I

518
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,380
mean I put all the ones that don't work in the same place, but then they keep

519
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:12,620
getting mixed up because other people move them around. I want to sit down and

520
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:15,420
test them all in a row because I'm also not sure it could be a microphone thing

521
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,500
or a recorder thing. We should just put a piece of tape on it. I basically want to hire a tester to test

522
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,100
everything for me. Interesting. Yeah, that's basically a tester. Do you guys

523
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,620
think you would be do a good job as a poison taste tester? I don't think I

524
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:34,540
would. No? I don't think I would because I'd probably eat the poison and then I

525
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:39,020
would die from it. That's a good poison taste tester. That's one who's good at it.

526
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,580
Because then the king won't eat the thing you ate. Anyone else sick of the

527
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,340
fucking king asking you to taste his food? Not me, I don't mind at all. Yeah, we

528
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,300
should politely ask him to stop doing that mm-hmm that'd be awesome if we got

529
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:58,020
if we maybe I think maybe the king I think maybe instead of asking the king

530
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,460
maybe we just go and cut the middleman out and just ask people to stop putting

531
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,300
poison in the food and aren't you guys sick of the middleman I hate the

532
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:12,060
fucking middleman and the little man yeah and I remember the medieval man's

533
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:16,820
the worst man I remember going to Trader Joe's once with my with my mom as a kid

534
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,180
and they had some ad or some sign or branding or something that said like cut

535
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:24,440
out the middleman on it. That was the first time I had heard that phrase. It's

536
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,840
like who is the middleman? Who is he? What's he doing with the food? What he's

537
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,780
got all the other food at the other grocery stores but at Trader Joe's they

538
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,700
don't have him. Yeah. They don't have the middleman. I don't know what the

539
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,500
middleman does he must increase the food's value somehow. Yeah.

540
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:54,900
He must be some sort of value increaser. He sprinkles, he puts on special dust

541
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,300
that's worth a lot of money. Yeah, right. Yeah. They say that every time a

542
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,900
product changes hands, it decreases in value, but the middleman is special

543
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:06,800
because he increases it. Yeah. Imagine getting a job as a middleman and

544
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,240
you're also an eBay real reseller damn him that you're making a shit ton of money

545
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,680
I actually worked as a middleman for a long time yeah yeah it sucks so bad

546
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:24,040
where's the job and I can't talk about it all cuz I'm still under NDA damn yeah

547
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,440
they don't let you tell anyone what you do to the things to make them different

548
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:33,640
yeah to make the things different because it's not all food yeah there's

549
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:37,300
is it and I'm close to violating my NDA here, but it's things not food.

550
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,520
There's all sorts of different things and stuff happens.

551
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,900
Aren't you guys sick of the the Queen and the Princess to I actually hate

552
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,360
them more than the King. I don't know. I think the Princess is okay.

553
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,800
I hate her. He has a crush on the Prince. I don't have a crush on the

554
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,120
Princess. I seriously don't have a crush on the Princess. No, she's just

555
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,880
nice. She's just nice to me and know everyone else is like you're a lowly

556
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,940
serving boy she's nice to everyone she's the princess yes that's why she's cool

557
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,260
if you don't want to marry her but i don't have a crush on her not the

558
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,980
princess sending me secret messages

00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:18,700
the princess is sending me very secret nonverbal messages that she wants to

00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,820

Because I'm committing adultery with the town hoe.

595
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,100
town. Oh the the town caliph is

596
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:43,600
threatening to make me renounce my God Christ.

597
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Yeah,

598
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:52,300
the town Viking is wearing a hat with horns on it.

599
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:59,000
Not the town Viking riding in a boat like a dragon. Oh dude.

600
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:06,120
The town barbarian is laying waste and siege to my horse. The town Trojan is

601
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:14,880
about to get... no wait the Trojan... I hear movement in the town Trojan. I hear movement

602
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:24,760
inside of it. The town Trojan is just a guy with people inside of him. Like a possum. Yeah.

603
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:32,440
Pasa mommy carries his babies or like a kangaroo. Yeah. Yeah, like a kangaroo. Maybe the town kangaroo is hopping

604
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,340
It's jumping he's hopping pouch Lee

605
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:44,280
Pouch Lee hopping I would love to live in a town where there's one of everything. Yeah. Yeah, there's a town kangaroo

606
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,320
I do baby Viking Brooklyn true Brooklyn. I do sick all these kangaroos hopping around Brooklyn, New York. Oh

607
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,880
where you get they hop and they got their boxing gloves on and they run up to you

608
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,280
and they try to fight you. They try to, these kangaroos are trying to knock out

609
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
people.

610
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,280
They're really good at it.

611
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,480
And they're so good at it. They sit on their tail and they kick you with your

612
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
feet.

613
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,480
Yeah.

614
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Like Sheila from Spyro.

615
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:16,180
A lot of people would think when they see a kangaroo with boxing gloves, they'd be

616
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,680
more scared because they think the kangaroo is about to punch me. I would be

617
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,180
less scared because I know kangaroos without boxing gloves also punch and

618
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:27,180
they have sharp claws. Yeah, I would actually prefer if they put boxing gloves

619
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,980
on their on their fucking feet.

620
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,680
Mm-hmm. Who was it? So because it doesn't hurt so bad then maybe? Dead ass.

621
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,180
Who is it? It was Mussolini used to like give tigers a bunch of like sleeping

622
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,180
pills or something and then wrestle them. That sounds cool.

623
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,180
I didn't. Am I remembering that correctly? I have no idea. Awesome.

624
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,940
My friend said that his grandfather had a tiger in his attic.

625
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,940
Tigress?

626
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,940
Ooh, a tigress.

627
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,940
Cheetah.

628
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,940
Oh my god, cheetah. Was she in the Wonder Woman movie?

629
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,940
Yeah, played by Kristen Wiig.

630
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,660
Kristen Wiig played cheetah? Was she funny?

631
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,660
I think she might have been a little bit funny.

632
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,660
Was she a funny cheetah woman?

633
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
I never saw it.

634
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,660
Oh, no, she wasn't funny. I think she was strange.

635
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660
She was strange? I didn't see it. I watched a clip and they...

636
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,660
I would have said she was feline or feral.

637
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:20,340
feral that's what that's the adjective I would have wouldn't she there's like a

638
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,340
scene of her eating a bunch of Doritos or something oh sounds funny to me

639
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,060
there's like a scene of her eating Doritos or sorry maybe I'm just

640
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:34,380
remembering that there is a Wonder Woman Doritos bag or maybe Wonder Woman had a

641
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,020
collab with Doritos or maybe I was thinking of Doritos and then I thought

642
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,500
of Wonder Woman yeah that must be it or maybe it's because I was thinking cheetah

643
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:50,640
Dorito like as if it rhymed. Holy fuck. Yeah. If only there was like a cool big

644
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,680
cat with sunglasses whose name rhymed with Doritos. Yeah like

645
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:04,140
Desta Dorito. Desta? Dustin Dorito. Yeah okay so he's Dustin Dorito.

646
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:08,700
Dustin Dorito doesn't really rhyme with Dorito. He's not a cheetah.

647
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,420
does Chester doesn't rhyme with Cheeto I thought his name was oh yeah his name is

648
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:22,500
Chester what did you think it was Cheeto no appears that's the food no that's

649
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,900
actually our 40 50 thinking yeah the okay what's up and Pierce thought that

650
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:33,100
the food was called Chester's thank you there are bags that say Chester's puffs

651
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:38,820
I've seen them there are bags that say that yeah yeah big not official bags but

652
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,860
yeah they've written there's at the gym there's bags that say Chester's there is

654
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,780

655
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,780

really a lion man why is there a lion mascot and plus he's a lion he's the king

658
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,140
of the jungle he could also have a crown made of Doritos

659
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,860
now that would look good yeah a crown made of Doritos is actually really

660
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:20,660
Dorito the king of Doritos Doritos ever have a mascot he's Dustin Dorito the

why did they have a dragon for jury does because of them

672
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,420
dragon character of the readers is one of the through the though production cases

673
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,220
where every bits of details demands extremely elaborated hard work from

674
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,900
intricate labor of merging plus two wings or nails

675
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,340
teeth are vacuum press now sir three printed we can be proud to declare that

676
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:16,200
there's maybe no similar one to be compared considering loyalty on original

677
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,820
design and comfort comfort ability of acting this is on mascot dot com the

678
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:24,860
mascot with a k right let's see is like a polish mascot

679
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:29,180
Yeah, in Poland they're just making mascots for brands without being asked.

680
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,980
Whoa!

681
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,900
Why are they- what the fuck?

682
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,180
They're assembling the shell and- oh my god, it's a little person!

683
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:43,660
It's a little person as a Dorito.

684
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:45,260
Oh my god, because it's a baby dragon.

685
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,540
Yeah, but what does baby dragons have to do with Doritos?

686
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,700
Oh my god.

687
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:51,740
What?

688
00:43:51,740 --> 00:43:53,260
This is so crazy.

689
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:53,980
I think-

690
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,980
I really do think that no one asked them to do this and they thought maybe there was a contest or something.

691
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:03,480
I think maybe this... Okay, I think the dragon is just named Dorito.

692
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,480
Oh, that... Well...

693
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,980
I think this is just a dragon named Dorito.

694
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:11,980
But what is he the mascot for?

695
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:15,480
It says, "Dorito's Hot Wave Baby Dragon Mascot."

696
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,480
Interesting. Oh, this music is great.

697
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,480
This is so crazy.

698
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,680
Whoa, look at that other mascot head they have on there.

699
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
I want to look at the other mascot.

700
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:29,880
They look like they just got the shells for like Barney characters.

701
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,480
Look at these diagrams.

702
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:32,480
Wow.

703
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,400
No, yeah, it is a Doritos mascot.

704
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,360
Look, they have pictures of him with Doritos bags.

705
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,360
Yeah, heat.

706
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,240
Heat burst and heat wave.

707
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,840
I really like this picture of him just holding out his arms.

708
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Yeah.

709
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Oh my god.

710
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
This is it.

711
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
We should buy this costume.

712
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,720
Can you buy it?

713
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,720
I don't think so.

714
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,640
think any of us are small enough to fit in that cost. We'll figure it out. We'll do

715
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,960
alterations. We should commission this company. To make a Dorito. Maybe we make a

716
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,480
Big Sullivan. That would be so sick. That would be cool. They have really nice

717
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:10,040
mascots. They made a bunch of mascots. They made mascots for Bonita Bee.

718
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,320
For masks. Oh they made some Masked Singer. Wow the Cobra one's cool.

719
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:20,360
Orange Fox, Madonna, Professor, Mirror Man. Hillary. They have a cheetah. We could

720
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:24,320
maybe come to them about about about dusting to read or the king of cheese.

721
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,120
Maybe you should be the king of the jungle of cheese and then he lives in a

722
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,120
jungle of cheese. Jungle of cheese is a jungle made entirely of cheese,

723
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:35,720
king of the jungle of cheese and through the jungle of cheese is a school

724
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:39,480
ranch river. Cool ranch river will be sick. I just think the jungle of cheese

725
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,640
is such a good idea. Yeah, yeah, a whole jungle made of cheese and the vines

726
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:48,480
are string cheese right. The trees are okay. What other Doritos flavors are

727
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,280
there there's the purple flavor spicy sweet chili right that doesn't really

728
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,840
have a cheese angle but no but it does have a chill the what about pepper yes

729
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,520
so what is pepper so what if the peppers are actually peppery Doritos yeah well

730
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,120
what do it maybe penguin pepper the penguin pepper the penguin in a jungle

731
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:15,200
yeah that's he got he got lost that could be his whole characters thing is he got

732
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,820
lost on the way to the flame penguin to pepper Antarctica oh yeah I guess as

733
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,720
long as creatures are getting lost we could do whatever we want this jungle

734
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,800
well that's yeah that's every every smart writer about pepper the porcupine

735
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:34,160
that's yeah or what's another door other than those maybe pepper snake a

736
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:39,800
pepper snake well or we could have a king cobra a corner all in it's all royalty a

737
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,480
a corn snake and it's a corn chip

738
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,920
that's a yeah

739
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,520
according to him

740
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:48,640
that's perfect okay

741
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,120
what other to read a look at the list of the reader flavors right now and i'm just

742
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,200
trying to think we're getting through the whole list of this cast of

743
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,320
characters what is their time to think about like what what is the actual like

744
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,360
greenery of this forest what it's she's made out of cheese so i think that is

745
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:10,480
cheese leaves cheese trees yellow or orange or white 3d guy yeah oh they do

746
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,560
have Doritos 3d yeah it can be like a Waldo see graphic Doritos air flame and

747
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,120
hot cool ranch yeah that doesn't make much sense to me well I think those are

748
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,200
you know these are like tertiary Dorito care so just to get the main ones out of

749
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:27,480
the way I mean I'm just on the Doritos products scroll down scroll down and I

750
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,340
don't want to talk about 3d crunch so I think the staples are cool ranch cheese

751
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:39,740
and spicy sweet chili. Ooh, the dinamita. That's interesting. Those must be sort of the trunks. Oh, and spicy nacho. Yeah.

752
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:44,000
See, and they have simply organic white cheddar flavored tortilla chips.

753
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:50,100
I think that that, maybe that is like, um, though. Well, the main, the main cast of characters here is, is. Maybe that's like an airplane.

754
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:54,500
No, but I have a good idea for a side character for the simply organic white cheddar flavored tortilla chips.

755
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:58,620
Maybe it's a Karen. It's like, it's like a, yeah, it's a British guy. Okay. It's like a Brit,

756
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,260
it's a Jane Goodall type came to the jungle of cheese to research it and he

757
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:08,460
goes it's simply organic that is awesome British and he's and it's he's made he

758
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,940
got covered in white cheddar right and I guess the white cheddar and his name is

759
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:17,460
basil cheddar oh okay so this is good he's like a animatronic in like a sort

760
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,900
of Disney ride and yeah that's welcome to the jungle of cheese simply organic

761
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:28,260
simply organic yeah. We began with a simply organic chip and yeah,

762
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:32,980
you want to everyone in the everyone in the ride gets a little so it's a right

763
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:39,140
now. I thought this was like a brand world character is doing a brand to

764
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:42,920
work. Yeah, no, I just thought we were until you said that a character is

765
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,660
saying something that there's a commercial and what do you mean is

766
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:51,060
there commercials and stuff right like Tony the Tiger says it's great. That

767
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,760
doesn't mean he has to be a ride.

768
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,700
So look you're you're on a ride and everyone gets a

769
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,900
one. This is Doritos the right

770
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,300
it

771
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,200
to move it in the cheese

772
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,600
and by the end of a custom chip, just like yeah, because it's

773
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,000
just like in disney's star wars lightsaber.

774
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,640
You start with like a chip base. You choose a chip base from you

775
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,880
can either you can get that from the corn chip snake or the

776
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,920
tortilla chip right right you have to on rails so that every

777
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:26,340
stop you get a choice and then it's one corner in one of three dips and then you

778
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:30,340
also get the powder at the end right it should all be it should all be powder

779
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:34,420
yeah I think I think it's a chip powder yeah did I tell you guys about the time

780
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,300
that I got a bag of chips in my cafeteria and we were all touching it

781
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:42,140
because it felt gooey on the inside it was Doritos so we didn't open it and

782
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,540
like everyone was like what it was like heavier than a normal bag of Doritos and

783
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:49,380
it felt really good on the inside and then we opened it and it was two chips

784
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:54,180
and just a ton of dust like all flavor dust and two chips.

785
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,180
Whoa, that's incredible.

786
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:57,180
You should have saved the dust.

787
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,780
I have a really good, I have a mix and match idea.

788
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:00,780
What's that?

789
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:06,180
Um, that we, this factories, it's a factory idea for any factory owners.

790
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:11,820
Switch out, switch out, switch out the dust between Doritos and Sour Patch Kids and see

791
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,820
what happens.

792
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,060
Yeah, they should have a mix up at the two factories.

793
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,340
A mix up.

794
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:24,380
why why did Doritos cool rancher look like why are they green when I think of

795
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:29,820
ranch I don't think of that color it's the jungle it's due to the jungle it's

796
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:33,540
the ranch River the ranch the river rancher is it's for the green color is

797
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:40,140
from algae in the ranch oh my god and the red is from the blood of the enemies

798
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:46,380
the enemies of the red is from the lipstick from the queen of the

799
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:50,620
jungle yeah that's like that that's the plot twist as you get you get to a

800
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,620
clearing and and the like trees the cheese trees kind of part as you're

801
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:58,060
turning the corner and it's a giant castle yeah they should just call the

802
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,380
trees palm cheese there we go yeah yeah what's a jungle. I don't think they

803
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:06,060
necessarily be palm she oh in the desert. Oh that's what do you get the

804
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:12,940
dry Dorito that's hot and the dust is sand yeah. Oh my God. This is a spin

805
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,540
off ride. Yeah, you can either go in the jungle of cheese or the desert of

806
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,440
desolation. Yeah, and it's the hottest desert on Earth and you dip it in the

807
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:26,240
sand, which is really all the sand is flavor third degree burn. Yeah, spice

808
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:33,640
cactus. Calvin Cactus Calvin is your guide there and he says it's simply

809
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:40,380
organic. He's the brother of of basil. Yeah, see I'm wondering

810
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,320
because okay, so we've got Dustin Dorito, the king of the

811
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,980
jungle of cheese, the king of the jungle of cheese, then we

812
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:48,800
have his wife,

813
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:55,400
Darlene, the town, ho the town, ho of cool Ranch River, yeah,

814
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:00,760
and then the the king Cobra is the we didn't think of his name.

815
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,060
- Pepper the King Cobra, spicy sweet chili.

816
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,300
- King Cornbra.

817
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:06,140
- King Cornbra.

818
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:08,300
- The corn chips, and then he has that whole title

819
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,420
in parenthesis, a corn chip snake.

820
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,260
- A corn chip snake.

821
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:12,740
- I really want to get that in there.

822
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:15,500
- Yeah, he is just venom flavored.

823
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:19,740
- Yeah, there's one thing that you do,

824
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,780
if you dip it in, it will poison your chip and you will die.

825
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,100
So do not, and the ride, they're like,

826
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,900
watch out for the King Cobra,

827
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:29,940
don't dip your chip in his bowl.

828
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:34,220
yeah only mean boys eat poison chips.

829
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,560
They feed it to their sisters and a few yeah a few times a year. People are like

830
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,720
they're probably i'm going to be nasty i'm going to dip my chip in the king

831
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:49,240
cobra's bowl is a bowl yeah is a bowl you get a bowl yeah you get a bowl for

832
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,860
your chips

833
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:57,840
with a regular salsa yeah and then at the end you don't get to eat your chip,

834
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:59,620
you get to buy a picture of it at a

835
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:01,700
kiosk. Yeah, you get to take a picture

836
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,420
that's a safety measure in case the any

837
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,740
of the poison gets onto the chip.

838
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,260
You don't want people seeing you.

839
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,660
I remember this kid at my high school

840
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:10,980
posted a picture of just like Doritos

841
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,740
covered in cheese in his microwave

842
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,660
and he just with the caption,

843
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,660
"I'm a fucking genius!"

844
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,980
We need to carve out some space at this

845
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:23,580
entirely Doritos themed theme park

846
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,340
for a Taco Bell area where they have

847
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,660
the Doritos Locos Tacos.

848
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:33,900
wait oh the Doritos the Taco Bell area should be like a Taco Bell when you're

849
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:39,820
done with the ride you can go to go to Taco Bell get a drink oh my god when you

850
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,180
order at the Taco Bell in a bell so you don't get to eat your chip at the

851
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:47,220
end of the ride you get your picture printed out of the chip when you order a

852
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,420
Taco Bell you hand them the picture of the chip you designed and they can make

853
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:55,180
that into a shell for your time make that a specialized taco yeah it has a

854
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:58,620
there's a code on the back that they scan with a code reader. Yep, they

855
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:03,680
have a code reader at the Taco Bell. This scans the chip code and that

856
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,260
way they can also protect against poison getting in the food right. I

857
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:12,380
guess I would like maybe every fast food restaurant to be in the jungle

858
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,860
yeah, and it has different. They you can eat each one of you have to

859
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:19,020
choose where you're taking your chip basically right like I can go to

860
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:22,420
mcdonald's and I could give them and they'll make my chip into a fry

861
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:29,700
I make it into a whole Doritos Locos Taco or you can eat it turns it into

862
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:34,260
well. You get multiple come on come on. Obviously, you get multiple fries

863
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:40,420
right. You get a whole order of fries. It's a batch. Yeah, Burger King also a

864
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,980
fry a chicken fry when these you also get a fry right as I'm just thinking of

865
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:51,060
like you know in the box a taco taco. Yeah, five guys is a fry five guys is a

866
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:55,540
a fry yeah del taco is a fry inside a

867
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,820
burrito yep a California style burrito

868
00:54:58,820 --> 00:55:02,100
yep. I hop you can't you can't use it

869
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:04,420
there. No you can't know you do that you

870
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,780
think it would be a so maybe you would

871
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,420
think it would be a hash brown or a fry

872
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,420
at I hop, but they don't accept it. It's

873
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:11,820
something with their contract. They say

874
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,260
we don't say we don't have want to buy a

875
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,900
code scanner at I we're kind of keeping

876
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:17,860
costs low. We don't really like having

877
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:25,280
code scanners around at I hop and then you can swim in a cheese river yeah yeah

878
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,400
and you get to see it's a blue it's like a pool where they instead of dying it

879
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,920
blue they die yellow oh it's a lazy river it's a circular lazy river it's

880
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:38,440
filled completely with liquid cheese it's really hot you get in you're covered

881
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,360
in cheese you're like okay that was a fun novelty thing to do they have showers

882
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,440
there I'm gonna go shower the showers are also cheese mm-hmm and you can never get

883
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:49,440
get clean and then you when you're trying to leave when you try to leave the

884
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,440
theme park. They say you can't leave because you're taking our cheese with

885
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,420
you. You have to leave the cheese at the door and you're like well. Can I rinse

886
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,560
the cheese off and they're like no, then yeah, give you a chip. They give you one

887
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:07,280
just to scrape it off yeah yeah to spray it off to scrape it. That's the worst

888
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,080
thing about going to like an amusement park as a kid or as an adult, ripping

889
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,960
cheese off your body. It's scraping all the cheese off. Yeah. When you go to an amusement

890
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,700
park as an adult or like a, I don't know, like a great wolf lodge and then you realize

891
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:27,700
like oh yeah, there's like, it's just kind of depressing here. Yeah. It's not as magical

892
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:33,140
as it was when I was a kid. So maybe this park can have a lot of stuff for, like awesome

893
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:38,340
stuff for adults. Yeah, maybe a beer ride build your own beer.

894
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:42,340
My God,

895
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:47,540
I want to go to be your world and you can pick you pick the

896
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,340
liquid and then you pick the bubbles.

897
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,340
You get to pick any beer.

898
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:01,840
Yeah, there's a lot of picture taken with the Rolling Rock

899
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:08,160
horse. Oh my God. Yeah, that's something we're going to have to figure out is if

900
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:12,440
the beer animals can coexist with the chips animals in the jungle or if we

901
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:17,120
need to kind of coordinate off. It does beer world have its own separate place.

902
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,960
It's the same theme park, but it has two entrances based on if you're going with

903
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,960
your family or not. Okay, so if you're taking your kids, you can trick them

904
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:30,400
into thinking you're going to only Doritos, Doritos Dominion. But if you

905
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,400
