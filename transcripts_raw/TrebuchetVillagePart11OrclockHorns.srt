[Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village, our heroes awoke from a night of bronzing each other's body parts

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and having some good fun playing music.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Their fun that next morning was rudely interrupted by Thorax,

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
who just wanted them to get ready for the fight in the arena.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
At this suggestion, the boy said, "Well, why don't you fight with us?"

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
and Thorax reluctantly agreed that maybe he should.

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
On their way there, they experienced Gal Gadot in more of its grandeur,

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
experiencing the kind of speciesism that hurts someone like Evil Stevel being a dwarf.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Which he got full on from the shaman, Giggy, who was a member of Thorax's gang.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Upon arriving at the arena, the boys fought Ola, the orc, to get her on their side so that they can get the deal.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
A confusing fight where much was espoused about love, who was in love with whom,

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Who is a better DM, patches or scratches, some body horror, dark sexual behavior, the things you expect from the show at this point.

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Almost, I think all of it.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're gonna have to run that back.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Can we bring Scratches back to talk about this?

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,120
However, the gang easily bested Ola and agreed to her offer over the walrus, which wasn't

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:49,320
so much an offer as much as a guarantee of two fish being a part of the equation at some

19
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,320
point.

20
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,160
However, once the boys left the arena, the strange, surreal, and frankly overwritten

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,200
feeling swept over them, as they realized that the nasty shaman Gigi and the prince,

22
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,880
whom they've neglected for some time, vanished during the fight.

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
What will they do?

24
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Who knows?

25
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,520
that's for sure all right so that's basically what happened so you guys are

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:18,640
sort of the first to recognize that the Prince Prince Jumanji is missing right

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,520
and was and so was the shaman those are the two facts you know everyone else is

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,840
kind of still like cheering you guys on is like so happy you made the deal it's

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,760
a big deal yada yada yada guys guys I'd all over here

30
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,980
Come here. I think the prince kidnapped the shaman. I thought they went separate ways. I thought they weren't even together. I don't

31
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,200
Did you guys want me in the huddle? Get that get out of here guys?

32
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:58,000
I think you get your wires crossed. I'm there's something. Oh god. What happened last night? My my brain is

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,520
is ruined

34
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Last night was a... Oh God!

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,520
Last night was a...

36
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,520
a scroll for real. I think the shop...

37
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
Real shit. Last night was a

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,520
scroll for real for real.

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Alright. Uh...

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Okay, so I'm gonna stand

41
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
just by everybody else. Yeah, we're just kidding. Get in the

42
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
huddle. Okay. Alright, get out of the

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
huddle. Alright, hold on. Here, you can get in the

44
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
huddle, but you gotta get in the middle.

45
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh, alright.

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
He does that.

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
We're gonna do something.

48
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:36,160
guys let's link arms and spin around him why cuz it'll scare him

49
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,160
I can hear all of these things

50
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,160
would you be scared if we spun?

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,160
if you spun around?

52
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,160
yeah you that is

53
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,160
I was in the tea tub

54
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,160
let's just go

55
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,160
I think I'll be alright

56
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,160
start spinning Sullivan

57
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,160
are you guys talking about everything

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,160
that'll show you Sullivan

59
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,160
I'm sorry

60
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,080
I think so we got to find the shaman or we got to find the boy. We have to rescue the shaman

61
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,480
We got to rescue the shaman from the boy. Cuz that is it. Here's the thing. We've been hanging out with him

62
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,100
He's a monster. We've been hanging out here for like two weeks most annoying kid in the world. He didn't really talk much

63
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,000
No, he didn't talk Sullivan

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,840
Weird though, I don't think he was like he's five

65
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,320
He's strong cuz he's a Nard, but I don't think he was you know, I mean

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,640
Better the situation he could be like 80 and Nard years. We don't really know. It's also not well

67
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,640
He was it was never like one of the guys

68
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,040
No

69
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,880
Me oh, yeah, I'm thinking of you. Okay. Yeah, just checking. Yeah

70
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:51,520
He should have been more careful. All right, here's my thing just gain a bunch of weight. No, we gonna pick you up

71
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,780
If you're big and fat and huge it's actually a good idea. Yes. All right. So once we get the kid

72
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,160
We're gonna feed him full of food. This will never happen again. Yeah, we're gonna that's a good plan. It's basically anchor him

73
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,960
Yeah, I don't know. All right. I'm not gonna say no to anything

74
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,780
All right, we got to figure out where this kid took this shaman though. Okay. Well, I was a kid

75
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:20,760
Probably the playground. Yeah, let's go candy store right now. I'm gonna go to a candy store

76
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,700
I mean, where would you go if you was a kid? Is there any we have a wizard?

77
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,100
We could ask him should I roll investigation or something?

78
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:37,220
Yeah, he's at the candy store

79
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:48,780
Yeah, it's totally at the candy store you like and like I think with your I think your intelligence is I'll double check I have

80
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,860
your

81
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,860
Shit up here, too

82
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,800
Yeah, so you're yeah, you got like well actually I should say cuz you chose the um

83
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,140
the

84
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
intelligence is the inquisitive feet

85
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:09,160
So I was really just for perception checks. Okay, so yeah, it's just a it's a five so with that I mean

86
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:16,140
You can see that they're not there. It's you can't really even make out. I can actually see well

87
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,060
Well you could just see that they're not there.

88
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:20,060
You could just see that they're not there.

89
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,340
I thought the candy store was far away.

90
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,340
I didn't know.

91
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:28,940
No, no, no, no, you could see that the two, the shaman and the nephew, that's what I'm

92
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,980
calling him, the nard, Prince Jumadjirn out there, that's really it though.

93
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,740
Like you can't really tell if there was a struggle or like where they would have went

94
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,740
or whatever.

95
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,980
Should I roll again?

96
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,980
I'm gonna roll.

97
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Okay.

98
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,260
Investigation here.

99
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,980
That's a 16.

100
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:45,420
Okay.

101
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,420
Plus what?

102
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,980
It's at 17 minus 1.

103
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,980
Okay cool.

104
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:55,300
So, yeah, I mean with a 16, yeah, so you, Patrick, Yodar, sort of walk in a small circle around

105
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:00,660
the group and you just sort of expand the circle and start to notice more things.

106
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,740
You see that, you can see, because it's an arena, it's sort of like a dusty floor, you

107
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,740
can see like, that there was like, some sort of like dust displacement, dust, dirt displacement,

108
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,260
like which you would be not happy about.

109
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,380
Yeah, I'm not happy about seeing that.

110
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,540
You're unhappy that this is up your alley.

111
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:19,260
I'm putting all the dirt back into the hole.

112
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:25,100
Yeah, and you could see that there was like, obviously, at some point there was dragging,

113
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,780
and then you see the tracks like stop suddenly towards like further down towards where the

114
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,660
exit is from this part of the arena.

115
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,980
But you see like a struggle at first and then it's just gone.

116
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,980
Okay, yeah.

117
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,180
What'd you see?

118
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,180
I don't know.

119
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,220
You've been investigating again.

120
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,460
I think they went out the exit.

121
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,060
Yeah, I didn't even think to look there.

122
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,560
They might have teleported though.

123
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,000
Can he do that?

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,960
Who?

125
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,640
What, the shaman? I mean, I have to imagine he's got some sort of magic, you know.

126
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,880
Oh, so now we're imagining stuff, is that it?

127
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,080
No, wait, no.

128
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,240
Why don't we use our actual brain?

129
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,120
Oh, no, I know, let's play pretend, that'll solve the problem.

130
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
That's a lot to solve.

131
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,760
Okay, Orc-Lock-Horns, go ahead, do your thing.

132
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:20,900
Alright, first of all, I only- I just finished- don't spoil anything, 'cause I just finished reading the fifth book in that series.

133
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,060
I mean, it is incredible.

134
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,100
It is phenomenal.

135
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,900
The twists, that orc lock.

136
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,900
He finds so much stuff.

137
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,820
Don't tell him, because I only got- I'm only a little bit behind.

138
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,820
And when they find out that it was the butler-

139
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,060
Oh my god- WAIT, WHAT THE HELL?!

140
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:38,180
Don't tell him which room or which weapon he used.

141
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:38,900
No.

142
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,260
Use the butterfly knife.

143
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,060
No.

144
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:41,620
How did you-

145
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,820
In the butterfly room.

146
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:49,140
You all read the book in the book. I'm yeah, that's what we did last night. All we did was sit up and we found it in your backpack

00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
Oh fuck, um, who knows? Who knows?

180
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,860
You do now.

181
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,860
Should we tell everybody?

182
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,860
No, now I'm implicated.

183
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,860
My son has been kidnapped!

184
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,860
You see everyone's like-

185
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,860
Andy's my son too!

186
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,860
Andy's Dogen's son also!

187
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,860
And that's okay!

188
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,860
Everyone's like, nodding, like,

189
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,860
"Okay, yeah, okay, okay."

190
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
You see Thorax kinda like,

191
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,860
like, hears that and is like, "Alright."

192
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,860
And looks around and like, looks away.

193
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,860
Thorax did it. Thorax doesn't really know what that means. Thorax definitely did it. He was the only one who acted differently.

194
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:46,780
So he's suspect number one. Not a bad point. I just thought you would be concerned if Thorax could tell or not, but

195
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,960
could tell whether we knew that he took the kid. And Thorax is his son,

196
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:59,020
too, and he's his son and my son. And we thank you for being here, Thorax. And we love you,

197
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,020
like, you're, we love you the most.

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,940
He's like looking around.

208
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,940
What did we have here?

209
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,940
We didn't really have anything but I'm scrolling through my contacts.

210
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,940
I don't know where he is.

211
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,940
God damn it.

212
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
What do you mean?

213
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,940
What about Giggy?

214
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,940
He stole my kid!

215
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940

Oh. Fuck.

219
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,240
Yeah.

220
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,040
Yeah.

221
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,740
It's what we said, like, a hundred times.

222
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,740
Oh. Okay. Uh...

223
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,440
A wizard says that you get it.

224
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,740
Fucking piece of shit.

225
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,240
No.

226
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,740

231
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,340
Sullivan, come over here.

232
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,140

Yeah, sure. Okay.

237
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,820
He's he's the rex like puts his hand on Sullivan's head and stop him from walking

238
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:38,000
He's like we're not gonna tell anybody else. Hey, Ted. Come here. Yeah, what do you want? Fuck you?

- What do my eyebrows do, what?

253
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,260
- Your eyebrow did a thing when I said the word kidnap.

254
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,300
- Come on, Tid, let's go.

255
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,380

I'm gonna bar his nose.

277
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,820
You have to-

278
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,820
You better-

279
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,140
If you don't take that dancing sponge idea off the table-

280
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,140
Alright, fine.

281
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
It already got sold.

282
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,140
We already sold it, man.

283
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Yeah, we don't give a cramp about that.

284
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
I flick his nose again.

285
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,140
You're not-

286
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,140
Stop flicking my nose!

287
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,140
You know, we-

288
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
You're not gonna do anything-

00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
You're not gonna do anything with it!

290
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Stop flicking my nose!

291
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,140
You're not gonna do anything with the dancing sponge idea!

292
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,140
Here.

293
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,140
I'm gonna do it.

294
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,140
I'm gonna do it.

295
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,140
I'm gonna do it.

296
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,140
I'm gonna do it.

297
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,140
I'm gonna do it.

298
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,820
- I'm not gonna do anything with the dancing sponge idea.

299
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,080
- Here, what if we gave you a different idea

300
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,920
that's 25 million times better?

301
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,740
- Yeah, we'll come up with an idea

302
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,780
that's way better than the dancing sponge right now.

303
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,620
- No!

304
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,460
- Dancing water.

305
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,940
- Give me my dancing sponge idea.

306
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,480
- Dancing water.

307
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,020
- How about a hot wing restaurant

308
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,660
where all the women working there got big ass boobs?

309
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,660
- All right, wait, hold on, that's my idea.

310
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,820
- You did not come up with that, I came up with that.

311
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,260
- You see him like, have like a

312
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,500
special moment alone in his heart

313
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,040
as the greatest business idea that's ever existed

314
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,620
just infected his mind.

315
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,460
- It's so smart.

316
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,840
- Comes raw from evil Sievel's brain like,

317
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,380
oh yeah, this would be a tight thing to have.

318
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:50,040
And he's like, you'll give me that idea?

319
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,340
- Consider it done.

320
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:53,060
- Okay.

321
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:56,560
You can flick my nose again at this point.

322
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,400
- No.

323
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,220
(laughing)

324
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,380
Enough flicking.

325
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:01,340
All I wanna flick is the truth.

326
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,140
- The shaman, he was getting a little antsy backstage.

327
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:10,620
He started talking about the terrifier this, that, he seemed like one of those, you know,

328
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,300
offshoots of the main church, kind of fanatic types.

329
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,420
Anyway, he started to grab the boy and...

330
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,940
Ah, he's a pedophile, goddammit.

331
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:23,820
Fortat and I tried to do something, but he pushed us away.

332
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:26,380
I was so pissed at you guys I didn't even want to tell you this.

333
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,700
And then he, I don't know, he must have cast something and sort of vanished away, and I

334
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,100
saw him a little bit down the ways, and I don't know where he went.

335
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,180
Which way down the ways? Did he cast a specific spell that lets you know where he was going?

336
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,020
Based on his description of like him

337
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:47,820
Teleporting basically like a short distance you would assume. It's like misty step or something

338
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:54,920
So some sort of like short distance teleportation spell that he's able to do quickly to just get him away from people

339
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,940
You wouldn't know what else he used but like like if you kept investigating down the way you would see like another

340
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:09,380
yeah so it's like and but but tip would be able to say um well um I mean I I

341
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,500
tried to go out and see where he was heading it looked like he was heading a

342
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,900
bit a bit further north in town okay all right I mean you gave me an amazing idea

343
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,420
I'm not gonna lie is that is that everything you need it's not even what a

344
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,020
flick sounds like yeah that's what it sounds like on his nose cuz he's like a

345
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
- Like a pig or something?

346
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,700
- I'm a goblin.

347
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,900
What the fuck?

348
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,940
- Yeah, there's like pig guy.

349
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,260
- He's a goblin.

350
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,980
- Oink, oink.

351
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,820
- We look the same.

352
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,620
- You guys here just oink, oink over and over again?

353
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,960
- Okay, well I told you what I know.

354
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,220
- All right.

355
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,180
- All right, I'm gonna just walk away.

356
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,980
- Now go, now go, listen. - Thank you for the idea.

357
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,980
- I do get to come on my table when I go to the restaurant.

358
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,460
- Horrible, but if this goes as well

359
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,040
I think it does of course you'll get to do that hold on and you got to clean it up like a

360
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,420
bartender's clothes and shop

361
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,060
Rubbing a rag into my cum

362
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:11,900
And that's all you know and that's the rule. I haven't okay fine. I had it's a really good idea

363
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,860
I have another idea. I can give you if you can tell me anything else

364
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:22,500
He's all out of June. I don't really know anything else, and I am all juice - the other guy tat when somebody juice this

365
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,880
Ted what did you do you see the same thing pretty much?

366
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:33,600
Yeah, I mean, I guess the only thing that I can maybe add if I could add anything to this would be that um

367
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:39,940
From my time in this in this city there are only

368
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:47,660
Okay, you're flicking my nose now. You know you I think I don't you you really hurt me last time so okay

369
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,820
There are there are

370
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,180
three main churches in this town

371
00:19:52,180 --> 00:20:01,820
and the only one that goes north is St. Anthony's Parish. The other two are

372
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:07,540
much bigger operations so if I had to guess where a fanatical terrifier type of

373
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,180
guy would be going he might be going to one of the smaller churches for the

374
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:19,580
terrifier. And for that I give you an idea half-price Tuesdays, half-price

375
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:26,240
wings on Tuesday happy hour I mean happy hour I mean whatever it was a wings are

376
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,860
half the kids the wings are half priced as well as the drinks I mean you guys

377
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,100
are assholes but the kid doesn't need to suffer I guess so it's great idea though

378
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,820
half price on happy hour I'll keep that in mind you think that was a good idea

379
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
I thought it was a really good idea.

380
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:47,260
Bitch.

381
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,980
So yeah, I mean you guys got some

382
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,140
information here.

383
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,320
All right, so to the candy store we go.

384
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,660
Yeah, you guys want to head to the church or do you want to verify the information or do you want to like check with

385
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,820
Fuck You spells? I believe him. I think we should go to the church. Yeah.

386
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,220
You think you want to head there? Yeah. Can we talk to Fuck You?

387
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:13,860
Mm-hmm. Does he have like a clairvoyant type thing? Yeah, he has some divination magic that you could use if you want to do that

388
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,100
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe

389
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:21,300
Talk to him. Hey, bitch. I mean fuck you. Yeah, well

390
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,220
What's up?

391
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,500
You have any type of

392
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:30,020
So there's like three churches in town. I just want to make sure we're going to the right one

393
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,680
Sarah any kind of fucking thing that you can do you have like maybe a spell where you know everything

394
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,940
No, right

395
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:43,620
They like a pill that you can take where you can use more than 10% of your brain that you take right now. Why?

396
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:50,360
Why which why to which one which question you better answer my question you got three seconds why?

397
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:57,340
If you can't answer the why it's not you're not very good at divination magic. Okay. Well because no wait

398
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,840
I don't have to answer that question. Okay, look, I can walk.

399
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,840
I can travel with you for a bit.

400
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,840
And then I have some spells that if I'm within the range, am I boring you?

401
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,840
Yawning? Am I boring you?

402
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
Nah, I don't know.

403
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:12,840
I just don't want to.

404
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,340
He puts yawning in front of me.

405
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:17,340
I mean, I don't give a crap about this wizard stuff. I just want to.

406
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,840
Okay, fine. Just let me travel with you and then I'll cast a spell.

407
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,340
I just want to find this kid so I can get. What do we get? Money or something?

408
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,840
You're going to get something from him.

409
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,460
Return the prince to the king is gonna be something probably some sort of reward, right?

410
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:37,920
Maybe he'll chop Sullivan's head off in a guillotine. Now that would be something and he gives us four seats

411
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:43,620
Now it suck for me. I didn't say I said it would be something. We could eat Sullivan's legs fried.

412
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,880
No!

413
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,880
No, that's also-

414
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,440
That hurt me in a specific way. Didn't you two used to be really nice to him?

415
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,840
This is how I'll change something so after that's that night when we partied and couldn't remember anything that happened for some reason

416
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,880
I hate him now. Yeah, I don't know why

417
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,920
To be in the same room. Yeah, it's just like I

418
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:06,680
Second of every day and maybe that'll change

419
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:14,000
After two more days, hopefully I'm I'm a superstar now so I get to treat people like shit. That's fair

420
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,920
I'm a musical super life. Well, hmm. Okay. Do we want to go to the church then?

421
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,680
Yeah, it's all of it. Okay. Yes, you guys walk to the church walk a bit north in the city

422
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,940
I

423
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,640
Would say that if you want like fuck you could cast

424
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,440
Clairvoyance

425
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,020
There's locate creature, but that's within a thousand feet which is like kind of a gamble

426
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm gonna give him like one opportunity to a divination spell. Okay, so that's a bit of a gamble

427
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
So, can we use it to locate the boy?

428
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Yeah, that's the thing. You can do it to locate the boy or the shaman, but it's only within a thousand feet.

429
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,000
So if you're not, you can go right next to the church and do it, and if you're wrong, then that's like your divination spell.

430
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:03,000
But, um, you could also, like, um, you know, cast clairvoyance, that's a mile long radiance.

431
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Yeah.

432
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:11,000
And that'll just give you, it'll basically just give you, like, a sensor that remains in the place of this area.

433
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:18,160
So like you can you can sort of know what's going on in the area, but I'm trying to think

434
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,160
of what other.

435
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,520
Do you think if I ask my God for guidance would he know anything?

436
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,880
Yes, and that's something he could also do.

437
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,880
He could give you guidance too.

438
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,000
Fuck you where he gives you like an extra d4 on that roll.

439
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,120
So if you want to do that.

440
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,280
I would say we can make that into a because you're a paladin we can make that like a straight

441
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,880
charisma check for getting guidance from your God.

442
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:43,880
I want to do something like that.

443
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:44,880
Should I do that?

444
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,880
I think like you'll get, I think like, you know, I'm being a little, being a little metagamey

445
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,760
here, but I would say like, let's say like you get to, consulting with your God is one

446
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,320
of the things that, that fuck you can like help you with.

447
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,000
And then if that works out, it works out.

448
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
If it doesn't, it doesn't.

449
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,080
But that doesn't cost the divination spell.

450
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,120
No, but that would cost, that would be like him giving you the divination spell.

451
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
Oh, okay.

452
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
All right.

453
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,960
- Yeah.

454
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,360
- Okay, I don't know.

455
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,120
- You can also like go to the church and investigate

456
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,960
and then get a divination spell too.

457
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,000
- Yeah, let's just go and investigate

458
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,400
and then figure out what to do from there.

459
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,120
- Yeah, I would say you could do that too.

460
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,720
So yeah, you guys can go to the St. Anthony's Parish.

461
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,720
The north end of town is a little--

462
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
- That's just a normal church name.

463
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,400
- Yeah, the north end of town,

464
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,400
well, there's three churches in the city.

465
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:37,320
There's, where is my,

466
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:43,620
Yeah, there's the Church of Horror, the Blood and Guts Cathedral, and then St. Anthony's Parish is the third.

467
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,620
[laughter]

468
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:47,620
So...

469
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,620
[laughter]

470
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:57,120
It's in the north end of town. It's a part of the larger collection of terrifier denominations.

471
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,320
It's a more mild one, but it's also the one that's least sort of like overseen.

472
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:10,820
So either weird stuff can happen there or too nice stuff can happen there, which is frowned upon by the church at large.

473
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,620
The north end of town is a little less developed than the south end.

474
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,620
Where the south end has a lot of high highs and low lows.

475
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:23,820
So you guys, where you are, you're sort of in the town center in the hotel, which happens to be the south end of town.

476
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,320
You know how sometimes towns are like the hub is in the south end.

477
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,120
That's sort of where you guys are, near those main churches.

478
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:35,120
And there's a lot of like really really rich members of the town and really really poor.

479
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,120
Here it's a little bit more like lower middle class, working class, kind of like solidly across.

480
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:49,120
It's developed around a few like-minded Terrafire-born who were careful to align themselves with the actual trading necessary to keep a city thriving.

481
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,120
So other people were just like killing and looting and fucking each other and this was a town that was like,

482
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,120
"What if we like grew plants and traded with other towns?" and that's how this got on the map more.

483
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,680
more. If it weren't for people like Kevin Ritterfin and some of the greedier officials, a place

484
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,740
like this would be thriving. For now, it's merely quaint with minimal bloodshed and even

485
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,720
fewer slaves. St. Anthony's Parish is the largest church in the area. So there's, you know,

486
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,280
there's smaller ones, but that's like the major church. So yeah, you guys approach the

487
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:22,840
church and you see like a, a, a doddering old, a, a yuan-tee. So they're like a snake people.

488
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:27,320
And you see them, you see them, you see him just sort of like raking the leaves out front

489
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:44,360
kind of like a jump in the leaf pile yeah yeah I woke up to my go what can I do to

490
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:54,480
help you boys you know that's not all we say I'm doing a leaf angel okay welcome

Big hostel

So basically we're looking for a child.

500
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,320
Two local celebrities.

501
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,840
Yeah, we're two celebrity men looking for a young boy.

502
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,840
And he looks at Sullivan and he's like, "A meal."

503
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,040
(laughing)

504
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,880
You can't eat him.

505
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,720
I'm just kidding.

506
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,840
Yeah, we're gonna eat him.

507
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
At the end of our adventure.

508
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,600
Oh, good, good.

509
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,200
He's like, "Oh, finders keepers, I see."

510
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,040
Yeah.

511
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,480
Yeah, this is him marinating.

512
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,640
We basically, we let him walk around with us

513
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,800
to like, so is his, you know, to get his meat ready.

514
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,440
Like so he gets lots of exercise.

515
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Yeah, in a couple days we're gonna...

516
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,440
We're gonna make it team jack.

517
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,440
We're gonna make it team jack.

518
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Extremely free range.

519
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,800
We're gonna break his legs and keep him in a cage so he gets real fat.

520
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Yeah.

521
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,120
We're basically gonna hold him upside down and tear him down the middle like a bone tomahawk.

522
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,280
And I'm gonna make an amazing sauce to go with this.

523
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,280
Yeah.

524
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,880
We're gonna let him marinate in our spit.

525
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,040
This is the...

526
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,040
Oh!

527
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,680
Don't, don't you dare wipe that off.

528
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
One second, I'll baste him.

529
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,960
It's all the flavors in there.

530
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,960
And I scoop the spit up.

531
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,960
Okay.

532
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Wait, why did I agree to that?

533
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,960
I scooped the spit up that dripped off him and I put it back on top of them like I'm basically

534
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
We'll do that every 10 minutes. Yeah

535
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,200
that's

536
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,600

You know, they have three

546
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Orc manatees?

547
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,060

549
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:48,060
Did you guys ever see that- that- that spin-off, Cleave Realm?

550
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,060
*snort*

551
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,060
The Cleave Realm show?

552
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,060
Nah, I didn't.

553
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:57,060
Yeah. I- I actually- but I- I haven't seen that one, but I did watch Orc American Dead.

554
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,560
*laughter*

555
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,060
So anyway...

556
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,560
That was fun.

557
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,060
Well...

558
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,560
Yes, he came back today.

559
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,560
He...

560
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
He did have, um...

561
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,060
A sack with him, but uh...

562
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:15,660
I got a sack on me check these out. He does have a humongous sack. Was the sack

563
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:24,220
saying... Was the sack saying little ass kid shit? It was wriggling around. Like a

564
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:31,380
little ass kid did? There's a chance there was... He... How long ago was this?

565
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:39,300
It was about an hour or so maybe. He he's always been weird. Is he gone or? He left

566
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:47,520
our parish to travel with Thorax. He said he was on a mission from from the

567
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:54,200
Terrifyer but I think he just wanted to loot. Who doesn't? Did he leave the... is he

568
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,400
still here? No he came in and he grabbed something and he left. What'd he grab?

569
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,040
A child. I don't know. I mean... Oh wait he had the child. Why don't you just look at

570
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,920
everything that's in the church and see whatever's not there.

571
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,080
- I guess I could check.

572
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,080
I haven't been, I haven't.

573
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,560
And you see he's like particularly just like rattled

574
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,440
by any form of questioning.

575
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,240
Like he's like getting a little, right?

576
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,080
And you see--

577
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,320
- You're not gonna die, right?

578
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,840
- You see sort of, I'm peeking out from like the church door

579
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,840
you see a very obviously human male wearing an orc mask

580
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,120
And you see him peek out and say,

581
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,800
"Psst, over here.

582
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,140
"What's that orc want?

583
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,360
"Psst, you guys wanna know what happened to Giggy?

584
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,040
"Come here, he doesn't know."

585
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,780
- Okay, so before we go over,

586
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,840
I get on all fours, like a table,

587
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,840
and I look up at one of them,

588
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,120
and I'm motioning to push the old man over.

589
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,640
(laughing)

590
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,020
- Now this guy's my friend.

591
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
C.

592
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
See? You guys would never do that with me.

593
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,960
Yeah, I would.

594
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
7.

595
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
It's not even it. It's not even close.

596
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
I don't remember how. How do you do it again?

597
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
He just reacts to anyone doing C.

598
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
He gets very excited.

599
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,960
I can't roll my S's. My bad.

600
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
C.

00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Senior.

602
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
C.

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
Okay.

612
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:20,780
Gilbert Arenas. I'll take it. Um, Giggy is a bad dude. Thank you for saying that

613
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:30,340
Gilbert Arenas? I can try to I think I know where he went. There's a small

614
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:40,300
temple about an hour north of here that's a a Kaiju Manji baby skeleton and

615
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:45,980
it's a place of worship and I've been seeing a lot of the weirder members of

616
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,660
our church go in and out of there a lot but I just don't want to be implicated in

617
00:34:51,660 --> 00:35:00,540
this and you won't be Gilbert arenas I mean okay I can try to I have a I mean

618
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:04,180

619
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,820
like a room like I have like a map as he's walking away I grab his mask off I

620
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,940

621
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:25,380
okay this guy's weird. You don't understand, they make me wear it or they say they'll eat me.

622
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:32,860
Okay, you weird. The people who work here are gonna eat you. Not the people who work, just the people, just a lot of a lot of

623
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,180
people a lot of people in Gal Gadot do not like that I'm human but I was raised

624
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:41,380
here and I just have to wear this mask forever. If someone would say it's like I

625
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,380
I put my fingers like under the mask.

626
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,740
(gagging)

627
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,120
- That hurt my mouth.

628
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,100
(laughing)

629
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,180
- I think wearing masks is like a prison.

630
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,140
(laughing)

631
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,660
I think people who, I think if you force people to do it.

632
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,500
- Right, yeah.

633
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,140
No, people should not be forced to wear masks.

634
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,020
- Absolutely not. - Absolutely not.

635
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,420
No, it's a form of oppression.

636
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,260
- I think so too.

637
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,500
- And it's disgusting.

638
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,980
- Yes. - I've been saying that.

639
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,380
- And you get sick if you put it on

640
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:08,780
because it circulates micro bacteria.

641
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,620
- Yeah, and when you take it off, it's healthy.

642
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,980
- I had a funny idea when I came up with it,

643
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,980
I'm seeing the synergy and I'm very excited.

644
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Um, oh here, let me just go get my map.

645
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,980
Plus you can't eat with him on.

646
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,980
Yeah. You see him, as he's walking away he's like,

647
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,980
"That too?" He's like wiggling his finger.

648
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,980
He comes back with a map.

649
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,980
I make a mask.

650
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,980
You make a mask? Out of some

651
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,980
cloth from my shirt.

652
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,980
Let's just do an

653
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,980
intelligence check.

654
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:38,980
And then I guess a dexterity check.

655
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,260
I like to combine my checks.

656
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:47,620
Intelligence is an 11.

657
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,620
Dexterity you said?

658
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,620
8.

659
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,620
8?

660
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,100
Okay, it's not a good mask.

661
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:58,700
It covers for some reason just one of your cheekbones and part of your eye.

662
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:02,340
So it's just kind of a cloth in the way.

663
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,020
You like my mask?

664
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,740
Take that thing off man.

665
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,460
I just wanted to see if Gilbert or Venus...

666
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,460
Bend the knee.

667
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,460
Ah, cramp.

668
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
All these people want you to wear masks here.

669
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:16,460
Look, okay, here.

670
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,460
I don't want to see you with a diaper on your face ever again.

671
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
It wasn't supposed to be, it was supposed to look like him.

672
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,460
Take that diaper off.

673
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,460
We get it, you pooped your mouth.

674
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,460
It was supposed to look like him, I wanted to impress him.

675
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,460
Speaking of him pooping his mouth, he has to roll to see if his bronze butthole kills him.

676
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,460
We're keeping that, that's true.

677
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:40,260
no i don't know if it's a little reacts that it really is that we thought we did

678
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,300
ok

679
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,460
you can roll just just to see what would have happened

680
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,580
and if he dies in the you've got to get it doesn't know you would have been

681
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:50,100
fine okay

682
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,860
yeah

683
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,180
okay anyway

684
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:55,740
you would have been fine but you're always fine

685
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,540
so yeah he's like i i think it's a nice mask uh... uh...

686
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:06,260
you're flipping us off of the camera for the for the so anyway

687
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,260
You like my mask?

688
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,260
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

689
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,340
I mean, you could roll an inside check.

690
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:13,620
You don't even have to, but you certainly could.

691
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,620
Four.

692
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,020
Yeah, you think he likes the mask, I guess.

693
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:18,380
Yeah, you believe him.

694
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,380
Yeah.

695
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,580
I'm just, I'm like putting my fist in the air, like end of Breakfast Club style.

696
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,820
Yeah, just like, look, look, just, just please, please don't mention me if you run into him

697
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,820
or see him there or see his-

698
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
What was your name again?

699
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:31,820
Gilbert Arenas.

700
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,820
Right, okay.

701
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Okay.

702
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,980
Gilbert Arenas to any of those people.

703
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,020
We won't go up to them and say, "Gilbert Arenas."

704
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,280
- We gotta let them know his new name.

705
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,180
- That's true, okay.

706
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,140
We'll go up to them and we'll say,

707
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,980
just so you know-- - You remember--

708
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,800
- Why do you have to let them know anything about--

709
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,640
- No, no, no, we'll say,

710
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:47,700
well, listen, listen, listen, hey, calm down, calm down.

711
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,540
We're gonna go up there, we're gonna say--

712
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,060
- We need to know what name not to say.

713
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,340
- Yeah, well, there's a guy you know named--

714
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,860
- Gil, Gilbert. - You guys,

715
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,180
there's a guy named Gil.

716
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,580
- Gilliam. - He's not involved with this.

717
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,420
- Anything-- - Plus, his name is--

718
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,420
His name is Gilbert Arenas now, so...

719
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
Mm-hmm.

720
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
Just so you know when you go back.

721
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,420
Yeah, we're not gonna, and we're letting you know that we're not gonna say that name.

722
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,420
We didn't see him. We actually saw it on a bulletin board, so we don't even know who he is.

723
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:11,420
Yeah, he's changed his name and he needs to be on the bulletin board for at least two weeks.

724
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,420
Yeah, we saw it on some kind of wanted poster.

725
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,420
For helping us.

726
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Yeah.

727
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
I'm so fucked.

728
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,420
We're just kidding, man.

729
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:24,420
So you guys can, like, go talk to Fuck You if you want, and want to do a divination thing too.

730
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,620
to just, oh sorry, talk to fuck you if you want to do a divination thing to just to check for

731
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:34,180
something else or double check things and make sure you know what's going on or you can start

732
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:39,940
your trek up north outside of Gal Gadot to this baby kaiju manji skeleton temple.

733
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,500
So yeah, you guys can talk to fuck you, see if you want to do that, scry.

734
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,700
Yeah, do we want to scry?

735
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,740
Do we want to wait and save our spell until we get to the other temple?

736
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,100
I think we wait and save our spell.

737
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,060
That's what I was thinking too.

738
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,620
I'm not going to blow my load on this first fucking place dude.

739
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,160
Yeah, true. Come on, bro. That's right. All right, cool. So you guys walk

740
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,780
About an hour's north further north. You're kind of outside the Gal Gadot city limits

741
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:08,160
You start to see some of the more agrarian settlements that have you know kind of cropped up around there

742
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,420
and

743
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:17,420
You as you're following the map, you know, it's it's it's kind of going around like a cliffside to like sort of a

744
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,180
little bit more of a like a

745
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:27,100
wet or darker part of the like near like sort of a long river. Can I spit in it to see how tall the cliff is?

746
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,400
Yeah, okay

747
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,340
I

748
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:37,540
Took another step 100 200 feet. Okay between 100 and 200 between 100 feet and 200

749
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:40,860
You can that's as much as you can tell you can buy. I that's like the worst guess ever

750
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,900
between a hundred and two hundred

751
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,740
Could be 150 feet. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I know. Yeah, that's pretty apparent

752
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,580
And as you guys around that you see

753
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,760
Sort of like you haven't seen many of the kaiju manji

754
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,300
Skeletons or skeletal body parts and sent a lot of them seem to have been at some point either

755
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:07,540
Magically through Ola or just like by happenstance because it's like built on a gravesite of these things all in the city

756
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:13,280
Constraint the city, but you start to see a few more of these bones and then you see

757
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,980
Further along now, it's sort of it's kind of plateaued as you walk around this cliff

758
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:28,220
a like full like baby kaiju manji skeleton sitting like cross-legged and

759
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:33,220
it's holding its head and its head its mouth is like open you could see that

760
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,100
like rock and stone have been built around this and within this thing to

761
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:43,860
make it into a center of some kind long long abandoned again kaiju manji have

762
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:47,860
not really been worshipped properly for a long time I guess it's abandoned so

763
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:53,620
probably should head back yeah I figure I think we've reached the end of town and

764
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,820
we got to go home yeah I think we should cry I think I think we maybe should cry

765
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:15,140
yeah what is that what do we

766
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,420

767
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,060

00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,140

Yeah, me too! I was doing impression of me also!

778
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,880
Um, you see, uh, fuck you's just like

779
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,160
watching this happen.

780
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,420
Just like, all of you just like, "Okay, um, do you guys want to, uh,

781
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,540
go in there, or... I'm gonna..."

782
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:06,500
Can you, can we, like, do the spell now to see how many people are in there?

783
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,660
Yeah, I mean, we could try to do...

784
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:10,100
Okay, they might...

785
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,680
If they're...

786
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,300
They might sense my magic.

787
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:16,580
You didn't tell us that shit!

788
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:18,580
Oh come on.

789
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,580
Do a secret spell.

790
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,580
Screw on a different silence spell.

791
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,580
Yeah, that's on your staff.

792
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,580
If I do silence, they would notice that too.

793
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,580
Have you seen John Wick? You know the scene when the two guys are going through the subway and they're shooting at each other?

794
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,580
Yeah, it's a cool scene.

795
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,580
Is that common in Keanu in the second one?

796
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,580
I don't remember. That might be in the third one.

797
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,580
Is it in the third one when Common and Keanu fight?

798
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,580
I don't know.

799
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:52,700
see them do a song together. So in America I think. Um, what does that have to do with

800
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:59,380
this? Well do that with a spell so that nobody can tell. Do that with a spell so nobody can

801
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,260
tell. That seems sick. Or you will go to hell. Oh my god. And that will be so swell. I know

802
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:07,860
some people with record labels, I think we gotta get you. The point of that is that the

803
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:12,940
other person notice that knows what's going on not the way I remember I just

804
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,220
cast a spell I don't care if they know we're here all right fine one way out of

805
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:21,060
this place okay so surely wait wait you're right there is one way out of

806
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:25,460
that place we could maybe set something up we could set a trap or something you

807
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:29,820
could put a bunch of oil and lighter we could fill I guess the kids in there

808
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,380
never mind watch this I got a great idea do you have a pencil or a piece of

809
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:42,380
a charcoal? Um, let's just check your inventory. Do you have some painting supplies? Me? I

810
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:51,540
think you have, you have a flask of oil. Oil paint. Oil paint, yeah, that's a thing. You

811
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:57,620
just make some paint out of the oil. Oh, you're trying to do a Looney Tunes? I'm trying to,

812
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:02,060
what's that? But yeah. Oh, what's that? He says John Wick, I can't say Looney Tunes? I

813
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:06,620
in a hypnotic to frozen state John wick exists in this because it's John wick

814
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:11,620
exists in this because it's fantasy to them it's like you know you got no

815
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:15,940
deterrents though that shit yeah well yeah we're all loony toots here

816
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:25,140
la la la I wasn't talking in game - well you clocked me and I'm giving up on my

817
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,220
I dream of Looney Tune-ins, so hmm.

818
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,220
Cast a spell.

819
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:33,420
Okay, so which one, do you want to do locate creature,

820
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,060
or do you want to do the one where he has like the

821
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:37,780
sort of sight for the area?

822
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Can, is there like, for the sight for the area,

823
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,780
would be, we'd be able to see like how many people

824
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:45,420
are inside and get like a idea of what's going on inside.

825
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,980
Also, could we identify that the boy is one of the

826
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:49,940
people that we see?

827
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:53,260
Yeah, I mean, that's, let me see something, so.

828
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:57,540
Yeah, because I feel like, well I feel like, yeah, I also, I want to know what the boys

829
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,860
there but I also want to know if there's going to be like a hundred people in there before

830
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,860
we go in.

831
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:03,860
That's what I'm kind of worried about.

832
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:09,380
So let me, because there are ways to like, to do that.

833
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:14,740
I want to make sure that I'm like getting the right spell.

834
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,140
Trying to think, because if it's not divination that would have this, there's definitely something

835
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:26,020
where you can see like within something and see like a group of like see who's in there.

836
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,020
I mean I guess.

837
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,020
Kind of Scry right?

838
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:30,820
Yeah it's kind of like Scry.

839
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:32,780
I mean I guess Scry kind of takes care of that.

840
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,060
Let me make sure that it does though.

841
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:39,940
I want to I haven't like I feel like I very rarely deal in divination so you can see in

842
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:43,620
here a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane of existence as you.

843
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:46,340
Target must make a wisdom saving throw yada yada yada yada yada yada yada.

844
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,060
If a target knows you're casting the spell, it could fail.

845
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,060
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

846
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,140
Oh, so we could scry the... we can scry Jumanji.

847
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,140
Yeah, exactly.

848
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,140
Okay, yeah.

849
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,940
Why don't we just do that to begin with?

850
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,340
Won't we just be able to see wherever he is, then?

851
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:01,340
Yeah.

852
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,340
Do you want to just do scry?

853
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:03,340
Yeah.

854
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,340
I think, like, I think, um...

855
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:09,780
Yeah, I guess I was trying to avoid giving you that ability, but we could do it now.

856
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,100
Well, we went through a whole thing.

857
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,100
You guys went through a whole thing.

858
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,100
We went through hell.

859
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:14,100
Yeah.

860
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,100
That's right.

861
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,460
I feel like there's got to be a lighter version of Skry. DM me on Discord, please, if you know that.

862
00:47:20,460 --> 00:47:30,060
Let's have him... I mean, he's not going to resist. So, we can have him Skry. He's crying.

863
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:37,660
He's crying. He's crying. And you see, fuck you, his eyes turn sort of gray.

864
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:42,700
And he's seeing something. Stop the spell!

865
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,700
And he's like, "Oh, oh, oh.

866
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,700
Okay."

867
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:54,700
He's scared by me now, because he's like, "What's...

868
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:57,700
I know now that someone else is watching me."

869
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,700
Um, he's surrounded by many shaman.

870
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,700
Um...

871
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,700
Many shuns?

872
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,700
Shaman.

873
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
Ah, I thought you said shuns.

874
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:11,580
I mean they could I how many we talking

875
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,060
six shans

876
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,560
shaman

877
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:16,740
seven

878
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:19,440
ten ten shaman Jesus

879
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,700
They're all in a circle

880
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,940
There's some

881
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:29,560
They're not doing a ritual are they? Oh, that's a ritual

882
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:34,820
I'm dude. I've seen a lot of ritual

883
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,460
They didn't draw nothing on the floor, right

884
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:46,620
If you look me in the eyes

885
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:52,000
Trying there. I can't really see you right now blink if they got a candle

886
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:58,140
We should just go home

887
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:01,940
Are they are they in there? Can you see what I?

888
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,540
I mean, I can't get the sense of their location, but um...

889
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,540
Well, what does it look like where they are?

890
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:09,540
Does it look like the inside of a skull?

891
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:10,660
It's very dark.

892
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,460
And horrible.

893
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,460
Can you tell them to put the candle brighter?

894
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,660
Um...

895
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,660
No.

896
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,260
That kind of sounded like he can do that.

897
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:20,060
Yeah.

898
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,460
You can make the candle brighter with that?

899
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,060
You better not be holding out on us.

900
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:24,660
I'm not holding out on you. I can't...

901
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,060
If you don't feel like doing it, that's fine, but it would be very helpful.

902
00:49:28,060 --> 00:49:30,060
Yeah, just say you don't feel like doing it.

903
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:32,900
Let me just try to get a better look and I don't know how much...

904
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:35,900
I don't want the boy to freak out and then freak them out.

905
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,220
So just give me...

906
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,220
Okay.

907
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:40,380
So what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to roll for him.

908
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,300
Wait, does Scry...

909
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:43,300
So Scry...

910
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,300
Does Scry include sound?

911
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,620
Yes, it does.

912
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:50,260
Okay, somebody make a really loud noise that doesn't sound suspicious.

913
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:52,540
Oh wait, I can use...

914
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,540
Can I use...

915
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:56,360
Thaumaturgy can make thunder, right?

916
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,540
I use Thaumaturgy to make thunder.

917
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,780
if you were there the sensor moves with the target the creature can see

918
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:05,020
invisible objects sees the sensors luminous orbits okay so actually here's

919
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:10,460
the thing he can and you can't use a spell against okay so what do you

920
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,660
actually can do is you're my awesome solution you can move it around sorry

921
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,700
what was your awesome solution if I can hear what scribe that I can use

922
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,460
thaumaturgy to make thunder where we are and then if you can hear it then I'll

923
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:23,620
know there well I don't know if you can you it's not like a conduit like pretty

924
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,060
clever though it's really cool I wish I was idea yeah but so what he can do is

925
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:28,900
- It should happen.

926
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,820
- It's existing like other divination spells,

927
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,060
similar to clairvoyance, where it's like,

928
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,320
you're like an orb that is like floating around,

929
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,700
and if somebody has like true sight, they could see it,

930
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,580
but if they don't, which none of these shaman

931
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,160
would have any reason to have true sight on, to be honest.

932
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:43,420
So he can move it around.

933
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,860
So he's moving it around the space, and he's like,

934
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:47,860
okay, okay, go get the matchbook.

935
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:52,300
All right, what I'm seeing here is, I can't get anything.

936
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,620
Oh God.

937
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,740
There's a lot of blood here.

938
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,660
And there's...

939
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,380
people's...

940
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:08,060
private parts? Faces. Oh.

941
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,340
Rolled out like rolling pins and plastered on the walls.

942
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:17,500
That's kinda cool. Wow, yeah. And that's downstairs of this building? Wait, I think I know that bar.

943
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,020
Let me try to get out of this room.

944
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:25,020
Okay, a darker room.

945
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:28,060
I see myself! Okay, it's here! I see myself too!

946
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,580
Okay, and you see he snaps back in.

947
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:34,620
There's one room, a much larger chamber, very dark, very hard to see.

948
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,540
Beyond that is that room.

949
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:38,340
Where they have the boy.

950
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:40,980
And there's ten shaman in there.

951
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:46,340
Now can you, you can, can you scry the candy store just to see if he's there?

952
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:52,660
I don't, I don't know. So I mean, I could try to scry the candy man.

953
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:57,120
who works there he's gonna be able to you can have a plus five of resistance i

954
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,320

You can't make fun of me, I'm not the frog.

974
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,100
You literally, you like dirt.

975
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,100
I don't like dirt anymore.

976
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,100
I like Oreos now.

977
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:23,100
You just got exposed, put you on blast, you used to like dirt.

978
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:28,100
I'm being defeated before my eyes.

979
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:30,100
I'm just walking into the...

980
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,100
Walking in? Okay, yeah.

981
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,100
Yeah, you're just walking towards it.

982
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,100
So you guys are going towards it, I mean...

983
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,100
So you guys are walking towards it, I mean you're doing it stealthily, I imagine?

984
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,100
Yes.

985
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:42,100
Everyone roll stealth checks.

986
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:44,100
Including Mr. Sullivan.

987
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,100
My first roll is fucking useless.

988
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,100
I know, it's a very talky talky one.

989
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,100
Yeah.

990
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:52,100
Okay, Sullivan.

991
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,100
Alright. Okay.

992
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:58,100
Got a...

993
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:02,100
I got a 7.

994
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,100
I got a dirty 20.

995
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:06,100
Nice. Sullivan's is not too good.

996
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Sullivan got a 5.

997
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:09,100
Okay, nice.

998
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:10,100
Plus or minus anything?

999
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,100
It's none of your business, I got 13.

1000
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,100
Yeah, and I am ignoring armor modifiers.

1001
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,100
Nobody's gonna care about that.

1002
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,100
Goddamnit, 7, that's supposed to be my strong suit.

1003
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,100
Goddamnit.

1004
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:26,100
Okay, so you guys walk in, some of you a little bit more loudly than the others.

1005
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,100
We'll resolve that, though.

1006
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,100
I'm singing the Candyman song.

1007
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,100
Like, humming it under your breath, but like, too loud.

1008
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:36,100
'Cause you want other people to hear how well you sing, kind of thing?

1009
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:42,640
kind of thing yeah it's a vast chamber it's like very very dark um actually

1010
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,980
Patrick Jodar because you lack dark vision you are like virtually blind in

1011
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,860
here - I didn't know I lacked that yeah it's a weird thing that Verdans don't

1012
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,760
have it but they don't I think I have dark yeah you both do have dark vision

1013
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,700
and I think so does mr. I think mr. the frog does mr. the frog have it I don't

1014
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,700
He's wearing eye patches so he doesn't have any vision.

1015
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,700
He's got no vision.

1016
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:07,700
He's got no vision. Yeah, he I don't think has it either.

1017
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,700
So you're both, maybe that's why you're both did so poorly.

1018
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,700
You both don't have dark vision.

1019
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,700
That makes sense.

1020
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,700
For those of you who can see a bit in front of you, so you too.

1021
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:20,700
You can tell by the way your armor is clinking and your footsteps echo that you're in an atrium of some kind.

1022
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,700
Beneath your feet is like tile flooring.

1023
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,700
You can feel the crunch of debris below your feet.

1024
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:30,700
See the occasional scurrying of rats between discarded pews, stone, and disfigured statues.

1025
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:37,920
As you get closer to some of the statues, you see that they resemble some of the kaiju manji that you saw within like different, you know

1026
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,880
You know symbols and just other like paraphernalia or whatever in Gal Gadot, right?

1027
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:49,260
Just the general vibe there, except that they were free. They retain their flesh, right? They're not just bones

1028
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:56,880
They look like full kaiju manji, like kaiju, but they're also like made anthropomorphized and like wearing like aristocratic

1029
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:00,440
Garb so it's um basically like

1030
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:07,040
Mimicking the style probably of the time of like higher ups. So it's like playing dress-up with your gods, basically

1031
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:13,800
You could see a faint light ahead and hear some mild humming and chanting as well

1032
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,600
But it's you know much further down passing that other room

1033
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,680
with those

1034
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,680
lower things

1035
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:33,400
With those lower sneak rolls, so you humming the Candyman and Sullivan just now I'm just fully testing the acoustics of the

1036
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:44,640
And so it's it's all it's like try to sing harmony like

1037
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:47,680
shutting him up like

1038
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:52,080
This boy needs a mouth patch - and you hear

1039
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,840
what sounds like

1040
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:55,880
flames.

1041
00:56:55,880 --> 00:56:58,480
Yeah, me singing.

1042
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:59,480
Fuck, what's up?

1043
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,480
Damn.

1044
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:02,980
That, all the way down in that

1045
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:04,560
room where you hear the chanting,

1046
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:05,560
you see a much

1047
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,000
brighter light kind of

1048
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,200
coming in from the right,

1049
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,760
down that long hallway.

1050
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,280
And you see like.

1051
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,400
And then you see the

1052
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:17,640
profile of a giant

1053
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:20,040
flaming skeleton head,

1054
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,720
and then you see it facing

1055
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,720
forward and then you

1056
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,700
see it rushing down the hallway and you hear it go as it comes towards you sorry

1057
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:32,460
for everyone hearing that and you guys gonna have to roll initiative as it's

1058
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,640
rushing into this giant oh my god

1059
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:52,020
nice job so 16 6 that's a 9 yes good the dot on the bottom I'm having terrible

1060
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:53,500
- The dot on the bottom is a six.

1061
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,340
- What?

1062
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:55,160
- 18.

1063
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:57,140
- If it's a bottom by bottom, you mean the circle?

1064
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,900
- No, that's a nine.

1065
00:57:58,900 --> 00:57:59,740
- What do I--

1066
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,560
- Oh, is it?

1067
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,400
- Yeah, that's how it works.

1068
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,240
The dot means that it's--

1069
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,060
- Oh, shit.

1070
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:03,900
- Have you been doing this wrong forever?

1071
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,980
- Oh, wait, it's not even a nine, then it's a--

1072
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:08,340
- I thought the dot on the bottom meant

1073
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,300
that's where the bottom--

1074
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:10,140
- It's a 12.

1075
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:10,960
- Yeah, that's where the bottom is.

1076
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,460
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is a nine.

1077
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,580
- Oh, no, when he said bottom, my first thought was circle.

1078
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,420
- Oh.

1079
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:19,260
- That's not the bottom of a nine.

1080
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:20,100
- I was--

1081
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:20,940
- It's the bottom of a six though.

1082
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:22,820
- I was thinking it's the bottom of that shape.

1083
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:23,660
This is what I was thinking.

1084
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,100
- Now that is a very good point.

1085
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:25,940
- I apologize.

1086
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:27,900
- It is very dependent on which one

1087
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,740
you would consider the bottom.

1088
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:31,220
- Yeah, this was like, just like a needless conversation.

1089
00:58:31,220 --> 00:58:32,780
- You have to know which number it is

1090
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,620
to know which number it is.

1091
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,620
- Yeah, okay cool.

1092
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:35,440
So.

1093
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,280
- So it's a 12.

1094
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,460
'Cause I forgot to add my.

1095
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,300
- You got a 12?

1096
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,120
Okay cool.

1097
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,000
- Forgot to add my initiative.

1098
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,420
- So we got a 12 from Patridge.

1099
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:44,700
- 18 over here.

1100
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,420
- 18 from you.

1101
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:47,420
- 16.

1102
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:48,260
- That's very good.

1103
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:49,100
- Even number?

1104
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,600
16 that's good too.

1105
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,600
Wow.

1106
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:54,600
16.

1107
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,600
17.

1108
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:56,600
17.

1109
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,600
Dogen.

1110
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,600
16.

1111
00:58:58,600 --> 00:58:59,600
18.

1112
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:00,600
Evil got 16.

1113
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:01,600
At the mall?

1114
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,600
Mr. the Frog.

1115
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:03,600
Oh it's called 17.

1116
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:04,600
16.

1117
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:05,600
Mr. the Frog.

1118
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,600
Life begins after school.

1119
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,600
Mr. the Frog got.

1120
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,600
That's when we bend all the rules.

1121
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,600
Mr. the Frog got a dirty 20.

1122
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:11,600
Wow.

1123
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:12,600
I don't know how he does it.

1124
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,600
16.

1125
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:14,600
Okay cool.

1126
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:15,600
Alright.

1127
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:16,600
So.

1129
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:30,840

1130
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:36,520
cast a fairy fire on this guy as he's freaking out out of his mind so this guy

1131
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:42,120

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,080
That's why he's hiding in the cave all the time. Oh God.

1135
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:59,480
Oh God. Is that really his? Oh, well, I'll solve it.

1136

He's like very, very ashamed.

Um, he feels very weird and embarrassed.

01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,280
so for credit you're gonna do double damage obviously still if divine smite

1167
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:21,400
you can do to

1168
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:25,940
yes i mean that is that double as well as it does add a lot of it on to the

1169
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:26,880
area

1170
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,300
uh... i'm not going to use it if it doesn't also don't pretty sure that i

1171
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:32,300
might double me double check

1172
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,140
i'd i'd need to look at how divine smite works

1173
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:37,180
i don't think that's true though uh...

1174
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:39,620
swindy ten

1175
01:01:39,620 --> 01:01:43,680
yet this is a common question i feel like it's been around

1176
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,320
uh... to get his your crew will happen in an opportunity

1177
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:51,900
that's why even divides made us double weapon damage and divine smite damage

1178
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,620
for your behalf work

1179
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:55,980
rake it's a criticism on spells as a total

1180
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:57,140
all shit

1181
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,960
that is fucking nuts it does so that works

1182
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,580
so because basically and i bet this is an undead or fiend right

1183
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:07,540
you bet it all my god yeah okay i'm i'm not a little bit you double all damaged

1184
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:11,220
ice associated with the attack yet the whole world is a little like that so it's

1185
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:13,820
a little bit to plus plus sixty eight

1186
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:16,860

1219
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:42,560
i mean he just starts running at dogan

1220
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,680
dogan punches him

1221
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:44,840
we just hear like a

1222
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,100
(laughter)

1223
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:49,820
- What the, you hear something?

1224
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,640
- It got bright in here for a second.

1225
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:52,780
- Yeah, what was that?

1226
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,460
You light a match?

1227
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:56,140
- I don't know, it was pretty much nothing.

1228
01:03:56,140 --> 01:03:57,460
- You could solve it, it didn't even.

1229
01:03:57,460 --> 01:03:58,960
- Good job, Togan.

1230
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:00,020
(snorting)

1231
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:01,860
- Alright, shit, okay.

1232
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:05,840
- Yeah, I mean, that was so cool.

1233
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,680
That was like solving, like putting a T on a T-ball.

1234
01:04:08,680 --> 01:04:11,220
And then you just fucking crushed it.

1235
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:12,320
That rocked.

1236
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,480
Yeah, I mean, that's that mattress, man.

1237
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:20,920
that's he's just dead you guys can keep going into the for the chamber. Hey let's just keep

1238
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:27,560
walking into this I mean there's no one bad here yet yeah yeah um so yeah as you guys walk in

1239
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:37,480
um you see uh the swirls swirls of like magic and light sort of grow in size way down in the hallway

1240
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:44,760
um the main chamber of this temple is like adorned with blood and hanging ornaments of skulls and

1241
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:50,920
bones and cooked flesh and masks of death faces frozen in horror unfrozen

1242
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:55,280
re-frozen made to decay and smell and then blown up and plastered on the walls

1243
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,360
like why me saw or fuck you saw you hear laughter too like a magical laughter

1244
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:06,680
similar to the jesters to other dark creatures or critters within the world

1245
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:11,280
other villainy just echoing off of the walls ears are ringing you guys are like

1246
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,760
Like, inside- when you guys walk in here, you guys are like, kind of brought to your knees

1247
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,840
by just the sheer, like, weight of like, awfulness here.

1248
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:26,520
You see this circle of- of- of shaman, um, sitting and chanting.

1249
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:31,720
Their eyes are like blood red, they're like, filled with like, rage or like- or like, uh,

1250
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,720
lust.

1251
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,720
It's horrible.

1252
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:40,160
Um, and- and- and for the faintest moment, it's like the end of dreams, the end of joy.

1253
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:47,600
the total annihilation of ease, you feel the terrifier for the first time in generations,

1254
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:49,320
very faintly.

1255
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:56,000
And the second you have that feeling, you see Giggy, his face painted, he disrobes.

1256
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
"Aww, what?"

1257
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,560
"Hey, put that back on, what the hell?"

1258
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,560
"Oh my god."

1259
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:06,440
"There's a child in the room and you're showing, you are a freak, you're one of the worst guys."

1260
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:09,880
I wonder what the what the kind of guy would come up with something like this

1261
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:16,700
What kind of horrible pedophile God would invent this situation

1262
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:20,400
It's just not right it's just

1263
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:25,120
It's it's one of the worst things I've ever heard

1264
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:30,120
I'm so sad.

1265
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:35,120
Giggy screeches, "BLOODLETTING!"

1266
01:06:35,120 --> 01:06:41,120
And all of these shamans start tearing into each other's flesh, attacking each other.

1267
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:46,120
They're trying to scare each other too, for some reason. It's like the terrifier. They're trying to make each other scared.

1268
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:53,120
The glyph in the center starts to turn multiple colors, shifting in and out until it settles on a vanta black

1269
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:59,840
That absorbs all the flying particles flesh wet blood you feel like a epic dryness sort of like seep into the room

1270
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:01,920
Fuck you guys. Fuck you guys

1271
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,480
Seems an epic dryness has appeared

1272
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:12,080
Epic dryness dry dry right? It was super

1273
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:18,680
Feeling wet before but now I'm dry epic style. Yeah, you felt wet when that guy disrobed

1274
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:23,240
No, let's keep doing that instead. Yeah.

1275
01:07:23,240 --> 01:07:23,740
No.

1276
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:24,540
Okay.

1277
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,940
If the kid wasn't here, I'd say something very bad to you.

1278
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:37,440
Um, the glyph itself begins to swirl and warp until it swallows up this, like, crying, sad form in the middle that is young Prince Jumanji.

1279
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:41,840
And he sees you guys, and he goes, "Guys!"

1280
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:47,540
And then, like, the fucking glyph, like, swallows him up, sinks him down.

1281
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:51,740
And in the midst of all this only one shaman remains alive after all the

1282
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:57,620
bloodshed. It's Giggy. He's lying on the ground near death because someone took

1283
01:07:57,620 --> 01:08:01,260
it just a huge chunk out of his jugular and he is just like holding it and

1284
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:09,060
almost dying. And the kid's gone. I turned to them and I went, "That was not good.

1285
01:08:09,060 --> 01:08:12,980
That was not a good thing to happen." That was pretty much, that was that too. I feel

1286
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,180
like that's that's it really.

1287
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:16,020
- Kid's gone.

1288
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:17,820
- That must just be it.

1289
01:08:17,820 --> 01:08:18,820
- Yeah.

1290
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,180
- Damn, oh well.

1291
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,020
- All right, time to go home.

1292
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,860
- Do you see, Giggy's like looking at you all

1293
01:08:22,860 --> 01:08:25,380
as he's like dying and he's like,

1294
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:28,580
he's like, I've done it, I've done it.

1295
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:29,420
There's nothing you--

1296
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,220
- What, you showed your penis to a boy?

1297
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:32,060
What have you done?

1298
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,300
- Yeah, you showed your dick to a kid, you're weird.

1299
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:35,900
- What do you think you've done?

1300
01:08:35,900 --> 01:08:39,940
- Now the kid's in a, you put him in a black hole

1301
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:40,780
or something?

1302
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:49,300
with spirits I smelt it on you you rid the woods of the wonderful jester you

1303
01:08:49,300 --> 01:08:59,820
stink of equity of the dreaded police the wicked God of fairness once I saw you

1304
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:06,420
had the boy it was only a matter of time can we get him back no he's monologuing

1305
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:13,780
Patrick shut up I'm basic I mean you can ask questions too let's keep going

1306
01:09:13,780 --> 01:09:17,820

1307
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:23,780

1308
01:09:23,780 --> 01:09:30,820
they'll be reunited so your mission's complete I guess what wait what what you

1309
01:09:30,820 --> 01:09:34,340

1310
01:09:34,340 --> 01:09:43,720
you do it yourself and fucking kill your friends? I'm so glad you asked. So, um, in the absence

1311
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:50,080
of his son, the king has been despondent. We have attendants in the kingdom. Now that's

1312
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:57,300
just cover your mouth. Look that back up. You've coaxed the king into performing a ceremony.

1313
01:09:57,300 --> 01:10:03,540
The same one to make his boy into a man. He'll be returned with what he thinks is the corpse

1314
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:10,940
of his son and when he performs a ceremony that our attendants have persuaded him

1315
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:18,140
to do the boy will be reborn as the terrifier himself the terrifier shall

1316
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:23,420
return you should be happy and he's looking to you for the Verdan Patrick

1317
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:30,140
Yodar and you Doga the dirt gom or is worked your terrifier born then I

1318
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:32,140
I should be happy about this?

1319
01:10:32,140 --> 01:10:33,640
Well, you're a terrifier, boy.

1320
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:35,140
All right, I guess I... yeah, pretty good.

1321
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,140
Yeah, that's a good point.

1322
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:38,140
And how should I feel about this news?

1323
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:40,540
You...

1324
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:43,640
should be very, very concerned.

1325
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:45,140
Well, I'm...

1326
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,640
Well, now I kind of feel bad. I'm starting to like this guy.

1327
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:54,140
I don't really care, but if you could elaborate what's gonna happen to me, am I gonna lose my job or something?

1328
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:55,140
[laughter]

1329
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:57,140
Uh, something like that.

1330
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:06,100
And as he's fading away at this point and he's looking to you guys, he has like a

1331
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:10,660
moment where he's like, it's like his last thought. He is looking at you again,

1332
01:11:10,660 --> 01:11:18,880
Evil Stevel, and he says, "You were not supposed to be there." And then he dies.

1333
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:24,580
Which if you remember, that was the thing that the fire creature in that volcano

1334
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:29,380
or in Mount Honestoodle said to you. Of course I remember. Way back in the first episode.

1335
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:37,080
Oh yeah. That was only six months ago. Yeah. Of course I fucking remember. Of course. And you would remember

1336
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:42,580
probably. Oh you weren't supposed to be in the hotel. That's what you were saying. Oh my god. He's right.

1337
01:11:42,580 --> 01:11:51,080
Yeah. It was 12 days in-game time. You probably remember. And you see, you also see when he dies finally,

1338
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:56,520
you you hear the rattling of a cage you look up above for the first time and you

1339
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:07,880
see a long-haired woman black you want to work at a hot wing restaurant my friend

1340
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:26,240
on it measure you she has no tits so no dice so and she she speaks to you and she

1341
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:35,000
says I'm sorry I couldn't stop them I'm the spirit the white woman of the caves

1342
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:37,880
I'm sorry I couldn't stop them. I heard-

1343
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:38,680
You know my uncle?

1344
01:12:38,680 --> 01:12:39,880
You don't remember us?

1345
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:43,160
I heard what you did for my sister, the white woman of the woods.

1346
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:44,040
Yeah, that's you.

1347
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:44,540
No.

1348
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:46,040
Yeah, wait, you were at that party too.

1349
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:47,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1350
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:50,360
You were in the lake. You were that lady in the lake.

1351
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:53,560
I was watching my uncle stoop the white lady of the river.

1352
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:54,280
The woods.

1353
01:12:54,280 --> 01:12:56,120
The woods. In her river.

1354
01:12:56,120 --> 01:12:57,720
Goddammit.

1355
01:12:57,720 --> 01:12:58,200
She was in a pond.

1356
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,200
She lives in a pond.

1357
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:01,160
And I was watching-

1358
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:03,080
Yeah, I was at that party too.

1359
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,120
I was drinking root beer or something.

1360
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:04,600
What?

1361
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,600
What was the...

1362
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,520
I forgot you were drinking juice.

1363
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,400
I was drinking juice.

1364
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:14,240
And the root beer made me go crazy.

1365
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:19,600
They used my power to make him disappear and to turn him into the form of a corpse.

1366
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,620
Can you make him not a corpse?

1367
01:13:22,620 --> 01:13:23,920
I've been drained too much of it.

1368
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,260
I can't teleport you.

1369
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:30,600
You saw my uncle draining his thing into your sister.

1370
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:32,000
I didn't see that.

1371
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,440
I heard about it after.

1372
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:35,440
I saw it. I watched the whole thing.

1373
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,440
[laughter]

1374
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:39,440
I...

1375
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:41,440
can...

1376
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,440
help you get back to Trebuchet Village.

1377
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,440
I can't teleport you there.

1378
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,440
I can only...

1379
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,440
make you go...

1380
01:13:49,440 --> 01:13:51,440
really, really, really...

1381
01:13:51,440 --> 01:13:53,440
really, really, really, really...

1382
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,440
really, really, really...

1383
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:57,440
really, really, really, really...

1384
01:13:57,440 --> 01:13:59,440
really, really, really, really...

1385
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:01,440
really, really, really, really...

1386
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,600
really really really really really really really really fast.

1387
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:07,600
Wait.

1388
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Can we go really really really really fast?

1389
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:12,600
Just one less fast.

1390
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,600
Listen.

1391
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:14,600
I don't want to know.

1392
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:15,600
Listen to me.

1393
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,600
Me.

1394
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,720
Alright, I'm hearing you, but how fast are we talking?

1395
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:28,480
I'm talking really really really really really really really really.

1396
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:33,360
I think times that by about two and a half times fast.

1397
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,760
So, you want to do it?

1398
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:36,760
Yeah!

1399
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,760
Speed me up!

1400
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:38,760
Okay.

1401
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:39,760
And me too!

1402
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:40,760
Oh, okay.

1403
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,160
He's actually already really fast.

1404
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,680
Yeah, he doesn't need any magic.

1405
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:47,400
He's actually like crazy fast already.

1406
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:51,080
Just imagining and solving, trying to catch up.

1407
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:55,440
So yeah, she casts whatever little magical ability she has left.

1408
01:14:55,440 --> 01:15:02,340
And you see it sort of is reflected within the like the glyph like whatever like splattered from that because the thing it like picked him

1409
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:09,340
Up as a hand and dropped him down, but there's still some residue of the paint there and she's sort of like weaving that

1410
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:13,040
This cave paint and she is

1411
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:16,640
Warping it around you guys and you

1412
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,760
suddenly like

1413
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:21,760
Take off like lightning

1414
01:15:22,160 --> 01:15:26,120
like Kool-Aid man through countless people's houses.

1415
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:32,800
You crash through things. You, at one point over the curvature of the planet, you sort of like

1416
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:38,640
overshoot and like crash through the curvature like you fuck up and crash through and

1417
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:45,400
you like smash through so many walls and you go down down down down down and you explode

1418
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:48,280
in none other

1419
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:56,220
Then sticky fingers joint and you see sticky fingers there. You see the pleasure men there and you see some brave lions

1420
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:59,220
And you see trunchbull as well

1421
01:15:59,220 --> 01:16:05,320
Yeah, there you are you old bitch. How you doing? What the why it was were you guys like expecting us or something?

1422
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,920
Did you hear that? We were fast now we weren't

1423
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:12,120
but uh, this is good timing cuz that we're about to

1424
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:14,720
We're about to kill the king

1425
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:43,720
[Music]

1426
01:16:43,720 --> 01:16:45,720
Now them cops...
