00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,840

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,680
don't know what he's doing up there, but what he's doing is an affront to God and

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,600
his stuff and let's just say the desolation of small has begun yeah right

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,600

mother fuck.

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:14,480
Pretty cool, it's kind of like I'm kind of working on some catchphrase. Have you

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:19,280
ever been on by yourself? I don't remember. I think that you you've been on

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,360
one for I was on by myself before you were on it. That's right in Boston.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,360
Yeah, when the dark wow

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,040
the dark thirty one just makes you reminisce doesn't know yeah, just

19
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,640
remembering things. I know that that was a good

20
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,120
we're having fun. I went upstairs to Caleb's apartment and we did it in his

21
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,960
room. Oh yeah, because you guys lived in the same building. I just remember

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,880
there's a few times you've been on this show. You've only been on here with

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:57,240
Alex, but I remember the one time Caleb wasn't here and we were doing karaoke to

24
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,800
start the episode off and it was me and Cameron in the living room singing and

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:06,280
then you had to come out and yell at us. I did not yell, but I was you to

26
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,400
reprimand us yeah. I mean, I think important for yell important detail is

27
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,240
that it was at my apartment at like our apartment and in that in the morning at

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,120
noon and I was probably closer to noon. I was mid work call and you were in

29
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,960
back when I worked

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:28,920
and I think that it was so your work didn't appreciate new divide by one

31
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,960
park. We were it was. I think I came out on one Republic and he said you have to

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,600
go to your bedroom. I think it's a rude. I think it was probably the second or

33
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,160
third karaoke song of the day yeah. I was like I'm going to push this

34
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm going to push this. I mean yeah it's on the it's on an episode. You can hear

35
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:48,160
it. There's one. Can you hear me in it? I think you can hear you kind of saying

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,080
like quiet.

37
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,480
That's exactly what you said was come on guys, and then I said, Can you just take

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,800
the call on your balcony?

39
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,320
Yeah, I mean I probably could have it doesn't matter. It's not like I well

40
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,960
hindsight is twenty twenty. Come on guys. It always hurts the most. I know

41
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,800
because I see I tried to ruined an amazing episode.

42
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,400
I'm sure that listeners love just like a straight karaoke track streamed into

43
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,800
the thing. Yeah, when we didn't even have a set up yet where you could like pipe

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,080
the music and do it, we didn't even. You just started off the app with a couple

45
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,780
songs. Yeah, you can barely hear the song. That's a good way to start off an

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,120
episode of anything is music. That's why TV episodes starts with the theme song.

47
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,960
Yeah, and this show has a theme song.

48
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,520
That's true. Did it play? It must have. Or is this the cold? Are we setting up

49
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,320
like hold open. Oh no, it plays right now

50
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,760
pretty excited. It's not going to play. That's a good idea. You don't get to

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,040
control when it plays. Okay, maybe if it played like right now, no, no, no, no,

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,760
don't you can't do that, because that's that'll be hell for dubio to edit. Yeah,

53
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,080
that's difficult to yeah and look he's already pissed off right now. You can see

54
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,600
him on the screen. I can't

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,880
he looks crazy. He looks so mad. Look at him. No he's Julio. Can you put the

56
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,180
Jameson right now. No he's not going to do it. He's not going to edit it. No

57
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:11,520
don't not it to him. He's not you're not doing it. Yes, there don't put it

58
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:16,340
yes, no, I feel like thanos when he got the infinity stones

59
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,240
pretty sick.

60
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,500
Okay, so here's something we were just talking about yeah. Basically, if we all

61
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,320
faked our deaths and ended the podcast completely yeah and it was over and then

62
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,200
we started a new one. Yeah, you think your dad

63
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,000
that no way.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,800
To be part of it, I go Juliet. I kill myself yeah for real, as you love us too

65
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,760
much, you're fooled

66
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,120
fully. Yeah,

67
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,280
think about that, but then what would the next one be called? Because let's be

68
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,560
honest. Also, if I'm faking my death, I'm starting another podcast immediately.

69
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,400
That's how they're going to catch me. Yeah, if I get sent into witness

70
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,720
protection, I will not be able to stay away from you. Just couldn't help

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,360
so you're in your glasses, a snowball, I can be like Hey everybody

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:10,880
checking in here. My name is so for some reason they made me change my name from

73
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,660
Cameron Fetter to John Smith. The craziest thing happened today. I got put

74
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,880
into a witness protection because I never believe a mafia related murder

75
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,360
yeah and guess what the guy who was killed by

76
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,420
Scarducci family Johnny Scarducci killed my friend

77
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:38,760
it's a ten hour log of all the crimes and look I even have a clip. It's just

78
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,740
the video. The guy just murdering like yeah, but here's my new address for

79
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,000
real, though, if I was in witness protection and I saw somebody I knew I

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,900
would not be able to not nod to them. Yeah, I would do that. I would do the

81
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,420
eyebrow

82
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,640
no, no, no,

83
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,140
you

84
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,600
you take off the glasses that they're like making you were just going like

85
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,400
yeah,

86
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:08,760
don't tell anybody it's like someone that you like you went to there in high

87
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,080
school for like one year. At the same time, yeah, it's the one who's very

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,160
loosely take a picture, yeah, someone who would not would have even they

89
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,960
wouldn't have recognized you. Yes, I want to talk like a history class in

90
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,520
college. Yeah,

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,660
my God,

92
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,640
it's

93
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:35,500
I'm playing a game that the FBI just told me I'm playing a game. I'm playing a

94
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,000
game where I buy a new character. Do you know Johnny's Cartucci

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,960
just sitting on the bus and seeing someone you know get on and just not

96
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,260
saying anything, but just like we're like

97
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,420
just looking

98
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,960
are the tap ending up, like yeah, all right, you caught me. It's me yeah

99
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,960
tapping the old lady sitting next to me be like. I know someone on this

100
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,960
my friends on the bus. I can't say hello to them, but I know I can say hello to

101
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
them because I witnessed a murder and they put me on witness protection, but

102
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,960
my real name is Cameron and I live at this street and

103
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,240
yeah I would be hanging out in the laundromat and I just be talking to

104
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,420
and be like yeah. I can't say hello to a lot of the people I know any more, but I

105
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:26,120
can't tell you why I try to drive around my old town all the time and I just

106
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,820
look at people.

107
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,940
Look, this nose is fake

108
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:36,680
look play wait wait. Okay, they do this say I got your nose and then actually

109
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,500
take my nose.

110
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,580
Just yeah, I would be a no. I would do you think they give you a whole new

111
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:47,300
style yeah they have to like a close yeah they bring a tan France from yeah

112
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,420
is yeah. You just look super you can tell someone's in witness protection

113
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,460
because they're wearing really cool. There were nobo yeah French,

114
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,740
short sleeve pattern t shirt

115
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:05,920
yeah they're all in like just decked out and just mall clothes. It's you to

116
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,660
see it, but you keep noticing somebody people wearing the exact same out like

117
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,700
different. It's just a bunch of like really fat, crazy looking Italian guys

118
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,740
with like the like

119
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,260
they all like a veto really tight like yeah short, just wearing like like

120
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,460
like a reading, avocado toast,

121
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:34,460
you know, then I started talking to my my dad. Seriously,

122
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:38,900
I realize a lot of the fucking underlying problems

123
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:44,460
they're all wearing. They're wearing like like fucking like Hollister and

124
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,300
it like like those old like the shit that people were in like two thousand and

125
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,100
eight. Those Hollister shirts with like the felt letters. Yeah, that'd be so

126
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,180
sick to see one of those big Italian guys in that shit. Yeah, I guess that if

127
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:00,340
basically if if you have to get your style made over, yeah, witness

128
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,020
protection, which I think that seems like maybe it would happen in my mind.

129
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,100
It's usually hair dye glasses or removal of glasses, beard, beard or no beard.

130
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,100
yeah removal of teeth yeah. Oh my God, adding a beard to a lady who

131
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,240
protection that would work actually ingenious, but I feel like

132
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,800
the stylist that you hire has to be airtight yeah. It's probably someone

133
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,840
who's the tiniest, the tiniest misstep, I think could blow your entire cover. I

134
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,240
would have to imagine it's an FBI agent who just has an eye for those kinds of

135
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,200
things, you know, but like that's what I like. If it's like yeah, if it's like

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,120
a sixty year old, like like silver haired Italian guy and they put them in

137
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,660
Hollister yeah, I'm going to know right away. I

138
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,780
yeah, this guy's a fucking I should kill this guy, but here's the

139
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:53,000
that's what it is. Whenever you see a fucking hot topic old guy, you know when

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,040
you see like a guy who's like forty and he still has the nose piercing and the

141
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,000
and the band, the like the fucked up bangs and stuff that's what's that's what

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,920
happened. That's why you why they're like that. You want to kill that guy.

143
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,760
yeah. We need to kill the guy in the cure, because he's a fucking rat dude.

144
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,680
He's a fucking rat Robert Smith. Yeah, he looks crazy. He's got a fake name to

145
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,760
think about it. Robert Smith, no way that someone yeah, oh my God, yeah,

146
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,480
that is a one. We start with the name, you know what

147
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,600
something Smith, one of the first saw either one of their first albums has a

148
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,200
song called killing in a rab. Oh my God, what did he do? Yeah, that's the

149
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:35,080
or what did he see somebody? What did he see somebody do yeah and the whole song

150
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,760
is the whole song is a confession. Oh my God,

151
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,760
that is crazy than I thought all the way to the cure yeah speaking of it be

152
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:49,320
really sick to like be the witness protection stylist and you're just doing

153
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,680
like character creation on dudes and you're giving like you're giving them

154
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,000
like big like pink liberty spikes, but you just see it some like fat,

155
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,640
old guy. Yeah, you're putting like

156
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,700
you know what what we're going to do. We're going to make sure that you're

162
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,060
times. You're going to be moving in with a lady who looks like a cat.

163
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,560
yeah

164
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,020
yeah, and this is called skuma. You're going to be need to take a lot of this.

165
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,300
Wouldn't it be incredible ever? If you ever see someone you know, give them a

166
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,800
very loud fuss road.

167
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,280
You won't have to deal with it.

168
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:46,640
The extent of my my sky room yeah, that was good, but sure it was good yeah.

169
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,760
Oh, and the knee, the knee yeah, oh the arrow to the near to the name yeah. Oh

170
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,280
my God, oh yeah, buddy brings back the memories. Wouldn't it be incredible to

171
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,140
he's so dangerous. They had to disguise a guy to protect him from you yeah

172
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:05,040
that if you are so you're so evil and dangerous that they're like we have to

173
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,720
turn this. We have to change this guy's whole style up or you're going to

174
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,040
destroy him like I like the idea that it's just like they live in the same

175
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
town. It's just style

176
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,360
they can't afford to move. There's a serious budget. Yeah, we so a lot of

177
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,900
shit got fucked up at the FBI. Just yeah, they just comb his hair a

178
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,040
different way. We either

179
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,600
lower tier of witness protection. They either lose the agents who are like

180
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,520
doing serious, you know shit or they get rid of the guy who gives them all

181
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,680
hair. Well, this is a guy who like he snitched on someone who was doing

182
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,900
something that way like he saw somebody shoplifting magic, the gathering cards

183
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,060
and he was like I'll tell you who did it, but you need to put me into

184
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,020
witness protection.

185
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,960
Like Okay, I guess I do it out of the whole song and dance with them just to

186
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:49,280
like just to make him think that it's happening, but they're just like going

187
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,320
okay, they put them in a pod. When you come out, you're going to look

188
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,860
completely different. Yeah, you're going to you're going to be shorter.

189
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,720
You're going to have to wear these color contacts for the rest of your

190
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,460
life. What do you think they would be killed

191
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:08,260
if you ever take these color contacts? I'll be a white guy. I got a cat. I

192
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,500
got a contact. Also, you're going to be the greatest backpack wrapper of all

193
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,440
time. Yeah, Mr. Hobson, I think most celebrities might be in witness

194
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,140
protection yeah. I think that kind of counter that runs counter to

195
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,120
witness.

196
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,800
It's called riding in plain. You're a famous pop star

197
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:32,440
in the world. You came up on vine through seven second songs.

198
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,320
You are a guy who has the power to climb walls and swing on web

199
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:43,120
drop a spider in the room.

200
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,320
making a spider out of like a radioactive steel bag and just tossing it in.

201
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,860
Okay, so something will happen to you.

202
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:58,660
Yeah. Wow. But anyway, even the reason I brought this up is what would the name

203
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,200
of the next podcast be? Yeah. I kind of got sidetracked. I thought I said one

204
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,400
that Joe was on board with and it was motherfuckers in jeans. That's not bad,

205
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,140
I guess. You just have to commit to the jeans. But we can only talk about denim

206
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:18,100
and being a mother fucker. Yeah, talking about denim, just being like this is

207
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:21,980
called salvage mother fucker. The thing where you wear the denim into the ocean

208
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,940
after a year, that's yeah, you told me what if if you get like real nice denim

209
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:33,020
jeans, it's these if you get like a raw indigo jeans, like you wear jeans, you

210
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,620
wear them all year. Yeah, you like form them to your body and then at the end of

211
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,180
the year, you walk into the ocean. You can walk into the ocean. You can do it in

212
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,600
your bath. This isn't a thing, but why do you have to walk into the you have to

213
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,760
walk into the ocean? There's just some guys who go into the ocean.

214
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,200
This is the only way to cleanse what the best you

215
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:58,240
I mean you can sit in your best of bathtub, bathtub, but why would you even

216
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,840
want to get some wet in the first place? You get them wet, so that to wash them

217
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,760
yeah to wash them and then the die comes out and like you like distress it

218
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:12,800
yourself. What does it mean to be distressed? When you're feeling so bad. You gotta feel

219
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,480
so bad. There's this one dude, people would repost him on Twitter and his name was the

220
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:28,040
Swiss Jeans Freak. He was like an old Swiss guy who was obsessed with denim and he would

221
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,960
bathe and put his jeans in piss. He would soak them in piss so they would get a yellowish

222
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:39,660
tint to him. So they them in piss yeah, so that the when the fades happen. So

223
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,060
like there must be another you all liquid. He could have used yeah totally

224
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,980
to be yellow. I don't know. I just saw a yellow tent. I think if you if you look

225
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,180
up

226
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,940
you did that you touch the cameras out. Yeah, you can you look that up?

227
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:59,120
He I know what a jeans can you look up swiss jeans freak p. Oh there he is

228
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,780
be careful because it's YouTube effects of urine with denim.

229
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:09,660
Yeah, that's him. That's the Swiss jeans freak. Oh, what's going on there?

230
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,620
He has a lot of jeans. He is awesome, completely obsessed with a very tiny

231
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,220
picture of him. Yeah, I just remember somebody seeing somebody repost a photo

232
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:23,060
of him. I remember who did it, but it was them posting a photo of him with

233
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,660
jeans and P. If you like jeans so much, I feel like you're allowed to do that

234
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,140
something yeah P P on your jeans. If you like jeans, I think if you're like so

235
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,140
into it, you like rod and I would I would maybe counter that by saying I

236
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:40,700
think maybe you're it's more if you're into P, yeah, something like that, but

237
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,540
there did G,

238
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,660
but where does the peace day

239
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,700
what is the high caged when I was a kid? I saw something. I saw something on the

240
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,940
internet that was like all dudes like have a little drip of P on the end of

241
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,180
their

242
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,780
say it

243
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,280
right

244
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:02,760
all guys like finished, have a have a drip on the end of their what p

245
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,420
my

246
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,100
I didn't say it

247
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:11,280
when they like pull up their pants after they go to the toilet. You saw

248
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,500
I saw someone say like you googled. Do you guys have a

249
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:21,280
like a relay of my penis? Is this normal you are on yahoo answers? Yeah, what's

250
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,120
Can this happen to all guys? Yeah, what's this stuff

251
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,060
after I P? What's the stuff after I P that's all over me?

252
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:36,240
What is this stuff? What the hell is this crap? What's this stuff in my hands

253
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,360
after I P in my hand?

254
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:45,040
I think it's P. Yeah, my yeah, those those rod denim guys are crazy, raw

255
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,080
denim, the rod is rod denim. What does that mean like when you get jeans they

256
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,520
get treated and washed right. So it's like you jeans made out of what is

257
00:17:53,520 --> 00:18:02,320
jeans is cotton. It's like inter woven and then died indigo. So every pair of

258
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,500
like you can get them raw, where that like if you sweat and then wipe your

259
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,520
hand on it, there will be like blue on. They don't like lock in the die. Yeah,

260
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:13,520
they don't lock in the die. So then you walk around to get completely undyed

261
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,920
jeans and they're just white. Yeah, really really you can yeah, probably

262
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,940
probably or really I think so is it look it up. Well, they wouldn't be jeans.

263
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,840
Yeah, well, they could be denim people wear black jeans yeah, but when you make

264
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,160
them

265
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,600
to denim, I don't know how it works. I don't know how it works. I just know

266
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,120
that raw denim is like the die. Raw denim guys don't wash their jeans for a

267
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,480
whole year. They get their booty stank all over it, and then they walk into the

268
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,760
fucking ocean sometimes or they pee on them,

269
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:52,080
and they're obsessed with getting the honeycombs, which is the like pattern on

270
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,420
the back of the the knee. So there's like a distress. It's like look how often I

271
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,500
move my leg in my rod denim. Oh talk about a crazy guy honeycomb, the little

272
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,360
guy, a little bee,

273
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,000
the little like monster, the guy with the arms and legs. Why did they make him

274
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,040
that? Because he looks like the thing probably doesn't look like a here. I'll

275
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,240
tell you, I mean you can ask that question again. Why do they call him?

276
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:18,280
Why do they make him that? Make him that. Oh, we're still talking about him, aren't we?

277
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:25,280
Ah, advertising at work. Years and years later. Wow. Hit that fucking button.

278
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Whoa. Fuck yeah. What are the other ones? You'll find out. Yeah, you'll see. I need to.

279
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:38,280
That's the best one by far. Oh my God. That's a new addition too. That is the best one.

280
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:42,280
I was lying in bed and I thought I need to add that to this board.

281
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,680
sound. That's the one that rounded out the sound board for us. You really have

282
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,560
to be careful with that. It is nice. You don't know, just explaining the show,

283
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,680
how the show has been. I've listened to some episodes,

284
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:58,120
yeah, but not enough. I like to you and then to the fans listening who already

285
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:02,120
know this guy, by the way to the fans. We don't know this guy and he's a fan.

286
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,920
We just ran into so if you want to be on the show, you just run up, just run up,

287
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,280
just run up. There's some clues like that any video with these guys in it.

288
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,080
there's some clues in the background as to where they may or may not live.

289
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,620
So

290
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,620
this guy just rang the doorbell and now he's here yeah. If you guys get the get

291
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:23,320
your your geo guesser on you can find these guys, you rainbow. Oh, we had we

292
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,000
me and we had weed. We had weed

293
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,580
we

294
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,620
pull on. I were we're debating a question last night that we actually

295
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:35,660
ended up asking that guy, the geo guesser guy, what I had responded, you

296
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,200
reply in person. No, we just sent him a dm. Okay,

297
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,900
do you have a dc if you replied when we pull up the question here so I can read

298
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,140
it out. Okay, let me let me fill. Okay, let me fill the dead air while this is

299
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:52,340
loading. It takes a long time to load. Okay, so this is the question that we

300
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:57,540
asked him. I asked I wanted him to know I asked are there any towns in the USA

301
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,580
with no pizza

302
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:04,780
send him another message, some question marks or say here rephrase it here, send

303
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:12,360
let's say or rather are there any towns in the USA with thousands of people,

304
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,400
but no pizza

305
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:22,480
us thousands of people, thousands of people, but no pizza, but no pizza, but

306
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,320
spell out people and then and then and then send wait before that preface this

307
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,420
start the sentence off by saying I'm sorry if my question is not clear and

308
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,860
that's why you're not answering,

309
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:40,760
but I think if there's anybody in the world, I am pondering this

310
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,640
philosophical question. If there's anybody in the world is going to know

311
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,000
the answer to this question, is this guy yeah? Wouldn't you guys agree that

312
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,340
this is the only guy maybe who can help me yeah yeah? I was thinking about

313
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,000
this a lot yesterday down. Just can you imagine a town with thousands of

314
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,560
people and no pizza in the USA?

315
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:00,580
I'm sorry if not clear. How about this

316
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,580
so

317
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:06,880
so he's going to respond soon. I'm sure I fucking hope

318
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,900
now

319
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,180
there you go pizza emoji that's going to lock it down yeah. I think the it would

320
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,440
be so funny to like, but whatever a ten of fifteen second tick okay,

321
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,560
look at he list every

322
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,900
every street

323
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:29,940
because there are towns because there's towns that have like maybe two or three

324
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,880
people and there's no pizza there, but that doesn't count. Maybe I think the

325
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,000
problem is just that like dominoes probably can go one town over yeah yeah,

326
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,540
that's what I was thinking to you know, but yeah that doesn't count though, but

327
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,480
thousands of people that wouldn't count. I wouldn't count it has to be a

328
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,200
thousands of people town with no pizza in the town, no pizza, no pizza, but

329
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,360
nobody said that is accessible, but it could be in the town over yeah, or yeah,

330
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,480
it could be a new message in back and say that clarified that it can be in the

331
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,280
town over. It can be the pizza can be in the just one over, but it's okay. No

332
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,460
I say this can't say if the town was the only thing that existed in the world.

333
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:08,840
There would be no pizza, so if the town, if a town detached from the earth and

334
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,620
flew into space, it would be a planet without pizza

335
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:17,040
just to spend just to make it specific that there were not talking. It couldn't

336
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,420
be the town over yeah yeah. You have to say that all of that. Does he follow you

337
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:25,940
guys? No, no, I'll say that why what

338
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:33,520
it's not going to make any sense to him unless you clarify it to him that's

339
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,300
okay here. We'll we'll handle it later. He's got he's probably working on his

340
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:36,640
video

341
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,640
yeah. You probably already started. I know we're probably throwing a lot of

342
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,820
wrenches in this thing. Now I feel like I could probably find like a you know an

343
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,740
old picture of my dad and get him to you know figure out where it was yeah,

344
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,740
that's yeah, that's what it does, but we're trying to figure out.

345
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,540
Maybe we just scrap this pizza joke and we send him a picture of my not a joke.

346
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,740
like what do you, it's a real philosophical idea. I just really like

347
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,180
to know where my dad was in a picture. What picture, maybe you could like a

348
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:09,020
whoa like a bit of switch, a bait and switch yeah, I'm bringing him in for

349
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,160
with a pizza. I am

350
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,980
and then we're going to switch it out and make him show me where my dad is and

351
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,660
then when he says no, we can just say like okay, never mind. Can you find this

352
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,420
picture of Joe's dad? Can you find the can you where was just

353
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,140
we're going to follow the Google Maps car around all day with this picture of

354
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:33,420
Joe's dad. Yeah, and then there he's going to tell me where the Google Map is

355
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:36,820
and then where in that's honestly probably a good idea. Yeah, a picture in

356
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,820
a Google Map. Wow, can you find me? They probably censor it nowadays, though

357
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,780
those fuckers. I've seen the Google Maps car before. I'm on I'm on Apple Maps on

358
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,020
my old place in Boston. We've talked about it. I think it was two eleven

359
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,620
Harvard. Is Apple Maps different than yeah, yeah, different, but they both do

360
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,180
I posted the photo. I've sent it to Jubio before. What I love doing, I love going on

361
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:02,080
Google Maps and looking at a place over time and seeing how it changes. Can you

362
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,580
do that? Yeah, you can go back to like 2007. Damn, when did they start doing the

363
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:12,240
Apple car, the Google car? I think it was probably 2007 because there's a lot of my

364
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,820
hometown that... Are you buying an iPhone 14? Don't buy an iPhone 14 on the company

365
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:22,220
the card. That's not right unless you want to give it to me for my front

366
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,180
facing video.

367
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:30,100
That's true. Nowadays, movies are shot on phones. Yeah, basically,

368
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,140
tangerine, tangerine, tangerine, one pretty much the only one I can think of

369
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:40,700
tangerine to the orange. Oh, there's the unsane. Yeah. Was that the Soderbergh

370
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,380
one? Yeah, Soderbergh. Well, I think actually he might have done a few. Was

371
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,320
that other one also? I don't know. That's the only one I saw. That one sucked.

372
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,240
I don't know. Soderbergh sounds like the town where they have no pizza.

373
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,640
They only sell burgers. Oh yeah. So does. Oh my God. So does in burgers.

374
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:01,760
That's genius. That's the only thing in Soderbergh. And if you try to put,

375
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,200
dude, that's the problem. They try to put pizza there. They fucking kill you.

376
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,920
Yeah, they kill you, dude. They fucking kill you. It's next to, um,

377
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,700
that's a and check this one out fatality. Whoa little combo yeah yeah pretty cool

378
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:19,280
pretty cool. We'll get to all of them by the end yeah and you can change them if

379
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,200
you want to yeah, but not right now, but yes, I've any suggestions of the first

380
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,440
one, the like Boeing. Oh yeah,

381
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,880
that's his favorite one. I guess that was just quick, but I want that one. I

382
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:33,560
you can change that one. Why why are you telling them to change it? No, I'm

383
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:37,120
saying that in here, I'm saying that one is like that everything that he does. I

384
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,460
I think that one is ripe to be changed. Well, you know that we have like a

385
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,700
bunch of space yeah,

386
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:44,140
I thought you were working with

387
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:48,420
we have one. I mean there's a easily accessible yeah, you don't want to be

388
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,560
changing the lovers yeah, but you know it's like what you want another one.

389
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:52,800
Yeah,

390
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,840
oh fuck yeah yeah

391
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,520
fuck yeah

392
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:05,160
that one's good. I would be are we got everyone already knows about all the

393
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,760
listeners already know about the sounds yeah. I'm just you're just going to have

394
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,800
to ruin it. You're ruining everything right now. Sorry guys.

395
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,520
It's okay. Sorry. It's all right. You got excited about the sounds. I think

396
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,400
the listeners are going to be thrilled that I'm on the episode.

397
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,520
I have to imagine the streets. I think the way the list. This is what the

398
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,280
listeners are like when they're on the episode.

399
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:32,100
Thank one

400
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:40,860
That I honestly I wish we started out every episode with the with the Kern

401
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,140
crab zombie nation. Do you not get a song of all copyright strikes for that? Oh,

402
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,540
we haven't yet. We will because of how often we use it. You guys got scared by

403
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:53,140
dog copyright changes. How often you use something? I think it's the amount of

404
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,620
time that you use it for. We will use it so often. I think on YouTube it just

405
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,820
it gets auto detected. If it hasn't yet, it don't ever will.

406
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,220
It don't ever will. I'm pretty sure it don't ever will not for us.

407
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:11,520
We have a list today. Yeah, so with this list is an analog list.

408
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,220
It's not found on any computer. Chill out for a second. I'm excited

409
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:22,320
because this isn't this. I just recently I got this in my mailbox

410
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,380
this morning from corporate. Yeah, you can see right there. It's got a first

411
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,280
class first class mail. They don't need a stamp for that. Yeah, no, they put it

412
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,180
in themselves. Well, I took off the stamp in the address part because I

413
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,580
don't want people to know my address. Obviously, why don't have addresses?

414
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,540
Why can't you did? Well, that's how rich the people at corporate are. They

415
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,580
print their own stamps with every address in the world. Holy fuck! Well,

416
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,420
that is

417
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,780
corporate America man. Yeah, now what they can get away with we that we can't.

418
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:58,780
why can't you reuse stamps? That's a good question. You know what? Save that. Save

419
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:04,940
that. Hold on to that. Save that for the end. Because basically what corporate has sent me

420
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:11,380
here is I guess that they're not so happy with some of the directions our conversations

421
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:18,860
have been going. They think that we've been talking too much about music festivals, candy,

422
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,860
type of thing and they want to kind of steer us and give us a little more

423
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,100
direction on stuff to talk about that. Maybe we don't talk about all the time.

424
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,940
Okay, so they just sent us some like I guess some of these are like questions

425
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,060
do we show the go? I mean I can show it briefly. I don't want to give them all

426
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,220
away. Okay, I'll talk about them, but it's they sent the I mean some of these

427
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,460
are questions. Some of them are just like, you know, phrases to talk about.

428
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,500
I guess we're just supposed to talk about as many of these as possible.

429
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:45,940
Great. So it is interesting. Honestly, it is an interest. It is interesting

430
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,300
because it does it's a list. I mean it's also

431
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,700
we haven't been doing enough. We are so mad that we do we have basically not

432
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,380
touched lists in a long time. This is this is also we haven't seen this before.

433
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,580
What this is straight from this is just opened yeah yeah, I don't know what's on

434
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,940
this list. Yeah, I mean I have no one of them. Okay, was it the last one that has

435
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,740
one? No, it was the it was the second one here. Okay, that I'll just read out

436
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:12,140
and then we can maybe we can just start that. Why don't we know let's start from

437
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:15,020
the top? Let's take it from the top from the top. He clearly wants to do the

438
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,260
second. I want to do the second one, though let's well. We can get into the

439
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,380
second one to jump around. We can get into the second one second did

440
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,900
corporate say to jump. I said to jump around jump around

441
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,500
I was going to read this one first that this is maybe this is more the type of

442
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,860
thing we're supposed to be talking about on the show. I guess apparently the

443
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,700
okay, but anyway

444
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,380
is Tom Holland cringe

445
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:44,100
is he cringe. I don't think he's not, but I don't think he's based either. I

446
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,660
don't know

447
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:51,360
I think he's probably somewhere in the middle of the road. You know, I don't

448
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,200
think he's like

449
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,440
I think I think he's cringe. You think he's cringe. Look at this picture that

450
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,100
we just got pulled. I don't know he just kind of looks like a young boy there. I

451
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,180
think Tom Holland is not cringe, but a young boy. I think I think Tom Holland

452
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,200
he's young. I think he's a little cringe. Okay, that he's starting to look like

453
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,960
you to me for some reason

454
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,760
but to me

455
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:27,360
for the listeners at home that Jubio put Tom Holland's face over Joe young Tom

456
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,960
Holland. Yeah, I know pre Spidey. I mean he's probably cringe here because he's a

457
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:35,720
young kid. The thing about Tom Holland is he's a little bit cringe, but if

458
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:39,560
you're Spider-Man, you're supposed to be that's true. That is actually really

459
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,640
through you want him to be a little bit because if he's what is that noise you

460
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:49,520
just made what was that if you're talking crazy sorry, I saw something on

461
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,600
the list. You want to be a little cringe because if you're talking to MJ, he

462
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,880
doesn't want to be like spit, right? You know she's a model and he's a nerd.

463
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,380
She's a total she's a total

464
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,720
and he's a babe and he needs to be cringe and his powers are what attracts

465
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,500
her to him yeah yeah wow. So we just put that correct this wide open yeah you

466
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:11,400
see that's why that's why I'm glad we have you. I'm ready for this God,

467
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,240
because Caleb would be talking about this for hours. I'm ready. I'm going to

468
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,280
give my God my God on you're bringing the hammer down yeah, so you know what

469
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:24,280
the moaning here, maybe you can drop Monear on on this one here, which is a

470
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:28,600
conversation topic that I'm glad that corporate has brought up because

471
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,360
honestly I think I text Caleb and Cameron this every single day

472
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,900
pizza Friday versus taco Tuesday. Wow it's pizza Friday for pizza Friday for

473
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,700
me to what about you? What are you thinking?

474
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,200
See I'm going to say

475
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,200
taco Tuesday, because

476
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,100
taco Tuesday, I think, is a little bit more

477
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,240
special and I think it's a little bit more.

478
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:59,600
I think pizza is an any day thing, whereas taco Tuesday kind of has some

479
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,940
right. There's like a solid platform for taco Tuesday to stand up, but pizza

480
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,440
Friday Pizza Friday Friday, Friday night you're watching a movie. You have pizza.

481
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,700
Maybe you got a Caesar salad look. I love Pizza Friday just as much as the next

482
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,340
guy, but well clearly not think about the next thing about guys right here. I

483
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,580
love it more than think about this in your head right now. Imagine okay

484
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:25,580
Pizza Friday, you get a taco pizza taco Tuesday. You get a pizza taco. They're

485
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:29,320
going to say what the hell are you right? You can't order a pizza. That's

486
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,580
you can't say some Spencer say shit yeah

487
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:36,480
that's some Spencer Shay shit that they're going to get Joe. I Carly as

488
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:43,520
get Joe, I Carly as back to spaghetti Saturday, get to be at Spaghetto, where

489
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,460
she was from Seattle Spaghetto and I mean now that we talked about I'm glad we I

490
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:53,640
mean again we got we're still this is still a heated thing, but

491
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:59,020
this is a heated debate. He's a Friday. I hope the pizza is a heated thing.

492
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,380
Yeah,

493
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:04,380
cold pizza is for pizza Saturday morning. Yeah,

494
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,820
pizza, which I'm not even going to lie to you guys. I don't know. There's a

495
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,980
not even going to lie to you guys. It's Monday. I'm literally going to have

496
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,280
cold pizza Monday later today, because I had a pizza Friday last night on a

497
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,580
Sunday night and what do you think about that? That's a Friday. That's a Sunday.

498
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,180
It was no, it was pizza. No, there's pizza sauce. Sunday is syrup Sunday.

499
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,520
it's got to be it's syrup sunday and if at night you have pizza and watch a

500
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:32,920
movie, it can be pizza friday on a sunday night, cereal saturday, cereal

501
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,700
saturday, i have cereal saturday. I have cereal most days, yeah, cereal monday,

502
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:41,100
tuesday, wednesday, thursday, yeah, and i mean i guess that honestly i mean we

503
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:44,140
could go on about pizza friday versus taco tuesday. Let's i mean let's be

504
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:46,860
crossing these topics off yeah we would be going we'd be going

505
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:51,640
it would be going to get it all on it for the whole episode and i don't think

506
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,880
that would be good. No, so why don't we just go? No, what do you next just let's

507
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,900
just dive right into this next one? Could the next Jared Fogle be lurking in

508
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,300
play?

509
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,420
Because you think about it and it's like

510
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:11,520
Jared Fogle, he was popular. He was and it's so. Everybody knew his name. He

511
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,440
was at the club that he was popular. He was at the club. He was at the club and

512
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,060
he was walking up to these bitches saying I'm going to give you that foot

513
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,760
long. Yeah, and guess what? Those bitches were kids. That's a fuck.

514
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,920
That's not right. That's disgusting. Oh my God. I never even thought of it that

515
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:27,960
way.

516
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,360
That's disgusting. Jared Fogle, he kind of flew too close to the sun because he

517
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,400
tried to be... Yeah, somebody's son. Yeah.

518
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:43,120
He flew too close to somebody's son. They were on the same private jet. Yeah,

519
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:48,040
and then guess where that jet was going? He... Subway headquarters. Yeah, they

520
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:54,840
knew of. He tried to be a Ronald McDonald that wasn't a cartoon, but he was a clown. He tried

521
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,040
to be a real guy. He tried to be the honeycombs guy. McDonald's is smart because they do a

522
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:04,160
bunch of different Ronald's. They have the different ones on the benches at the places

523
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:09,240
when you go. What do you mean? And it's not just a guy. There's the Ronald on the bench

524
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,160
at McDonald's and you sit next to him and you take a picture. That's the same guy. That's

525
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,080
just the same Ronald. But each one is a different one. He goes to the different ones every time.

526
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:20,160
and he just comes to which everyone I met yeah. He follows him. He likes me

527
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,200
low, kill, a little sus,

528
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,700
a little, a little sus. Actually, that's exactly what Jared would do speaking of

529
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,320
I mean we've probably talked about it before, but long of mcdonald's and

530
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,960
Jared, we don't to do a mall. You can just as me jump around to precise me

531
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,160
Jared Fogel's just there interviewing him at a damn school. Yeah, you don't

532
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,120
remember that scene and super size. Oh yeah, I do that. He shows up to talk to

533
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,400
him about eating healthy and he's just like well. I'm just here to talk to the

534
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,740
kids. He said dude he there's so many pictures of him at movie premieres for

535
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,740
like puss in boots and oh yeah, it's like he just went to every movie premier

536
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:58,100
for you. You used to have like a big slide show that you would do. I would do

537
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,180
it. You would do that slide show. I just found a ton of pictures. It's crazy.

538
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:04,840
Yeah, when I was when I after that happened, I went to a subway like two

539
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:09,500
days later, yeah, and bear and waste there was a tumble. We the row in the

540
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,460
back of the subway. There was a

541
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,440
three days after it's just a guy just

542
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,640
he

543
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:24,040
he opened up like the bread like a great things.

544
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:31,580
He's the last of all rations. There is a there is a framed picture of that guy

545
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,980
and Jared yeah in the on the back wall and I was like. Oh, did you did you hear

546
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,880
what happened and he went

547
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,760
he's got put it down. Oh my God, can you imagine you should have offered to buy

548
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,000
it off?

549
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,660
I was like

550
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,500
Dude, can you imagine being like yeah like a guy a guy? What did that have

551
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,040
you have you have no life at all? You work at subway, you dread going to

552
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,580
subway every day yeah it's it's well. He owns the franchise. When did I talk

553
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,420
about just that I'm saying I'm saying you're a per your person who works at

554
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,520
subway, you're not this person as a junior in high school. You're a junior

555
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,680
as a senior. I was only three

556
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,660
you you, you dread going to your job every day, because it's like a fast food

557
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,660
you don't want to do this shit yeah and then you see the news and you're like

558
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,660
like every every day for for however long someone's going to come in and say

559
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,780
something to you about Jared for yeah, yeah, you even want to be there. You're

560
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,380
seeing I would do in that situation is cut out Jared's head, put a different

561
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,620
celebrity in it yeah in that photo that photo that everyone walks in there like

562
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,420
oh my God, someone else is going to believe that a different guy has pants

563
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,940
that big that don't fit him. Shaquille O'Neal, but he's the pants are too big

564
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,540
but is he wait it's him and the guy standing in the pants together. No

565
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:50,560
is one like one like whoa pretty cool. Is science going too far? Yes, next

566
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,500
question, what's the next hot meme?

567
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:59,760
Okay, see that one is that one's actually a reason to think about because

568
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,280
the next fashion is all I was going to cross out fat yeah. We talk about denim.

569
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,880
Oh yeah, we did a lot of fashion,

570
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,380
but the hot next hot meme is scary to think about because obviously

571
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:16,080
with the way that society is going right now, every single one of these memes

572
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:20,980
that comes out now is based on a national tragedy. Damn is that the

573
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,160
orange smoke, the orange smoke that became a meme that was a posting how

574
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:29,320
orange things were baby crunk and you know, I'm just gonna say in terms of

575
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,200
the next hot meme, just keep your eyes on the finale of the mass singer this

576
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,420
Sunday. Okay, you have inside. I have a feeling that there's going to be some

577
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,780
serious memeable content that could be. I bet there will be at least a gift or

578
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,860
two will come out of that. I'll give you a dream. I've a I've a I've a I've a

579
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,820
sneaking suspicion that cucumber princess is going to be revealed. Okay,

580
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:52,500
okay, and let's just say she's not that great at singing. Oh man, cucumber. I

581
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,660
think I have a feeling, though, about the next hot meme. I'm thinking that it's

582
00:39:55,660 --> 00:40:00,620
likely going to be an original drawing. Yeah, something that someone has drawn in

583
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,460
in terms of when people draw a face that's crying. Why don't we try? Okay,

584
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:09,740
pig, a frog on the back of this. We'll, we'll, we'll sketch it out right now. So

585
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,380
yeah, you tell me, wait, we should do the thing where we fold it.

586
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,280
You know,

587
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,300
a mad magazine folded, you know,

588
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:22,660
you draw the head. Well, you have the head. Yeah, you draw the head. It's

589
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,620
gonna be this is the next meme character. You can't look at it. You can't

590
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:29,220
look. I can't. No, none of us look at each other. So I'm just gonna draw the

591
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,940
neck and then you draw the body and then you draw the legs yeah, okay, great

592
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:35,740
yeah, who draws the head? He's drawing the head in the neck. Oh, I got it

593
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,780
I want to try okay, okay, but in the meantime, all right, well, I think wait

594
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,380
wait, hold on give us the other two pages. No, you know,

595
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,980
okay,

596
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,500
okay, okay, yeah, chill, but I still want to talk about memes, though you

597
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,220
don't I do oh, okay,

598
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,380
okay, all right, then keep going. Sorry, I'm sorry for interrupting. Well, I

599
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,400
think that maybe don't stop looking at that. Okay, don't stop looking at it.

600
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,700
No, stop looking at it. Okay, we had image memes. We had gifts as memes. We

601
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,940
then we got video memes. What is next? I think is memes that are interactive

602
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:16,180
and their games with three point. You know where you it's completely a

603
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:20,080
controllable me where you someone posted on Twitter and you have to play through

604
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,020
the whole thing in order to get the meme. The joke of the meme. Okay, that's

605
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,500
so like it looks like maybe it's like a first person walk around person

606
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:33,200
salamander and it's like a meme and it's like when you have to go when you have

607
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,260
to go to the bathroom and the meme game is you're running really fast and you're

608
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,660
and you control it to go to the bathroom and you're taught and it's a salamander.

609
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,420
I don't know why I'm married to this right now, but it is a salamander for a

610
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,180
salamander could be a good character. Yeah, because think about it all pepe in

611
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,540
the future, the frog that's true. He's a frog. What's the next logical step? A

612
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,360
a slimy little salamander.

613
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,560
A salamander, yeah.

614
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,860
And he has...

615
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,360
Can you hurry up with your drawing?

616
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,560
He's shedding his skin.

617
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,060
He's shedding his skin maybe.

618
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,060
Do salamanders shed?

619
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,460
I don't really know much about salamanders.

620
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,060
Me neither.

621
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,760
Did you know that they used to think salamanders were fire

622
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,660
monsters?

623
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:10,260
They are.

624
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,960
They are fire type if you look at Charmander.

625
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,560
He's a Charmander.

626
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,160
That's true.

627
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,460
Well, I think they used to think that they were

628
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,960
in...

629
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,860
Okay, now it's Patrick's turn.

630
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,160
See, was salamander a topic?

631
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:20,960
No.

632
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,460
Now we're...

633
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,860
but I don't go ahead and draw your draw. All right, okay, and me and Joe will

634
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,280
tell you what topic is next. All right, yeah, I guess now we can move on to a

635
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,480
topic while he works on that you'd sell salamanders was not a topic. I heard

636
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,900
salamanders yeah, it was not a top. I mean, let's see you want to keep talking

637
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,300
about salamander. I don't know. I don't know what to say. Let me let me look at

638
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,620
the other page here. Let's okay, let's see what we have.

639
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:42,920
Let's see here.

640
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,920
Do we need superheroes in our society?

641
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:51,220
I think that the question was superheroes becomes why should they be

642
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,140
the judge of what's right and what's wrong. That is so true. That is so so

643
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:57,500
true, but do you think that maybe

644
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:01,640
if someone's super powered, it was to know exactly what was right and wrong.

645
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,980
See my dad once told me we were we were playing a little league game and I was

646
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,840
praying that we were going to come back and win and my dad pulled me aside. He

647
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,220
was like why would they why would God choose to let your team win and not the

648
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:16,640
other team and I feel like we're so conflicted in this world. So we're

649
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,280
bringing God into this now. Well, God is the number one superhero of all time.

650
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,720
that's true. I guess the main superhero. He is the main superhero. Yeah, and what

651
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,120
if the superhero was anti God

652
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,920
would be low keys carry that would be more of a villain. I feel like than a

653
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,820
superhero. It depends on your your thought about God. I'm just saying that

654
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:39,380
it's things are so things are so polarizing right now that I don't think

655
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,640
it's super here would necessarily. Okay, wait. No, you know what here. I have a

656
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,320
question for you this one. I think you're uniquely

657
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,920
equipped to answer this one here. What can music fans expect in 2024? Oh wow,

658
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:57,840
let's just say I have a sneaking suspicion that Adele is going to drop

659
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,140
some serious heat.

660
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:05,540
I think that do you think pianos are going to make a comeback? I think 37 is

661
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,520
probably coming out. That's me guessing Adele's age wildly. She's probably a

662
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,360
little bit younger 35. Does she name her stuff out of for her age at the first

663
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,120
these couple. They definitely were. I don't know anything about Adele. To be

664
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,600
honest with you, what was the second question you asked? Are this piano is

665
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,700
going to come back pianos of music really? If you don't listen to the radio

666
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,240
that much, have you ever seen a producer flip a sample?

667
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,700
Yes, often with piano songs, oh my God, and he's doing it on the piano to do

668
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:36,400
you think we could see a new genre emerge in the next year? I do feel like

669
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,180
country and rap are fusing in a major way right now. I thought that already

670
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,000
happened. I thought that was happening even more now it's happening again.

671
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,120
Let's just say there's going to be some more country songs with some nice beats

672
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,880
behind it. I feel like my theory is I feel like we're going to see a new

673
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:53,920
genre that's not even two genres fused and it's just something completely new

674
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,160
that no music has ever been like before

675
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,400
ring tones ring to ring tones are probably going to be huge again. People

676
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,760
are going to start having ring tones again. I don't know. I still have a ring

677
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,440
ringtone. You still have a ringtone? Yeah, actually while you're pulling up

678
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:17,000
your ringtone, let me ask you about this. Cousins. Cousins. That's all it says.

679
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,880
That's all it says. You're very close with your cousins. I am very close with

680
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,120
my cousins, actually. I love all of my cousins very deeply, but I'm not like

681
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:28,440
super close personal friends with them. Yeah, well, I lived next to all of my

682
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,840
cousins growing up. My next door neighbor was my aunt, and then a little

683
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:40,440
down the road was my other aunt. So I had five cousins down the street and four

684
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,440
cousins who lived next door. Yeah, that's very weird. You're just literally

685
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,200
close to them. Yeah, literally and figuratively very close to my family.

686
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,280
This is my ringtone. Okay, let me hear it.

687
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,180
it's minions doing panda

688
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:10,240
and I did it like a long get that every single time you get a text. It's when I

689
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,160
have because I've got it like in college and I kept my I kept my phone on like

690
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,520
vibrate for a long time and then now when I wear headphones, it like pops up

691
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,440
on my oh yeah. You know why it's kind of a good one. It does make me answer. Oh

692
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:25,480
my God, where's the new me? We have the meme. This is the

693
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,880
next to me.

694
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:32,700
you guys, everybody take cash, cashier, your checks. Now, if you're listening on

695
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,920
audio only, I want you to open up your phone right now. I want you to take a

696
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,360
screenshot. I want you to start posting this with captions and make this catch on

697
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,680
as the next viral me. Wait, hold on, let's let's workshop one right now. I'm

698
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,040
hold on

699
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,080
okay, okay, wait when your teacher says the homework was is due

700
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:56,280
and it's yeah yeah, that's pretty good. Wow, if we break down each of the

701
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,160
components. See, I was going for kind of an angry guy. Yeah, so

702
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:02,400
you've got an angry guy with a soul patch and steam blowing out

703
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,400
of his ears as the head. That's the angry guy and the body here

704
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,440
is, I think, size double G breasts. Okay, what does it say

705
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,920
on the stomach? And that is a tummy rocker that says, "Come

706
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,400
shot with a dollar sign on the S." Okay, and she also, let me

707
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:25,640
just point out one thing here, also has one finger and one

708
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:29,920
thumb on a really small little spaghetti arm like a crab. Yeah,

709
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,720
would and then let's see these legs here. Yeah, so I just tried

710
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,360
to go with something simple, some legs with lines on them and

711
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,760
socks. Okay, I like that that kind of bases it and those are

712
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,640
not that is not hair. Those are lines. Yeah, well, it's a

713
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:47,160
drawing leg lines. Wow, those are leg lines. This guy's the

714
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,960
leg liner and here and let me let me just here's the next

715
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,400
topic here. Let's just combine these two because once you hear

716
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,640
but once you hear them combined, it's going to make a okay a lot of sense.

717
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:01,860
I'm sure corporate won't mind that how to deal with that termites and woke

718
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:06,460
culture. How to deal with term same way when you have to blow them the fuck up

719
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:08,120
yeah with fire. Well,

720
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:18,120
that's right. No, I would say for termites I'm for me. I think peanut

721
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:21,960
butter works peanut butter, peanut butter definitely works. I don't think

722
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,320
termites yeah termites because unless it's like I'm the type of guy. I don't

723
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,640
like to I don't like to look up an instructional thing on how to do

724
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,520
something. I'm a handyman. I do stuff myself. I'm not going to buy fucking

725
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,400
furniture from Ikea and follow the instruction manual. I build shit myself,

726
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,880
so when I'm getting rid of termites, I'm not going to go to an exterminator.

727
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:46,240
Say how do I do this on by the way exterminator exterminator termite? They

728
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:49,760
work with the termites yeah. It's literally a they're putting low more

729
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,320
cycle in your house cycle. They put eggs in there so that they have to come back,

730
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,840
but anyway, basically I'd probably use a straw to suck them up yeah and same with

731
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,360
woke cold. That's a good sound effect. Just get a strong

732
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,480
for the sound. Yeah, I want to eat that

733
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,360
yeah. I don't think that would actually be so good of a sound. Can we live

734
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:14,100
record and put stuff on it? No, no, it's not a thing. I know how there might be a

735
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,140
way, but I'm not going to try and figure it out. Can you do some like Reggie

736
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:19,300
lots of loops on it. I can do this

737
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:24,940
wow that's a record scratch yeah, yeah, yeah, but how would you deal with woke

738
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:25,420
culture?

739
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:32,800
See in in my in my opinion, I don't necessarily have many opinions that are

740
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,120
more important than like

741
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:39,160
what really matters to people. So like you know

742
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,960
like none of my none of my takes on anything

743
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:44,960
so

744
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:50,600
I'm okay with it.

745
00:49:50,600 --> 00:50:00,020
If you know if if what culture tries to take away like you know videos, then

746
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:00,340
I'll

747
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:04,680
they want videos to be gone. Oh man,

748
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:10,220
well, then I'm gonna have to get it. They try to take away videos like if

749
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:13,060
they try to make world culture takes away videos. They try to make videos,

750
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:13,880
not okay.

751
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:20,180
I'll get pretty upset about it. Yeah, I like video. I hope videos. I love

752
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,380
videos. I really love videos yeah

753
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:27,600
oh well in woke people when when you play a video

754
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,160
that's right screaming yeah.

755
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,960
What is that from

756
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,760
just screaming from D and D? It's from the Dungeons and Dragons and it'll make

757
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,200
of a like what is the screen? I just got it from Youtube yeah yeah it's a

758
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,840
thousand people dying. I

759
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,640
know it's a sound effect and

760
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:52,080
so let me let me let me just transition that last question. So I said I would

761
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,800
deal with termites and well culture using peanut butter.

762
00:50:54,800 --> 00:51:00,360
Let's just get right into this another question from corporate is peanut

763
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:04,600
butter based your cringe. I used to here's I you were doing your set yourself

764
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,440
stop for a little. I thought about this before I used to think it was based

765
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,240
nowadays. I think it's cringe well

766
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:20,160
Patrick, just take I didn't hear it, but I thought it made it was a completely

767
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,720
silent spit. I think that water bottle has been here for a very long time. No,

768
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,760
I bet that this morning

769
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:31,400
the spitting, but I had too much water.

770
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:31,900
oh

771
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:39,280
man that was more like a squirtle water gun type spit take than it was a

772
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,520
funny. You need to

773
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,000
be one. You need to press my bed. I did not know. I've never okay. I'm sure

774
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,960
I've never done a spit. Take no, no, we're not doing

775
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:55,720
doing now. No, no, this is my water and I need it to do it on the shelf of

776
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,440
technology. Don't do it on the shelf of technology. Do it in any way. You're

777
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,600
not supposed to have spit takes in here at all yeah. That was even one is to

778
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,040
that's one of the rules and here is our next topic from corporate rules. I

779
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,680
fucking hate rule. You hate rules. I hate rules too. That's why let me guess

780
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,040
you like rules. Joe likes rules. If we don't have rules, what are we? What are

781
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,000
we? What are we? What are we following rules? Don't have to be bad rules. We

782
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,640
don't have rules. What are we following? Yeah, I don't know. I wouldn't know

783
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:25,600
where to go man rules. Don't have to what about the leader? Yeah, what you

784
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:30,300
or the leader. You can make I make my own rules up. I do what I do what I want to

785
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,440
do, but I live the leader. Now I live by a coat. I'm the leader

786
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,500
your ass ain't the leader. I'm not the leader you're in general. No, you're not

787
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:42,460
the general. You don't see me as a leader. I don't see you as a leader. You

788
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,060
don't see me and follow my lead.

789
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:49,360
No damn what whose lead do you follow probably gods?

790
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:53,800
Yeah, I mean me too, but I thought I was like I think he's the one leader one

791
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:57,760
true leader, but there's okay. Here's a one true leader. I think we can really

792
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:01,060
because we're having a little bit of an argument here. Yeah, okay. I think maybe

793
00:53:01,060 --> 00:53:06,020
it's just a question we can really dig into. It's just discussions, discussions,

794
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,040
but what

795
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,940
what was it like long ago?

796
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:15,240
I like thinking about that. What was it like? I'm going to go question really

797
00:53:15,240 --> 00:53:19,680
fucking hate thinking about that. What was it like long ago? You know you think

798
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:22,600
about that you think about what it was like long ago, then you start to

799
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:29,080
do start to yearn right. I feel like a year in for what was long ago. You know

800
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,700
back in the day before they figured out how to make animals right or animals

801
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,760
figured out how to evolve correctly. They when the first animals, the first

802
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,380
multi cell, whatever's, they were just like things they weren't even they were

803
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,700
like sub plant. They were like they were like circles that would sit on the

804
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:48,740
ground. They were just pieces and they would they would just sit in the bottom

805
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:52,580
of the ocean. It would just be like a hot dog or like a pancake and it would

806
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,260
to sit there and if food went by it, then it would survive yeah and if it didn't

807
00:53:56,260 --> 00:54:01,380
isn't that a long, long time ago. That's what he means. I long ago, I was

808
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:04,300
thinking yeah. What was it like long ago? I was sort of thinking like nineteen

809
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,100
ten Ellis Island. Let's talk that yeah. I mean we can talk about that. That's

810
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:11,660
the beauty of discussion. Well, I'm as you guys might know I'm fascinated by

811
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:13,340
old maps. Really

812
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:20,540
what is it about old maps for you? I love if it's a place that I'm familiar

813
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:26,140
So New York, I got it with Boston after going to school there and I kind of have it with

814
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,500
Los Angeles a little bit.

815
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:34,700
I love to see that the streets that I walk on today still existed and served a purpose

816
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,700
way back when.

817
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,060
That's kind of magical, isn't it?

818
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,300
It is actually very magical.

819
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,300
That's actually pretty cool.

820
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,060
What was it like back then?

821
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:43,700
So New York changes a lot.

822
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,780
New York is kind of built around this rapid change.

823
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,460
Rapid transit too.

824
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,800
still historical. You know societies and bus on their landmarks started being

825
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:59,300
made people were tearing shit down willy nilly, whereas Los Angeles kind of has

826
00:54:59,300 --> 00:54:59,780
more

827
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:00,900
of a

828
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,940
steady like

829
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:13,060
okay here, okay, here, I'll say yeah, we're going to do we're going to do a

830
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,700
few more. We're going to love it because there's a few. I want to get are we

831
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,980
doing a speed around now with the last speedish round speedish around. I want

832
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,760
do I just want to get through all the I'll just go in order here. I'll skip

833
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,140
some of the ones that you know what no we'll do a lightning round. We're going

834
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:28,300
to do all the rest of them. Okay, I'm ready. Okay, can I get the third paper?

835
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:31,200
Yeah, the third paper is very important. Okay,

836
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:36,140
okay, so I'll just go down the line. Yeah, let's just let's just go around

837
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:39,400
each give a quick answer. It's not to be so quick, but quick

838
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:46,600
Joe, please quick the streaming wars. Whose side are you on? Oh my God, thank

839
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,820
thank God we didn't have thank God this is in the lightning round, because I'd

840
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:53,760
be here talking about this all day. Let me get into it,

841
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:59,440
because obviously I'm on the side of the streaming yeah for me. It's like I

842
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:00,160
always

843
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,540
kind of aligned with the young, the scrappy, the new kids on the block, the

844
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:11,980
people who really want to like show the fat cats what's for and that's why I am

845
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:15,300
throwing my way behind a little new service. So some people might not have

846
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:21,020
about yet called Max. I like Max Max has scrappy coming crazy. You're thinking

847
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:25,820
boomerang, but they also they are has it, though, also on that, but also it's on

848
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:29,820
both. There's a section on now there is no, but there's a scooby section and

849
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,460
it's called boomerang because it keeps you. They have Tom old Tom and Jerry's

850
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:37,180
as well. I can races if they got like a race. Some there I'm there. They have

851
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:41,580
the one with the evil guy next topic. Why can't race us every time? It's every

852
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:44,360
the hockey race. Whatever happened to chivalrous men,

853
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:48,720
you just got to look a little bit harder. Yeah, that's right there out

854
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,020
there. We're out there. We're waiting. There's three on your screen right.

855
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:55,380
Yeah, that's true. Well, let me actually let me throw something out there.

856
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:59,080
Maybe you know, because people always complain the men don't hold the door

857
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:03,460
anymore. Yeah right ever think about nowadays. You can get a job holding a

858
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,540
door at a hotel or at an apartment building. So why would you do it for

859
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,080
free or you can do it

860
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,040
Amy Yeah, well, I was going to say some people do it for free out in front of

861
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:19,140
the McDonald's. Yeah, actually they do it. They don't want to be doing it for

862
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:22,060
they do it on commission. Those people work for the McDonald's.

863
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:27,400
That's why they have a cup. Okay, here's one in a past generation

864
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:34,100
in a past generation. Guys like us would be rock stars.

865
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:41,860
so go ahead and discuss that. I mean it's not really up for discussion. There's

866
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:45,700
still time. The thing some guys would say that the podcast, the podcast boom is

867
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:51,140
the rock stars of today. Yeah, and you guys, I think, have you guys have a wait

868
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:51,920
no

869
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,140
yeah.

870
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:58,460
I would say that you guys have carved out this like incredible audience and

871
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:02,200
this incredible like loyal fan base. Wow, who holds you up as if you are rock

872
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:04,540
stars. What is going on in Ukraine

873
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:09,720
much don't even want to know. Yeah, next that sounded like a sound effect.

874
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,960
Water monsters.

875
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,580
Oh, I saw a few. You've seen some. Yeah, I wanted to. There's a video that

876
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:20,280
Caleb was talking about a water monster attacked a man. Oh yeah, that shark.

877
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:25,440
Yeah, sharks are water monsters. Orcas are now. Yes, the orcas, payacon orcas

878
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,880
or attacking. Yeah, why are you outcast?

879
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:34,560
What a movie. Whatever happened to cowboys. Cowboys are still around, but

880
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,860
you got to look a little bit. They are wearing little that's a really good

881
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:41,440
answer for a lot of little dangly things in front of their face, calling

882
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,640
themselves orville peck. I don't know if that's a cowboy or not. Is that the

883
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,080
tattoo guy? Maybe

884
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:51,480
that's Oliver Peck. What's the guy from ink master? I don't know orville peck

885
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:55,840
nevaro. He's like a gay cowboy who sings. Oh, I don't know if he's gay. I don't

886
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:59,240
know if it's a he. Okay, here's one this this trump bullshit.

887
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:02,920
We'll see we'll see how it goes. Yeah, we'll see all right.

888
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:09,060
what's wrong with doctors nowadays. They are too focused on the medicine and not

889
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:13,300
focused enough on creating a relationship. Yeah, it's not friendly

890
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:17,000
enough. I would say I would say that they really stepped up big during covid

891
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,800
yeah, and I would say that they're probably still reeling from the effects

892
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,840
of it. My doctor almost sent my medical bill to collections just because I forgot

893
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:29,040
to pay it. Wow, how long a lot of my bills are in I paid it right now today

894
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,820
and today was the day it was going to go to collections. A lot of minor in

895
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,820
selections right now and guess what you do you just ignore them. You ignore

896
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:41,420
them until they break down and cry calling you. What would you do if you

897
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:42,960
saw someone drinking nut milk?

898
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,460
What kind of nut yeah doesn't specify

899
00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:53,000
and I don't know I didn't write these not like I mean, okay, not like a human

900
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,100
semen, but I can like all mon you can kind of see what corporate was trying to

901
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:02,180
you under a very kind of spark, a funny little, a funny little riff, yeah, a

902
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:04,760
a little riff. Let's let's not give it. Let's yeah we're not going to engage

903
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:08,320
here. Why are so many people getting injured lately? Probably because I'm

904
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,660
hitting them. There's someone slipped a

905
01:00:10,660 --> 01:00:15,360
lot of people there. There's people that try to come by the office. They try to.

906
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:20,680
I know there's a bus stop near it, but I think that they are attacking my

907
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:24,240
fortress. I go out with a broom. I haven't had a serious injury in a while.

908
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:29,040
Me neither. Genetic splicing facts, it's fine facts. Yeah, right, let's let it

909
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,640
I'm let it what I'm going to do when I get home.

910
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:38,540
Oh, I can't discuss that because it's a Monday for me. It's a rod. I tuna fish.

911
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,580
I have some tuna fish. You have it with you know at home and then I'm going to

912
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:45,600
have another one of these guys. Okay, nice. We can't endorse that on the

913
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,940
short and culture. It's ice tea, art and culture. Y'all are in culture. Y'all

914
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,940
love it. Well, just I said, you know, I graffiti is art to me. Next question,

915
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,340
would you eat a rock? I ate one as a kid depends on how porous it is. Could

916
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:02,820
someone with ice powers defeat someone with fire powers like the ice freeze the

917
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:07,380
fire or what the ice ends on is it like a Voldemort Harry Potter vibe where

918
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:10,020
they're just going at each other straight up? Let's see it says someone

919
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:12,900
with ice powers and someone with fire powers because I think I started to

920
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,900
kill the rain ice powers could kill the fire guy. If he snuck up, if he snuck

921
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:20,380
up yeah, you're probably rocks could put out the same. The fire, though, is

922

Okay, what's this? The future of TV. That's again. Yeah, we're streaming.

933
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,240
Yeah, we covered that. I hope it's good. Would you adopt a baby from cringe

934
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:06,340

01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:18,140
Is injustice real? The game.

01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,100
Injustice. What to do when you are visited by an angel?

939
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:26,900
I can't even discuss that. See what the town would be like without you.

945
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,600

968
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:28,980
elves elves elves in general, yeah elves, Santa bro, Santa, bro, that's my answer

969
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,260
as well. How to deal with teachers who assign hella too much homework. I think

970
01:04:33,260 --> 01:04:37,380
we discussed this okay. We covered that with today's generation. Consider Homer

971
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:39,220
Simpson a good father. Hell, no

972
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:45,060
Homer, the Simpsons, lightning round lightning around Joe early, yes or no

973
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:46,460
early Simpsons, Homer have heart

974
01:04:49,060 --> 01:04:53,000
magic, the gathering should it based should it be a crime to lie. Yes,

975
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,660
whatever happened to cartoons. I think they're on the TV. I don't know what

976
01:04:56,660 --> 01:04:59,620
they cuss now. How come Thanksgiving is only once per year?

977
01:04:59,620 --> 01:05:04,260
Oh my God, I wish we touched upon that earlier.

978
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:10,280
History we could have really go ahead. Go in on that go in on it a little bit

979
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,940
then. Okay, so if you know the history of Thanksgiving, like I do

980
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:20,600
how many people know where Thanksgiving comes from? It comes from a little guy

981
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:21,640
called Squanto

982
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:29,480
and Squanto pulled up. This is what they don't teach you in school. Squanto

983
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:34,260
pulled up with the turkey and the cornucopia and he said we should do this

984
01:05:34,260 --> 01:05:39,100
every single day, but these fucking whiteys were like yeah, oh yeah, yeah, of

985
01:05:39,100 --> 01:05:41,580
course, and they never pulled up again.

986
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:45,260
So we were supposed to have Thanksgiving every single day.

987
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:51,540
My family does Thanksgiving in a restaurant. Really? I did that one or two

988
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:57,460
times. So we could do that. I do that. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, but you know

989
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,760
what? I'm here. Here's the thing. Here's another. Here's another little thing

990
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:06,940
about Thanksgiving. Okay, if you are a Canadian American citizen, guess what to

991
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:11,620
thanksgivings? Yeah, you just have to travel. That's a trick question from

992
01:06:11,620 --> 01:06:14,820
corporate. Also, they wanted me to reveal the truth. You got to be. You got to be

993
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:19,440
traveling. Did cavemen have stores caveman's had caves? There was some

994
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:22,160
trading. There's definitely some trading or going on yeah

995
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:28,200
uga buga paper straws. Come on man. Are these things still around? They are

996
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,080
disgusting me when I go to a woke restaurant

997
01:06:31,080 --> 01:06:36,240
yeah, you need to dip it in water. First, he's sucking penis at the

998
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,000
restaurant. See I'm okay with the paper straw as long as it's something that

999
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,880
I'm going to drink quickly. No yeah people don't talk about this, but paper

1000
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:43,620
drink beer.

1001
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:48,860
That's what I like a paper straw for I'd like a paper cup drink my beer. See why

1002
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:52,340
don't we put this wax coating that's on paper cups inside the paper straws to

1003
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:56,540
only mother fucking shit. I think I think you're right yeah to have just

1004
01:06:56,540 --> 01:07:01,320
created the greatest, you know in the movie, the new it movie when it opens

1005
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,680
the first one, it starts in the little kid. He makes a boat out of paper and he

1006
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:08,800
covers it with wax, paraffin wax yeah and it's like that maybe that was the

1007
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:13,140
he was going to do that to straws and he got eaten by my God and that's the

1008
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:18,640
origin of why paper straws suck so damn bad eaten it e a n

1009
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:26,260
by the clown. He got eaten it e a n. He got eaten by the clown and now he can't

1010
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:31,920
make eat. He can't oh yeah, I just got it. He can no longer make it. He can no

1011
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,640
longer make pennies off of his wise discovery.

1012
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:39,100
Okay, just just a couple. We're just blowing every single thing. Why is it

1013
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:44,680
wrong to blow something up? Yes, no, if it's a controlled demolition. Yeah, no,

1014
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:48,560
I would say it depends on the context. Okay, fair. Don't do what matters in

1015
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:53,440
explosions is the age of Mario over. Yes, no, I think there's probably a sequel

1016
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,800
coming. Whoa, not right and then I got the last one here. This is we got we

1017
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,600
went through these two pages. We have the third page that corporate sent us

1018
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:05,280
and this is the biggest one we have yet to talk about reddit.

1019
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:05,780
reddit,

1020
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:09,940
which is why joe. Why don't you go ahead and explain what's going on with reddit

1021
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,800
right now something about the api reddit is now

1022
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:19,660
the sub reddits are down because they don't want to let people use

1023
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:25,340
third party apps in order to like access the

1024
01:08:25,340 --> 01:08:29,900
website. Say what third party apps are no longer

1025
01:08:34,820 --> 01:08:39,960
is our is our subreddit blacked out right now. Can you black it out? Yeah, I think

1026
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,880
we should participate in this. We need to participate in this blackout. What is

1027
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,920
this? What are you looking at? What are these numbers? Destiny's a kind of grab.

1028
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:48,940
He just likes. Oh, it's just all the ones that are the

1029
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:53,580
blacked out subreddits. Oh, will you go ahead and black cars out? See I was

1030
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:57,820
pretty upset because that I don't I don't know how to do it, but once I've

1031
01:08:57,820 --> 01:09:01,380
learned how to do it, oh my God, our slash shower thoughts is down. Our

1032
01:09:01,940 --> 01:09:06,380
filmmakers, shower thoughts deleted my last few shower thoughts, so I'm not too

1033
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,620
mad that they're down. Yeah, I think a lot of these subreddits deserve to be

1034
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:10,800
shut down forever.

1035
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,380
Our slash one right here, street where did how am I gonna know that nature is

1036

1037
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:23,940
Oh my God, oh my God, yeah, they're gonna take a huge hit. Alright, well, I'm

1038
01:09:23,940 --> 01:09:28,700
glad we were able to shed some light on this. Yeah, the NBA one is down now and

1039
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:32,400
it's the finals today. What the fuck our slash martial arts has also been taken

01:09:32,400 --> 01:09:33,140

1043
01:09:36,060 --> 01:09:43,760
So our site wait, our slash Asian beauty has been is been blacked out. Oh my God,

1044
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:48,220
when does it end? When will it stop? Holy crap, it's crazy how much stuff people

1045
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:52,700
like. So what everyone should do now is go and check out

1046
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:58,460
home planet and watch some of the funny planet planet video that Joe is half of

1047
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:03,300
Home Planet that makes his funny videos. Yep, you've seen Alex on here.

1048
01:10:03,300 --> 01:10:07,360
You've seen Joe now. What's Home Planet's Twitter? Home underscore underscore

1049
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:10,700
planet. Okay, so when you're on the Twitter homepage, you can just add it

1050
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:14,040
to the end of the URL. It says twitter.com/home normally. So then you

1051
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,660
can just add... Yes, underscore underscore planet. Wow. Underscore underscore planet.

1052
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:19,060
Pretty cool. And it's on YouTube and there's a website too, I guess,

1053
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,940
that I had forgotten about. Homeplanetvideo.com. Look at that. Guys,

1054
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:25,800
if you have any design notes for our website... You can send them over

1055
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,640
Joe and speaking of design notes, I have one for you right now, Joe. Why don't

1056
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:36,880
you add a section on your website that says live show? Oh shit. Yeah, yeah,

1057
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:42,140
because this guy right here is going to be joining us along with philip and

1058
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:47,740
philip and alex and pierce and we're all going to be doing a sketch show of

1059
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:52,160
funny comedy. Um, and I've been, should we maybe watch some home planet videos

1060
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,840
and like mystery science theater them? It could be pretty awesome. It's going

1061
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,640
to be at Littlefield on I believe July 14th. July 14th at 8. I can buy tickets at 30pm.

1062
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:04,960
Swagpoop.com/shows and maybe eventually on the HomePlanet website if they get their shit

1063
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,280
together. HomePlanet.com/whatthe1show. And Pierce does not have a website so. I think

1064
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:11,340
he might. I feel like he should have one. I think he definitely does actually. World

1065
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:16,760
biggest army of ports of call. Go on-is. It's going to be really fun. It's going to be great.

1066
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,780
You're not going to want to miss it. And if you don't live in New York you're probably

1067
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:24,820
we going to be traveling here? You will be taking the Amtrak Sella train. Do

1068
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:28,520
we know how fast as you can? Do we know how they're selling the tickets? I have

1069
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:31,420
like somebody just bought ten tickets for a hundred and ninety two dollars.

1070
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:35,540
I really I really need this to go well. I really need the cash. Oh, and Julia,

1071
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:36,180
what day is
