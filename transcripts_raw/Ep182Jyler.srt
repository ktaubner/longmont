39
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,720
select that we're making

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,400
scott a frog test a journey operation operation frog testic voyage and we're

41
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
We're gonna have a website soon.

42
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,240
- Yeah, we'll see about that.

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,400
- And there's gonna be Flash games on the website.

44
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,640
- We're gonna, I do wanna make a website

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,840
and put a slot machine on it.

46
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,680
- Yeah.

47
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,500
- I wanna make a slot machine so bad.

48
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,120
- You know what I wanna do is figure out how to embed

49
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,080
like the old Flash games from Addicting Games onto it.

50
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,360
- Oh, that's sick.

51
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,560
- That's a good idea.

52
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,480
We have one section that's called--

53
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,600
- Virtual Buddy.

54
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,080
- Games Corner, and then we just have every game

55
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,800
from Addicting Games on the website.

56
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,640
- Doesn't Flash not work anymore though?

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,480
- Oh, true.

58
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,680
- Didn't they get rid of Flash?

59
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
All of our fans are on XP.

60
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,680
That's true.

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
Yeah, I don't think...

62
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,680
They're way behind.

63
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
Yeah.

64
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,680
Yeah, is it browser?

65
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
Is it based on the browser you have, I guess?

66
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,680
There's no way they just like pressed a button and all flash turned off.

67
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm sure they did do that.

68
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,680
I don't think they did that.

69
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
That's exactly what they did.

70
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
I don't think they did that.

71
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,680
That doesn't make any sense.

72
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,280
I don't know if it's based on the browser.

73
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,400
I assume if you didn't update your browser, you're probably still a flash.

74
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
Why did they do that?

75
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I don't know.

76
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
It's really stupid.

77
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,400
There's really no reason.

78
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
So much history.

79
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,400
Yeah.

80
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
possible quiz can you play the impossible quiz?

81
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
I think you can still play a lot of those

82
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
a lot of the stuff on like newgrounds is like

83
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
I think they have like their own thing that like

84
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
you can play like it's like it runs flash

85
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
and like

86
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
some virtual thing yeah yeah exactly

87
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
so we get that for our website

88
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
yeah so that's gonna blow

89
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
a big part of the budget for the stuff

90
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
we want to do this year

91
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
everything else is canceled and we're doing this

92
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
put that one in the what? remember the

93
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
etnies downhill skateboarding game?

94
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I played bowman.

95
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Bowman was good.

96
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,400
That was a bowman world champ.

97
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
Slap the monkey is gone?

98
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,080
Slap the monkey, that was a funny show.

99
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,060
I remember telling my dad I was playing slap the monkey and he said what?

100
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,060
What the hell are you even talking about?

101
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,600
Have you guys ever played with a line rider?

102
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,600
Yeah.

103
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Is that one?

104
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
I'm supposed to teach you that.

105
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,600
Dude, line rider was tight.

106
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Line rider was really fun.

107
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,600
That was sick.

108
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Yeah.

109
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,600
That was a good idea.

110
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Remember they had a promotional line rider for hot rod?

111
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
What's that?

112
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Did you say emotional line rider?

113
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Promotional.

114
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Oh, okay.

115
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,240
I mean, I've seen an emotional line rider.

116
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,560
There's a proposal on line rider.

117
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,940
- Yeah, there's the ones where you skate the whole thing

118
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,840

119
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,800

00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,480

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,360
and they're in Dallas.

135
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,640
you're there in their dirt you could just say do do do do do do do do do do do do

136
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,560
those are the German does I think what aired dirty dots those are the German

137
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,040
thugs you think you know you know no dirty dust the German thugs those are

138
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,560
the German does Oh German those yeah German thugs I was thinking that that

139
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,920
fellow from Rocky dirty dice no the blonde guy Ivan Drago yeah is he German

140
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,900
nope okay Dolph Lundgren but he reminds me of a German thug Dolph Lundgren has

141
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,120
never played a German guy in his life he's German in real life that's I didn't

142
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,440
say the only thing was Russians yeah or or Americans yep it is I love when he

143
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,600
plays America it's cool that they got him a scientist I think he's an actor no

144
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,960
he's also he's got like he's got like some of her he's an actor in movies

145
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,360
actually any Arnold movie do they ever try to say that he's anything other than

146
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,860
an American? He's from California. The best guy that they do that with is

147
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:57,640
Jean-Claude Van Damme. Oh yeah. Where they try to make him like Cajun or like Canadian or

148
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:05,640
something to explain it. Yeah. So cool. The best is Seagal because he tries to be the other things. He's an

149
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:09,000
American trying to be the other things. No, I like it when they have an accent and

150
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,240
they try to like make it, they try and cast him as something else. But they also don't know how to not do their accent.

151
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:21,360
Exactly. There is a block of Europe where if you're from like Spain, France, or the UK,

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,740
you can do an American accent pretty believably if you're a good enough actor. If you are

153
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,060
from the eastern part of Europe, you sound mentally disabled.

154
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,020
Or if your job is to kick and get kicked in the face a hundred times every day.

155
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,980
I am from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

156
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,100
No, I said French is good.

157
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
I was Israeli.

158
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
Oh yeah, well, this is...

159
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
Every time I try to do...

160
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
No, Israeli's got it down pat.

161
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,100
No, never mind. Yeah, that wonder...

162
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,100
That wondrous woman. She can't do it.

163
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,100
No, no. Which is like, why would Wonder Woman be from Israel?

164
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,100
Well, there's a clear answer for that.

165
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,100
What is it?

166
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,100
Press pause.

167
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,100
Intelligent damn females.

168
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Call back.

169
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,100
That's right, baby.

170
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
People are gonna like that.

171
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,300
Yep. Everything was leading up to that joke and the show is done.

172
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,700
But do you think, because she's supposed to be from another planet, right?

173
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,900
Yeah, Israel's another planet.

174
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,500
No, she's supposed to be Greek in Wonder Woman. She's a Greek goddess.

175
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,700
Oh, no.

176
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,700
Well, I guess that makes sense that she has an accent then.

177
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,100
I'd be pissed if I was Greek.

178
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
I would be.

179
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Are you kidding me?

180
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
It would create less confusion in my life.

181
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,100
First hot woman ever given to...

182
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:37,100
She's maybe like the worst actor I've ever seen in my life.

183
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,100
She's maybe worse than like people on the battlefield.

184
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:44,700
Maybe worse than like people who make like YouTube short films and stuff.

185
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Like she's maybe one of the worst I've ever seen.

186
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,700
Did she do something? Was she like an Olympic athlete before she was in there?

187
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,700
No, I think she was a model.

188
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
She was in the beauty Olympics.

189
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Oh my goodness, fucking disgusting.

190
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,700
I hate this idea that beautiful women can be actresses.

191
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,700
Yeah.

192
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,700

210
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:09,340
Japanese accent. That's like such a gimme. That's so obvious. That's really

262
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:02,660
I didn't get killed by my stepdad. Yeah, Caleb got thrown into a river by his stepdad. We did, I remember one

263
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,940
time we had this like drainage ditch behind our house. It wasn't even a

264
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:10,980
drainage ditch. It was like a just like a it must have at one point been a

265
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:14,180
drainage ditch and then they like stopped it up and there was a hurricane

266
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,900
and so all of a sudden there's this like crazy river behind our house just filled

267
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:22,340
with mud and my mom made us play in it and me and my brother got really sick

268
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:26,020
for two weeks. That's tight. Yeah we definitely had some kind of worm go up

269
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,140
our wee-wees. Yeah it's like when Steve-O jumped into the swamp of poop.

270
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,380
I mean this was like a hurricane so it's every it's not worth to like touch that

271
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,060
water at the lowest point in the entire town and my mom is I mean every single

272
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,700
dog shit that had happened in the last six months yeah every dead animal every

279
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,380

292
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
He's doing something.

293
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,540
Was that some kind of reverse Millie Rock?

294
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,540
What is that?

295
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540

296
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,300
Doing a high Millie Rock?

297
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,700
I'm trying to put my arm around Patrick.

298
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,700
It's my friend.

299
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,700
You keep missing.

300
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,180
It's completely straight and at 45 degrees.

301
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,740
You keep missing every single time.

302
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,660
Well, because you keep running away from me.

303
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
You're skittish.

304
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,660
That is on you a little bit, Patrick.

305
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
I am skittish.

306
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,660
Yeah.

307
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:37,560
What? I heard that Nazis hated the skittish people. I like that I said that,

308
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,460
like I gasped like I had a good idea before I said that. Yeah. To me it seemed

309
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,020
more like you gasped, like you were scared of what came out of your

310
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,460
brain. Yeah. Yeah. You're terrified of the darkness you ride. That was a dark

311
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:54,860
thought. Yeah. That was seriously dark. And it wasn't, I'm not saying that Jews are

312
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,920
skittish I'm saying what rhymes with you wait hold on what huh let's cut let's

313
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,480
clip that clip that I think that's a way better joke if you're saying that Jews

314
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,640
are skittish if you're trying to rhyme it with Yiddish that's stupid I know

315
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,380
yeah no you had it right on accident maybe it was on purpose and you guys oh

316
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,140
my there's gonna be a coffee mug is gonna drop I'm gonna why are you making

317
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,380
You're making fun of me being all blue and you're all black.

318
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,820
I had white shoes on.

319
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,300
I got white socks on.

320
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,300
I don't know.

321
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
It's not all black.

322
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,300
This is a blue hat.

323
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,300
You're blacked up.

324
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,300
That's a black hat.

325
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,300
That's not a blue hat, yeah.

326
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,300
Not in this light.

327
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,300
That looks even more-

328
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,020
If you go somewhere else that might be a blue hat, but here, nope.

329
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:39,940
Maybe if you went into a really blue room that might be a pretty blue hat.

330
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,940
Yeah.

331
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:45,020
If you went onto a blue version of the sun, I could believe it.

332
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,020
Maybe.

333
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,020
Maybe.

334
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,020
Maybe.

335
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:52,100
I think it's okay to be all blacked up I don't know what's wrong with being all

336
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,860
blacked up I think it's cool I think it's perfectly fine. Blacked up is like

337
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:04,300
what British people say for blackface. Really? Yeah. Oh well you're really blacked up for sure then.

338
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:10,700
You're blacked up. They're calling me Bo Selecta. I'm blued up but that's okay.

- There he goes.

344
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:41,160

345
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,000

00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,000
- Matt Lucas.

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,380
- From the Doran family, whose name's Patrick.

350
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,220
- Yeah.

351
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,260
- That guy, there's a really fucking scary picture of him

352
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,200
in like, he's dressed up like a black woman.

353
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,040
- You think that's scary?

354
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,180
- That's scary?

355
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,540
- Well no, it's just they use prosthetics.

356
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:03,120
They use prosthetics and it looks insane.

357
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,660
It's like very uncanny valley.

358
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,580
Oh, I'm sure that's what scares you.

359
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,080
Yeah.

360
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,160
[LAUGHTER]

361
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,140
No, I'm not scared of that anymore.

362
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,000
[LAUGHTER]

363
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,500
CBT.

364
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:26,480
[LAUGHTER]

365
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,120
You're something else.

366
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,720
We're all something else today.

367
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,120
Yeah, I know.

368
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,820
We're all behaving a little differently.

369
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:37,620
day after Valentine's Day. We all got that Valentine's Day hangover. Oh yeah. You know

370
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,940
what it is. I'm so drained of cum that my white blood cells went down. Oh my god, I ate so much

371
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,740
of my girlfriend's chocolate that I bought her yesterday. All of it. I had corned beef hash

372
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:58,420
yesterday. That's unrelated, but I did shape it in a heart. I ate two cheeseburgers. For dinner?

373
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,780
That was your Valentine's Day dinner? You made Jana want to eat two hamburgers?

374
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:04,820
They were cheeseburgers.

375
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:11,300
[Laughter]

376
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,060
Jana wants to fast and eat these!

377
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,420
Wants to fast and eat these!

378
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,920
Oh!

379
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,100
I didn't even finish the second one. I got so upset stomach.

380
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,140
Did you go to a restaurant or did you make burgers at home?

381
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,380
I made burgers at home. I made some smash burgers.

382
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,580
[Laughter]

383
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,380
Made one with a...

384
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,660
Two cheeseburgers?

385
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,160
Yeah.

386
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,140
I don't like you berating me for my food decisions.

387
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,900
Yeah, why not?

388
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,740
Because of what I've seen you do in this world.

389
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,220
That's true.

390
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:42,980
But yeah, I did eat two cheeseburgers and then I was too asleep to do anything else.

391
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,780
I got knocked out by the red meat.

392
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,980
I did drink cold brew last night so I could hang out still.

393
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,220
That was a crazy move on my part.

394
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:54,020
I drank cold brew concentrate because I was falling asleep.

395
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
You need to get into normal coffee.

396
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,220
I don't know why you thought I'm going to stop drinking Buster Energy

397
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:02,340
instead I'm gonna drink like the poison version of coffee.

398
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,220
- I would say it's a little better than Monster.

399
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,060
- No, you put--

400
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,740
- It's definitely better than Monster, but it's--

401
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,700
- You put a shot of the cold brew in,

402
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,020
and then you mix it with water.

403
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,980
- Yeah, but you don't do that.

404
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,820
- Yeah, I do.

405
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,640
- No, you don't do that.

406
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,620
- Well, why'd you just lie then?

407
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,620
And you said you were drinking up

408
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,100
just the concentrate straight.

409
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:18,940
- I didn't say that.

410
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
- Yeah, it's you, oh, running back.

411
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,180
- You might not do that all the time,

412
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,820
but I feel like once every three days

413
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,900
that I talk to you, you're like,

414
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,940
yeah, I drank way too,

415
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,780
I had like half cold brew concentrate,

416
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,300
half water this morning.

417
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,860
- Yeah, sometimes I don't cut it right.

418
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,500
- Yeah, I just drink normal coffee.

419
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,460
- He doesn't like normal coffee.

420
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,740
You like the shit with the iguana on it.

421
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,060
- Yeah, the chameleon?

422
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,900
- Yeah.

423
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,100
- Chameleon cold brew.

424
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,180
- You like that damn iguana coffee.

425
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,140
- Dude, the iguana?

426
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:45,980
- Yeah.

427
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,800
- He's good.

428
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,260
- That shit'll make your doo-doo change color.

429
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,100
- Oh, it did?

430
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,060
- Oh yeah.

431
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,260
- Before I got used to it, you know,

432
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,420
like when you first start drinking coffee

433
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,180
and like your shits are just horrible.

434
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,740
your eyes start bugging other, going different directions.

435
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,580
You put out a doo-doo that blends into the porcelain.

436
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,820
- Big shout out to the Chameleon Coffee.

437
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,660
- Big shout out.

438
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:06,660
- It's so, they got that cinnamon vanilla one.

439
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,620
You mix that with water, it's not that good,

440
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:10,940
but if you mix it with like milk, oat milk.

441
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,300
- Do you guys think we could get sponsored by Folgers?

442
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,020
- Yeah. - Yes.

443
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:15,860
- I would love to get sponsored by Folgers.

444
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,660
- I wanna get sponsored by Cafe Bustelo.

445
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,140
- We're gonna do that Folgers incest commercial

446
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,740
over with each other. - I feel like Cafe Bustelo,

447
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,340
it's like the worst coffee in the world,

448
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,940
I drink it all the time, it's dirt cheap,

449
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:27,900
and I do feel like one of these days I'm gonna open it up

450
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,500
and there's gonna be like a hidden brick of cocaine in it

451
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,260
that fell off of the thing.

452
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,380
That's the whole reason that coffee fucking exists.

453
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,220
- I don't wanna buy anything other than like Folgers

454
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,560
or Bestella because I don't wanna like find out

455
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,780
that I like good coffee and have to buy it.

456
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,620
- Yeah.

457
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,780
- Dude, it's not good.

458
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:46,220
The highest shelf coffee I'll get,

459
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,740
sometimes when I'm at Dunkin, I'll grab a bag.

460
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,580
I'll grab a bag of beans.

461
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,100
- Yeah, sometimes some Dunkin coffee I'll have.

462
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,420
- 'Cause I'm like, I like Dunkin coffee.

463
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:56,780
Yeah, there's no way you can trick me into getting something that has flavor notes.

464
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,780
No.

465
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,780
Not happening.

466
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:05,380
Either Joe or Alex or one of, or Neil, one of my fucking, one of my crazy roommates buys

467
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,940
that Café du Monde.

468
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,940
What's that?

469
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:08,940
Oh, that's the one with the chicory root in it?

470
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,940
The stuff with the orange tin.

471
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,140
Yeah, like the stuff with flavor in it.

472
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,140
I drank it.

473
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
Couldn't be me.

474
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,700
I drank, I made a pot one time for like everyone in the apartment with that and I drank it

475
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,220
I was so afraid after drinking it.

476
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,500
- Literally, I bought one tin and it sent my butt cheeks

477
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
to Neptune, it was really, really bad.

478
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,140
- I think training yourself to like really shitty foods

479
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,880
and drinks that are really cheap is like the closest thing

480
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,500
you can be to being a Buddhist monk without being one.

481
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,340
I think it's a really important thing to do in your life.

482
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,940
- Rather than do all that other stupid shit.

483
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,500
- Yeah, exactly.

484
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,540
Yeah, living at what, a castle on a mountain?

485
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,980
- Don't even get me started on monks, bro.

486
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,820
- I would hate living in the beautiful mountains.

487
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,460
- You don't need to shave your head.

488
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,080
- Yeah, and I have to get my balls hit

489
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,780
with a hammer every day or something

490
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,580
with a block of concrete.

491
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,820
- That's what monks have to do.

492
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,860
- And then one day, Bruce Wayne shows up,

493
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,180
we gotta turn him into Batman, great.

494
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,660
- Plus I can't get no damn pussy.

495
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,260
Ain't no damn pussy on the mountain.

496
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,100
- Yes sir.

497
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,720
- What I gotta do, fuck some leaves?

498
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,960
- The Yeti.

499
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,300
That's what the Yeti's for.

500
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,940
- That's why they keep the Yeti all chained up.

501
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,580
- If you had to keep the Yeti.

502
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,460
- They just take turns fucking that other Yeti.

503
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,140
you get you can't go in this room this is the most sacred room in the monastery

504
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:27,100
we have a sacred statue and there's a serious sacred thing and we have a

505
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:34,500
bluetooth speakers in there. We left our Halloween soundscape on.

506
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:39,980
Somebody's meditating so hard that their stomach is growling because we haven't eaten in years.

507
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
No!

508
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,460
Somebody's watching a movie on their iPhone in there.

509
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
I don't know what that is.

510
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,460
I gotta go in.

511
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,460
I gotta go in and stop them.

512
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
They're not allowed to watch movies.

513
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,460
Yeah.

514
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,460
Hey, hey, stop watching that movie.

515
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,460
Stop watching the wampa scene.

516
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
Oh, stop watching the movie.

517
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Everybody's just joining in, fucking the yeti.

518
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,460
I would love to see the yeti get gangbanged.

519
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:05,460
It's what he deserves for the havoc he's wreaked on our world.

520
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:08,780
Oh my god, he's eaten so many plane wrecked.

521
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,420
- Don't get me started on that damn Yeti.

522
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,060
- Yeah, and you know he's actually Cain.

523
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,900
- Yeah.

524
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,720
- From Cain and Abel.

525
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,560
- No, that's Bigfoot.

526
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:15,400
- No, I think he's Abel.

527
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,220
- That's Bigfoot.

528
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,060
- I think any of those--

529
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:17,900
- He's Abel, that's why he got one arm.

530
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,940
- No, the Yeti's not Abel.

531
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,300
- The Yeti ain't Abel, bro.

532
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,140
- Don't be stupid.

533
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:21,980
- Don't be an idiot.

534
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,420
- He's able to get fucked by me.

535
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,780
- Bro, the Yeti is Cain in a can of goose.

536
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,740
- Bigfoot is Cain.

537
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,580
Bigfoot is Cain.

538
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,400
- No.

539
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
- The Yeti's a different thing.

540
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,080
- No.

541
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,680
I mean the yet is just an ape monster

542
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:38,180
no real yeah yeah big foot is actually a biblical guide. Yeah,

543
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:43,120
that's just a monkey. That's just a big cold monkey. That's just a monkey with

544
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,520
an ice power. Yeah, there's people with ice powers in the world. Yeah, they were

545
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,920
in the Bible, but they cut those pages out yeah, you got to peace out because

546
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,740
they were too scary. Yeah, yeah, the Apofrica, the sky high

547
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:05,700
a chapter here. I love the apocryphal text. I don't know how to pronounce it either.

548
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:11,980
Apocrypha. No, they are very sad. They have that one where they're like Jesus was

549
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,860
actually he was gay. Yeah, that was cool. I love the ones where they cut it out

550
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,340
because it was too scary. They have the shit with the Nephilim and stuff. Back in

551
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:25,940
the old days, there were three hundred foot tall giants that ate everybody and

552
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,700
the fucked angels all the time and they're like yeah. We can't we can't

553
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,060
have this in our book. Yeah, this is not it's like edit. It's like editing a

554
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,280
movie for an airplane or the yeah, exactly we can't and also by the kid in

555
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:42,620
the back row like see this on somebody's yeah exactly and angels were a and

556
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:48,240
angels were also a big fly the the never soft eyeball. That's what an angel

557
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,240
looked like yeah, the yeah and also it's also good. They're also ones where

558
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,340
it'll be like it's just about a guy who's like yeah. I saw the end of the

559
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,920
world and here's exactly how it

560
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,080
happened and all this stuff and

561
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,120
it's like well that stayed in.

562
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,560
So not all of it though.

563
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,400
But a lot of it in Revelation and

564
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,400
it's pretty cool man.

565
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,400
It is pretty cool but there's

566
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,920
other stuff where it's like I

567
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
forget there's a guy whose name

568
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,600
begins with a Z and there's one

569
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,600
Zorgan.

570
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
It's Zorgan yeah.

571
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,440
Zorgan the terror mantor.

572
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,880
It's just like he's like he's a

573
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,640
tormentor and a terrorist and he

574
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,280
fucked God's butt.

575
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,280
Shut up.

576
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,280
God and his book. He doesn't exist.

577
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,280
And he flipped off Jesus too.

578
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
No.

579
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,280
And you don't even want to know what he did to Abraham.

580
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
What did he do to Abe Lincoln?

581
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,280
Both.

582
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,280
Sheesh. He shot Abe Lincoln.

583
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Yeah. People forget about that.

584
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,280
He possessed John Wilkes Booth.

585
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,280
Dude, that needs to be a Transformers thing.

586
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,280
Zorgon the Terramenter?

587
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,280
No. We're done with Zorgon the Terramenter.

588
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,280
I don't know.

589
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,280
The apocryphal text. He's six feet tall.

590
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:59,280
Hitler's the Dead Sea Scrolls. And he's six feet, and the worst part, he's six feet tall.

591
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,280
That is what would happen in the Bible.

592
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:12,280
And verily a giant strode into town. He was five feet eleven inches. That's so cool.

593
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,780
He towered over the villagers and he picked up their crops and he said,

594
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,500
you can't get this you can't get this you shall not get this. That's why if you say

595
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,100
nanananaboo boo you acquire the mark of the beast and you go to hell immediately

596
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,420
mm-hmm they should do a Transformers with the Dead Sea Scrolls where it

597
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,780
reveals that the Transformers were in the Bible. I hope that's the next one

598
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,260
that's what they did that it with a Beyblade. Oh really? Yeah Moses like part

599
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,220
the Red Sea with the Beyblade or something. Oh I remember that! That's so sick!

600
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,780
That's basically what Yu-Gi-Oh is too. Yeah. But Yu-Gi-Oh is like Egyptian right?

601
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:53,780
Aren't they all white in that show? Yeah of course it's a Japanese show.

602
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:58,260
It's anime, everybody's white in anime. Except for Bobobo.

603
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,260
Yeah it's true. But aren't the Yu-Gi-Oh's...

604
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:05,940
Aren't the Yu-Gi-Oh's all Egyptians?

605
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,620
Well it's about... No they're all Japanese.

606
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:13,460
They're all white Japanese. You want me to, you expect me to believe there's a...

607
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:17,140
But they have Egyptian ancestors. Oh, you expect me to believe there's a

608
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:23,140
Japanese Egyptian guy named Joey Wheeler? No, he's from Brooklyn. Oh. I don't think he's from,

609
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,740
I think, I don't think he's from Brooklyn. You expect me to believe there's a Japanese guy named

610
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:36,660
Yu-Gi-Oh? Nope. No chance. Nope. Most of them, Steve, that's a pretty popular Japanese name.

611
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
Steve Japanese

612
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,960
Yeah, that's his name as most that's the most of the names in Japan

613
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,340
Yeah, Tom is also a pretty Japanese name in my brain. Mm-hmm Tom Stevens

614
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:56,100
He's Japanese like is that like giant like Chinese where when you come to America you get some brand new fucking name

615
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,700
I don't know where you go. That's fucked up. You show up and you're like, no, it's red. It's cool

616
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,620
I would love to be able to pick a new name

617
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,220
that's like a cartoon character something from the country that I'm going to.

618
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:10,260
Yeah, but that's only if you pick that like I don't know like it's like sometimes you

619
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,140
just get what the name translates to.

620
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,140
Sometimes, well yeah sometimes you just get what the name sounds like.

621
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:16,620
It's not what it sounds like.

622
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,260
There's a kid in my high school his name was Hercules.

623
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,260
See that's sick.

624
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,260
That is beef.

625
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,260
Again, cartoon character.

626
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,260
Yeah.

627
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,020
Look every, every, every.

628
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,140
White Americans really got the worst names man.

629
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,140
Yeah.

630
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,140
They really got fucked.

631
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
Caleb, Cameron.

632
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,260
- All that shit is just like,

633
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,260
we've just been in this stupid country too long.

634
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,260
We just have the most fucked up stupid names

635
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,580
that have just been passed on.

636
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,340
- Yeah, but then people start to make up their,

637
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,460
like it's played out to make fun of it now,

638
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,900
but like Kaylin and like--

639
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,820
- Is that Irish?

640
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,820
- No, like K-A-Y-L-I-G-H-N,

641
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,340
or like Traley.

642
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,420
- G-H-N?

643
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,300
- Well, Traley's--

644
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,060
- Wait, K-A-Y-L-I-G-H-N?

645
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,540
- Yeah, you have to--

646
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
- What? That's not a name.

647
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:06,260
- Or like, or Giler.

648
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,100
- Or Barler.

649
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,580
- The worst example.

650
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,020
- Or Tramila.

651
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,100
- Tray, Kaylin, I've seen spelled like that before.

652
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,940
- You've never seen it G-N-H at the end?

653
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,020
Or G-H-N?

654
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,100
- I think I might have been being dyslexic, but yes.

655
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,420
- Yeah, okay.

656
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,500
- I've seen it spelled like that.

657
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,860
- You saw Kayla.

658
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,700
- No.

659
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,540
- And then you added a bunch of letters to it.

660
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,980
- Yeah, I think the best made up names

661
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,380
where they just take Tyler and put a different consonant set. I like Kyler

662
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,580
Jailer. I heard in I think I said it before, but I should just do all of them

663
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:43,500
as a letter and a mom was yelling at her son. She went Tyler come here. I was

664
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,100
like Tyler. I was run away to you like my mom name may name me that shit. What

665
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,980
you were like that you were like Jailer.

666
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,460
I was so confusing dude. It's a funny way to fall around this family fucking

667
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,860
Walmart. I was I was playing the switch switch demo.

668
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:16,000
Gyler, what an odd name, very curious, most peculiar, take out a big book. Let

669
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,760
me let me ask you when did you come up with this name? Gyler, just walk

670
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,780
the following or around the store.

671
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:28,780
Gyler, Gyler, where have I heard that name before?

672
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:30,780
Gyler, Gyler.

673
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,780
Oh, from that kid over there.

674
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Oh, his name's Gyler.

675
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:37,780
Excuse me, ma'am, is your son named Gyler?

676
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:39,780
I always like him.

677
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,780
Can I take something out of your cart?

678
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,780
When people name their kids like

679
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,780
Crystal, that's always funny to me.

749
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:12,000
to do that. How much are these pants? These are actually 20 bucks. Why must people always think

750
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,300
about their appearance to others or to themselves? It's a

751
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:21,440
strange world we live in. I am actually wearing my least expensive shit. Yeah, you

00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
Clip that.

764
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,280
Cameron said that.

765
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,640
Cameron is wearing ladies underwear under his shirt.

766
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
No I'm not.

767
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
He's wearing a bra.

768
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
No I'm not.

769
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
Look.

770
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Cameron's wearing a...

771
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640

772
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,640
Oh my god.

773
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
That is one of the most beautiful, intricate, lace things I've ever seen.

776
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:03,440
I'm jacking off to Cameron's bra. Whenever guys like underwear and like smell it and jack off to it,

777
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,800
that's the weirdest shit. That's really funny to me. I think that's weird. That is so crazy. That's

778
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:14,240
worse than like wanting to eat a woman. Okay. I don't think that's... And wanting to eat a woman,

779
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:19,680
it's actually pretty normal now that I think about it. It makes sense. What? Like wanting to eat it,

780
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:24,360
like army hammer being like I need to eat your arm like doing I need to use your

if you said you wanted to drink blood right yeah did he did he want to eat

783
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:38,320

787
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,760

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,720

genius comment. Videos of Traegers. Shoes are cloths, right? Coats? Definitely clothes.

794
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,240
Facts. Too bad nobody wears them. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Have you noticed this? A

795
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,680
lot of these women will spend extra money to have less clothes on their bodies.

796
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,000
Have you noticed this? The Emperor is actually wearing nothing and people told

797
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,040
him that the clothes are... I could see the clothes so it sounds like maybe you just

798
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:59,240
weren't cool enough to see them. No he wasn't wearing any clothes. I mean I could

799
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,600
see that they said they were clothes that only cool people could see and you

800
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:06,440
didn't see them and I did. The Emperor's robes were not there. Yeah I also saw them.

801
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,260
Yeah they were blue right? And hold up you were looking at the

802
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,860
emperor while he wasn't wearing clothes is that what you're telling me? Yes. Okay so

804
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,340
decapitated too with a big very dull rock that we use right now. Yeah

805
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:31,980
baseball bat. Well that's fine. You would think it's fine. Clothes would be great.

806
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:39,360

816
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,200
I work for the police. Officer, we have found over three million gigabytes of

817
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,080
invisible child pornography on this man's computer. We need to send him to jail.

818
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:48,200
Yep, it's all over. You can't see it, but everybody else can. He

819
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,920
encrypted it just so that cops can't see it. So the cops and the government can't see it.

820
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,440
Everybody else can see it and you need to kill him right now.

821
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:00,700
how listen to the fan on his computer is going so fast it's because there's no

822
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:06,280
space left nope there's nothing number two is games nope games have a game gate

823
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,600
will listen to this this might change your mind okay games have such engaging

824
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,320
stories perfect gameplay and some of the most memorable ways to spend your time

825
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,920
in the 21st century aside be it from being with real people obviously why

826
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,400
spend it on clothes that you will grow out of in a couple years compared to

827
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,020
games that provide memorable experiences for decades if you get a good one that

828
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,960
did change my mind. Yeah, games have good gameplay. That's true. That's the thing about games

829
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:37,020
that clothes don't have. Yeah, you can't king a pair of pants. You could if you put a crown

830
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,920
on it. No, that's not the same. You can embroider a crown on them. That's not kinging, that's

831
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,020
embroidering a crown. The fact that you're saying embroider a crown instead of king proves

832
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,080
it's not, it doesn't make sense. It's not a real thing. I wish I could justify buying

833
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,520
a bunch of playstation 5's and just like dumping them into a volcano.

834
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
Yeah.

835
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
That'd be kind of fun.

836
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
It would be fun to like...

837
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,520
I really want to like destroy some really expensive stuff.

838
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
PS5 under the pneumatic press.

839
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

840
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,400
Can you imagine how mad people would get at that?

841
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
Yeah.

842
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
It'd be so funny.

843
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,800
What's the deal with the PS5's right now?

844
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,800
They're like...

845
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
They basically play like 900 dollars.

846
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,720
They're like the next one after PS4.

847
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,640
Why are they 900 bucks?

848
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
I think that...

849
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
I don't know.

850
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,640
I don't know either.

851
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
I don't know.

852
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
That makes no sense to me.

853
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,360
like the same price as a PC? I don't know man you're asking the wrong guy you

854
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,740

00:39:56,980 --> 00:40:01,020

00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:06,420

top tap tap tip I hate that - Linus is trick tips oh those are nasty cuz he

863
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,960
- Like the one about the jar when he says,

864
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:21,040
"If you care about glass in your food,

865
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,280
"then you won't get glass."

866
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,420
- He's not a very good writer.

867
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,320
- No, yeah, that's what's so tricky about it.

868
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:32,100
- And the other one about his jar,

869
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,420
if you sit on it, you'll go viral in a video.

870
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,840
- Well, that was actually a great tip,

871
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,680
'cause it works.

872
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,840
- You know what would be a good recreation?

873
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:41,580
Do one man, one jar now,

874
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,860
but it's a jar of peanut brittle

875
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,980
the prank snake flies up in your ass.

876
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,180
- Before he's sitting down.

877
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,020
- Yeah.

878
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,860
- It just shoots directly into your ass.

879
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:50,460
- You gotta get Pierce Paris on that.

880
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,300
- Oh yeah.

881
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,140
- Dude, oh my god.

882
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,260
- He would be good for that.

883
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,060
- The snake opens up and still goes in his ass.

884
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,300
- Just directly, just huge gaper.

885
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,420
- That would be awesome.

886
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:00,580
- And then he walks around with a,

887
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,620
it's kind of like a tail.

888
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,980
But he's kind of, he's holding his ass like he's Mario

889
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,420
and he just fell into lava.

890
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,260
- Yeah.

891
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,540
(imitates Mario)

892
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,380
- Yeah, yeah.

893
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:11,180
- Big shout out to Pierce Paris' video.

894
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,540
- And shout out to Mario.

895
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
You go fast when you hot.

896
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,540
And shout out to Bowser.

897
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,220
Gotta have good and bad.

898
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Definitely not.

899
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,220
Nope, that's, I'm saying it.

900
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Shout out to Bowser.

901
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,220
We're gonna be apologizing for that really soon.

902
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Yeah.

903
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:28,260
Comedian Patrick Doran came out today and said he was...

904
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:33,180
Comedian Patrick Doran today is fired from SNL as a podcast clip emerges of him being

905
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,180
pro-Bowser.

906
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,700
Yeah, like the Koopas, I would love to hang out with the Koopas.

907
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,340
Yeah, I just think what he does to the Koopas is sick.

908
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,740
It's like cool. Yeah. Plus his son is too.

909
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,540
Say what you will, but like the Mushroom Kingdom has run way better with him in charge.

910
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,120
No.

911
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,660
All right, that's just my opinion.

912
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,880
No.

913
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,400
No.

914
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,500
No, you fucked us. You fucked all of us. We're fucking done.

915
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:08,140
Comedian Patrick Doran let go from writer's room this week after an offensive clip surfaced

916
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:11,580
from the past of him doing an extremely exaggerated toad accent.

917
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:12,580
Okay!

918
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:19,660
And there's the clip.

919
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,660
Number three, food.

920
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,660
Nope.

921
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,660
Nope.

922
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:23,660
Don't need it.

923
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,660
Let's be honest here, who doesn't like food?

924
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,660
I don't need food!

925
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,160
With $100 you could get yourself a very fine steak dinner or buy a lot of nice yummy chocolates.

926
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,580
You really just can't go wrong with food.

927
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
I'm on pretty much a steak and chocolate dinner.

928
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,340
You spent $100 on chocolate?

929
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
Did I spend $100?

930
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,340
Would you?

931
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,340
Would I?

932
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:41,340
of chocolate and steak? I think I... Steak? Yeah. Oh yeah. I don't even like steak. Okay,

933
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:46,620
just chocolate. I would buy one a $100 steak. Would you buy a chocolate steak? Would you buy a $100

934
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:51,900
steak with like a chocolate sauce? That sounds really shitty. Did I ever tell you about the

935
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:58,540
chocolate ham? Don't care. Yeah? Nope. I think I've told you about the chocolate ham. My cousin's

936
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:05,180
birthday is like fifth birthday. Did you not hear me? All right. Food is amazing and there are so

937
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:08,300
so many choices such as Chinese, Italian, Indian, etc.

938
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,900
The list goes on forever, how can you not choose it?

939
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:12,820
- Please tell me, I wanna know something.

940
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,460
- No, you said you didn't wanna know.

941
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,220
- Please, can you stop, please, I was just kidding.

942
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:19,900
I really wanna know about the chocolate ham.

943
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:20,940
- You sure?

944
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,780
- Yes.

945
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,100
- Cameron, can I tell him about it?

946
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,980
- That's up to you, man, you don't have to ask me.

947
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,500
- I don't know, it seems like you're the one

948
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,460
in charge right now.

949
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:30,180
- I'm not in charge, I'm looking at these comments,

950
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,660
I'm trying to find the next comment to read.

951
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,260
You guys have to settle this yourself.

952
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:39,460
my cousin's fifth birthday. I don't care. I'm a big fat kid who liked to eat. Whoa. Yeah

953
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:48,460
you are. My food, wait go back. Food is my best friend. By the way I'm not a loner. Whoa.

954
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:55,780
Does that mean he's got a lot of food around him? Yeah. He's got, he lives in a sausage

955
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,860
party. Food for the win. Food is a need. Oh he's really small and he lives in sausage

956
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:01,060
but it was in the grocery store after dark.

957
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,020
- Come on, food creates a satisfying feeling

958
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,460
that comes from endorphins in your brain.

959
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,220
Enjoy it with some spaghetti, sandwiches,

960
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,860
brownies, chicken tenders, et cetera.

961
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:10,060
- I love to have food with my spaghetti.

962
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,580
I think Sausage Party might be, to me,

963
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:14,980
I don't think I've ever watched a movie

964
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,940
that filled me with so much like--

965
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:20,620
- Dread? - Existential unease.

966
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:22,820
I watched that movie and it really upset me.

967
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:24,940
- I think I got, I think I watched a clip,

968
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,740
I've never seen it, but I watched a clip from it

969
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,020
and it made me so upset.

970
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,740
It really like made my stomach hurt.

971
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:30,740
Yeah.

972
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:32,460
You know, it's like when you watch Fight Club and you're like too young.

973
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,460
Yeah.

974
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:34,460
And you're like, "Ugh."

975
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,460
Yeah.

976
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,460
I did not watch, I did not watch Sons of the Party.

977
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:37,460
It was like watching, it was bad, dude.

978
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:40,300
What's that movie with Brad, I think it's Troy.

979
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,620
Brad Pitt plays Achilles.

980
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,620
It's probably Troy.

981
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,620
I haven't seen it.

982
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:48,180
I saw that, I saw the Trojan horse scene and it freaked me out as a kid.

983
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,180
Why is this horse so big?

984
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
Dad, the horse is made of wood.

985
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:51,180
Dad.

986
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,180
Dad, it looks like a house.

987
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,180
You're afraid that the Trojan horse is going to show up to your house.

988
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:58,380
of wood! Dad! Dad! It looks like a house! You're afraid that the Trojan horse is gonna show up to your house, huh?

989
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,500
I got really upset that there was like a bunch of people getting murdered. You

990
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:08,100
sound like a pussy. I liked it. I looked out of the window and I saw, I lived in

991
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:13,260
Syria and I would just watch people die all day when I was a kid. I'm from Syria.

992
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,620
A lot of people don't know that. I'm from Aleppo. Yeah. Like Steve Jobs. What? Steve Jobs is Syrian.

993
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:26,380
Really? Was. Yeah, now he's seriously a dead skinny guy. Yeah. And he used to

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:39,700
sips some smoothies. Yep. To subdue his symptoms of cancer. And what did they do?

00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,780
www.nakedladies.com too.

1032
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,780
He goes to whitehouse.com and not .gov.

1033
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,780
That's right.

1034
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:34,780
Right after he said you weren't getting got you.

1035
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,780
Oh shit!

1036
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,780
Number 6 is a puppy.

1037
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:38,780
It costs way more than a hundred bucks.

1038
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:39,780
This shit's lying.

1039
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,780
Yeah?

1040
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,780
Yeah.

1041
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,780
How much does your dog cost?

1042
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:43,780
One million trillion dollars?

1043
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:46,780
I think the adoption fee is like four hundred bucks.

1044
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:47,780
Really?

1045
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:48,780
Yeah.

1046
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,780
Four hundred bones.

1047
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:50,780
They have a genius.

1048
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:51,780
The top comment here is by a genius.

1049
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:52,780
Okay.

1050
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:53,780
I think that you ought to rephrase that.

1051
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:56,780
When you buy an animal, you aren't just buying the baby version of that animal.

1052
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:00,360
of that animal. You are buying that animal's entire life and it is your duty

1053
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,860
to provide for and love them all that time. Anyways, when you add food, vet care,

1054
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:10,300
and other necessities, dogs cost much more than $100." And then it's colon dash slash.

1055
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:14,300
They did the slanty face? Yeah, the slanty face but with a nose.

1056
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,180
Whoa! Wait, wait, wait. Caleb got in trouble for doing a slanty face one time. No, I didn't.

1057
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:25,380
Yeah, here's a comment from a dove. "Yep, so far my dog has lavishly spent

1058
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:32,060
$1,000.00. I hate when my dog spends my money. Stop fucking putting your dog's paw print on

1059
00:49:32,060 --> 00:49:38,020
your fucking iPhone. He gets my credit card when I go to work. It's fucked. Dogs have been

1060
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:47,660
doing in-app purchases on ragandbone.com. Imagine you get a huge Amazon box delivered

1061
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:52,460
and you open it up. It's all tennis balls. It's literally all tennis balls and huge bones.

1062
00:49:52,460 --> 00:50:00,000
yeah, I don't think I ordered this. Yeah, I don't think I know. I don't think it's

1063
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,420
you know what a puppy ordered all that

1064
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:08,080
puppy that loves the delicious bones. They all like to play with tennis

1065
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,860
balls. Yeah, if you call your credit card company and tell them your puppy

1066
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:14,780
did it so basically my yes, it was my mistake. I did make my password. I'm a

1067
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:15,260
dog.

1068
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:19,780
There was like a knock on the door and it's the pizza delivery guy. It's like

1069
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,620
I have I'm here, but I'm bringing a pizza. It's a it's got no cheese, no

1070
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:28,180
sauce. It's just it's peanut butter. What did you order this butter? I don't

1071
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,460
know I must be I'm not too lazy to make peanut butter on toast.

1072
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:37,540
It must have been my dog. Who calls you is like nothing I've ever seen it's

1073
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,700
just a it's just a bone. There's no well. I'll have to punish my dog by

1074
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:44,740
eating this myself and not letting him have any and hurting my dog. Also,

1075
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:48,300
I don't like to get high on peanut butter and hurt my dog.

1076
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,300
That's not what I do. I don't like to get high off the sugar and the canola oil.

1077
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,300
Also, I don't have any money, so if I could pay you some other way.

1078
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,300
Or if my dog could pay you some other way, because it's for him, I'm not going to use it.

1079
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,300
Are you going to put the peanut butter on you?

1080
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,300
I could put the peanut butter wherever.

1081
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,300
I could put it wherever.

1082
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,300
Peanut butter pizza with a side of peanut butter.

1083
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:10,300
Peanut butter dipping cut.

1084
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,300
What else?

1085
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,300
What else?

1086
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:16,300
Number seven is a phone.

1087
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,300
One hundred pounds is not enough for an iPhone.

1088
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:22,020

I've never seen this before.

1123
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,820
In the entirety of this podcast.

1124
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,820
Number 10. It just says 10. There's nothing there.

1125
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,820
There's no entry and there's a ton of commas.

1126
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:55,820
It just says 10.

1127
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:57,820
Oh, trips.

1128
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,820
It doesn't say it but it's supposed to be trips.

1129
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,820
See if you can highlight it.

1130
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,820
No, there's just nothing there.

1131
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:05,820
What the hell?

1132
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,820
We gotta take a photo of this shit.

1133
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:09,820
This is life changing.

1134
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:16,100
This is the craziest episode we've ever done.

1135
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:19,580
This is the most psychotic shit that's ever happened.

1136
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,580
Damn.

1137
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,060
Oh, it is trips.

1138
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,060
It's trips, yeah.

1139
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,200
But it still doesn't show up.

1140
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,200
Number 11's cat.

1141
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,100
Fuck a cat.

1142
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:28,100
Number 12 is tattoo.

1143
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,100
Yup.

1144
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:30,100
Yup.

1145
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,840
I would get a tattoo of Conquer the Squirrel on my arm.

1146
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:32,840
Just kidding.

1147
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,840
I wouldn't get a tattoo.

1148
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,840
They aren't for me.

1149
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,840
I don't want to get a tattoo of something stupid.

1150
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:36,840
Caleb has a ghost on his ass.

1151
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:37,840
Check out my butt.

1152
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,840
Is it ghost?

1153
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,980
Ghost. I've never seen the ghost. You've never seen this? I have seen it actually.

1154
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:47,020
Never mind, I have seen that ghost. This is like, this is like probably my best tattoo.

1155
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:52,020
What were you like 18 when you got that? Yeah. I fucking knew it. Yeah.

1156
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,220
Yeah, that's the dumbest shit ever. It's cool. It's not cool. Look it has the same dot.

1157
00:53:56,220 --> 00:54:01,360
You're talking a lot of shit right now Pat. I have a cool tattoo. Yeah? My tattoo's

1158
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:08,060
sick. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah? It says Dr. Evil on my left bicep. That's cool. It is

1159
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:09,060
That's kind of cool.

1160
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,060
That is sick.

1161
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:11,060
It's not as cool as my ghost.

1162
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,740
No, the ghost is not as cool as that.

1163
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,340
Which one is cooler?

1164
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,340
That is sick.

1165
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,340
This one's the coolest.

1166
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:19,420
Okay, okay, the tribal thing is way sicker than mine.

1167
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:20,420
Yes.

1168
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,400
That's sick as fuck.

1169
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,200
Now he wishes he got a tribal tat like me.

1170
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,200
I was thinking about it.

1171
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,200
He should get a tribal copycat.

1172
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,220
He should just get all different, all like this exact kind of little hundred dollar tribal

1173
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,220
tat all over his body.

1174
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,900
I'm going to get barbed wire across the arm.

1175
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,900
Barbed wire is sick, dude.

1176
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:35,900
Yeah, dude.

1177
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:40,540
You should get a really shit, you should get one of those crosses that turns into the John

1178
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,860
Deere logo at the top.

1179
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,860
That'd be cool.

1180
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,860
Yeah, dude.

1181
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:47,020
I want the line work to look so bad.

1182
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:48,020
Yeah.

1183
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:53,340
It's clearly done by a guy who's been in recovery for 20 years and he's just got the shakiest

1184
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:54,340
hands.

1185
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:55,340
No shading.

1186
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,340
Yeah, no.

1187
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,340
It's barbed wire, no shading.

1188
00:54:57,340 --> 00:55:00,940
Yeah, yeah, with a real, real fucking small needle too.

1189
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,980
Yeah, that'd be cool.

1190
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:03,980
Got a tattoo on my arm.

1191
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,340
I screams like a baby.

1192
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,740
"Yes, I am honest 'cause the owner was playing this song

1193
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,300
"I kinda detest now.

1194
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,520
"It's called Karate Chop,

1195
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,620
"and it is the worst future song I've ever heard."

1196
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,860
- Whoa, Karate Chop's good.

1197
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:15,700
This guy's an idiot.

1198
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:16,980
- He was screaming like a baby

1199
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,680
'cause he heard that song, he said.

1200
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,860
"I am so glad I stumbled on this website.

1201
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,620
"I've been looking for a way to spend my newly earned $100,

1202
00:55:24,620 --> 00:55:26,680
"and I'm so excited to get a little pink dolphin

1203
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,020
"on my ankle, heart, Merry Christmas."

1204
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,380
- Damn.

1205
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,420
I should get a, oh, like the pink, wait,

1206
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:39,580
pink dolphin like the the hot topic brand. Here's one that's a that's cap each

1207
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:45,620
word is capitalized. I'm getting a tattoo of a foot on my foot. Mind blown. That's

1208
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:51,380
sick dude. That's swag. Number 13 is shoes. How you gonna buy a hundred dollar

1209
00:55:51,380 --> 00:56:00,060
pair of shoes? How could a man possibly buy a man possibly buy a hundred dollar

1210
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:04,380
pair of shoes. He just did. I'd bought, that's probably the most expensive pair of shoes I ever

1211
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:08,700
bought in my life I think. Me too. Buy a huge amount. I don't think, I think I probably the

1212
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:13,340
most I spent on shoes besides that is like probably like $40. 40 or 50. 40? I buy like

1213
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:17,740
New Balance shoes. I'm a shoe carnival man. I'm not like a shoe guy. You ever go to shoe carnival?

1214
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,220
What's that? You ever been to shoe baka? Bro, shoe carnival was crazy. What is it? You go in,

1215
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:28,540
it's like you do, there's like a get what you get wheel. Yeah. Where you spin a wheel and like

1216
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,740
It's like a giant wheel and sometimes you get a free pair of shoes.

1217
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:34,420
Because it's really where is this?

1218
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:36,180
It's in Wilmington, North Carolina.

1219
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:37,760
I'm going to go there next time.

1220
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,100
Yeah, got the worst fucking shoes in the world.

1221
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,680
Yeah, but they got a wheel, though.

1222
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,020
I do love to spin a wheel.

1223
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,900
They got a serious guy.

1224
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,140
I don't care as long as I get to spin a wheel.

1225
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:46,900
I just spin the wheel.

1226
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,180
And then like it gives you different coupons.

1227
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,900
I'll go to like the worst place in the world as long as there's a wheel there.

1228
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,360
I think if the wheel is still going, dude, next time we're in Wilmington,

1229
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:55,980
I'll I'll take your. Yeah, yeah.

1230
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,360
We'll hit you.

1231
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:00,880
What do they got there, like Airspeeds?

1232
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,380
Yeah.

1233
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,200
Remember Airspeed?

1234
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:02,700
Mm-hmm.

1235
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:04,800
They got the Shaquille O'Neal shoes.

1236
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,000
Dude, I got--

1237
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,500
I tried to--

1238
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,360
I used to only wear Shaq shoes when I was in third grade.

1239
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:11,200
I tried to buy a pair a couple years ago.

1240
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,620
They only make them in kid's size.

1241
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:13,880
It's so fucked up, dude.

1242
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:14,760
Messed up.

1243
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,800
Shaq can't even wear them damn shoes.

1244
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,080
Number 27 is toys.

1245
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:20,520
Yes, I love toys.

1246
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,600
I have no idea why.

1247
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,840
I'm 12, and I still love toys.

1248
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,480

1251
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:39,920
think you guys didn't get bullied out of playing with toys when you were like I

1252
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,400
never got bullied even once. I am eighty nine years old and I love toys. I

1253
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,820
dominated my civil. That's a right here.

1254
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:52,180
I'm eighty nine years old. Do you remember that guy when I lived in

1255
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,580
Central Square, remember that crazy house across from me?

1256
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,420
- Yeah.

1257
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:00,820
- Yeah, that guy would go to Brookline Lunch down the street

1258
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:03,380
and he would go and play with action figures all day.

1259
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,200
- Really?

1260
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:05,140
- It was so cool and he was old as fuck.

1261
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:06,220
He was in his 70s.

1262
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,700
He would just be there playing with GI Joes.

1263
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,340
(imitates gun sounds)

1264
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,180
- That's tight.

1265
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,000
- I would get cooler toys if I--

1266
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:12,940
- And I was like, that guy is a homeowner.

1267
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:14,980
- I would get cooler toys than that guy and I would go--

1268
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:15,820
- He didn't know about cool toys.

1269
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:18,740
- And I would sit next to him, sit across from him.

1270
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:19,580
- Make him jealous?

1271
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:20,580
- Yeah.

1272
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:21,780
- Pretty good idea.

1279
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,760
- Wait, wait, Smooth Criminal says,

1280
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,260

1281
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:59,800
- Number 46, Fleshlight.

1282
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,840
- Fleshlight's so great and scary as a concept.

1283
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:02,960
- Number 47, Cranberry Juice.

1284
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:03,800
- You think so?

1285
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:04,620
- Yeah.

1286
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:05,460
- That's scary?

1287
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,300
- Uh-huh.

1288
00:59:06,300 --> 00:59:07,880
- Spunk it in a hole?

1289
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:08,720
Is scary to you?

1290
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:11,960
- Well, just like, imagine opening that thing up

1291
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:16,800
and just looking at a vagina like that.

1292
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:18,240
I think I'm just scared of vaginas.

1293
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,480
- I think so.

1294
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:23,440

one of these whether you're a guy or a girl. Car parts. This man is a genius. Beef jerky?

1296
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:34,240
Beef jerky is expensive as hell. They gotta lower them damn prices. It's like six bucks

1297
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,880
for a little sweet and hot. I called the boys on my bus beef jerky when I meant to call

1300
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,280
- A knife. - Bong?

1301
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:49,760
- Spin brush, toothbrush.

1302
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,040
- Oh, I used to only use that toothbrush.

1303
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,920
- Goldfish crackers changed my life.

1304

- Yeah. - I didn't have a scooter.

00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:00,960
- I did. - I had a skateboard.

1310
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,360
- I'd want to just destroy my ankles

1311
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:04,680
