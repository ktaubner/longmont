1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,180
Interior, The Matrix 2, The Groundhog Concert Hall.

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:15,140
The artificial air is thick with anticipation at the Papi Chuku Concert Hall.

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,980
Today is the most celebrated day in The Matrix 2, Groundhog's Day.

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,940
A familiar voice creeps into the scene, aching for attention, for validation, for respect.

5
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:29,160
The ever-present ghost of your long-dead mentor,

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,720
head detective Lenny Krapschitz.

7
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,000
- Holy crap.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,200
- So it goes.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,120
- I forgot about him.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,200
- It's Kurt Vonnegut.

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,600
Yeah, he died in the very beginning, so.

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,720
I'm sure many of you thought that with their passing,

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,360
the adventures of my protégés, Blotas Piss,

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,080
Ray William Johnson, and Patrick Yoda would cease.

15
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
This is not the case.

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,360
- We fucking died?

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,200
- Yeah, remember?

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,040
- Yeah, you remember you died?

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,760
- We've died so many goddamn times.

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,680
- This was the real death.

21
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,760
- The real death happened.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:55,840
You've died in other campaigns.

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,640
This is what happened to us. You got killed by some disgusting monster was a

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,120
giant tentacle. Yeah, we were in like a hole or you in the core ship. We got

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,600
killed by a fuck this shit. Oh yeah, that pissed me off so much. Yeah, I was so

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,200
mad about that mission. I was genuinely for like he gave us some good couple. I

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,360
think for an hour after I think I was like, I think you can hear it in the

28
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,000
episode. I sit there and I'm about to yell at you. Yeah, that's true. Yeah,

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,480
it seemed pretty upset. Yeah,

30
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,560
this is not the case though.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,560
For a detective never dies.

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,640
As long as there is a case to be solved, the detective will rise from the dead, wipe the

33
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,920
dirt off their trousers, rub the maggots out of their eyes, grab a magnifying glass, and

34
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:47,280
look at a clue.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,960
But we're not dealing with the undead detective.

36
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,880
This is a mystery solved before the gang's untimely demise.

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,120
They solved many crimes between my passing and theirs.

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,240
And this is, this one.

39
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,400
- Wait a minute, are you saying that we're gonna be revived?

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,080
Our characters are gonna be revived,

41
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,240
Mass Effect 2 style?

42
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
- I didn't say that. - We're three ghosts.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,200
- No, I said this is, but--

44
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,680
- You said that rub the maggots out of their eyes.

45
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,520
- No, so I--

46
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,720
- Are we, is there gonna be a new Gun City campaign

47
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,520
where we get revived like Commander Shepard?

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,560
- You just thought of this?

49
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,560
- I cannot, I cannot confirm nor deny

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,360
that there will be a new Gun City campaign

51
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,280
with these characters.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,880
but this is in the past. Okay, this is not just like you said that we like

53
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,780
commented on the line. There was a kind of a pile and then he started his next

54
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,380
life in the middle of you at way to

55
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,580
come back to life. I was drawing an eye. Yeah,

56
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,980
yeah, the letter I know it was an eye full minute.

57
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,880
They solve many crimes between my passing in theirs and this one is not

58
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,080
this one is one of my personal favorites

59
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,680
who killed Mr. Groundhog

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,580
see

61
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:56,580
As the narrator said up top, Groundhog's Day is a big deal in The Matrix 2.

62
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,580
Many a celebration is thrown across the virtual world, celebrating our wonderful furry friend, Mr. Groundhog.

63
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:13,580
Mr. Groundhog is a very popular creature. You see, a celebrity in his own right, an artist, a businessman, a member of Mensa, you name it, he's done it.

64
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,580
He throws the biggest party in the Matrix 2 on the day of his namesake, Hogfest,

65
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,580
which takes place at the Papi Chuco Concert Hall.

66
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,580
That day, he drank, partied, laughed, cried, and put on a show with the talented VTuber artist Haseki Tsune.

67
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,580
Unfortunately, it would be his last.

68
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:33,580
But our intrepid investigators don't know that yet.

69
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,580
They stand amongst a crowd, out on a large, welcoming garden and patio outside Papi Chuco Concert Hall,

70
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,580
where unmolested techno-slime fountains roar.

71
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,720
far. Just wait till Patrick gets in the room

72
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,780
damn my slime hasn't been molested.

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,540
Here comes that way. What's that sound?

74
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:04,280
They see all matter of famous guests that they may recognize

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,340
celebrities, businessmen, financiers, scientists, academics, social media,

76
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,940
marketers,

77
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,780
The gang are honored guests as well, invited because of their numerous exploits and adventures

78
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,780
at this point.

79
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,260
It's turned all three of them, and even yes, little Sullivan, into celebrities in their

80
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,380
own right in Gun City.

81
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,100
Though where they go, trouble is sure to follow.

82
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,180
So it goes.

83
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,180
And so you guys are.

84
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,460
You're at this sort of gathering.

85
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,960
bit on the reveal, the hairline reveal

86
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:44,060
didn't know

87
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,060
and we get a punch in and a dramatic music sting.

88
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:55,460
I don't know how you immediately got hat hair from a hat sitting not even

89
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,160
really on your head on top of head for it's it's

90
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,660
had not on your head, but I'm so like precarious right now. Yeah, that's okay.

91
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,260
The amount that's here, right? You gotta give it volume when I'm doing to it.

92
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,580
You do look a little wind swept. Yeah, I think you could rock this for 25 years

93
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,580
and it's gonna be that's the plan. Yeah.

94
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:20,860
So you guys are standing right now outside of the this

95
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,980
concert hall, the poppy chucos concert hall. Obviously, poppy chucos been long

96
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:28,980
dead. You guys killed him, punched his head off. You specifically killed him

97
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,020
at William Johnson, actually. And so, but he has a concert hall still in the

98
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,540
virtual world of the Matrix two who gets the money from this hall if he's

99
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:45,460
passed away. So he has a family. I'd like to kill them too. Well we can make that something.

100
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:51,060
Are they there? Does he have little kids? Real young ones? He does not have little kids.

101
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:54,780
I'd like to kill his mom. You want to kill his mother? Yeah, but we'll get to that later.

102
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,660
His mother is alive, his father is dead. Explains a lot about his personality. His father died

103
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,700
very recently, though, so it doesn't explain to explains recently. His

104
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,280
body was still that's why he's dead recently. That's right. So yeah, you

105
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,300
guys are hanging out outside. You'll see some people you recognize. Leo, the

106

00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:30,140
between right after the heist campaign. Yeah. And right before we die on time

relationship. We do have something special. You've seen their texts.

126
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:42,620
We have kind of a... We have a bestial relationship where one licks the other.

127
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,620
Yeah. So, yeah... Sorry, we haven't seen each other in a couple of days.

We're all hyped up. No, I understand. Yeah, you're hyper. Yeah. Leo, the

129
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:52,180
collector, comes up to you guys and goes, "Well, it's good to see you three all

130
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,100
still all well and together. How are you? I don't remember what my character is

131
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,720
supposed to sound like or what his personality is like. So his personal

132
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,740
nailed it on both

133
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:09,540
we're good man. How are you?

134
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,460
I'm well wait. What was that? What was that little bird? I heard

135
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:20,460
what the wait are you being controlled by Sullivan? Oh, fuck me. Oh, no, wait,

136
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,500
why you're changing characters.

137
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,900
Hey guys, yeah, I mean, you guys told me to...

138
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,020
Can I break the fourth wall like Deadpool now?

139
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,660
Yeah, you guys left me in the car with the windows up again.

140
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Yeah.

141
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,060
And you made it out.

142
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,360
So what are you complaining about?

143
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
It's getting harder.

144
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
It's called a test.

145
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,340
Because the glass is really sharp.

146
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,340
Oh, you're still in there.

147
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,340
We get by bigger and bigger cars that have a higher handle.

148
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,340
This is a Hummer H50.

149
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,820
This one had a maze inside of it I had to get through before I found out.

150
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,820
Yeah, yeah.

151
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:54,220
far. Well, you solve the maze on you. Aren't you proud of that? Yeah, we're

152
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,060
testing you, Sullivan. How would you be fucking proud of yourself for once?

153
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:03,300
You solve the fucking maze roll deception

154
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:11,480
three that sets a bad tone, but I've noticed the first role sets the tone for

155
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,220
every role. We have the whole episode. Really? Yeah. So don't ask me to do any

156
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:20,980
I don't think it would be too worth my time to be proud of myself to be honest.

157
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,980
I'm going to punch you in the head.

158
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,100
Well, if no one else is going to be so you better be.

159
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,660
I'll punch you in that fucking head if you don't do that.

160
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,820
Where does your head even fucking start?

161
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,540
You look like all head to me by the way.

162
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
You look like one leg.

163
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,820
We have a picture of him right here.

164
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,580
You're basically one leg.

165
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,060
You're basically a leg to me.

166
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:44,420
You're like the leg lamp from Christmas Carol.

167
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,420
You're worse than the light lamp because you can't even make light.

168
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
I can't even rub ya.

169
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
We've been over this.

170
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,700
I have arms and legs, you guys.

171
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,780
But the rest of you is neck right into head.

172
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,300
So where is the point where it becomes the other one?

173
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,620
You see Leo the collector's like, "Well, I'll just leave you."

174
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,900
No, Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo, come here.

175
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
We uh...

176
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,420
Do you know stuff about frogs?

177
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,900
Oh yes, I collect frogs.

178
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,060
Oh, you collect frogs.

179
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,100
Well, we have a frog for you to collect.

180
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Oh yes, I know Sullivan.

181
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
You didn't want this one?

182
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,100
Sullivan worked for you.

183
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,100
Just for a brief period of time.

184
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
Sullivan was his assistant at one point.

185
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Sullivan was both your boss at one point,

186
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,100
the head of the detective agency,

187
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,100
after Leo Kravchits died.

188
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Immediately became an assistant for

189
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,100
Leo the Collector.

190
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,100
Downward mobility.

191
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
Yeah, I just felt that Sullivan was not going to...

192
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,100
No offense by the way, Mr. the Frog.

193
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,100
He just wasn't very good at anything.

194
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
You're kidding.

195
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,300
wasn't very good at anything. You're kidding me. Yeah, he wasn't good at

196
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,280
anything. No, I've been told this before, too. He's a little too good at getting

197
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,660
out of a fucking hot car.

198
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,460
Also, I just remembered we're

199
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:59,740
guys we've been we're called. I don't know why you guys are calling this thing

200
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:03,740
Sullivan. I think his name is shirt. His name is so sorry.

201
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,940
Wait, where is Sullivan?

202
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,100
you left your your son's at home. He's sleeping. It's too late for all that's

203
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,020
so cute.

204
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,460
Are we actually maybe his name isn't sure yet? I don't know the timeline. It

205
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:21,020
is well, he is shirt by now. I came shirt in the heist. I think he became

206
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,940
sure the highest or in Indiana. I thought his name was you know, you know,

207
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,540
sometimes nothing. I think in India, nothing

208
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:34,180
you know, like you know when they do like they do like he was like nothing

209
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,420
again or he's crap.

210
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:41,800
crap right now. You know how they'll do the thing in like a prequel or like a

211
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,120
spin off that set in the middle of something where, like you know some new

212
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,080
detail about a character will get like revealed that they just never, ever go

213
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,760
back to and yeah because it's obviously because it's to with Jess. So he needs

214
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,620
to have he needs to have a completely new name. It just doesn't make any sense

215
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,180
for the future. Yeah,

216
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,980
plug

217
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,760
probably we all call him a different thing and we're like no it's not

218
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,200
stick. Yeah, he has no name

219
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,280
so Leo Cup. I just keep looking at him and holding out my hand and just keep

220
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:17,080
going the cop. I just keep looking at looking at him and trying different. I'm

221
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:23,440
just going to like Cup. No, no, try and try plug glasses. No, like but plug

222
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,920
grass. No

223
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,120
Adam, so what what about ourselves at home

224
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,320
listen David the frog.

225
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:38,580
so what about oops? Are you all good? Yes, because I don't know his parents,

226
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,340
but I know he was very accidental, not did not mean to be living.

227
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:46,500
It is very good. We're going to go with accident for this episode

228
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,060
or this mystery. You're all excited for the concert tonight. Yeah, I was

229
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:59,300
playing Ja Rule. I wish it's Lily Katsumi, Hase Katsune and Mr. The Frog.

230
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,820
I hope there's no whoa wait, wait, wait, Mr. Groundhog. Oh, okay. Are

231
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,120
you going to Mr. The hog? I hope there's no bad blood between you and

232
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,640
Hussey. So you guys remember you guys kind of incidentally put Hussey behind

233
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,160
bars.

234
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,240
Why? Why would there be bad blood between us? No, it's a problem. Yeah.

235
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:23,360
What did we? Well, never mind. We put her behind bars. Yeah.

236
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,260
So

237
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,160
All right, yeah, it's good. She's out now. Yeah, no, she's out now and it

238
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,480
did actually do wonders for her. Korea gave a lot of credit street cred

239
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
great for Korea too.

240
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,080
And then you

241
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,680
you see

242
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,400
the

243
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,720
big like sort of like projected like there's like a big projected wall over

244
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,880
the arena and like a shadow shows up like a groundhog shadow.

245
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,680
And

246
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,440
oh, it's time. It's time for us to get to the concert and so time for the

247
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:01,440
concert. You guys walk inside into the concert. You see Gary C. Enterprises there also. He

248
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,440
comes up to you guys. "Hey guys, how's it going?"

249
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,440
"Shut up!"

250
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,440
"Hey man!"

251
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,440
"What are you doing? You should be at work."

252
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
"I'm at a concert, I'm hammered."

253
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,440
"I've got lots of people making us plenty of money for hot dogs and hot soda and cold

254
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,440
dogs."

255
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
"Oh that's what you do. Wait a minute, don't you have..."

256
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
"Yeah, I run your business. We're partners."

257
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,440
"I forgot."

258
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,440
"We missed your last 100 Zoom meetings with me, but that's okay."

259
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,440
"I don't have a phone anymore."

260
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I don't have a phone anymore because I sat down on it.

261
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Hey, it happens all the time I'm sure

262
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,440
to people who are like you.

263
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
In between the two, the heist and the...

264
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Aren't I addicted to cocaine? I think for you, yeah.

265
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,440
I blow all of my... You blow all of your money on cocaine eventually.

266
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,440
So I take $100 out of my pocket and I put it in the lapel of his shirt and it keeps

267
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,440
keeps falling out. I forget that the pocket is where you put the money.

268
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Oh, that's...

269
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,880
Yeah, hold on, keep that.

270
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,440
You heard the number 100 and you're now giving me a $100 bill.

271
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,200
Yeah, well, here's that. That's for you to hold on. Oops. Sorry about that. Let me just

272
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,120
grab that for you.

273
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,740
You hear an announcer. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.

274
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
I'm a boy.

275
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:25,280
Mr. Groundhog and Hasegi Tsune. And you see come out a furry, cute,

276
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,680
friendly little groundhog named Mr. Groundhog. Does he look like the Chinese

277
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,140
dickhut one? Yes, Caleb. Maybe. Where are we? Okay, a couple of things.

278
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,340
What's the cap at this venue? How many people are here?

279
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,740
Like probably 300, 15. 300? It's like a very intimate sort of like...

280
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,120
Okay, where are we sitting? Private party. Are we VIP? Standing... Oh,

281
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,560
it's standing room. So we're... We have bottle service 'cause I spent way

282
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,300
too much on tickets. You can get... There's a bar and stuff. 'Cause I lose

283
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,240
all my money at the beginning of the campaign, right? I would like to

284
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,440
force myself to the front with me and my friends. So yeah,

285
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,940
so I'm just giving money to security guards and I'm like... I got us

286
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,160
bottle service and VIP and everything, but I'm still like... I basically

287
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:08,060
bought one of each ticket for each of us

288
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,640
to the whole venue. You guys were invited to this, this is like an

289
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,680
exclusive. We're VIP. But you still bought a wine to buy tickets, yeah.

290
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,880
Yeah. Okay. So roll, roll strength check just to like push your way through. I

291
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,380
mean, you'll be fine, but I want to just do this. Let's get a roll out of the

292
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:27,880
way for even with that. You're fine. Like these are you guys are strong.

293
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:32,080
Oh, you guys are fighters. These are normal people. I say that with a four

294
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,180
though. It's like you, you kind of go. I want to be right at the front. You

295
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:39,380
can't do that a little bit. I want to be right at the front. I hang back

296
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:43,680
cross my arms, nod my head. Every few down beats nice and I'm going to every

297
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,080
single seat that I purchased. Also, when I say not my head to see which one I

298
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:51,480
like the best when I say not when I say not my head, I'm not like nodding to the

299
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,160
rhythm. It just means everyone's from here and note that I like and I'm like

300
00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,540
I brought a bunch of ziplocks full of Indian food that I started eating like

301
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:06,120
maybe four minutes into this whole thing, like really, really pungent Indian food

302
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,900
and I start I start crowd killing anyone who has a cell phone up. So Mr.

303
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,120
Groundhog and Husky today put on like this kind of like it's like a hyper

304
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,560
pop.

305
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,440
So all right sing it

306
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,280
it's it's really just sung by the ground hogs sing it

307
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,320
okay,

308
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:27,180
okay, I'd like to the best musical artist ever. I'd like for you to make

309
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,320
this song. Now this is something I would listen to. Oh, I I really wanted to

310
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,680
I'll take it after this, but it's a mind blowing song. It's like the best song

311
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,360
you can imagine. And Mr. Groundhog is clearly carrying it entirely.

312
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,140
Like Haseki Tsune, it's hard to imagine her having any creative input in

313
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,940
this and it's a little bit evident in her body language. It's like when

314
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,660
they bring...

315
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,560
It's like when a rapper brings their... They're like a feature on stage,

316
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,400
but the song doesn't change. Yes, exactly. And they're just both dancing

317
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,760
to it and just occasionally just going, "Yeah!" Yeah, yeah. They suddenly

318
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:04,800
become demoted to a hype man, they don't... They're out of their element.

319
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,580
so and the crowds eating it up and it's not so much a series of tracks as it's

320
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,380
like a fifteen minute long just kind of odyssey where they're all playing.

321
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,680
It's a cover of Edmund Fitz the Reckoning.

322
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:21,980
The legend. How would that go down?

323
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:34,080
People are like going crazy, they're crying, it's so beautiful,

324
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,640
but concerts are also usually about fifteen minutes in gun city due to the

325
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,620
decrease attention span. So concert ends and you're all directed to the dining

326
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:47,600
area now and you have a sign table for just a three of you. Wait, the concert is

327
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:52,760

328
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,720
spill my butter chicken all over the stage.

329
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,560
And then I like I would I get on all fours and I crawl under everybody back to

330
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,760
the back of the room. Perfect.

331
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,960
and yeah you guys sit at your assigned table.

332
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,240
It's just the three of you for safety precautions. You guys are sort of like

333
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,200

338
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,060
screwed the table this way and I start pushing it towards them. He's under the

339
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,300
table. Yeah, we buckled him in

340
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,100
why did you do this? I don't table his head pressed up against the other side

341
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,380
of the table. Please, please, I didn't want to. I start kicking the legs of the

342
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,620
high chair. Oh come on. I can't even fix this. I kick out one of the legs of the

343
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,140
table.

344
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:57,660
He becomes the

345
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,700

348
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,660
I get up and I take a folded napkin and I put it under the high chair because it

349
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,800
was wobbling a little bit

350
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,080

351
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,080

Ooh, from Culver's.

377
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120

378
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Oh. Shut up. But it's also from Culver's.

379
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,120
Is Gun City in the Midwest of

380
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,120
Ybom? Of Ybom?

381
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,120
Sort of. I mean, geographically.

382
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Yeah. So it's the

383
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,120
Chicago kind of. It's kind of the Chicago

384
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,120
of Ybom. Yeah. I mean, it's the

385
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,120
main, it's also the only city.

386
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,120
It's not the only city, but it's the main

387
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,120
city. It's a future hell where Chicago

388
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,120
is the best city in the country.

389
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,380
in the country. And when the Butter Burger platter is brought out with the

390
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:26,480
silver cap on top. And it's lifted up by the chef. You're making me starving with salad.

391
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,440
Something about those platters make me so hungry. I know, god damn. Me too. That reveal.

392
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,400
Oh yeah. I experience it three times a day, but it just has never gotten old.

393
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,520
The reveal. My god, it never gets old. It really just every time. Well this reveal

394
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:51,500
still has Mr. Groundhog on it. What dad with an apple in his mouth apple and the

395
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,180
chef looks I start digging in what

396
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:59,420
what is wrong with this is the groundhog right and everyone starts going is

397
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,140
horrified. I'll take three more. It's like we just found it also solve the

398
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,260
mystery and it was the chef. Yeah, the chef must have done it seemed like it

399
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,920
was the chef and everyone is okay. Immediately they rush and to tear apart

400
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,580
chef and as the bloodshed rises, you feel yourself get a little lightheaded,

401
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,900
not because you guys aren't scared of blood, but you just your vision starts to

402
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:25,060
fray glitch almost whoa and then you're back exactly where you were when you

403
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,740
first arrived on the patio. Time loop a time. We are caught around on a time

404
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:36,900
glue. Fuck dude. We're playing twelve minutes and then you hear from your PSP

405
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,080
in one of your pockets. I guess Pat you sat on your phone. So who else has a

406
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,800
PSP? I got one. Okay, I'll have it here. Hello, hello,

407
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,080
Blotus, Blotus, it's Dr. Touladeralis. Wrong number.

408
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,160
We go through the time when we can.

409
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:55,840
We just do the same shit. Don't solve it.

410
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,800
Blotus, please, please pick up, please. Oh,

411
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,600
I was supposed to pick this up.

412
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,760
Hi hello, how many times how many phone calls has it been

413
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,520
by

414
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,960
on your on your five times already and then I

415
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,920
and I

416
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:23,240
if we die, I say does this is your fault

417
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:29,040
does the time loop reset if we done yes, okay, yeah, it loops back around to go.

418
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,520
That's how I get away with you guys don't have to worry about dying in this

419
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,080
campaign right because you your characters are because they're so

420
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,560
talented. It goes what I did die, though, and it was revealed that all along in

421
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,360
the play time campaign. They were an imposter. Wouldn't that be cool? That

422
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,440
would be cool, but now we have to cut that basically invalidate everything. It

423
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,560
goes back around again,

424
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:51,180
like one of the time solvent is three eyes for some reason. I think it's just

425
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,700
like it's like completely fucked up and then it's like okay, a cause calling you

426
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,480
this time. Hello ray, you got red. Oh my God,

427
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,400
Hi ray, I managed to get your number from blow toss during one of the do you

428
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,380
realize there's multiple time loops going on?

429
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,440
The fuck are you talking about? You guys are stuck inside of some kind of time

430
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,360
loop right now. No, we're not time loop a time. What is a time loop? What the

431
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,240
hell's a tie loop?

432
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,040
I

433
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,840
what's

434
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,500
No wait wait wait guys. I think he's saying we're caught in it. I

435
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:34,200
it's time.

436
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,400
Wait, wait, wait.

437
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,500
Yeah, so what's that time a loop? It's a time a loop. Now. Well,

438
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,000
you're caught in a time loop. Oh my

439
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,900
cocks in my cocks in a tie loop a double winter.

440
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,600
Okay, well,

441
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:57,260
it's been the entire loop in the bathroom. It doesn't really look like

442
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:01,680
well, I guess I'll keep messing with it.

443
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,120
Okay, roll perception.

444
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,420
No, just just just just Ray, would you

445
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,740
sorry? That's owl owl

446
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,860
six. Okay, can I roll it too? Because I got a sixteen what now

447
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,980
I go that's the curse. I don't have a phone.

448
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,560
Okay,

449
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,340
please. Okay, time loop. Yes. Oh, okay. I was just trolling you, Mr.

450
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,660
Ladder.

451
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:32,460
I know what a time loop is. I'm getting trolled. It doesn't matter. We

452
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,060
could do it a hundred times. My friends are trolling me. Yep, you got

453
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,500
trolled.

454
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:41,460
So it's time to solve the mystery of... Okay, I figured we could. It's time.

455
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,340
Wait, it's time...

456
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:47,820
No, I'm kidding. Who's Miss Terry?

457
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,340
I know Miss Terry, she's the bus driver.

458
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,620
It seems that

459
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:59,420
if you don't figure out what happened to Mr. Groundhog, you might be stuck in

460
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:03,140
this forever. How do we know it's that and not that we need to like do...

461
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,380
We need to... Well, let's try kissing. Yeah, we need to do something.

462
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:09,020
Okay, we'll try kissing. Okay, well, let's rule out kissing. Guys,

463
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,620
go for it.

464
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:16,180
You guys solved it. How was that kiss? How was that kiss?

465
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,660
that's the fastest you guys have ever solved on my

466
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:26,000
okay. We ruled out kissing. We ruled out a hand.

467
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,800
Under the bad stuff, I pulled his hair for a little bit. We did all this. We

468
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:34,660
did all this stuff and it we did all this stuff and it took like five

469
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,500
minutes. So then the rest of the time that loop was just as waiting.

470
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,740
I bet this is going to work. I bet it. I bet we're going to

471
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,640
yeah having the like time loop you kill yourself thing, but you just

472
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,240
the other people who are also stuck.

473
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:56,640
So you all remember what I forgot you guys are also in it. Neither of us will

474
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,340
remember this. If we just go for it,

475
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:09,380
okay, all right, so we need to wait. It's time. Okay, hi, nice to meet you.

476
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:11,760
I don't remember

477
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,540
I've never been here before in my life.

478
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,740
He has no idea.

479
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,280
We both think we're taking the other one okay, so I'm at beginning of the next

480
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,940
loop. I immediately I'm just going to go into the kitchen and I'm just going to

481
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,260
be in the kitchen the whole time. So

482
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,360
jubio if you can bring up the map, please whoa

483
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,900
okay there we have no screen. Yeah, we don't have a screen today. Jubio do not

484
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:41,380
bring up the map. Why didn't we connect the laptop to the because it's playing

485
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,780
this? We didn't know we needed visual. So did you guys see on this aesthetic

486
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:48,220
kind of back drop we have here? This is the most exciting part. First of all,

487
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,740
it's a beautiful noir backdrop, which fits the noir theme. But what you guys,

488
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,220
I'd noticed while I was looking at this when I wasn't paying attention before,

489
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:58,100
ribs are only 23 cents. Whoa, that's quite cheap. Oh my God, I want to jump

490
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:02,420
into the TV like Super Mario. Milk is more expensive than ribs. These hams,

491
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,180
fresh hams. Oh, I love ribs and I love ham. Yeah, milk is more expensive than

492
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:11,680
ribs. That's so and it's all next to the Deluxe Club. I went there. I will give

493
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,820
you guys this to just look at for a second. Then just know this. There is the

494
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,140
outdoor patio. That where we start. Yes, this is where you start the concert

495
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,420
venue, the stage, the green room.

496
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,860
There are some dressing rooms, one for the Mr. Groundhog, one for Husky

497
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,420
Kitsune.

498
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,420
There's the dining room, the bathrooms

499
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,940
and the kitchen. I would say you should draw this. I can, yeah, just draw

500
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,020
this. I drew a guy. And I'll keep describing this while we're doing this

501
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,700
so also the folks at home. So the way this works is I've always wanted to do

502
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,340
this with you guys actually. It's very exciting for me. Is this detailed

503
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,940
enough or do I need to add more? I'm being serious. I know, I know you are.

504
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:54,940
Just add the bathroom area. Where's the bathroom area? The squares? Yeah,

505
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,540
yeah. And then I would just divide up the green room top into three separate

506
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,580
areas, like the right behind the stage. And then I think you're pretty much

507
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,340
good. Okay, there are some doors there, but I will just tell you about those and

508
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,140
we'll just play it like that. So the way this is going to work is that each of

509
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:16,260
the time loops, there's 15 minutes. What did you do? He dispensed his in by just

510
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,980
opening his pouch and one perfectly just flew out. That's pretty cool. That's

511
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,540
crazy. That was amazing. Wait, can you just say that? So I'm sorry, say the

512
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,420
rooms from right to left really quick again. Yes, yes. It's patio on the right,

513
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,980
outdoor patio, patio, and there's patio one. You're right. It's really like four

514
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:35,140
sections right where it's like patio concert area dining area kitchen.

515
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,540
I'm trying to listen Patrick, it's not the time. Kitchen right and so there's

516
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:42,260
the outdoor patio, then there's the concert area where there's a concert

517
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:46,780
venue on the bottom. So it's like the audience area over here. I don't have,

518
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:49,660
I have the free license so they don't let me make the fonts better. Okay.

519
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,140
The stage

520
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:56,940
and then there's like the green room in the back. What is a groundhog DR?

521
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,620
That's a dressing room. Oh okay. Yeah, not groundhog Dominican Republic.

522
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,640
Okay.

523
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,680
Can the groundhog be Dominican?

524
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,240
If you guys are really that

525
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,040
interested in that, yeah.

526
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,200
Then what's the next one on the

527
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,200
left?

528
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,080
Next is just the dining area.

529
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,200
Dining area.

530
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,320
And then in those are the

531
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,760
bathrooms off of that.

532
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,400
OK.

533
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:15,520
I mean, all the way left is the

534
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,120
kitchen.

535
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Sick. All right.

536
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,360
And officially the groundhog

537
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,160
is Dominican.

538
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
So.

539
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,520
Yeah. Sorry.

540
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,160
Wait. No. If you have something.

541
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,280
Yeah. No.

542
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:28,360
The way this works is

543
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,360
there are 15 minutes sort of

544
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:36,720
increments and I will just signal each one as it happens and say like what do

545
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,020
you guys want to do during that time and then we'll play that out and then when

546
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,960
those end we'll move on to the next 15-minute increments. Okay. That's how

547
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,720
we're gonna try to figure out what happened, what went down. Yeah, that's

548
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,920
that's kind of the beginning end of it. So right now you want to go you want to

549
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:57,640
beeline for the bathroom. The kitchen. I would like to do I remember I've done the

550
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,620
loop now probably 10 or 15 times. Yeah, okay. We can do something with

551
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,160
that. Can I...

552
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:08,520
I would recognize the waiter who serves the hog. Yeah, okay. Let's... So I'd

553
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,640
like to just try to find him and tail him for a bit. Perfect,

554
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:15,080
that's totally fine to do that. And I am gonna go backstage.

555
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,760
Perfect.

556
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,040
Nope, those are good moves. Your first opportunity to go backstage. So let's

557
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,640
start with you going to the kitchen. Okay. So

558
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,940
you guys, you guys arrive, it's back to beginning

559
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,000
Sullivan goes. What do you guys want me to do by the way? Oh, actually, also I

560
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,700
wish you guys we didn't have. Why'd you guys make me do hand something I

561
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:39,300
noticed in the last loop that I didn't haven't mentioned anybody yet is I

562
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,000
noticed that the

563
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,820
killer, the waiter that brought out the dead groundhog actually looked like on

564
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:52,360
his wrists and and up to his elbows. He had kind of encrusted shit. Okay, yeah,

565
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:58,640
so I need you to go into the toilet okay and go down as far into the pipe as you

566
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,280
can go because it's think that if he had killed the guy, the weapons probably

567
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,100
down there, that's probably

568
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,700
yeah, you need to dive into it ahead first, like all the way like do you want

569
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,600
me to do that every single loop like you? Yes, I think actually I have a better

570
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,200
idea. I think my fist, I think I was just like a baby. I think I will just

571
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,480
kill you right now so that you're not in the loops and I'll do that every single

572
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:21,800
time.

573
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:26,780
I'd like to shoot him in the head yeah, okay, yeah, you do the crowd around you

574
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:27,660
goes crazy,

575
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:34,140
going nuts. You guys are getting arrested. The loop restart arrested for

576
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:36,060
fucking what killing a

577
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:41,420
fucking animal okay, okay, wait, maybe just kill me in a quieter area or a

578
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:41,860
quieter.

579
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:46,020
You know what's a living that might be the best thing you've ever little

580
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,420
clip.

581
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,340
No, it's not worth it. Go eat the poop out of the toilet. You got it because it

582
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:55,540
runs to the toilet. Okay, cool. So you go into the kitchen,

583
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,620
you see Leo goes up to try to talk to you guys. I guess you just

584
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,680
beeline past him. Yeah. Okay. Hi, bye. You go past him. I'm sure I

585
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,620
know where everybody is right now. Cool. You go past him, you go past

586
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,620
the crowd venue,

587
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:12,880
you get to the security area to enter into the concert. He's like,

588
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,380
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, concert hasn't started yet. You're not allowed

589
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:15,780
in here."

590
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,500
Yeah, we are.

591
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:23,500
what we're all allowed in here because I bought the most tickets.

592
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,460
You bought a lot of tickets, but the concert I bought the most tickets. I

593
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,940
didn't buy a lot of tickets. I bought the most old speaking with disadvantage.

594
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,300
Well, it's true, though. Well, it was a natural. What he's saying is true.

595
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:40,260
All right, can I can I have a can I also have a can I ever have so we

596
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,980
can have a retcon memory from a past time loop was the waiter wearing a

597
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:49,900
the waiter wearing a name tag before if not that's okay. Now it was okay, but I

598
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,940
wouldn't reasonably know his name. Can I pitch a name? Okay,

599
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,740
well, maybe you maybe one time, but you don't have to give it to me. That's I

600
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,060
won't go to yeah. You can try again, though. Try it. I have to. I just have

601
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:03,140
to go to the bathroom. I think I mean I think I saw my friend. I don't have

602
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,660
that. Why don't you let that frog go to the bathroom? Now I can't go in. You

603
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,060
have invisibility and disguises you guys. I want to go. You want to yell at

604
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,580
the guy, though, okay, I saw you literally let you stop. Okay, first of

605
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,580
all, a frog who was an accident, one of the most pathetic forms of life on the

606
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:19,500
earth. You let him in. I'm important. I'm a celebrity. I borrow somebody's phone

607
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,100
and I start filming and I go, we got a we got a Karen y'all. All right. All right.

608
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,020
All right. All right. Enough with. Okay, fine, fine, fine. Just get just just I

609
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,580
don't want to be Karen. Okay, so just like keep. No, I was saying don't say

610
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,660
anything. Don't say anything. Okay. Did I misunderstand that? No, you didn't shut

611
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:41,100
the fuck up. Karen, go home. You're fired. Okay, I'm fired for being a Karen. And

612
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,060
so yeah, you guys are allowed in. I can't believe that were

613
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:49,980
happen this time, and so yeah you're going to go to the kitchen right and

614
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,380
you're going to backstage the backstage and where did you want? I'm trying to

615
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,780
find the waiter, the waiter. Okay, so let's finish you out. So you go towards

616
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,140
the kitchen and

617
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,980
as you're walking past, you see

618
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:06,140
you're walking past the kitchen, the doors to the kitchen. Oh, this is

619
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,700
perfect. Actually, you see Gary see enterprise sitting at a table on the

620
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:11,660
phone with somebody

621
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,980
Oh, you can keep going. I'll kind of cock an ear as I go maybe catch a snippet.

622
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:26,860
What do you mean? No, I... Well, tell him that... This wouldn't happen if... Roll, roll. If

623
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:30,700
you want to listen further, you're going to have to try to like... Roll stealth. To get

624
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:37,420
closer. Okay, what stealth is that? That's balance ball. Okay, that's a 14. Okay. You're

625
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,700
able to sort of like perk over a little bit more you hear him say I don't care

626
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,300
how popular he is it's not right he stole our IP and now his product is gonna do

627
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:53,340
better than us I'm in his own freaking event right now okay cool so he stole our

628
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,000

00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,560
Can I help you? Botas? Yes.

00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,300
You're next up. You wanted to go to... I wanna find the waiter.

633
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,820
To find the waiter. Okay, so you walk into the

634
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:27,180
venue as well. You see Gary C. You see the same conversation that he saw,

635
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,980
but he was listening into it. You flag down the waiter. Yeah, you see him

636
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,820
there. And he says, "Is there anything I can help you with, sir?"

637
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,120
Yeah, I am

638
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:43,120
training to be the new waiter at this venue, and they told me that I need

639
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:47,280
to come and tail you for a little bit, just for the service.

640
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,460
old. I'm not going to I could do it just regular

641
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:02,940
damn well, of course, I'll tail the way to program. Well, let's just I don't

642
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,900
know why you're being so condescending. It's pretty common. No, no, no, I'm not

643
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,860
condescending at all. It's not calling. It doesn't have a name. The tail the

644
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,940
waiter, no, it's very you would do it any kind of you guys really rich.

645
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:16,940
There was somebody's following when somebody's following somebody to learn

646
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,900
to do a job, you're tailing them or you're shadowing them. Fucking Sonic the Hedgehog

647
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,580
vibes man. Real as fuck. That's crazy. So I would like to start shadowing this waiter.

648
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,700
Okay cool. So you're going to follow the waiter around and we'll go back to you as he goes

649
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:38,780
about his shit. Shift. Nice. You're up. So you're going backstage. So you get through

650
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:46,220
this first bouncer but now you're going backstage. And I have a lanyard that has every ticket

651
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,820
that I bought. So I could have bought... Is there a VIP backstage pass?

652
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,940
You did establish this up top. I'm gonna let you just go in there. So you go in

653
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,580
there, you're in the green room right now.

654
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:03,620
So the green room on your right... You're nut? I nut. I nut. I nut. I nut.

655
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:10,660
I nut because I've never seen something so lavish like this. You're on the...

656
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:15,540
When you walk in, on your right, you see a door, it says the Hase Kitsune's

657
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,940
dressing room on the left is to Mr. Groundhog's dressing room. Okay, while

658
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:24,500
I'm in the green room, though, I nudge one of the roadies and I say green room.

659
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,060
This room is barely green. I didn't even call it a green room. This room is

660
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:27,860
barely green.

661
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,060
Yeah, man, it's true.

662
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,260
He is one hundred dollars.

663
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:38,340
Nice man.

664
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:43,460
Your laugh is super scary,

665
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,940
but I kind of like

666
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:52,740
I did too much some kind of tech.

667
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,340
Yeah, so I'm freaking out a little bit, so I run to

668
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:05,940
I run out of the room because I realized that maybe I run out of the

669
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,540
green room where I was and I made that joke out of embarrassment because I

670
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:16,620
realized that the joke was bad and I fall. I liked it too. I fall back and I

671
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:22,100
lean my back on the door near Hudson's room. Okay. And what do I hear?

672
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:27,620
Who's Hudson? Very nice. It's fine. You could say that. Roll. No, no, no. You

673
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,940
just hear this. You just hear this. You just hear this. Should I roll

674
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:35,260
perception because I'm freaking out. Why do you want to not hear it? You don't

675
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,500
have to roll. You're hearing this. I was trying to be fair. No, no, because

676
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:45,060
because it's a it's it's I would say roll. Actually, what I would say is

677
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,640
because you just slammed yourself against the door

678
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,300
roll.

679
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,700
It's kind of more like a

680
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,620
okay, you're fine then all right. So, then you hear you hear her say

681
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,660
take this

682
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,140
stand. Okay,

683
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,860
do it

684
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:06,180
say it doesn't sound like you heard that. Can you say that exactly again?

685
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,680
say it louder and so that you hear the door start to open, but a fly buzz by my

686
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,540
ear. So I didn't hear it, so it's not fair. You hear a door start. I was a

687
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,960
real life intervention. You want to react to this. Where am I in relation to

688
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,620
the door? Your back is against the door, which is what you described to me. Okay,

689
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:26,600
so I stand up and I lean with the door. I try to make myself as flat as possible.

690
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:32,580
I like that I try to follow the door to the wall. I love that

691
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,800
roll

692
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,500
that's kind of athletics. That's kind of I guess I guess I still Panther,

693
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:46,340
I guess still so it's been we have. Can you make a new stack very nice

694
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:50,500
calling a way about just all pink and I teen right yeah, that's a great idea.

695
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,520
We need a new for big head. That's only a pink Panther, a kind of things,

696
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,260
pink pants are good. We would use a we would basically only roll. I would only

697
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:01,440
how would be an incredible. Can we make a system where it's like the different

698
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,620
things are like a pink panther, Mr. Mago,

699
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:10,900
think of all the things that we do yeah right yeah, Mr. Bean's, a great one,

700
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:15,120
Tom and Jerry, Tom, Tom and Jerry Frank's driving yeah bugs bunny, the

701
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:20,960
squad. This is such a good idea yeah. I love this, but so this opens up and

702
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,860
yet you do it perfectly and you see walk. I make a creaking sound with my

703
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:26,400
mouth

704
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,560
Okay, that's what you do you do a motor a Ducati

705
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,580
the roadies like that's the beginning of a playboy car. He's on a cool sound man

706
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,920
that door is awesome.

707
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,940
These doors he's a wait wait wait a second let me make that door.

708
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,760
You have to do the sound of

709
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,960
he's like what put you mess it up you like,

710
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:03,760
but yeah, so you see walk out not husky tsune, though, but one of her V tuber

711
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,680
like girls who are part of her posse, remember V tuber kind of hose.

712
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:11,940
I wish I had a phone to text the other guys what I just saw and you see her

713
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:12,360
go

714
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:19,900
dash P

715
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:25,140
and you you see her walk right into the ground hogs room.

716
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:26,520
So

717
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,280
look at the time for this. Yeah, I would say fifteen minutes go by.

718
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,820
Okay,

719
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:38,980
and you see how we'll go back to you in a second. Okay, fifteen minutes go

720
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,960
by. So you make sure I know where everybody is right now.

721
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,960
Cool. You're in the kitchen, right? Yeah. Okay, so you're in the kitchen.

722
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,200
You've been just, I guess, like

723
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,120
I'm eating all of the ingredients, the wrong

724
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:56,640
ingredients.

725
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,640
Bla bla bla.

726
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,640
Please stop, stop.

727
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,640
Bla bla bla.

728
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,640
I do not do this.

729
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,640
That's how we treat French around here.

730
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,640
And you see, what?

731
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
This is how they treat me.

732
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Bla bla bla.

733
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
That's not what I sound like.

734
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
Bla bla bla.

735
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:08,640
No, it's not what I sound like.

736
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,640
Bla bla bla.

737
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,640
Stop it.

738
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,640
And how can you understand me?

739
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,640
Because I don't know.

740
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:13,640
I did not think about that before.

741
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:14,640
Do I sound like Zitong?

742
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,640
No, it's not true.

743
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,640
And so, like you see, so far from what you can notice, nothing unusual.

744
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
I mean, I'm not saying that I'm a bad singer.

745
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:18,640
I'm just saying that I'm a bad singer.

746
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:19,640
I'm just saying that I'm a bad singer.

747
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,600
no, it's not true

748
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:25,880
yeah, and so like you see so far from what you can notice nothing unusual

749
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:30,120
people just doing. What was the dish that was supposed to be the ground?

750
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,560
How to be the butter burger butter burger? Okay, I basically I'm like can

751
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:40,760
you show I just really want to see the making of the butter burger surprise

752
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,480
nailed it.

753
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:48,400
I suppose I can show you this yes, and yeah he goes well. No, when it's like I

754
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,160
I heard about your Tale the Waiter program.

755
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:53,160
Yes, of course.

756
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
I wanted to participate in it.

757
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,040
Very famous, very important, not condescending program.

758
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,200
Maybe then you've also heard of Shadow the Chef.

759
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,200
Shadow the Chef.

760
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,200
Oh.

761
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,400
So I was hoping that when you do make the Butter Burger I could...

762
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,400
He sounds cool.

763
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Roll persuasion.

764
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
We're speaking with advantage.

765
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,400
My God.

766
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,520
You know me.

767
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,840
I could be a DM so easily.

768
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,840
You could.

769
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:11,840
It's really not very hard.

770
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:12,840
It's not.

771
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,840
It's a joke.

772
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,840
Oh, that's a 17.

773
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:15,840
That's very nice.

774
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:16,840
Yeah.

775
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:17,840
He's like, "Yes, of course.

776
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,880
shout to me when I make zip about the burger surprise,

777
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,800
Bertie Burger,

778
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,880
Pink Panther

779
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:34,360
in my head. I'm going to go home and re watch that. I watch it. I watch it a

780
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:36,200
couple of months ago. Honestly, funny

781
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,800
things. So I keep myself. This is a Steve Martin. One of the stuff with his

782
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,120
secretary is so which one is it when the giant globe rolls down the that's the

783
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,200
first one. That's the first that one I saw in the it is fine. I remember

784
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,880
specifically that scene. I almost peed myself. I think so. That movie is still

785
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,040
fun. I've never seen the Peter Sellers one is that one. I think it's good. No,

786
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,360
I mean it's it's good. It's not the same kind of no yeah, it was there. All

787
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,620
they're very dated, but the the the new pink panthers came out after Austin

788
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,520
power, where they realized this should be Austin power. Yeah, right yeah, he's

789
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,680
a foreign guy like right yeah, yeah, let's have an American play a foreign

790
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,320
guy. Okay, cool, so yeah, you've got that on lock like you're going to be

791
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:16,960
the shadows guy throughout. Oh, it is that the one to where he where he farts

792
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,540
in front of Beyonce. Yes, Beyonce is so fine in that that movie is funny. When

793
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:21,660
you

794
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:26,680
also even think about this, she was she is my God, she was just doing that.

795
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:31,080
Why does she have the greatest taste of all time and literally a large, but

796
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:36,160
that's you probably would heard the fart and she was like that's nothing yeah.

797
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,080
You should smell

798
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:45,620
You can see my farts. My farts are loud. So you, meanwhile, Ray William Johnson,

799
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:49,360
you've been shadowing your waiter friend here. I wanna say this, he goes to

800
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,880
the bathroom, I go to the bathroom.

801
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,880
I'm glued to his hip. Yeah, yeah, he's like, "Of course, that's what I expect

802
00:46:55,880 --> 00:47:00,760
you to do. You must pee when I pee." I will. Good. I will. Poop when I

803
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,920
poop. I won't. That's a little too much. Well...

804
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:09,160
I will. I will. That's right. And so yeah, you keep doing these things and you

805
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,100
walk back into the kitchen and you see,

806
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:15,500
again, this is before the concert, so this is an area that's not supposed to

807
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:20,200
be open yet, really. But you see Leo the Collector walk in and you also see him

808
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,320
with one of his leprechaun slaves as well walk in too.

809
00:47:23,320 --> 00:47:26,200
What up, slave? High five.

810
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:30,440
Yeah. Hearty, hearty, hearty, hearty. Yeah.

811
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:36,180
Oh yes, I live right what you oh shadowing a waiter. I see terrific

815
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,180
kitchen because he's shadowing the ship. Oh yeah, well the waiter doesn't go in

816
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,760
the kitchen. They have a waiter's room, a waiter's pantry yeah

817
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:00,620
because they don't really bother with the food.

818
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:02,020
Oh bother!

819
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:07,120
I hope it's going well though the program, then you're enjoying it.

820
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,120
It's amazing.

821
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:11,120
I'm learning how to carry a bunch of stuff.

822
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:12,120
That's incredible.

823
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,920
And how to pee and poo mostly.

824
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,320
That's wonderful.

825
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,120
It's good to hear.

826
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,320
I will leave you to it.

827
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:22,820
And yeah, he goes and he turns to his slave at this point.

828
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:25,520
Now,

829
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,660
you slave at this point, he'll be free. So well, this is in the past, so you

830
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,580
never know he will be free. Yeah, he may be free. So you you see

831
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,680
husky tsune come out the door and she sees you. She goes

832
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:41,120
Patrick,

833
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:47,040
I say nothing because I'm pretending to be part of the door.

834
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,120
She rolled her eyes and she goes and she sort of like starts to linger,

835
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:57,020
I used to linger around. That's my creek sound and then I jump off the door.

836
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:03,620
Yeah, and I say, aha, I bet you thought I was part of the door. No, I said your

837
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:06,580
name, so I knew exactly who you were. Well, I couldn't hear because I was a

838
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,160
door and doors can't hear right

839
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:10,040
smart as ever

840
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:11,880
bitch.

841
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,420
deserve

842
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:24,120
like what do you want anything or what

843
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:32,880
I just take out one hundred. I just just I'm just folding hundreds. I'm like

844
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:34,120
look whatever you're going to do.

845
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,720
Let me do it and I'll pay you and I'll double whatever they're paying you.

846
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,660
what wait if we this is such a good strategy. If we have if we have

847
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:53,320
infinite time loops, all we have to do is go to every single and try to pay

848
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,560
them off and just pay them off here. That's why can we let's just skip

849
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:58,960
through it. We'll go through every single time when we choose a different

850
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,520
person, go up to them and say I'll pay you five hundred million dollars.

851
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:08,360
Don't what he said was whatever you're doing, I'll do it and I'll pay you and

852
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:13,360
I'll double whatever, whatever they're paying you way created so many for you.

853
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:18,200
she wants to perform yeah. I was like she's like I'm you want to go on stage.

854
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:24,480
If that's what you're doing, that's what I'm going to do my God yeah sure roll

855
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,100
insight

856
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:31,500
what that be bird owl

857
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:39,700
would be okay, then I got eighteen okay, it's time to simplify you have plus

858
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,920
three bird have plus three bird owl

859
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,620
apple more to bird

860
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:48,560
bird of an animal.

861
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,820
This is too complicated.

862
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:57,320
So

863
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:02,920
this is literally a

864
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:05,720
sheet for people who have mental this

865
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:07,720
literally for dyslexia.

866
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,340
the thing that still cracks me up. Maybe people haven't seen this because I

867
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:15,780
know we introduced these a while ago. I know I think the one that still gets me

868
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,380
so fucking good balance speed.

869
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,100
Speed is a picture of an outline of a rabbit

870
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:27,280
a big as rabbit

871
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,620
yeah balance ball. I was really I was funny because it's on my I haven't

872
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:36,320
transferred my hard drive to my new computer, so I couldn't find this, and so

873
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,120
had to re Google it and they added like now they added like dexterity and like

874
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:45,080
strength, like we need to add labels just because people are dyslexic. It

875
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:48,360
would be they can't read. There's a new one that's a Facebook like with a

876
00:51:48,360 --> 00:51:52,040
metal. Yes, I that was never there before. They added proficiency bonus down

877
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,200
there and then like where you can list your skills, which I thought was a nice

878
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,280
idea. I like that it also skills I add bonus to

879
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,920
Oh, I add the bones for like simplistic folk like like

880
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,760
my God, it's both a simple character sheet and also one that's for this like

881
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:15,360
it's honestly still quite hard. It should be one number yeah. Yeah, it

882
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:18,960
should be yeah, then yeah that number against just average this out yeah. We

883
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,520
just do that and then we just roll again. I would be down for that. It's

884
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,960
basically what we do anyway. Yeah,

885
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,480
I'm still dead. I'm still I'm still fucking with the Pink Panther sheet.

886
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,720
Yeah, so you

887
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:38,720
So, with the 18, that's not all she's doing. You know that for sure. And when you said

888
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:43,720
to her, like, "Your insane thing about paying her," or whatever, but when you said to her,

889
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:50,440
like, "Whatever you're doing, I'll do it," it was not just a, like, "What's this weird

890
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:53,720
guy saying?" There was, like, a, "Does he know something?"

891
00:52:53,720 --> 00:52:54,720
He knows.

892
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,100
So but then she brushed past it because then you said a bunch of random weird crap. But

893
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:06,320
like you noticed that she was trying to like hide something for sure. Like no doubt in

894
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:12,760
your mind. Can I roll perception? Because now I want to now I want to. You have the

895
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:18,680
ability Yoda's mind. I drew I drew Cameron. You can read people's minds. Oh my God. I'm

896
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:23,120
going to read her mind right now then. OK. So she has to roll to resist that. This is

897
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,040
- So you don't roll for that.

898
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,400
- Oh, she does. - No, no, no, no, no, no.

899
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,240
Nothing happened.

900
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,800
- This is goofy's, this is a goofy.

901
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:32,520
- What is your max? - An extremely goofy.

902
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,720
- I think the DC's 13 for you, yeah.

903
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,560
She does not pass it.

904
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,800
So you hear, when Yoda's mind,

905
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:41,080
it's you hear kind of at first surface level thoughts.

906
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,760
- Yeah. - Which for her right now.

907
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,840
- Then deeper, then question, yeah.

908
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,780
- Yeah, which are right, like so yeah.

909
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,800
So it's surface level thoughts and I sort of augmented it

910
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:50,160
where it's like, you get surface level thoughts,

911
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,180
then you can get a bit deeper in terms of motivations

912
00:53:53,180 --> 00:53:55,020
and things that are really troubling them.

913
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,300
And then question, I sort of made this

914
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,160
into your divination piece of this,

915
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,320
where you get, if you keep, if you keep,

916
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:04,760
she keeps failing the DC and you keep wanting to dive deeper,

917
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,800
you can literally ask her thought a question,

918
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,640
like remind a question and get an answer.

919
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,980
So this first level though,

920
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:12,520
you do hear her basically think,

921
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:15,640
just 'cause it's right on her mind,

922
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,460
which is like, what does he know?

923
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:27,000
Okay, I'm doing I know that you're up to something. Do you say that to her? I say that in the mind

924
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Yeah, I'll let you do that. Wait

925
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,700
No, I'm just gonna delve deeper. I'm gonna tell you okay

926
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:37,680
Okay, she fails again, oh fuck yeah, okay

927
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:44,600
She's really really concerned about how much people like mr. Groundhog more than her

928
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,480
and

929
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,240
case to stop it like murder him to I'm delving deeper I'm delving deeper.

930
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,840
She got a 20.

931
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,340
Oh, I'm son of a crap.

932
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:02,140
Redo the blue kicks you out.

933
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:04,440
But you know these things.

934
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:10,040
But now I look at her and I just say I know I know that you're starved for

935
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:17,140
attention and you're going to do something crazy tonight and I wanted and

936
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,020
whatever. Hey, you know what? I'm actually on your side.

937
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:25,520
I'm on your side, so I'll pay double what they're paying you to do.

938
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,400
Well, that didn't sound so on the side.

939
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,400
Role deception.

940
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,820
A crit 10.

941
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:34,580
It's a 10 plus...

942
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,440
Role speaking, yeah.

943
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:37,700
Okay, so that's a 13.

944
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,500
She's like, "Why would you want to help me?"

945
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,960
'Cause I'm on drugs and I'm bored.

946
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,520
that's actually I'm not a good role for that.

947
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,520
Basically, the best reason I've ever heard of you ever.

948
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,440
She says

949
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,520
I'm just trying to screw up his performance,

950
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:05,240
so there's no other motivations or anything like that. I want to go back

951
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:05,760
to jail.

952
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,120
Yeah, I guess you have a kind of you wait. I don't want to screw up his

953
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,200
performance. How you gonna screw up the performance? The performance was

954
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:18,260
unbelievable every loop. She clearly fails to screw it up right now. My

955
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,080
girl's in there.

956
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:23,520
He's a well, guess what? I know that she screws it up.

957
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:28,560
What do you mean? But let's get the details, though. Yeah, yeah, well, yeah,

958
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,280
tell me what's up, but I know that she's gonna fuck it up because that groundhog

959
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,760
is too charismatic and he probably he's probably bone in her right now. Patrick

960
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,440
completely fucks us up, but we go through the

961
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,960
here again.

962
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:43,000
he starts talking. He says I already know

963
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,240
yeah,

964
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,640
no, no, no yeah, we're good here yeah.

965
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,340
She says right now

966
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:55,140
she's trying to do him.

967
00:56:55,140 --> 00:57:00,540
He's going to do her anyway. He's a complete pig, but he's a hog. He's a

968
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,740
hog. He's a ground hog. Correct. A hog is not a pig. I mean, a ground hog is

969
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:08,640
not a is going to give him a bad batch of technos line. I think he's going to

970
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:10,160
completely blow it tonight.

971
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,160
Well, he doesn't.

972
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,160
What are you talking about?

973
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,160
Just explain.

974
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,160
So I'm in a time loop

975
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,160
and I have to...

976
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,160
Well, he dies.

977
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:24,160
And you get framed.

978
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,160
What?

979
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,160
And if you don't want to get...

980
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,160
If you don't want to go back to jail, you're going to help me out

981
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,160
and

982
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:34,160
if you're involved in a murder

983
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,160
or something, or if there's somebody that you know...

984
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,160
What do you mean he dies?

985
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,600
I'm stuck in a time loop. Look, you're gonna fail at the, he's gonna do good on the performance

986
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:45,920
and I know that he's in there boning her.

987
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,120
He's not boning her. Why don't you go in there and check?

988
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,080
Okay, and the doors are next to each other?

989
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,080
He is boning her.

990
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,080
Yeah, he's... Look!

991
00:57:52,080 --> 00:58:01,920
God damn it! But like, you see him also slugging down the drink that she gave him.

992
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,920
Don't do that!

993
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,020
(mumbling)

994
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,820
- Yeah, she poisoned it or some shit.

995
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,940
(mumbling)

996
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,740
Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.

997
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:14,180
(mumbling)

998
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,380
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know.

999
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,420
Well, let me tell you, I'm stuck in a time loop

1000
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,040
and you die.

1001
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:20,880
(mumbling)

1002
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,380
- Someone barging in on you having sex,

1003
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,980
it's like, I'm stuck in a time loop.

1004
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,820
- Listen, I know you're in the middle of something

1005
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,700
right now, but you're gonna die.

1006
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:31,340
And if we don't figure out--

1007
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,180
- Hussie's like--

1008
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:33,020
- How about you just--

1009
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:38,120
but you're fucking traitor. You fuck me again. You asshole. Well, no, I didn't

1010
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:38,980
he fucked her

1011
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:45,100
and I think you see you see the ground hog. Go you see security go in and grab

1012
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:50,580
Hussey to I'm going to get you for this Patrick Yoda. All right, off and now I

1013
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,920
got to perform on the stage. I guess you see the ground. He puts his hand on

1014
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:54,340
your shoulder.

1015
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,040
so we'll go back to that in a second.

1016
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,040
You are in the kitchen right. Let's have they when are they going to start

1017
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,080
preparing the butter burger. Do I have time to do something else before? Yes,

1018
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,280
you definitely do. Okay,

1019
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,420
well, I guess

1020
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:17,960
what else is there that I can do? I guess I want to go find and I want to

1021
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,880
make sure that whatever I'm doing, I could be back in time for them to

1022
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,160
completely start making the butter burger. Yes, you will be able to have

1023
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:27,580
Okay, I want to go find your action this time. You can do one thing. I want to

1024
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:34,140
find out Mr. Enterprise. Okay, cool. So we are now in the yeah, we're gonna

1025
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:37,800
move forward anyway too. So the concert's about to start. So we'll go to you

1026
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,720
too. I'm backstage. I'm throwing up.

1027
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:46,060
You're gonna find Mr. Groundhog, Gary C. Enterprise

1028
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,920
in the crowd and roll perception.

1029
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:59,180
natural eight natural eight plus owl is ten. Okay,

1030
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:04,280
it's probably that's actually probably sufficient. You notice that he has a

1031
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,880
camera he did not have before. Okay,

1032
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,900
I want to try like a big old fashioned camera with like a light bulb that

1033
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:15,400
would like explode if you took the picture. It's okay. I would like to

1034
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:21,000
first, I just wanna try and steal it from him without him noticing. Sure,

1035
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,960
several side of hand. That is balance ball right, it's correct.

1036
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,720
That's a 14. Okay,

1037
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,200
let me see if he notices.

1038
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:40,080
Yeah, no yeah, you're able to sort of like take this off of him and what do

1039
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:43,400
you do? You walk away. Is there a way for me to view the photos on it or is

1040
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,840
it so old that I can't see

1041
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:49,000
because we're in the future? So I figured old camera could still be. You

1042
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,160
you can see the photos on it. What's what's on there anything it's just it's

1043
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:55,880
him vacationing with his girlfriend. Okay, well I take pictures of those

1044
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:56,640
with my phone

1045
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:08,560
as the chef and then I and then I tap and then I tap him on the shoulder and

1046
01:01:08,560 --> 01:01:11,280
as he turns around, I take a picture of him with the camera.

1047
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:16,440
why I'm holding it up. He's small right. Yes, he is

1048
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,540
give it to me. Why do you want it so bad just because it's yours? I need it for

1049
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:23,160
what it. What do you need it for

1050
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:31,220
promise? You won't tell he's yeah of course, right to gather partners and

1051
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,400
speaking of partners damn

1052
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:36,800
wait, wait, wait,

1053
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,200
what's it out of play?

1054
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,360
This is perfect. Our TV stopped auto playing, stopped playing the noir

1055
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:53,340
background and now we're in a cafe. A beautiful cafe. It's a relaxing jazz

1056
01:01:53,340 --> 01:01:56,400
piano. So there's the through line. Wait, turn the volume up.

1057
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,120
I wanna hear what this is. Let's hear this shit.

1058
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,900
Okay.

1059
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:09,440
It's a bad remote. It's not jazz at all so far.

1060
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,620
I think this is jazz.

1061
01:02:11,620 --> 01:02:12,620
Completely jazz.

1062
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,620
I think this is jazz.

1063
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:14,620
Oh yeah.

1064
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:15,620
It's pretty relaxing.

1065
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:16,620
It actually is putting you to sleep.

1066
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,620
It is very relaxing.

1067
01:02:17,620 --> 01:02:18,620
Turn it down.

1068
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,620
Turn it down.

1069
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,620
I'm going to save this video though.

1070
01:02:21,620 --> 01:02:22,620
Okay, cool.

1071
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:23,620
So, roll intimidation, so speaking with advantage.

1072
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:24,620
He was about to say that it was okay.

1073
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,620
Yeah, he said he wouldn't tell, but he's almost there.

1074
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:26,620
With advantage.

1075
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,620
Okay, that's a 19, 17.

1076
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:28,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1077
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,620
He goes for it.

1078
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,620
He's got it.

1079
01:02:30,620 --> 01:02:31,620
He's got it.

1080
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:32,620
He's got it.

1081
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:33,620
He's got it.

1082
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,620
He's got it.

1083
01:02:34,620 --> 01:02:35,620
He's got it.

1084
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,620
He's got it.

1085
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,620
He's got it.

1086
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:38,620
He's got it.

1087
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:40,880
seventeen. Yeah, he goes

1088
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,140
trying to take a picture.

1089
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:47,640
That's it

1090
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:50,320
promise. I won't tell anybody

1091
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,620
fucking more.

1092
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:55,500
You go through the time with again

1093
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:58,140
realize, oh wait, probably had something else. He's trying to do

1094
01:02:58,140 --> 01:02:59,900
it. Yeah, try to take a picture

1095
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,340
Mr. Crown.

1096
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,460
After concerts, he likes to go out with his horse

1097
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:10,800
and I'm trying to take a picture so I can let people know about this.

1098
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:11,800
Why?

1099
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:16,680
What's wrong with... Why do you want people to know? He's ruining my

1100
01:03:16,680 --> 01:03:21,500
business. How? First of all, when you say my business, you mean our business.

1101
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:25,520
I assume, unless you have something on the side, I don't know. He's not

1102
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:29,560
touching hot soda, cold dog. So what's he touching? He's touching my... Your

1103
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:29,940
thing?

1104
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:34,680
I have a lot of...

1105
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,360
Okay, this does kind of involve you guys, so you--

1106
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:40,080
- I need to know about it. - Promise you can't get mad?

1107
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,400
- I won't get mad unless it's--

1108
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,800
- I have been selling action figures

1109
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:46,960
based off you guys for a little while now.

1110
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:47,800
- Slap him.

1111
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,460
- Oh, my God.

1112
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,520
- Are you serious? - Pretty badass, honestly.

1113
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:57,280
- I want three of each sent to my house today.

1114
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,840
- Socially maladjusted kids love it.

1115
01:03:59,840 --> 01:04:01,720
They've been using it to--

1116
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:04,320
- So what's this Groundhog, idiot?

1117
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:07,580
but he's basically been profit. He's been investing in knockoffs and then

1118
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:11,080
selling them as his own. These are my statues, you guys are my guys. We

1119
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,920
should kill that guy. No, I don't want I'm looking for I'm waiting for his

1120
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,040
reaction when I say that

1121
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:19,920
I just don't want him to be fighting, but just getting in the way of what I'm

1122
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,080
trying to do, but it's actually a good idea. Kill him. We should kill him. If

1123
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:24,680
someone did kill him, you wouldn't care.

1124
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,640
Who you think would kill him?

1125
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:32,240
I don't know. Okay, it seems all right, whatever.

1126
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,560
Okay, okay, so when at what time are you planning to take the picture

1127
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:40,040
after the concert?

1128
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:43,160
We had question, are you planning to take the

1129
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,600
making the butter burger or right

1130
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:53,400
well, the butter burgers part of the I mean he usually bows out before dinner,

1131
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:57,080
so I'm going to try to go right before they serve the meal and go out. You

1132
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:00,200
mind if I take if I take the picture with you,

1133
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:04,340
if you want to be involved with me, yeah, I could probably you

1134
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:08,780
roll the

1135
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:16,220
septum. He loves him. No, it's a nat twenty. I love you man.

1136
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:20,920
Okay, okay, okay, I'm going to go out to the to the to the patio again

1137
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,600
right right before we go into dinner and then meet me out there and then

1138
01:05:24,600 --> 01:05:28,640
we'll go out to the back. Okay, all right cool and I also want to text.

1139
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,680
Am I going to miss the butter burger for this? Probably. Okay, I'm going to take

1140
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,680
Sullivan. I'm going to text Sullivan and I'm going to tell Sullivan.

1141
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:39,580
He's just way too down.

1142
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,880
Can we do another time?

1143
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,680
No, no, what do you I'm in the kitchen?

1144
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,280
I just wanted to tell Sullivan to go to watch over the butter burger.

1145
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,280
Can we do another time?

1146
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,980
We were still Sullivan's phone.

1147
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:49,880
His mind's broken.

1148
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:52,780
I am and we go back to exactly where we are.

1149
01:05:52,780 --> 01:05:55,780
I'm going to roll athletics to see if Sullivan can climb out of the pipe.

1150
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:56,280
This cycle.

1151
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,580
He has not been able to.

1152
01:05:57,580 --> 01:06:00,080
he's been dying in the poop every time. So

1153
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:06,120
okay, pretty good. Yeah, he'll get out of the pipe this time. Yeah,

1154
01:06:06,120 --> 01:06:09,440
I where am I with this waiter? So

1155
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,880
right now you are

1156
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,120
going back to the bathroom again with the waiter. This guy really has a

1157
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:17,640
problem.

1158
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:23,400
He might be diabetic. Yeah, his prostate. It's looking actually quite foamy

1159
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:23,920
waiter.

1160
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,680
Yes,

1161
01:06:26,780 --> 01:06:34,220
And as you see now walking there also is Leo's leprechaun.

1162
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:35,660
He's going, "Heart to tart, heart to tart."

1163
01:06:35,660 --> 01:06:43,340
And he goes into the, like, a, you know, fucking stalls that have the doors.

1164
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,740
A bathroom stall.

1165
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:46,500
A bathroom stall.

1166
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:47,300
This is cool.

1167
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:47,740
This is great.

1168
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,860
The stalls with the doors.

1169
01:06:48,860 --> 01:06:51,180
This is exciting to know that this can happen.

1170
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,500
So he goes in there, and you're watching him pee.

1171
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:57,500
and when you see him come out, he is dressed like a sous chef.

1172
01:06:57,500 --> 01:07:01,820
The leprechaun. And he sees you, you see him, and he's like,

1173
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:06,900
"Hart-t-tart-t." Oh, waiter, so please introduce me to your chef here.

1174
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:12,700
He turns around, fully foamed, coming in and dacing on the leprechaun's head.

1175
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,820
Yeah, yeah. "Hart-t-tart-t-tart-t." I've never seen this man in my life.

1176
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:20,220
He's eating on him. I've never seen this man in my life.

1177
01:07:22,060 --> 01:07:23,560
Oh, well, if you've never seen it before,

1178
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:25,060
oh, now I recognize

1179
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:32,260
I don't know. I've seen this guy before, but never covered in P.

1180
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:37,740
He wasn't so wet when I met the leprechaun sort of tries to dash

1181
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:40,040
out the door. I don't know if you want to do anything. I'd like

1182
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:42,460
to grab him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah roll.

1183
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:48,360
Let's say which one is that? I mean, that's basically that's strength.

1184
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:51,060
Yeah, it's kind of strength. It's kind of dexterity. It's a pick one

1185
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:52,760
because it's really athletics, right?

1186
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:53,600
That's kind of how I see this.

1187
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,100
- Strength is my plus three.

1188
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,780
- It's either athletics or an attack roll.

1189
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:58,020
Let's go with athletics.

1190
01:07:58,020 --> 01:07:59,060
- Okay, I got 19.

1191
01:07:59,060 --> 01:08:00,220
- Nice, yeah. - Oh, good strength.

1192
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:03,340
- You absolutely grab him by the like scruff

1193
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:05,300
of his hairy red neck.

1194
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:06,140
- Okay.

1195
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:07,140
- And he's like running in place.

1196
01:08:07,140 --> 01:08:09,620
(yells)

1197
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,260
- Wait, taste the chef's pee to see if he has diabetes

1198
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:14,660
'cause you're a computer and you can analyze his pee.

1199
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:15,500
- Okay, I do that.

1200
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,540
- You're a demon computer, so you taste it.

1201
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:22,340
I grab grabbing him and I turn around kind of so smoothly. He has type four

1202
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:22,940
diabetes.

1203
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:27,800
Three. Well, that's actually not which doesn't exist. Yeah, that's the best

1204
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:32,900
one probably right. It's the one where you live forever. Okay, but you also

1205
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,780
need to pee foam all the time. All right, that's not so bad. No, he's gonna

1206
01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:38,620
die in like a day or so. Okay, well, do you wanna tell him?

1207
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,920
No, I'll keep that to myself. Okay, that's cool. So yeah, the leprechaun is

1208
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,280
now like sort of like he's sort of like you're holding him up. He's sort of

1209
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:48,680
Oh, our to tar. He's like looking at you kind of sad like you look like a sad

1210
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,380
dog. What are you doing and speak perfect English that I can understand

1211
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:54,720
keep

1212
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,840
to

1213
01:08:56,840 --> 01:09:03,680
sure, so I for God, you're a computer. Yeah, why you roll? Well, Google

1214
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:08,820
translating your body. Is it still brain? Yeah, yeah, brain roll brain.

1215
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:14,180
if you understand him. Sixteen nice. He goes I'm trying to

1216
01:09:14,180 --> 01:09:16,220
help out Leo.

1217
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:19,780
It's Leo. Pretty good. What does Leo need from you?

1218
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:26,760
He wants, I can't see, I can't tell you. Okay, so he wants a groundhog dead.

1219
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,480
No, I don't think so. Wait, okay.

1220
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:34,160
Is anything happening in the kitchen right now?

1221
01:09:35,840 --> 01:09:39,340
I don't know you're in the like is oh you're you're right. Is there anything

1222
01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:44,220
in the bathroom that groundhog day style I could bring up later and say like this

1223
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,240
is about to happen and then it happens to prove that I'm in a time loop.

1224
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:48,640
Oh

1225
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,720
he's about to pee on you

1226
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:55,640
he's like that already happened ten minutes ago

1227
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:02,340
like in twelve dates of Christmas, the Hallmark movie that we've all seen where

1228
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,520
she says that guy is about to...

1229
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:06,140
Right, we know the trick.

1230
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,640
Yeah, we know 12 dates of Christmas.

1231
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:09,420
Everybody knows 12 dates of Christmas.

1232
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:09,680
Yeah.

1233
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,720
We're all very familiar with it.

1234
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:12,220
I'm trying to think of what the thing would be.

1235
01:10:12,220 --> 01:10:13,720
Okay.

1236
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,020
God.

1237
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:16,720
Roll brain.

1238
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:19,880
It's like basically a history roll to see if you remember

1239
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,120
what's about to happen.

1240
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,120
God damn it.

1241
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,560
Well, I'll just observe and I'll do this again.

1242
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,700
You have to do it again later.

1243
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:30,100
Yeah. You don't remember anything, so you can't tell him that.

1244
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,500
And he's like, no, I don't think so.

1245
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:36,200
he just wants to, he wants to collect him for the zoo.

1246
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,200
He's Scottish.

1247
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,200
Wait, collect him for a zoo? He's not going to kill him for that.

1248
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:43,200
But he could to stuff him.

1249
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,200
A zoo doesn't have stuffed animals.

1250
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,200
Think about that.

1251
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:50,500
There's no stuffed animals at the zoo.

1252
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,500
The animals are alive.

1253
01:10:51,500 --> 01:10:52,000
Maybe in the gift shop.

1254
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:52,500
Taxidermy.

1255
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:56,200
I mean, I suppose it could be a failed capture.

1256
01:10:56,200 --> 01:11:00,200
But I do not think it's this leprechaun.

1257
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:04,200
So I'm going to take his coat, his chef's coat off,

1258
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,200
and I'm gonna pat him on the butt cheeks, his little butt cheeks.

1259
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:13,200
I'd like to touch them a little too long, and then I push him back into the dining room.

1260
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:17,200
Okay, cool. Alright, we'll resolve that in a second.

1261
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,200
I'm backstage, throwing up.

1262
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,200
Time for the concert.

1263
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:25,200
[gagging]

1264
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:28,200
Mr. Beaver, I don't know how you fucking do any of this shit.

1265
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:30,200
You need to stay with this hog.

1266
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:31,200
I know.

1267
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,200
He like grabs you by the shoulders, he slaps you across the face.

1268
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,200
You hear, he's going, "Fluh, fluh, fluh, fluh."

1269
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,200
You hear, "You can do this."

1270
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,200
I can do this.

1271
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,200
You guys go on stage and roll performance.

1272
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,200
You and Hussie.

1273
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,200
No, Hussie's gone in this thing. I've taken a deal.

1274
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:48,200
You and Hog.

1275
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,200
Performance, so that is speaking?

1276
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,200
Yeah.

1277
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,200
So that is an 18.

1278
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,200
Wow.

1279
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:58,800
you people are like Patrick Yoda. I thought he just skateboarded and stuff

1280
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:00,480
and you tear it up.

1281
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:04,880
Do you take the spotlight? You take the spotlight away from Mr.

1282
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:05,160
Graff?

1283
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,040
No, it's in perfect tandem.

1284
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,800
I better find your heart.

1285
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,520
I better find your heart.

1286
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,600
And you guys are just like, everybody's loving it. They're like, is this a new

1287
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:20,720
duo? Is this something we could do? I think it is. We haven't heard music this

1288
01:12:20,720 --> 01:12:24,520
biscuits and solvent had the perfect blue incident. This is amazing.

1289
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:29,860
The plot of perfect blue happens to so yeah, it happened to solve it. We

1290
01:12:29,860 --> 01:12:30,400
can't pay

1291
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,940
this is a deep lord thing. I like I remember that I just saw that like two

1292
01:12:35,940 --> 01:12:36,260
weeks

1293
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,800
exactly to solve and so what's that?

1294
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,980
You got to watch that about a frog. Yeah,

1295
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:47,920
it's a frog movie, but he got it should be called perfect green. Actually,

1296
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:48,800
think about it.

1297
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:49,300
yeah

1298
01:12:49,300 --> 01:12:53,760
yeah, I can pose nude.

1299
01:12:53,760 --> 01:13:01,760
Can we talk about a movie? I know yeah sure okay, Harry Potter and yeah, a

1300
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:02,520
little fire

1301
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,880
what I compose nude

1302
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:08,840
it now. Oh Jeez,

1303
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:15,240
so you do this. The ground hog comes up to you, he's like he's like hugging you.

1304
01:13:15,240 --> 01:13:18,640
He's like all right, let's he's like like let's blow this joint. The shit

1305
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,900
rocks. I hate that I throw this ground hog. Me and you are the new Tyler, the

1306
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,220
created ASAP Rocky

1307
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:29,380
going to do something incredible to get a real the ground hog. You think says

1308
01:13:29,380 --> 01:13:33,380
the N word, but you're not sure and you guys I'm pretty sure you can say that

1309
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:37,140
and you go look I'm from I'm from space Boston. I say it all the time

1310
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:39,500
from space

1311
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,560
from space.

1312
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:46,280
You guys go back into the dressing room. You see the like V girls of eeho's

1313
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,100
Groundhog's kind of like he's with me and you see the girls are hanging on you

1314
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:49,500
now

1315
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:52,100
and I didn't see the performance and

1316
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:56,340
want him off of that. Well, they just like it's like a yeah, I guess he saw

1317
01:13:56,340 --> 01:14:00,220
the performance and also thought it was dope and so then yeah,

1318
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:05,260
listening at the timeline here too for this, making sure

1319
01:14:05,260 --> 01:14:10,660
so I'm gonna get a pic of, I'm gonna get a pic of Groundhog and Patrick Yoda.

1320
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:16,180
of them tearing it up. Cool. Okay. Yeah.

1321
01:14:16,180 --> 01:14:19,340
Concert ends, you...

1322
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:23,460
Can I say one thing first? Yeah, of course.

1323
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:24,820
I make

1324
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:29,180
all of... You make whoopee. I make whoopee, but not before,

1325
01:14:29,180 --> 01:14:32,740
not before backstage, I,

1326
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:38,660
me, the groundhog, and all these hoes are doing in the classroom from Wild

1327
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,060
and Out.

1328
01:14:40,740 --> 01:14:44,960
just tight we're doing we're doing that we're doing that as a party game. Okay,

1329
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:45,700
Brandon is there

1330
01:14:45,700 --> 01:14:56,260
you walk in you're like

1331
01:14:56,260 --> 01:15:03,620
by doing that man, the time loop does fail and you start back to the beginning

1332
01:15:03,620 --> 01:15:08,460
again because you spent fifteen minutes doing that, but that means the ground

1333
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:12,740
dog didn't die. No, he didn't, but you need to find out who did it in the

1334
01:15:12,740 --> 01:15:15,860
original time. We're back to the top. Okay, then I don't do that. No, you do

1335
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:16,960
that. We're back to the top.

1336
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,060
Back to the top. Leo, the collector, is coming up to talk with you guys. I do

1337
01:15:21,060 --> 01:15:22,960
exactly everything that I've done. Leo,

1338
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:27,880
your zoo has enough. Leave him out of this.

1339
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,520
What are you talking about? We're in a time loop, Leo. Dumbass, you think I

1340
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:36,560
don't know? I know everything you do. Should I go to the toilet again? No,

1341
01:15:36,580 --> 01:15:43,460
Give me your phone. It's a time loop, Leo. I can prove it. I'm about to hump

1342
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:46,340
Sullivan's mouth. Watch this. And then I do that for a little bit.

1343
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,980
Say we're in a time loop. I knew that was gonna happen. And I need his phone.

1344
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:55,140
I need Sullivan's phone so I can text them when I go backstage. Did that

1345
01:15:55,140 --> 01:15:58,900
happen before the time loop? Leo. I broke my phone 'cause I sat on it.

1346
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,380
Yeah. Enough.

1347
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,820
It ends today.

1348
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:07,460
everything from every animal in your zoo will be freed.

1349
01:16:07,460 --> 01:16:13,060
I will never allow you to do that. That's fine. Then can you at least give

1350
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:13,860
me one then?

1351
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:17,940
If I can't do all of them, let me choose one. Let us have the groundhog.

1352
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,900
The groundhog. Don't do the groundhog. Well, I don't have a groundhog. Yeah,

1353
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:23,300
I know, but you're gonna collect him. You're planning to have a groundhog

1354
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:25,580
tonight. You're acting all dumb.

1355
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:29,860
Or maybe you just are dumb. And you killed the groundhog. Yes.

1356
01:16:30,740 --> 01:16:32,540
And your slave is mighty short.

1357
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:35,940
Martin Short is his name.

1358
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:41,020
Okay, can I try and see if he's playing dumb or if he really has no idea

1359
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,740
what we're talking about? Of course, yeah, roll and say.

1360
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:46,500
Okay, that is a 10.

1361
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:51,420
I mean, you see him... Maybe if anyone else wants to roll too. I'll roll as

1362
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,980
well. I'm gonna roll Patrick's mind. We're all hearing it. Roll Yoda's mind.

1363
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:58,300
Is it intelligence? 'Cause you don't roll... Oh, wait, no, I don't roll

1364
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,800
Patrick's mind. It should be called Patrick's mind.

1365
01:17:01,800 --> 01:17:06,080
All right, he fails. First thing you hear is that first level of thought,

1366
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,780
where he's like, "Why are they asking me so many questions?"

1367
01:17:08,780 --> 01:17:13,260
He doesn't know. "Why are they asking me about..." Wait, wait, wait, wait,

1368
01:17:13,260 --> 01:17:15,880
wait, wait, wait. So then the leprechaun... I'd like to talk to the

1369
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:18,880
leprechaun now. Okay, but I'm gonna delve deeper. Okay,

1370
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,520
let's do you, the leprechaun, then we'll do you, you delve deeper. Leprechaun.

1371
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,400
Tarty, tarty. You can speak to him now. You, like, I'll say that you

1372
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:31,760
exceeding that so you can stop doing what you want. I know that you want the

1373
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,260
gopher.

1374
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:37,760
I don't want to go for ground the groundhog. I know you want the groundhog.

1375
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:41,560
How did you know that because they're both small because they're both small

1376
01:17:41,560 --> 01:17:43,660
which I just came up with

1377
01:17:43,660 --> 01:17:48,360
you want to have it because you want another small friend and your crew.

1378
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:52,560
That's not why I don't know. So you do want to know shit. You do want to be

1379
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,060
you fucking little bastard.

1380
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:00,460
Artie Tartie Tartie tell me why I slap him to Adam to the zoo.

1381
01:18:00,460 --> 01:18:03,020
Why does Leo not know about this?

1382
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:09,040
No heat, he's he's ordering me to do it. He knows about it. He's our what is

1383
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,280
Leo saying right now? Oh yeah, yeah, don't deep yeah, yeah,

1384
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,500
yeah, he feels he says

1385
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:18,660
I hope they don't catch on to my plan to capture the ground.

1386
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:22,800
Okay, but we already know that he wants to capture the ground hog, so I want to

1387
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:26,020
feel a little deeper. Please be a good role.

1388
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:30,700
What is that a fail? What do you wanna ask?

1389
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:34,980
Are you gonna... Well, no, you're not. You're just trying to collect the

1390
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,540
groundhog. Don't ask a yes or no question. Yeah. So... Ask something vague

1391
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:40,460
where you force him to talk for a minute.

1392
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:48,420
What are your plans for the night? What are your plans for the groundhog?

1393
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,420
Just what are you planning to do tonight? What are you planning?

1394
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:53,180
What are your plans?

1395
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:57,780
What I'm planning to do is to tell my leprechaun that he's going to dress as a sous chef to

1396
01:18:57,780 --> 01:19:02,420
go backstage, to go back to the kitchen, to leave through the back door there, and when

1397
01:19:02,420 --> 01:19:06,020
the groundhog comes out to do his usual stroll after the concert where he walks around with

1398
01:19:06,020 --> 01:19:09,620
his horse, he's going to beat him up, take him back to my place, then we're going to

1399
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,620
have him in the zoo.

1400
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:11,620
Wait, what goes where?

1401
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:12,620
Wait, wait, wait, ask him where the- well, they don't know that.

1402
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:13,620
I don't know.

1403
01:19:13,620 --> 01:19:14,620
Ask him where that happened.

1404
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:15,620
Ask him where-

1405
01:19:15,620 --> 01:19:16,620
Where does that happen?

1406
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:17,620
Oh, behind the kitchen, of course.

1407
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:18,620
Okay, I would like to go to the kitchen.

1408
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:19,620
I would like to go to the kitchen.

1409
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:20,620
I would like to go to the kitchen.

1410
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:24,920
kitchen, of course. Okay, I would like to go in this time loop to nothing

1411
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,360
really matters time wise until that moment. I'd like to go sit behind the

1412
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:30,700
kitchen. Yeah, I wanna go there too. And I still wanna have the... I wanna

1413
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,760
get the camera again. I wanna repeat all of this. I want to repeat going

1414
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,780
on stage with... Yeah, you'll be with Gary? Yeah, Gary. I am repeating going

1415
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:40,060
on stage also. I would like to stay... You crushed the concert, Hussie's still

1416
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:43,780
arrested. Okay, cool. I would like to stay fully stealthed. I don't want

1417
01:19:43,780 --> 01:19:46,580
them to see me. Oh, and I'll turn invisible. Okay, you don't have to...

1418
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:50,820
you should roll a stealth roll.

1419
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:53,820
Okay, I've got a lot of time to set up, so it doesn't really seem like I need to.

1420
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,820
Oh, okay, I see what you mean. Like you're saying all the time.

1421
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:58,820
Still roll it, just in case it's a one. I'm sorry.

1422
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,820
But then let's go to the next loop, man.

1423
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,820
It's going to be, yeah, you're right.

1424
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:03,820
That wasn't great.

1425
01:20:03,820 --> 01:20:06,820
That's fine. It's fine. Like you said, you have tons of time to set up.

1426
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:09,820
You go around, you wait backstage, you go around the security.

1427
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:12,820
Maybe they have a business-style dumpster with a big flap.

1428
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:16,820
slap or what they have a P O S. I actually don't want to be with Gary.

1429
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:19,620
I want to not talk to him at all, but I know he's going there, so I want to

1430
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:22,940
also stealth and hide and I can maybe even turn invisible right before it

1431
01:20:22,940 --> 01:20:25,960
happens, but I want to just like keep my eye on him without him knowing I'm

1432
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:28,860
with them. We can have you outside and you, I'm still doing the concert.

1433
01:20:28,860 --> 01:20:30,940
I'm not changing. We're fast forwarding, we're back to the concert, the

1434
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:32,940
concert's over, you're with the groundhog now, right?

1435
01:20:32,940 --> 01:20:37,500
And you guys go out,

1436
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:42,220
the groundhog looks at you and he's like, "Do you want to do that dance we

1437
01:20:42,220 --> 01:20:45,960
did in the previous time loop. Now he doesn't you guys go out. Look, we're

1438
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:49,880
not playing in the classroom. We're going to go walk around with your horse.

1439
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:50,760
Brandon leaves

1440
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:52,540
Brandon

1441
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:54,300
runs away

1442
01:20:54,300 --> 01:21:01,720
in the class. You the whores all leave outside you yeah, waiting out. You see

1443
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:06,080
the leprechaun come out the back of the kitchen dress as a chef. You see Gary

1444
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:10,180
see enterprise walk around, take off to techno sign points for use or whatever

1445
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,740
it is for using invisibility. Okay,

1446
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:18,740
We have so many take off. I think it's five maybe for Yoda's mind for this round.

1447
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:19,740
Ah shit.

1448
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:22,740
This is going to be, this is going to probably matter. No, no, no, that's your refills.

1449
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:25,740
On the left side. See the left, the right side, sorry stupid.

1450
01:21:25,740 --> 01:21:26,740
Oh right, right.

1451
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:30,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, fill those in or just whatever you want to do to make it so that you know.

1452
01:21:30,740 --> 01:21:35,740
So, here's what happens.

1453
01:21:35,740 --> 01:21:39,740
You go backstage, you start to see Gary C. Enterprise come out.

1454
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:43,460
you're out with the horse. Let their laughing. You're like

1455
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,060
conga line

1456
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:54,580
and this leprechaun jumps up, goes her to her to fight the ground hog. The

1457
01:21:54,580 --> 01:22:00,780
ground hog scared. Gary C takes a picture. The light bulb explodes. Flash

1458
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,300
goes off.

1459
01:22:01,300 --> 01:22:06,020
The bad techno slime and the fear inside the ground hog. We are. Oh my

1460
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,300
God, his shadow emerges.

1461
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:17,620
from the light. Damn in retaliation, a shadow immediately beats a shit out of

1462
01:22:17,620 --> 01:22:23,600
the leprechaun. The whores run away. He scared the hose. He scared the hose.

1463
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:25,220
When my shadow comes out,

1464
01:22:25,220 --> 01:22:30,580
yo, whoa, whoa, and then I want to stay hidden. I think we should say I'm

1465
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:34,660
staying. Why do you do it? I'm invisible. Groundhog now starts to run

1466
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:39,180
and the shadow starts to follow. I'm skating damn. It was his shadow all

1467
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:44,780
along. Holy crap. I'm skating towards him. I hit my back like Power Rangers Turbo.

1468
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:52,780
Okay, now that they're running away, I'd like to trail them. I have full sneak attack guaranteed crit to shoot the shadow in the head with my sniper.

1469
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:58,380
But I'm going to skate. What are you guys going to do? Yeah, let's follow him or are you going to sniper him?

1470
01:22:58,380 --> 01:23:04,980
Sniper. I think we should follow and attack him. Yeah, I'm following. You follow the shadow and the groundhog.

1471
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:11,460
the shadow, the groundhog, some would say into a part of the matrix that

1472
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:13,500
doesn't exist. You hear Dr. Tool out around

1473
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:16,240
damn it man.

1474
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:18,480
Game stupid. Hold on

1475
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:23,440
part of the matrix that doesn't exist or the matrix. It doesn't exist. This

1476
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:26,660
is but how can that happen? It's the two guys, the two the two tick tock

1477
01:23:26,660 --> 01:23:27,020
guys.

1478
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:31,100
So I hear there's a part of the matrix that doesn't exist. But wait, how

1479
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:34,540
can it exist if it doesn't exist? Well, basically the shadow followed the

1480
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:38,260
Groundhog all the way across the parking lot at the ground hogs, a pop star

1481
01:23:38,260 --> 01:23:41,900
right yeah into a place in the matrix that doesn't exist.

1482
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:50,400
So this is like the this is like that that portal I know okay. I know what you

1483
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,500
want this to be visually, but it's from Kingdom Hearts.

1484
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:58,460
You know, Mike interviewed those people yeah, I know I read it. Oh yeah, it's a

1485
01:23:58,460 --> 01:24:00,620
good interview. He said they were really stupid

1486
01:24:02,260 --> 01:24:06,560
Dr. Tool-- oh, that's crazy that they are stupid. Dr. Tool Lateralis.

1487
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:11,360
This is that scene in Kingdom Hearts 2 where Axel meets Sora for the first

1488
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:13,860
time. I know exactly what this is supposed to look like.

1489
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:17,760
And it's-- and the reason why the glitch is happening, Dr. Tool Lateralis

1490
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,160
realizes and he tells you, "Because the shadow was created! You have to

1491
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,060
kill the shadow!"

1492
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,260
Okay. I figured we had to do a fight.

1493
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,960
Yeah. I snipe, surprise attack, snipe, sneak attack, headshot.

1494
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,860
Oh, it's an auto crit, right?

1495
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:34,060
Yeah, it's a guaranteed if I if I

1496
01:24:34,060 --> 01:24:38,760
oh, it's a three with advantage because he's a sneak with advantage.

1497
01:24:38,760 --> 01:24:42,460
He sneaked as a one. Oh, my God.

1498
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:44,860
So that's why I surprise around. It doesn't matter.

1499
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:48,460
Yeah, you miss the shadow, though, turns around and sees you guys.

1500
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,060
Rolling.

1501
01:24:50,060 --> 01:24:54,060
Just silently.

1502
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:57,360
Roll initiative 11.

1503
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,560
Wait, don't tell me that the groundhog is going to take damage

1504
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,460
when we hit the shadow.

1505
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:07,280
I said don't 18 that I won't tell you a plus one on this. Oh, my initiative is a blank

1506
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,000
You have zero then no you know

1507
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Your initiative should not be it should be plus three. I think okay. Well, it's blanks. All right. You have 16 decks, right?

1508
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:24,400
What'd you get I got 21 21 21 what'd you get I got 19

1509
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:32,260
21 can you do something for me? Okay, I'm gonna imagine my song like that with the

1510
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:35,460
ground hug. I'm gonna attack with my Grinch gun. Okay.

1511
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:40,540
Well, that's a good rule. That's an 18 because it's plus six hits for sure.

1512
01:25:40,540 --> 01:25:43,540
Okay, and that's a guarantee crit because I went before him because I

1513
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:45,580
remember that part. Uh,

1514
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:51,180
do I roll it twice or double it? Roll twice.

1515
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:54,660
Okay, do I double what's added

1516
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:56,960
Like the +3?

1517
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,920
Oh no, no, no. The +3 is just once.

1518
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,200
Okay, then it's 12 damage.

1519
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,400
Okay, nice. Okay.

1520
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,120
You shoot at the groundhog,

1521
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:04,400
the shadow of the hog,

1522
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:05,400
shadow of the groundhog.

1523
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:06,240
Shadow of the groundhog.

1524
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:07,240
And I have two attacks.

1525
01:26:07,240 --> 01:26:08,920
You do. You have an extra attack.

1526
01:26:08,920 --> 01:26:10,760
Okay, that is 14.

1527
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,200
Okay, it does not hit.

1528
01:26:12,200 --> 01:26:12,600
Okay.

1529
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,600
Oh, bloody hell.

1530
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,560
Alright, cool.

1531
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:16,760
DC 15, Balder's Gate.

1532
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,240
I am going to do the

1533
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,520
hoverboard boomerang.

1534
01:26:20,520 --> 01:26:24,840
So whatever I roll, +5, +1d8, +1 damage.

1535
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:27,420
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1536
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,260
Just said it. And that is a 19.

1537
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:31,560
That hits for sure. Yeah.

1538
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:33,840
And then the eight.

1539
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:34,940
There's a D.

1540
01:26:34,940 --> 01:26:37,360
Yeah, it's like two D fours on top of each other.

1541
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:40,100
Oh, my fucking God.

1542
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,480
One to. OK, cool.

1543
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,340
One to you throw the hoverboard boomerang

1544
01:26:46,340 --> 01:26:48,780
and knocks the shadow, the shadow, the groundhog in the head.

1545
01:26:48,780 --> 01:26:52,780
And now it is his turn.

1546
01:26:52,780 --> 01:26:54,960
Wait, can I like?

1547
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,020
No. So he has nothing to do with the groundhog at all.

1548
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:01,940
So I can't like convince him to like do like a dark evil type song,

1549
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:04,980
like JPEG, mafia, Kanye style with me.

1550
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:10,260
Maybe you've warned me down a bit. I mean, it's kind of getting late.

1551
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,860
Maybe you can, let's give it some time.

1552
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:15,540
So he's going to

1553
01:27:15,540 --> 01:27:23,260
okay. Roll you, Patrick, actually roll D20.

1554
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:26,900
Oh, what'd you get? Great one.

1555
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:32,140
Oh, you see emerge from you a perfect shadow clone of you.

1556
01:27:32,140 --> 01:27:34,460
No. Oh no. I fuck it.

1557
01:27:34,460 --> 01:27:37,100
I fuck it one time.

1558
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:44,460
And meanwhile, the shadow of the groundhog shoots a shadow beam at you,

1559
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:48,380
Blotas. And yeah, he hits.

1560
01:27:48,380 --> 01:27:51,660
Tealing. Yeah, I hit. I fucked my shadow.

1561
01:27:51,660 --> 01:27:53,660
Oh, sheesh.

1562
01:27:53,660 --> 01:27:55,660
Seven damage to you.

1563
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:58,660
And now, you're up, Ray William Johnson.

1564
01:27:58,660 --> 01:27:59,660
I gotta go pee.

1565
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:05,660
I would like to use, I think I will use my sexual grenade on this fool.

1566
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:06,660
Nice. Do it.

1567
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:09,660
Tooshteknoz.

1568
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,660
That's right.

1569
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:12,660
Alright.

1570
01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:14,660
Please, please, please, please.

1571
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:18,660
What is that, six?

1572
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:19,660
Yeah, it's not gonna hit.

1573
01:28:19,660 --> 01:28:24,300
second. 12. Not going to hit. Okay. All right. Back to the top of the order.

1574
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:24,740
You're up.

1575
01:28:24,740 --> 01:28:29,980
All right. I want to close the distance and use a melee attack. Okay.

1576
01:28:29,980 --> 01:28:35,980
That's a crit 20. Wow. Shit. All right. Roll for damage. All right.

1577
01:28:35,980 --> 01:28:37,660
That's 4,

1578
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,540
10,

1579
01:28:39,540 --> 01:28:41,500
11,

1580
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,660
12,

1581
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:48,140
14. Wow. Okay. Yeah. He's not looking good. You go in there. You just start

1582
01:28:48,140 --> 01:28:48,460
beating

1583
01:28:48,460 --> 01:28:48,960
you

1584
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,860
saying a shadow creature

1585
01:28:51,860 --> 01:28:57,600
a witness. I have another attack yeah

1586
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,540
okay. That is only a nine yeah. It does not hit

1587
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:04,080
and roll a d twenty

1588
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:07,440
six.

1589
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,900
I do when you miss

1590
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:15,420
the shadow pops up right behind you.

1591
01:29:17,220 --> 01:29:20,020
and I go like this. It's a free

1592
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,520
reaction with advantage,

1593
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:24,720
but he misses both the town.

1594
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:26,020
Cool.

1595
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:28,220
You are now up Pat.

1596
01:29:28,220 --> 01:29:28,720
Okay.

1597
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:33,820
I am going to use my lightning on who

1598
01:29:33,820 --> 01:29:35,620
ooh,

1599
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,720
give your shadow clone.

1600
01:29:36,720 --> 01:29:38,020
It doesn't have like a cone of

1601
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:41,220
no, it's like a lightning bolt.

1602
01:29:41,220 --> 01:29:41,520
It's like,

1603
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:42,420
oh, it's one bolt.

1604
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:42,820
Okay.

1605
01:29:42,820 --> 01:29:43,920
I thought that it was like

1606
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:46,120
all of my fingers spread out.

1607
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,720
into no it's not quite a lightning, not this campaign. Okay,

1608
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:54,720
what is my shadow doing? He's ready to hit you.

1609
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:59,720
Yeah, but I feel like I should if I kill the ground, the big one,

1610
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:00,920
the little one will die.

1611
01:30:00,920 --> 01:30:05,620
Speaking. Yeah. Okay, I'm gonna hit, but also I bet historically speaking

1612
01:30:05,620 --> 01:30:08,420
also that if anybody else hits your shadow, it will damage you.

1613
01:30:08,420 --> 01:30:11,120
Yeah, so I'm gonna I did that gimmick once. I don't know if I

1614
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:14,020
can get away with no. I'm gonna hit the ground. Stole it from you.

1615
01:30:14,020 --> 01:30:16,660
They did steal it from I'm hitting the ground. I was a consultant on that

1616
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:16,940
though.

1617
01:30:16,940 --> 01:30:19,460
What I'm hitting the ground on the

1618
01:30:19,460 --> 01:30:22,820
you look at these a lot

1619
01:30:22,820 --> 01:30:24,900
fucking son of a

1620
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,660
bit. Yeah, you missed. Yeah, and I roll with advantage

1621
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:32,580
say that. That was a good role. That's pretty funny. The faster you say it,

1622
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:36,260
the more likely it is to be 17. Cool. Wait, wait, no, no, no, that was a

1623
01:30:36,260 --> 01:30:38,820
two plus five. So that would be a, well, it'd be a seven. So I

1624
01:30:38,820 --> 01:30:42,340
didn't even get anything. Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Yeah. I thought you didn't

1625
01:30:42,340 --> 01:30:44,340
anything. Roll a d20.

1626
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:48,560
Why are you rolling like this?

1627
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,180
It goes off the table every time

1628
01:30:50,180 --> 01:30:51,920
you can roll a different d20.

1629
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:58,220
Then that is a 15.

1630
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:00,220
OK, cool. Yeah, nothing happens.

1631
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:01,920
You. Nope. Sorry.

1632
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:02,940
Your shadow is up.

1633
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:05,180
Fuck you, shadow.

1634
01:31:05,180 --> 01:31:07,700
Great.

1635
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,700
Yeah. Crit 20. He's going to beat the

1636
01:31:09,700 --> 01:31:10,700
shit out of you.

1637
01:31:10,700 --> 01:31:11,200
Damn it.

1638
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:16,020
This ain't right, man.

1639
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:19,340
He does 10 damage to you.

1640
01:31:19,340 --> 01:31:21,820
So it's not so bad.

1641
01:31:21,820 --> 01:31:24,340
And now he's going to try to attack you again.

1642
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:26,500
He misses.

1643
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:27,580
Misses because I did this.

1644
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:28,420
Yeah, he does this back.

1645
01:31:28,420 --> 01:31:29,420
The finger works.

1646
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:30,500
Finger work this time.

1647
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,100
And now you're up.

1648
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,580
OK, I'm going to use my sexual grenade again.

1649
01:31:34,580 --> 01:31:36,940
Please, this time, please.

1650
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:38,060
I'd really like to get a hit.

1651
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:38,980
Oh, wait, sorry. Don't.

1652
01:31:38,980 --> 01:31:39,900
Yeah, sorry. I forgot.

1653
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,240
It's a shadow hog's turn actually.

1654
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:43,600
Roll a d20 though anyway.

1655
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,820
- Wait, shadow the hog?

1656
01:31:44,820 --> 01:31:45,660
- Shadow the hedgehog. - 19.

1657
01:31:45,660 --> 01:31:47,360
- Shadow the groundhog I mean.

1658
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:48,540
- 19. - 19, okay cool.

1659
01:31:48,540 --> 01:31:49,640
Nothing happens.

1660
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:52,640
He's gonna shoot some--

1661
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:54,920
- Jizz. - Jizz at you now.

1662
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:56,700
- Okay, not a problem for me.

1663
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:57,880
I dealt with that before.

1664
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:00,100
- Okay, he does hit you.

1665
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:02,000
- Don't tell me you never had jizz on your belly.

1666
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:03,800
- He does. - I've had it in my belly button.

1667
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,440
- He does 12 damage to you.

1668
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:06,880
- You've only had it in your belly button,

1669
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,400
but not, okay, I'm at one HP.

1670
01:32:08,400 --> 01:32:11,320
You've only had it in your belly button, but never on your belly.

1671
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:12,440
You're real glass cannon this campaign.

1672
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:16,840
Yeah, it's just kind of, um, it's kind of violating cannon.

1673
01:32:16,840 --> 01:32:20,280
Yeah, I know you're just kind of a killer in the original one, but I mean, yeah,

1674
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,040
just kind of you changed it.

1675
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:25,360
And this is a red glass cannon would actually make you more balanced

1676
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:27,080
because I made you too strong.

1677
01:32:27,080 --> 01:32:29,400
Ballot. We die every fucking campaign.

1678
01:32:29,400 --> 01:32:31,400
Do not. And I should have a teleport to.

1679
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,480
Yeah, I should have a free teleport.

1680
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:34,960
I should give you free teleport.

1681
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:36,360
I'll do the missing counters more fun.

1682
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:39,160
Can I roll if there's risk to the guy who does the most damage?

1683
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,960
Because then you guys have you to have to figure out and I roll.

1684
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:43,000
Yeah, you can roll.

1685
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,640
But what are you doing? OK, it's fine.

1686
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,360
Tecto slime. Twenty one.

1687
01:32:46,360 --> 01:32:48,440
Twenty one. OK, techno slime. Twenty one.

1688
01:32:48,440 --> 01:32:49,760
Write it down.

1689
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:52,120
Sexual grenade. I need to use techno slime.

1690
01:32:52,120 --> 01:32:53,880
Roll the damage for that.

1691
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:57,320
OK, to that absolutely hits to the tens.

1692
01:32:57,320 --> 01:32:59,760
That's hard to meet in.

1693
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:06,040
Two and so seven.

1694
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:11,280
Nice. Okay. Yeah, he's not looking good. Now he's got to roll DC to see if he

1695
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:13,680
can even move next turn.

1696
01:33:13,680 --> 01:33:21,080
He cannot move. I rolled that. That's the hog's shadow. Yes. Yes. Okay, good.

1697
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:24,600
Yeah. You did the thing where you like you draw the circle perfectly. So it

1698
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:28,840
does. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, yeah. I've never I hate that shit. I

1699
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:32,800
mean, well, it is fun to do that, but not for this. It's fun to do that. But

1700
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,160
you're up by the way, Blotus.

1701
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,560
Okay, 22. Yeah, that hits.

1702
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:42,600
Yeah, we're seven.

1703
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:44,400
Describe your kill territory.

1704
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,760
Really? Oh, we're already.

1705
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:47,840
Yeah. OK, well, beat the shit out

1706
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,720
of him. You got a crit earlier.

1707
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,860
God, what's funny to do to a shadow

1708
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:53,560
guys?

1709
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:55,040
Oh, you give it bunny ears.

1710
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:56,080
I give it.

1711
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:00,280
You give it bunny ears and a bunny.

1712
01:34:00,280 --> 01:34:01,840
Yeah, that attack was not even a lead

1713
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:03,160
pipe attack. I just kind of said

1714
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:04,160
create a shadow.

1715
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,300
and I just yeah, I just went like this

1716
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:09,100
and it goes

1717
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:15,800
all right now. We have Pat's shadow to deal with you, but I don't know yeah

1718
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,500
yeah,

1719
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:21,400
you know how that works. Thank thank good. You see the ground hog on the

1720
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:23,900
ground scared likely place for him to be

1721
01:34:23,900 --> 01:34:30,400
he's a that likely place for him to be Pat and he's looking around me and Pat

1722
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:35,920
that session some memes over here and you see the leprechaun now come over he's

1723
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:40,440
beat up and he sees the ground hog and he's like are you guys done with him?

1724
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:42,100
Can I have him? No

1725
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:48,140
we're we're getting fuck you. I'm taking this ground hog to the studio. We're

1726
01:34:48,140 --> 01:34:51,860
going to put out an album that's going to make me lose even more money. I'm

1727
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:57,240
going to I'm going to throw the rest of my money on this album. I can do a

1728
01:34:57,280 --> 01:35:00,980
perception check to see if there's maybe any other threat to his existence or if

1729
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:03,560
we maybe reasonably could believe that we solved my

1730
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:07,900
habit. We solved it. You solved it okay. Well, I'm going to tell the leprechaun

1731
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:12,220
you know what you know what buddy I'm going to put you on game right now

1732
01:35:12,220 --> 01:35:17,500
just because you're a slave doesn't mean it's okay to enslave others.

1733
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:22,360
Damn, that's our first singles. What that's going to be about

1734
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:28,040
in the ground hog. It's going to be a first single. He like starts. He just

1735
01:35:28,040 --> 01:35:32,760
starts crying. He's so affected by it. So what happens if you guys don't do

1736
01:35:32,760 --> 01:35:38,540
anything is he finds the ground hogs corpse panics, gives it to the chef and

1737
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:39,900
the chef serves it for dinner.

1738
01:35:39,900 --> 01:35:45,460
I see you guys did it. Happy ground hogs day. Happy ground hogs day. We did

1739
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:49,600
it. Another amazing way to do a short scene of us eating the butter burger.

1740
01:35:49,620 --> 01:35:51,860
you guys are eating the butter burger. It has

1741
01:35:51,860 --> 01:35:55,900
butter oil, ground meat, pepper, garlic,

1742
01:35:55,900 --> 01:36:00,460
I thought we got the meek animal away from the kitchen. Why did you write

1743
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:02,740
this down? 'Cause I thought you guys were gonna be like, "What's a

1744
01:36:02,740 --> 01:36:06,340
butter burger?" We know it's a butter burger. I always wonder,

1745
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:09,980
I feel like you should publish all your notes because... They're kind of

1746
01:36:09,980 --> 01:36:12,140
crazy though. I know, but you can go back and fix them. There's definitely

1747
01:36:12,140 --> 01:36:15,100
stuff that we never touch that needs to be out there. Yeah, that's true,

1748
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:18,380
and I keep making it too bespoke, that's the problem. What's one subplot?

1749
01:36:18,380 --> 01:36:23,480
What's a sub plot that we never touched? I mean in the space one,

1750
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:27,620
like- Or no, in this one. In this one- I read, I got a, I read a

1751
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:30,540
comment from somebody. We did a whole episode about the space one. Stuff we

1752
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,700
didn't touch. I mean, in this one, in this one you saw a lot of it.

1753
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:34,680
You didn't see,

1754
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:40,680
I mean, you didn't see like Leo, you didn't see the full phone call that

1755
01:36:40,680 --> 01:36:41,900
Gary C. Enterprise has,

1756
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:45,740
where he finds out about what was going on. You also didn't see what the

1757
01:36:45,760 --> 01:36:50,320
leprechaun does in the kitchen where he starts to like he messes things up, he

1758
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:54,960
starts to fucks up, he hides the Butter Burger ingredients 'cause he panics and

1759
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:58,000
like, like that's when he's like, "Okay, I just gotta go deal with this." What

1760
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:00,960
else did you not see this one? This one you kinda saw most of the stuff. Yeah.

1761
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,160
In the space one, you didn't see,

1762
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:08,760
I mean the entire... The villain we didn't. Yeah. You never met the villain,

1763
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,800
the entire, like you guys... Who was it?

1764
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:14,360
Who was it? I told you guys who it was. It was, it was,

1765
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:16,640
- Well, it was a bastard child.

1766
01:37:16,640 --> 01:37:19,200
- It was the bastard child of--

1767
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,200
- See, I read a comment from somebody.

1768
01:37:21,200 --> 01:37:23,440
I got a notification from the Patreon thing

1769
01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:24,720
and it said somebody was like,

1770
01:37:24,720 --> 01:37:27,400
"God damn it, if they just realized

1771
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:28,860
"what the characters' names are,

1772
01:37:28,860 --> 01:37:31,240
"they would have solved this."

1773
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:33,840
- Oh, I guess I named, what did I do?

1774
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,480
- You named somebody something

1775
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:37,480
that we should have all picked up on.

1776
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:40,880
- I'd have to look, my notes for that one are in Obsidian

1777
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:42,720
and I'd have to, I'll re-download that.

1778
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:43,560
- Why are you writing in that?

1779
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:48,660
I engrave them into and you know it's a different program, but no that one I

1780
01:37:48,660 --> 01:37:48,900
had

1781
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:54,660
I had a whole thing with them, the assistant like that you guys were

1782
01:37:54,660 --> 01:37:58,580
supposed to help the British woman like who's like Belinda, who's like the

1783
01:37:58,580 --> 01:38:04,400
version of Belinda, where she is and also oh my God, the entire John Carlo

1784
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:09,300
subplot where he had multiple missions for you guys to do that would help you

1785
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:13,680
both uncover what was going on and also like you would learn more about how he

1786
01:38:13,680 --> 01:38:14,820
was like planting, like

1787
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:16,880
basically he's trying to like

1788
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:18,400
understand

1789
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:23,000
because Leo, the collector in that one, technically what the

1790
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,320
what John Carlo had on him, I think was John Carlo had it on him was that he

1791
01:38:27,320 --> 01:38:31,480
like like to play with toys and there was photographs of him and it was a

1792
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,440
whole thing. I'd have to find it, but there was a lot of plots in that. Well,

1793
01:38:34,440 --> 01:38:38,800
all of this will be revealed in the plot where we are John Commander John

1794
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,880
Shepherd style revived. Oh, can I do an epilogue for this one? The commander

1795
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:48,300
Zap Brannigan character was a vampire from Transylvania. What? Loud ass ring

1796
01:38:48,300 --> 01:38:53,280
tone. Yeah, it's my buddy Rick. Rick, he's gonna Rick call. Let me do an

1797
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:56,960
epilogue really quick for this one. So basically it's days after the time loop.

1798
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,560
I'm sitting at home, everything I'm like, for some reason days after I'm

1799
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:00,980
just

1800
01:39:00,980 --> 01:39:06,360
well, I think I can finally confirm we're not in the time loop anymore and I'm

1801
01:39:06,380 --> 01:39:09,420
and like well, that's crazy. We live suit through so many loops and there was

1802
01:39:09,420 --> 01:39:10,360
there's

1803
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:15,840
there was none of it even matt. It all got undone basically just only the

1804
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,620
perfect scenario actually occurred. Well,

1805
01:39:18,620 --> 01:39:23,620
that's just a job well done. I guess and I kind of I take off my work clothes.

1806
01:39:23,620 --> 01:39:27,600
I'm like and I go to my hamper to put my work clothes in. I open up the top of

1807
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:32,140
my hamper. I look in a thousand pairs of underwear filled with jizz from when we

1808
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:32,900
fucked each other

1809
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:33,740
- Wow.

1810
01:39:33,740 --> 01:39:35,980
(laughing)

1811
01:39:35,980 --> 01:39:39,380
- I smell the underwear.

1812
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:40,860
That's my edition.

1813
01:39:40,860 --> 01:39:41,700
- Amazing.

1814
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:42,520
- Cool.

1815
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:44,540
- And I have a number one top selling platinum album

1816
01:39:44,540 --> 01:39:45,380
with the grand code.

1817
01:39:45,380 --> 01:39:47,100
- We can explore that maybe in the next.

1818
01:39:47,100 --> 01:39:50,060
- When I get, we get revived like Mass Effect.

1819
01:39:50,060 --> 01:39:50,900
- I think we need to.

1820
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:51,720
- I think we need to.

1821
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:52,560
- We'll see.

1822
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:53,400
- 'Cause this is, I like doing this.

1823
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,740
- I miss this character so much.

1824
01:39:55,740 --> 01:39:56,580
- Yeah, I love these characters.

1825
01:39:56,580 --> 01:39:57,600
- You do it in every campaign.

1826
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,540
- I do the same character every time.

1827
01:39:59,540 --> 01:40:00,500
- It's a little, yeah.

1828
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:02,740
- No, the only one that I've ever changed up

1829
01:40:02,740 --> 01:40:03,740
is the new one.

1830
01:40:03,740 --> 01:40:04,740
Yeah.

1831
01:40:04,740 --> 01:40:05,740
That one is nice though.

1832
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:06,740
All right.

1833
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:07,740
Bye everybody.

1834
01:40:07,740 --> 01:40:08,740
Bye bye.

1835
01:40:08,740 --> 01:40:12,780
I do love mustard.

1836
01:40:12,780 --> 01:40:13,780
Me too.

1837
01:40:13,780 --> 01:40:14,780
I like spicy mustard.

1838
01:40:14,780 --> 01:40:16,260
I like different types of mustard as well.

1839
01:40:16,260 --> 01:40:17,260
I like mustard.

1840
01:40:17,260 --> 01:40:18,260
Mustard.

1841
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:19,260
Yellow, brown, pink.

1842
01:40:19,260 --> 01:40:20,260
Oh my god I love mustard.

1843
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:21,260
I fucking love mustard.

1844
01:40:21,260 --> 01:40:22,260
I fucking love mustard.

1845
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:23,260
I love mustard.

1846
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:24,260
I love mustard.

1847
01:40:24,260 --> 01:40:25,260
I love mustard.

1848
01:40:25,260 --> 01:40:26,260
I love mustard.

1849
01:40:26,260 --> 01:40:27,260
I love mustard.

1850
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:28,260
I love mustard.

1851
01:40:28,260 --> 01:40:29,260
I love mustard.

1852
01:40:29,260 --> 01:40:30,260
I love mustard.

1853
01:40:30,260 --> 01:40:31,260
I love mustard.

1854
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:32,260
I love mustard.

1855
01:40:32,260 --> 01:40:32,760
I

1856
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:38,700
so

1857
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:40,360
crazy.

1858
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:43,660
I

1859
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:49,020
different kinds of mustard. I'm imagining hearing this voice, hearing

1860
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:52,340
this voice saying you getting this at a call. I was going to say I wouldn't

1861
01:40:52,340 --> 01:40:53,440
know when you pull up to the

1862
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,280
getting

1863
01:40:55,280 --> 01:41:01,480
my scenarios. You imagine being a ketchup lover and yeah, getting that

1864
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:05,640
mustard. My my scenario is you pull up to the McDonald's. You pull up to the

1865
01:41:05,640 --> 01:41:10,140
McDonald's drive through. You say, Hey, yeah, can I get a burger and I'll get

1866
01:41:10,140 --> 01:41:13,200
some ketchup on it and you know it all gets a mustard to

1867
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,740
through the speaker on the

1868
01:41:15,740 --> 01:41:21,340
oh yeah, yeah, okay. You want a big you want a big Mac yeah, mustard and some

1869
01:41:21,340 --> 01:41:22,260
mustard mustard.

1870
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:27,300
This is the this is the cashier who's talking to you through the speaker and

1871
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,800
that's actually pretty funny. I guess I'm playing the guy in the restaurant.

1872
01:41:30,100 --> 01:41:33,200
Okay, cool you so just get ready for your big your big moment because it's

1873
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,440
coming up. Okay, but it's very funny for that to happen for

1874
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:40,980
or someone for you. Pull out, you pull up to the to the drive through and

1875
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:44,220
you're saying like yeah, I want a burger and then say, oh yeah, I bet you

1876
01:41:44,220 --> 01:41:47,740
do want a burger on and then you pull it. They're like okay, next one. Don't

1877
01:41:47,740 --> 01:41:50,960
you pull up and it's just the guy, he's just there. He's looking very cheap

1878
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,080
and you're like sorry about that.

1879
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,420
The whip

1880
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:57,960
and I forgot about this. I was trying to prank you. I forgot how this works.

1881
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:00,720
forgot about this part of it. I'm new here. I forgot you were going to see me

1882
01:42:00,720 --> 01:42:03,180
is my first day on the job. Yeah, he's like

1883
01:42:03,180 --> 01:42:13,920
he ducks down really quick and then he throws the bag in the car like a

1884
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,000
grenade. The restaurant is like

1885
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,600
and then the guy in the restaurant is like

1886
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:26,700
this is so much better than the McDonald's in the parry.

1887
01:42:26,700 --> 01:42:30,060
[LAUGHTER]

1888
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:32,640
(upbeat music)
