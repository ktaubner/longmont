00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

(explosion)

9
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,080
- So what's your McPortant news?

10
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:13,920
- McPortant news.

11
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,160
- He said McPortant news.

12
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,000
- McPortant news.

13
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,820
- I didn't say that.

14
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,660
- You did say that.

15
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,840
- Well, if I did, it wasn't on recording,

16
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,680
so it doesn't matter.

17
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,500
- The Shamrock Shake.

18
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,340
- The Shamrock Shake.

19
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:23,240
- I do have huge news right off the bat.

20
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,080
- Yeah.

21
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,280
- The lady at the post office today called me Papa.

22
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,160
- I love it when she calls me Papa.

23
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,460
Papa Papa, it was weird. Was she a young was she your grandchild? No, she obeyed

24
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,560
me like a isn't that weird? Isn't that not what you would expect? Was she like

25
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:47,060
Papa? I will know it wasn't like that. She said, are you? She just said Papa

26
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,660
was she maybe one to two feet tall? No, she was taller than that. She's taller

27
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,160
than you know than one to two. She was taller than you. Supermodel. No, she

28
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,240
through a window that they used to protect the I guess did she have a

29
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,440
picture of her grandfather taped on the window no didn't see the maybe you

30
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,840
maybe it was like her grandfather maybe it was a one-way picture a one-way

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,280
picture I guess it could be I mean I guess a one-way picture could just be a

32
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,560
picture taped to the other side of but like maybe you could see fully through

33
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,480
it it's transparent on one side right now what do you say go go go my breast

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,160
smelled like arugula why I ate a bunch of arugula okay that's got to be the

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:31,500
most interesting story I've ever heard. I had myself a chicken Italian

36
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,200
sandwich. Chicken Italian. Yeah I didn't have any lunch yet. So why did she call you

37
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,800
Papa? I don't know. That's I mean I it was pretty she yeah I don't I don't know.

38
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:46,600
Is she your baby? No. You're sure? I'm completely certain. I think. Is that your

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,480
grandbaby? No. I think you gotta go pick that young girl up. No she wasn't

40
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,220
young she's saying you're letting her work a full-time job and you're her

41
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,280
Papa if I what okay if I was her Papa which I don't think I am I'm pretty sure

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
I'm like 98% sure maybe she thought maybe she thought I would make her work

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
as your time job you would you hand over to her a package a package and could it

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,360
be mistaken for a gala no it was not it would not have been mistaken for a gift

45
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,000
because it had an address on it that I think was not her address but what if it

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,960
was and she was like oh this is my papa giving me a gift. I guess maybe she lives with my

47
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:29,720
dad now and she saw my dad's address on the package. Secret love child of your father's

48
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,360
and he did the reverse of like you know when somebody has a... Well then wouldn't she call

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,600
me... No listen she would call you "Bru". You know when somebody has a kid too young

50
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,640
and then they get raised like siblings? Yeah. You know? So he did the reverse of that. He

51
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,200
He had a kid and he's old as fuck and he said that he's her brother and that you're both

52
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
of their dad.

53
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,200
Yep.

54
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,080
That makes complete sense.

55
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,280
See, and you know what?

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,160
Let me come up with that kind of brain power.

57
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,160
I solved the white side of the Rubik's.

58
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,640
There's a buzzing bug over there.

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,640
I don't want that.

60
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
It's far away.

61
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
I solved the white side of the Rubik's Cube.

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,640
Guys, look at this.

63
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,640
I would never be distracted by that.

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Oh, it was only one side?

65
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,000
I thought, or did you solve the whole thing earlier?

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Or it was always just this side?

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,440
No, no, I got halfway through the video so I only solved this.

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,880
Well, if you hadn't said anything just now, I would have always assumed that you just solved

69
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,780
solved it all because I earlier when you showed me just the white side, I

70
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,400
assumed you solved it all because you said look and you showed where you like

71
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
that was cool. I was like that was I was actually very impressed. I got

72
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,120
quickly, but now I

73
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,320
thing is putting one side no, not the white side and not in the way that you

74
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,560
have to do it because you have to go are our prime

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,720
you and you prime you prime. So that's a you didn't even know that you for

76
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,000
R U and then R prime U prime.

77
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,840
- R U prime?

78
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,820
Are you in your prime?

79
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,040
- I'm basically in my prime mentally these days.

80
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,880
- I think you're past your prime for doing Rubik's cubes.

81
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,760
I think that's a--

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,680
- I was never Chinese.

83
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,920
(laughing)

84
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,600
I was never like a Chinese 13 year old,

85
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,240
so I haven't hit my prime yet.

86
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,080
- Dude, there's a--

87
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,900
- I don't think you're going to be.

88
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,960
- Yeah, I mean, maybe one day I could be reincarnated.

89
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,800
I believe in that.

90
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,800
- There's a, in every community college I've gone to,

91
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,280
kid with a Rubik's cube walking around solving that shit.

92
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,920
- I don't think I've ever seen anybody

93
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
with the Rubik's Cube past like middle school.

94
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,680
- There was a kid--

95
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,800
- And then if I saw somebody do it in high school,

96
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,760
I would be like, there's something wrong with that person.

97
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,300
- There was a kid at Manchester Community College,

98
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,640
his name was Justin, he would sit there

99
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,680
and solve it with one hand.

100
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,280
He had emo bangs, he was in my English class,

101
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,200
John Buzzle's English class.

102
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,280
And then there was a different kid

103
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,440
at Lakes Region Community College

104
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,160
who would sit in the cafeteria and fucking solve that shit.

105
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,000
- I mean, it's fun.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,320
I'm gonna finish the video today.

107
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,600
- They do speed, they do.

108
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,360
You can do like a speed solve though.

109
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,080
Yeah, no, I know.

110
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,480
Yeah.

111
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:41,880
Yeah.

112
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,200
Yeah.

113
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,080
It's crazy.

114
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,720
Yeah, it's-

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,800
Yeah, I've seen a lot of- I've seen- I've seen- the thing about a Rubik's cube though is that I guess

116
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm trying to get across is I've seen 12 year olds do it in 10 seconds.

117
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,840
Yeah, definitely. It's pretty-

118
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,080
And I-

119
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,560
It's-

120
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:53,720
Yeah.

121
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,640
I wouldn't say it's easy, it's just you have to learn it.

122
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,120
Yeah.

123
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,520
You know?

124
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,320
I mean, anybody could- you could teach a chimp how to solve it.

125
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,120
I don't think I could-

126
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,240
It's kind of like if I were-

127
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,720
I don't think-

128
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,440
It's like if I-

129
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,000
I could-

130
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,760
I don't think you could get through the video.

131
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
Me?

132
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Yeah.

133
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,920
I think if you gave me like six months I could do it.

134
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Six months?

135
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
It's a ten minute video.

136
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Yeah.

137
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,040
Honestly, I will give you fifty dollars if you learn how to solve a Rubik's Cube.

138
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,040
In six months?

139
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,040
Yeah.

140
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Okay.

141
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
I'll send you fifty bucks.

142
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
I just feel like it's the...

143
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,560
You sent me ten for sniffing your poop pants yesterday?

144
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,680
The poop stain on your pants?

145
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
Yep.

146
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,960
If you guys didn't hear that, go listen to the regular episode from Wednesday.

147
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,480
I want to get that stain out of those pants so bad.

148
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,980
Did you think that maybe I was gonna sniff it out?

149
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,240
- Yeah. - Sniff it clean?

150
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
- I thought that you had a shout nose.

151
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,480
- Then don't.

152
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,800
- Or tied to go nose.

153
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,380
- Yeah, no I didn't.

154
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,580
But if you can solve a Rubik's Cube,

155
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,060
and you can't, six months you could even

156
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,400
maybe reverse engineer a thing that only you can solve,

157
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,160
but I just don't think that you have it in you

158
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,480
to watch that 10 minute video.

159
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,320
- I think I could.

160
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,800
- I think that's the big barrier.

161
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,320
I think you can physically and mentally solve a Rubik's Cube,

162
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,640
think the 10 minute video is a huge barrier.

163
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,120
I think I think it's not what if I don't watch this account if I don't watch the

164
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,880
video? Yeah. Oh okay. I thought the video was a big. It's just boring. I think you're

165
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,040
not gonna make it. It doesn't seem necessarily like a fun thing to solve.

166
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,320
Well the video is boring but then when you get it when once you start doing fun

167
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:24,020
to do. R prime U R prime U prime. You're like oh shit this is kind of fun.

168
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,440
There's like a this is like a crossword. Does prime mean counterclockwise? Yes. Then why

169
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,960
Why not just say that?

170
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,960
Because how many syllables?

171
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,960
It's faster.

172
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,960
Yes, there's more syllables than counterclockwise.

173
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,460
Yeah, but it makes more sense.

174
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,640
So U and R is right and up or something?

175
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,640
CCW.

176
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
Yeah, so it's the right.

177
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,840
If you're facing it, it's this axis and the up is that one.

178
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,840
Yeah.

179
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,000
So it's R U R prime U prime.

180
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:54,880
I guess I feel like solving a Rubik's Cube is kind of like doing like a hundred jump rope

181
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,760
jumps in a row where it's maybe it's maybe interesting but I don't that's

182
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,160
going to be honestly and I respect you a lot that's gonna be maybe your all-time

183
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,880
worst analogy yeah yeah that's really thinking of something that I don't like

184
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,320
an elementary school or middle school kid might do oh that's like impressive at

185
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,520
the time and then I've I see an adult doing it I'm like okay I didn't say

186
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,640
jumping jacks that jump rose said jump rope he said jump I did not say you are

187
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:27,360
you are looking you're a doofus he said jump roping jacks

188
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,080
he said that you are you are looking at so hard that i don't remember if you

189
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,640
said jump roping jacks we already had them on this being a bad analogy we didn't have

190
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,280
to we didn't have to make up things to make it easier you said jump roping jacks

191
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,440
we already had them pinned do i jump roping jacks i guess i must have said

192
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,040
jump roping jacks. That would be a worse analogy, baby.

193
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:57,440
That's got to exist. Yeah, that's the worst. I just mean that if I saw an adult

194
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,800
doing it, I'd be like, I guess that's technically kind of cool, but I don't

195
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,240
really care. Yeah, well, I mean, if you see a kid doing jump ropes, you're like...

196
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,440
As a kid, that's cool to see a kid do 100 jump ropes. I guess that might... In

197
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,400
my elementary school, we had a thing where we would... There was one gym class

198
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,880
a year where everyone would do a jump rope challenge and they would put up

199
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,280
the high scores on the wall. So maybe that's something in my mind.

200
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,320
Did you have a juggling unit in your gym? No, but I had no. There were a bunch of kids

201
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:30,000
who went to circus camp. I wish I did. What? It's crazy. Circus camp? Yeah, where they

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,280
teach you to tightrope and juggle and stuff. Yeah, we had a juggling unit and we had to

203
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,000
watch these videos where we would juggle my second grade teacher. Actually, no, maybe

204
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,520
we did. Now that I'm thinking about it. My second grade teacher, Mr. Larravie, had a

205
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:48,520
jump roping or fucking juggling unit and we had to watch this video where it's

206
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,680
like we wouldn't juggle balls we never did that we juggled scarves like yeah

207
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:59,080
yeah you are you're bringing back a memory I'm pretty sure I also did when I

208
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,160
was in when I was like 13 14 like first year high school maybe I was just like

209
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,360
really interested in joining the circus and I was looking into the like Barnum

210
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,360
at Bailey like Clown College yeah but they closed in like 2011 or something 97 is

211
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:18,320
that what it was Steve was the last graduating class I really I was like I

212
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,360
found out about it I was like oh my god that's so fucking sick I could learn to

213
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,640
like do a unicycle I don't have to do school anymore I can start when I'm 16

214
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,440
and then yeah it was wasn't it didn't exist anymore now and then I found out

215
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,440
that if you want to be a clown now you got to go to France and you got a cry

216
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:43,480
gold gold there and there's no you know you're showing up and it did none of

217
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,320
there's not bullshit there's a squirt we're an easy way for kids to run away

218
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,800
and join the circus nowadays what I think maybe you could technically run away and

219
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,240
join the circus right now but it's definitely it's - I would go do that I

220
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,040
feel like you used to have maybe back in the day you could just go just walk into

221
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,360
the circus and you then go away with you were ugly enough but now they're all but

222
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,280
now there's you know it's there's a vent brights for the circus there's uh

223
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,840
the circus was supposed to blow in exactly and now it's like they

224
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:14,520
they have they've permanent circuses yeah you can't run away with the circus was

225
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,320
supposed you're supposed to be there should be one the hell this wasn't here

226
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,440
yesterday there should be maybe 10 circuses that are like

227
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,880
they're like government programs where they they go across the country and any

228
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,640
kid who wants to be a clown or a freak can just go into it and that's okay and

229
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,320
their parents aren't allowed to look for them

230
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,520
Yeah, exactly. You give up.

231
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,680
Yeah, and it's like a legal thing.

232
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,000
Yeah, and then like officially it's a legal thing.

233
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,560
And maybe you can still...

234
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,640
Yeah, it's completely illegal. No, it's a legal thing.

235
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:37,960
But then...

236
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,040
You have to keep up, Pat. You got to clean your ears out today.

237
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,240
You'll cross off like the...

238
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,520
I do have some gunk in my ear today.

239
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,800
You'll cross off the like missing...

240
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,560
I have a lot of gunk in here.

241
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:49,240
The missing child thing, you know, they say like assumed dead or whatever,

242
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,720
then they'll do like assumed clown, assumed...

243
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,760
Yeah, exactly.

244
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
Assumed trapeze artist, assumed mime.

245
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,200
That's the worst thing a parent can do.

246
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
And that's based on like just looking at them.

247
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,560
you know somebody with skinny kid long face big ears mime yeah right news a

248
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,080
parent could get about their missing kid is assumed human cannonball yeah yeah

249
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:11,520
well who what do you each of our right yeah what do you guys think that we

250
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,120
would be in the circus lion bearded lady you would be a bearded lady you would be

251
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,520
an easy bearded lady because you have a pretty lips and beautiful eyelashes and

252
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,320
a beard yeah if we put big fake Minnie Mouse eyelashes on you and we gave you a

253
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,920
I guess I'm thinking maybe I might be the ringleader.

254
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,400
No you can't choose ringleader.

255
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,320
Ringleaders are- I think I might be the ringleader.

256
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,080
Ringleaders are not- you can't choose them.

257
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,160
I think I might run away to join the circus and become a ringleader.

258
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,040
You'd be so shit at the circus.

259
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,480
They would probably already have a ringleader.

260
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,040
No I'm gonna run away to the circus and be like I'm your new ringleader.

261
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,400
No you'd need to do a lot of stretching.

262
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,000
The way to become the ringleader is you have to kill the old ringleader.

263
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,360
It's very easy to kill someone at the circus.

264
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Really?

265
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Probably.

266
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,560
Yeah you just- They got all sorts of stuff there.

267
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,160
literally swords and stuff yeah yeah you're in a paper that's the easiest

268
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:06,320
way to kill somebody is it cloth it's paper okay it's complete printer paper

269
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,760
yeah yeah well are the the new circus that we're developing that steals

270
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:16,440
children to give them a better life it's all paper it's hearts

271
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,360
that they can't they get no Wi-Fi the whole circus tent is a is a raster bait

272
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,560
poster what what you remember that so what a what I don't know what I'm talking

273
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,200
about we're talking about kidnapping children also the same life hacker yeah

274
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:38,080
that was a goes a or not it was a gawker really website yeah life hacker life

275
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,320
hacker yeah there cuz I remember there was one or is like here's a kataku and

276
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,040
poster it's been around of printer paper and it was a thing and the process is

277
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,600
called rasturbation and then there's also another video where it's like how to

278
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,360
turn your iPod into a taser.

279
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,560
Life hacks used to be like, here's how to make a bomb with a water bottle.

280
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Remember the one...

281
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,760
Drain on aluminum foil.

282
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:12,320
It was like how to make your guitar into a real Guitar Hero controller.

283
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,640
It was like, yeah, this is a pretty easy process and it involved soldering.

284
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,640
Once you hit the, when you were a kid, once you hit the solder or the dremel, you're like,

285
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,120
I don't know what that, I don't know how to buy that.

286
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,600
I feel, I guess it's probably well trodden ground at this point, but it's so funny that

287
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,280
so many life hacks are just like, you just like see it, like they'd be like, this is

288
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,640
the most useful thing ever, and it'd be like how to make a cup out of a milk carton, or

289
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,760
like just completely just, here's what to, here's how to keep a piece of trash in your

290
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
house.

291
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,360
We had a book when I was a kid that was like, how to build robots with everyday things, and

292
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,560
was like duct tape and like hangers and stuff to like build robots but then

293
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,880
that's just how to build the outside of it and then the inside you still had to

294
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,800
know how to make a fucking robot and it didn't give you any instruction on that

295
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,520
it was just like so first you you get a cardboard box you covered in duct tape

296
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,000
you apply the hangers so it looks like a head and then you just put a pro a robot

297
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,280
programmed robot fully in that and wheels on the bottom I had a Lego book

298
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,200
that was like that? Yeah I remember my friend had the Lego robot thing.

299
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,920
That thing was so sick. I wanted that so bad. Not the robotic stuff but like there was this

300
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,240
Lego thing where it's like it comes with like rubber bands it was like a Lego.

301
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
Yeah. It came with the the amount of pieces that you need for like

302
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,680
the first six pages of the book and then the next couple pages are like all right.

303
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,480
So we're assuming you have Legos at home so here like you need these pieces and I didn't have any

304
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
any of the pieces.

305
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,280
Dude, all these fancy Lego sets when you were a kid, don't spend a hundred bucks.

306
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,000
They're ending up stuck in my ear anyway, okay?

307
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm going to fucking miss ninth grade.

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,680
When I was a kid, I had those.

309
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,120
Did you guys know about snap circuits?

310
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
They're like...

311
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Oh, wait.

312
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
My cousin had those.

313
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,360
Yeah, they're like little snap buttons, like pieces that have pieces of circuits on them

314
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,480
and you can build little circuits and stuff.

315
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,040
It would be like, you can make a light turn on.

316
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
You can make...

317
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,400
There's one where it made this disc shoot into the air.

318
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:10,680
when you like turn the switch. That shit was so fun and I almost started a fire so many

319
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,680
times because it's that you just create a short, you just can just, there's a battery

320
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:18,520
piece and you just put two wires on it and it starts to smell really bad.

321
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,320
Yeah, I just had an easy bake oven. I was preparing for a much different life.

322
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,120
I had a, my mom bought me Shrinky Dinks once because I was watching, I was really watching

323
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
a lot of--

324
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
You don't know Shrinky Dinks?

325
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
Yeah.

326
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Dude, I didn't have--

327
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
I was watching a lot of I Love the 70s and stuff.

328
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
Shrinky Dinks?

329
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,920
They did Shrinky Dinks at my like school after school program.

330
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
They did it one time.

331
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Yeah.

332
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
You know what?

333
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:43,920
I need a special oven for Shrinky Dinks.

334
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Yeah.

335
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
I try to put them in the normal oven.

336
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,440
I try to put them in at like a hundred degrees for like an hour and they all curled up in

337
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,440
a little ball.

338
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,440
What is a Shrinky Dink?

339
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,040
It's like you draw on like a plastic sheet and then you put it in a special oven and it

340
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
shrinks.

341
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Yeah.

342
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
That's it.

343
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,460
It shrinks down to like this big.

344
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,100
It makes like a little like a charm.

345
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,100
You shrink it?

346
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
Yeah.

347
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,300
And then you can put it on a bracelet.

348
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,300
Do you dink it too?

349
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,580
No, that's just a cute word they add in to make it sound fun for kids.

350
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,580
It's a cute dinking?

351
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
Yeah.

352
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
It gets acutely dinked?

353
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,580
Yeah.

354
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:21,900
Dinking is when the curling.

355
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,220
It's a Spanish toy, so it's shrink-y dink.

356
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,220
Shrink and dink.

357
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,220
Shrink and dink.

358
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,220
Yeah.

359
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,220
Okay.

360
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,220
Huh.

361
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
Yeah.

362
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,540
and they fucking curled up in the oven.

363
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,340
I got every one of my toys from the arcade.

364
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,340
Yeah.

365
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
Pretty much.

366
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,340
Arcade toys are bustin' bustin'.

367
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,340
They really are.

368
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,340
I used them one time.

369
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,340
One of my favorite ones.

370
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,600
It teaches you to appreciate them more because you earned them.

371
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,180
One of the best arcade toys I think is when it's just a rubber little dome thing.

372
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:52,940
You turn it inside out and then you just wait and then it shoots up into the air.

373
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
Like a snapper.

374
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,140
We called them poppers down in the dirty south.

375
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,940
I called them that little thing.

376
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,300
You know what the best one was?

377
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,100
Was the fleshlight that they would give you.

378
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Yeah.

379
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,940
the one the rubber one filled with gel that was it teaches you about

380
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,200
infinity in my brain. That's a dentist toy in my brain. That's

381
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,100
I think those are probably the same thing that you put on your

382
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,200
penis. Yeah, I think I see this toy. The parachute man is a

383
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,640
dentist toy for the best, but the number one dentist toy to

384
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,380
me is the is the sticky hand, but I think that's also an

385
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,820
arcade toy. Yeah, I love the parachute. You're going to be

386
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:25,140
there. She managed a key hand. We used to go to the tower at

387
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,220
in Mount Auburn Cemetery and throw the parachute man down.

388
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,480
We used to go to the top of the Empire State Building and throw them all.

389
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,680
That's completely not true.

390
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:35,560
Yeah, I lied, guys.

391
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,560
You completely lied.

392
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,640
I just thought it would be fun to lie to you guys.

393
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,760
It really made me feel bad, actually.

394
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,760
You should feel bad.

395
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,760
Yeah, that wasn't very nice.

396
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,760
I don't think I want to lie anymore.

397
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,760
I would appreciate it if you didn't.

398
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,280
I think I'm going to stop lying.

399
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,280
Thank you.

400
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,040
Yeah, but my dad is just dead.

401
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
He died today.

402
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
He died this morning.

403
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,040
That's awesome.

404
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,040
So I need some money from both of you.

405
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,840
I mean I have a, I think I have one dollar in my wallet.

406
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Do you want that?

407
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:59,840
You only have one dollar in my wallet?

408
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,840
I lied again.

409
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,840
He was in debt.

410
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
I left my wallet at home.

411
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
You lied again?

412
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
I just left my wallet at home.

413
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,520
I was about to give you money.

414
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,740
I've never done that.

415
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,320
You actually left your wallet at home?

416
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Actually left my, look.

417
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Can I pat you down?

418
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,320
Get up.

419
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
Get up.

420
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Get up right now.

421
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Alright.

422
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,920
I'm going to start, I'm going to do a standard TSA patting, okay?

423
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,360
So I'm starting, sir, I've got to go.

424
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,320
Do a lot of rubbing so it picks up on the mic.

425
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:31,440
This is BBC News. We're interrupting our schedules for the following announcement.

426
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,280
Buckingham Palace has announced the death of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.

427
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,920
A statement from the Palace said, "The Queen died peacefully at Balmoral this afternoon.

428
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,420
The King and the Queen Consort will remain at Balmoral this evening and will return to

429
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,420
London tomorrow."

430
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:54,420
way. He's tickling. If you were at the TSA and you did that, they would shoot you. That

431
00:18:54,420 --> 00:19:03,820
is a ploy. They would shoot you on sight. No wallet. Give me your new hat. No, what? That's

432
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:18,180
scary. I'm going away. He touched my hat. I had to attack him. That's not how it works.

433
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,180
I'm going to attack you with this. Yeah, you don't have your wallet on you. Yep. I'll tell

434
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,020
you that much right now. Well, you do have a hammer. That's two episodes in a row where

435
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:30,060
we stood up. Yeah. I think we might be moving towards a new kind of standing up. A physical

436
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:33,540
standing kind of. A standing podcast. Do you guys want to stand for the rest of the episode?

437
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,540
Watch this.

438
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
What?

439
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,940
I brought my tap shoes.

440
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:41,940
We can't see.

441
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:42,940
You're standing in such a way.

442
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Yeah, I mean all I can see is your upper body and it's your just.

443
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,900
You sound exactly like a horse.

444
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:48,900
That's like crazy.

445
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,900
Yeah.

446
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,420
You have a gallop to you.

447
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Sounds just like the clopping of a horse.

448
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,540
It sounds a lot like a horse, yeah.

449
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,740
You know what sounds more like a horse?

450
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,740
I am wearing my horse shoes.

451
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,740
I learned from a movie, Coconuts.

452
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:00,740
Huh.

453
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:07,280
Huh, there's a sir. There's a movie that's that talks about that really yeah, it's a documentary the movie. Yeah

454
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,760
The documentary about coconuts. Yeah that I watched

455
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,440
Coconut I called the story of coconut. He's ever just gotten a coconut just split it open to eating it

456
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,180
No, no like a fucking like Tom Hanks. No, no, no

457
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,740
It's really hard to open one though, yeah, don't you have to like you like a buzzsaw?

458
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,800
Yeah, yeah, and you when you were like six or seven

459
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,980
And you started learning about like exotic fruit.

460
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:33,980
Mm-hmm.

461
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:35,980
That's what they usually, that's part of the curriculum.

462
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,980
Second grade.

463
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,980
That's when I started learning about exotic fruit.

464
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,460
I wanted to eat every single exotic fruit.

465
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,180
And I think I made my parents buy a pineapple.

466
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,180
Yeah.

467
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:47,180
Just not that exotic.

468
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,180
Yeah, I feel like, yeah.

469
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,180
I eat a lot of pineapple.

470
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,980
You know about pineapple instantly, I think.

471
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,660
Yeah, you know about pineapple instantly, but then like...

472
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,660
Because of Spongebob.

473
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Guava, passion fruit.

474
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,660
Fruit salad.

475
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,260
I don't know, I couldn't even tell you what those look like.

476
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Yeah, me neither, honestly.

477
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
Dragon fruit.

478
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,520
- The dragon fruit and star fruit,

479
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,840
I've been seeing in my grocery store,

480
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,020
and I'm really tempted to buy it,

481
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,120
but I'm scared that I would eat the wrong part of it

482
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,960
'cause I don't know.

483
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,780
- I eat a dragon fruit pretty easy.

484
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,940
- The thing about those kinds of fruits

485
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,980
is if they were that good,

486
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,720
they would be as popular as apples.

487
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,180
- That's true, I agree with that.

488
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,940
A dragon fruit has to be boring.

489
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,220
It probably tastes like nothing, right?

490
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,060
- Yeah.

491
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,900
- Eighth grader, it doesn't taste that great.

492
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,020
- Exactly, there can't be,

493
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,240
if it did taste good, everyone would eat it.

494
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,200
- It tastes, I mean, it tastes good.

495
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,780
- I wanna try it. - But if it tasted like--

496
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,620
- You know what we should do? - If it tasted like

497
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,860
of Fuji. You're not going to find a fruit that's like this is actually the best

498
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:33,380
fruit ever. You know what you're finding like I'm sure I guess you're like going

499
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,220
somewhere and getting one. We should buy a fucking durian. Yeah and smell it

500
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:40,340
together. Yeah wait what was the fruit that we were talking about buying when

501
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:45,100
we were on tour that was like it's like a... Oh what was it? A cotton candy?

502
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:51,220
A cotton candy grape? Or no a fuck what was it? It was some fucking like sugar fruit.

503
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:55,900
It was a tree that you could grow that made a candy. It made a candy a fruit that tastes exactly like candy.

504
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,800
exactly like candy tree or something yeah fuck what was it it was so it sounded so

505
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:07,060
delicious it was like a video of people eating it. It's not a cotton candy grape is it? No no it was

506
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:10,700
like it was it was specifically a tree it was like a melon that had a... I'm googling

507
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,660
candy tree it's that's not gonna work it was a fruit it was a fruit and we were

508
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,500
talking about buying the tree because it's so hard to find the fruit fruit

509
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:23,380
that tastes like candy but a durian I really want to try yeah yeah I thought

510
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,540
durians and jack were the same it was an ice I was an ice cream fruit yeah ice

511
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:38,540
cream bean yeah ice cream bean yeah ice cream bean ice cream bean and ice cream

512
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,820
bean I we I want to try one so there I think I found out that you can buy the

513
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:47,180
plant yeah you can buy the tree it's not a planet it's really hard to buy you can

514
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,340
buy them in New York you can buy the tree in New York no it's not hard to find the

515
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,940
beans but they're insanely expensive.

516
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,980
It would be so funny to just go into the backyard of this building and just plant it.

517
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,460
That is what we were talking about for at least a full day is buying an ice cream bean

518
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,200
tree and planting it in the backyard here.

519
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,200
That would be incredible.

520
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,820
And we get ice cream beans whenever we want.

521
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,980
The tree will go strong from water.

522
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
That's true.

523
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,980
Actually, good point.

524
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,980
Yeah.

525
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,020
And then the sunlight the next day will give it photosynthesis.

526
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,120
And then we can harvest the bean.

527
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
The ice cream bean.

528
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,420
like ice cream beans I just want to try it I want to try that I do it durian I

529
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,280
want to try I've never had a durian is very good I want to try a truffle truffle

530
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,520
I've had a truck an actual truffle not like the salt that you get at Trader

531
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:37,120
Joe's I want to travel really what does it taste like same as the salt it's just

532
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,600
like oh yeah you're on Etsy you can buy one ice cream bean for $30 let's just do

533
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,280
it I think this other website though has it for something is this maybe their

534
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:50,360
biggest fuck yeah yeah I think it's a good investment to buy one of them yeah

535
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,160
it's an and then and then split it into three we can buy I'm so we could buy a

536
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:00,960
seedling a live sea ice cream bean seedling for $13 on a one in like a

537
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,640
community garden and we should straight up just put it in the backyard here look

538
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,400
it has a pot we'll probably have to I guess probably take years man as a pot

539
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:13,360
hey you know that's exactly an investment though that's I mean like what

540
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,600
we don't know if one of us is gonna what if one of us dies in a couple I would

541
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,680
want to just it'll be so much more poignant to finally eat the bean but I

542
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,800
just want to eat the bean now don't you want to raise a tree together I would

543
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,960
honestly I think I would rather raise a child with you to three men and a baby

544
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:34,660
then I think you don't have to do anything for a tree I don't want to do

545
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:39,680
three minute I'm completely ready to be you're not ready no I would be I would

546
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,440
be the I would end up getting a mom there's nothing about me that doesn't

547
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,520
scream daddy it says ice cream bean is fast growing but like how fast is it

548
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,400
says fast growing but I want a time frame okay I'll do some research you

549
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,720
guys talk about being a father how old do you want to be when you have kids pet

550
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,320
15 you're gonna get to 15 and then have kids yeah now you get a plan on doing

551
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,320
And then are you 25?

552
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,000
Okay, so it only takes about three years.

553
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Leap year.

554
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Leap year technology.

555
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I was born on a leap year.

556
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Really?

557
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
So you're like...

558
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,320
I wasn't born in February.

559
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,760
Okay, but you were born in a leap year.

560
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,800
I was born on a leap year, yes.

561
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:29,360
Okay, so how do you get planning to get to 15 so you can finally start procreating?

562
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:34,720
Um, I guess, well, if I was born on a leap year, how old would I be now?

563
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,160
You know what?

564
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,360
Depends which leap year.

565
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,160
It's a bad day.

566
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:45,680
Speaking of procreation, we have decided that we are going to neuter Phil.

567
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,960
Oh, really?

568
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,320
Yeah, I took him to the park today.

569
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
He tried to...

570
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,240
Attempted, attempted rape.

571
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:52,960
Damn.

572
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,240
In the second degree.

573
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,920
It's crazy that dogs are...

574
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,480
Attempted.

575
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,080
To the point where I had to take him out. We went to the park to play, this guy, straight

576
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,320
insatiable, bro. Juniper, driving him crazy.

577
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Who's Juniper?

578
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
That's a dog's name.

579
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,320
Yeah, okay, good.

580
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Gray dog.

581
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Thought it might be a woman's name.

582
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,880
Gray dog, and he has a type. Let me tell you what, these gray dogs.

583
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,440
Is it a great tall, like a Weimariner?

584
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,440
No, it's a schnupper.

585
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,440
A schnupper.

586
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,440
Yeah, at least I think.

587
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,880
yeah at least i think it's still a german breed well just looks like a schnupper i don't know

588
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,720
if it is is that a real dog breed no it just looks like you look at you're like kind of

589
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,360
schnupper yeah yeah um dogs should be named what they look like because a weimeriner does not look

590
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,880
like a weimeriner yeah i use i would call most dogs dog yeah or i'd call it like it should be

591
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:48,800
they should all be dogs with different numbers of o's in there yeah without whoever they are

592
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,240
like a big dog is like dog yeah i think if you put a but that works for if you put a bunch of o's but

593
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,160
but if you do put two only two O's it is gonna be Doug.

594
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,360
- No, no, 'cause you'll pronounce it.

595
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,320
- Dog. - It'll be Doug.

596
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,460
- No. - I think even three O's

597
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,840
could be dog, but two O's is just Doug.

598
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,680
- Dag.

599
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,500
- What is that?

600
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,080
That is a little bit of a linguistic quirk

601
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:08,920
that movie Snatch.

602
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,080
- We should get Gnome on that.

603
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:10,920
- Yeah. - Movie Snatch for--

604
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,120
- We should get my gnome.

605
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,960
(laughing)

606
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,480
- My linguistic gnome.

607
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,040
We should get my little gnome on that.

608
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,240
- But an ice cream bean tree

609
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,520
does take three years to fruit.

610
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,360
- Fuck that, man.

611
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,200
(laughing)

612
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,520
That's fucking like,

613
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,520
You know when you're just like, it's just one of those moments where you're like, God just doesn't exist.

614
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,520
But imagine how fucking funny it would be if at this office without consulting anybody we plant a tree in the backyard.

615
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Yeah, like drill, we get it, we jackhammer all the fucking concrete.

616
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,520
And it's a tree that starts growing ice cream beans.

617
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
In three years.

618
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
In the middle of the backyard.

619
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Yeah, I have no idea where this came from.

620
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:51,520
They have footage of us planting it and then like, it starts like, the sapling starts to grow and shit and we're just like, yeah, I don't know.

621
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:57,160
Yeah, if anybody lives in New York and has a yard. Yeah. Yeah, please grow an ice cream

622
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:02,000
bean tree and to live there for more than three or more than three years. We will smell you

623
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,720
an ice cream bean or what? Fuck it. Even New Jersey will go as far as New Jersey. Yeah,

624
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,560
these beans and then what in three years we will come and visit you and eat the beans.

625
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:16,360
Yeah, and we might all be different heights by then. Yeah, yeah. And we will have a bean

626
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:21,640
cook off. I don't want to cook it, I just want to eat it. It's a fruit, it tastes like ice

627
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,880
cream. We'll bring other beans, it's just bean themed. No, it's only the ice cream beans.

628
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,120
The fuck, the ice cream bean is going to fucking show up any other bean. The ice cream bean

629
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,240
is the dessert and then we have a bean cook off to have beans for dinner. No, I want to

630
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,960
have a clean palate, I want to be ravenously hungry. You can clean your palate with water.

631
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,760
I don't want to eat anything else all day, I want to go straight. What do you mean a bean

632
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:51,080
cooking cook you mean a chili beans baked beans grilled beans grill Lima beans

633
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,240
just a kind of drill it I guess well ice cream bean is big but what do you so you

634
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,480
just you're boiling different kinds of beans what I got I got really different

635
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,760
flavors of there I heard that there is there's a secret Chipotle in New York

636
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,280
City that if you ask for when they ask what kind of beans you want you can say

637
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,800
ice cream beans and they'll put ice cream beans into your burrito.

638
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,280
And they also have a secret ice cream dispenser.

639
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,280
Yeah.

640
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Chipotle.

641
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
Yeah.

642
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
I've had ice cream in a row.

643
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,520
And it's over the counter and if you jump over the counter they have to let you use

644
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,520
it.

645
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,240
Hickory smoked bacon bean.

646
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,280
That's not, that has nothing to do with the bean though.

647
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,280
You're just adding bacon.

648
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,800
They're different flavors of like Bush's baked beans, right?

649
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,480
So you're just cooking Bush's baked beans?

650
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
No.

651
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,480
Cook off them.

652
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,680
the beans, you were softening them with water, and then you were cooking-- this is not hard

653
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,680
to understand.

654
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,680
I don't--

655
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,760
You were giving me the Kubrick stare, because I'm talking about--

656
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,920
That's-- you're just saying that because I'm bald.

657
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
No.

658
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,920
That's the only reason you're saying it.

659
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,920
Stanley Kubrick was not bald.

660
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,920
No, he didn't do the stare.

661
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,920
He didn't do the Kubrick stare.

662
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,920
He does this--

663
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
He's a fucking idiot.

664
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,920
What are you talking about?

665
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,160
He did the stare through the fucking lens of the-- through the viewfinder.

666
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,160
You think it's-- the stare is--

667
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,160
That's what the stare is?

668
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,920
--is opening-- is only having one eye open?

669
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:07,360
yes the stairs having one eye open and looking through a camera lens

670
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,280
the stairs doing the thing from rocket power?

671
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,680
yeah with the with the yeah framing things with the kubrick stare is making sure it's

672
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:19,520
i thought the kubrick stare was that it was um when uh jack nicholson and um

673
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,640
and uh shelly duvall were were fighting in that hotel on that on what are you on the kubrick stare

674
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,000
oh that's the kubrick kiss

675
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
they don't kiss at all though

676
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,600
yeah exactly he's a weird guy

677
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,360
that doesn't make any sense

678
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:31,600
kubrick's kiss

679
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,720
So what you said was complete nonsense.

680
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
That's Kubrick's kiss.

681
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
Kubrick's kiss.

682
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,440
Because he shows that actually life is not good.

683
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,960
Shelley Duvall, she went crazy because of that movie, right?

684
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
Because of him.

685
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,080
It was actually, I read that, so I mean I guess I don't know exactly what happened, but

686
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,200
I read that she did another interview where she was like everyone blew that out of proportion

687
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,960
and I didn't go crazy.

688
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,280
She is, if you watch a video with her, she is crazy.

689
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
Dude, the videos of her now, yeah.

690
00:30:58,280 --> 00:30:59,280
I'm just telling you what I read, Dr. Phil.

691
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,280
She is crazy.

692
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,160
like I must have gone crazy from another. She's like it's like she's like she's

693
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:09,080
doing like a like like a I think that she's like she like hello, Doctor Phil

694
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:13,920
like in the whole interview, I'm weird man. Yeah, not at all. I think she was

695
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,640
already crazy. You see the way she smoked cigarettes in that movie. Tell you

696
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,680
what she looked like a fucking rabbit

697
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:25,080
in a good way. She's hot. Yep, it's beautiful. Yeah, yeah, I'm surely do.

698
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:28,040
Yeah, she said that she did say that

699
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,800
- What up Popeyes, me Shelly Duvall.

700
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,320
- So she says Papa too.

701
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,480
- No Popeye.

702
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,880
Oh my God, what if the lady at the post office

703
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,100
was calling you Popeye?

704
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:37,940
- That would be so cool.

705
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,280
- Because of your forearms.

706
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,480
- Oh my God, I don't have Popeye forearms.

707
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,120
- You have tattoos on 'em like a sailor.

708
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,880
- Maybe, I guess.

709
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,360
I guess that could be, I should go back and ask.

710
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,080
- You were being called Popeye.

711
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,380
- I may, that'd be.

712
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,640
(laughing)

713
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,800
- The lady was saying.

714
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,400
- Speaking of women being your Popeye.

715
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:03,260
I think I also got Popeye today. A woman needed me for my strength. A woman who spoke no English.

716
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:10,260
You know those, the woman going, "Oh, Popeye!" No, she did not do that with her hands and

717
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:16,980
say that. You know the metal things that cover storefronts? A lady couldn't get hers open

718
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:20,300
today. No, the metal like, I don't even know.

719
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,940
Was it her first day at the store?

720
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,940
I have no idea.

721
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,940
How does she usually open?

722
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,940
I have no idea. It was right next to my apartment.

723
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,340
I think you started a thing by accident.

724
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,860
I just walked by and she--

725
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,860
I think you helped, I think you aided in a robbery.

726
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,620
She didn't say anything, she just went,

727
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,860
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh," and like pointed,

728
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,660
and without even saying,

729
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,140
without even asking for clarification,

730
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:39,540
I just knew what she needed and I just opened it up.

731
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,380
I think she's actually going,

732
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,620
she's going, "Oh, my hero!"

733
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,620
Yeah, and then I did pick her up,

734
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,660
and then now that I think about it,

735
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:49,700
the kind of a, the frame slowly turned into a circle

736
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,740
and kind of closed.

737
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,220
Yeah. Yeah.

738
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,580
Did you hear, "Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum,

739
00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:01,940
I did hear that now that I think about it. I think I can be a good Popeye. Yeah, I

740
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,660
think we should make I think we should make a new pop. I do some wrist curls

741
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,380
get a big get some big for you're gonna be following Robin Williams though. I

742
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,100
think by that I think he's dead true. There's nothing to say about it when you

743
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,300
die all your kid I die with the nice thing about if you're playing you know

744
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,740
how when like you play a role as an actor and somebody already played it

745
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:24,220
you're supposed to go talk to them or whatever right if that person's dead

746
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,740
it's fine it's probably the easiest role to play ever. You could also channel Robin Williams.

747
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:32,460
You could channel him. I'll change the channel if that fucking untalented hack shows up on my

748
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,940
tv show that way. I know you could tell he was sad and it hurts his performance. Yeah you know

749
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,740
what you should listen to is his episode of WTF. WTF. Markman. I mean I'm seeing I see this guy

750
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,060
doing stand-up and improv and whatever I'm like this is a this he's a you can tell he's running

751
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:52,700
into a dead end here. I remember I remember seeing it's like weapons of

752
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,780
mass destruction or something his like his HBO special Robin Williams and I was

753
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,940
like oh it's like oh this is like the guy from my childhood or whatever and

754
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,220
the first bit I see him do is him pantomiming eating pussy into his elbow

755
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,940
like he's sneezing into it and I thought that was the funniest thing I've ever

756
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:14,940
seen. Robin Williams was a beast dude. He was a beast. That was insane to me.

757
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:16,940
Honestly, just him going like *makes pig noises*

758
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:23,420
Into his elbow pit. Yeah, he sounded like a pig. It is like he was pantomiming eating pussy. It's so sad man

759
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,640
It's almost like fucking a lot of these people who we see as like clowns almost have this like

760
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:33,360
hidden darkness, sad aspect. It's a similar thing, I mean they say that um that uh

761
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,140
You know Heath Ledger

762
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:40,620
He was eventually driven to suicide by playing the clown in um in the Dark Knight

763
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,620
night and I think it was a similar scenario.

764
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,100
I heard there's a similar scenario with Robin Williams where he actually he was

765
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:53,500
driven to taking his own life because of his role as the genie.

766
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,740
Yeah, the ultimate clown.

767
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:58,300
Well I heard that it was a similar thing.

768
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,020
You know people saw Avatar and they got really upset.

769
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:05,560
And Robin Williams was like, after he finished doing that movie, he's like, I can't be blue

770
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
in real life.

771
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,060
The same thing that a lot of people watch Avatar.

772
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,280
he just was like he died I had Paris syndrome I heard he ran directly at a

773
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,300
brick wall and jumped into it headfirst and that's how he died that's awful it's

774
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,260
really horrible I heard that is he tried I heard that all lamp yeah I heard all

775
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:27,940
his hairs flew off his head when I hit the wall that's fucking awful full head

776
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:31,540
ledger was supposed to be a clown in that movie the Dark Knight what do you

777
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:37,580
think he was criminal you can be both why not both taco commercial pork and no

778
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:42,560
of those those mm-hmm that means one on both what the the thing is the opposite

779
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,800
is also true with the client with the clown people who are often the darkest

780
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,900
have the weirdest enough turning into pretty funny guys yeah and you know

781
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,320
jessleneck Anthony jessleneck on his favorite Anthony doesn't like I think is

782
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,460
one of his pro is a maybe a mass murderer yeah and then he turned into

783
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:03,500
he's doing some fucking some funny-ass shit you know so you say so what you

784
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,140
just said I was like what I you just said I heard is that sometimes the

785
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,300
darkest people are the funniest and that's the words I heard come out of

786
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:15,340
your mouth I would say that's pretty much true across the board yeah every

787
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:21,180
sense of comedy and every sense of the of the word that is true yeah yeah yeah I

788
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,580
mean I'm not yeah yeah of course I think I think

789
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:38,300
just the truth man I got real bad right now I got a bubble but and I got a patch

790
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:45,100
you down to check when they when a TSA they tell you to bend over so they can

791
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:51,140
feel your butt my biggest fear is if I do get pulled over by TSA pulled over

792
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:58,740
pulled over the side and there's you driving ass over shoot why cuz I'm in the

793
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:04,780
TSM in the line in the car driving in the airport yeah you're walking in there

794
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:09,420

795
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,700

00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:19,060
have some serious fun with a Louis CK joke pretty soon yeah yeah okay yeah

797
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:24,380
we're talking about that Cinnabon thing and he's talking about oh I Jim

798
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,780
Gaffigan has it had a Jim Gaffigan I think you're thinking of Jim Gaffigan oh

799
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:35,300
oh yeah now that'd be funny yeah Jim Gaffigan doing that joke that might be

800
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:40,940
fun yeah that would him saying that yeah that'd be pretty fucking funny in that

801
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:48,380
voice mm-hmm I I think I've had a Cinnabon or an Orange Julius or a couple

802
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,380
of things like that. It's been decades, man.

803
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,380
I want to go, dude, best Orange Julius in the world.

804
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,380
Orange Julius is fucking mad.

805
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,380
I think I've never been to a Cinnabon.

806
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,380
Really? Yeah. I'm thinking about it.

807
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,380
I don't think I ever have. They're good.

808
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,380
In my head I was thinking about

809
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,380
Auntie Anne's is the same thing,

810
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,380
but it's completely different.

811
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,380
Cinnabon is like 15,000

812
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:10,380
calories for a single Cinnabon.

813
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,380
I didn't have Auntie Anne's until we went to that

814
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,380
rest stop that one time. I think that was

815
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,380
also the first time I had Auntie Anne's, maybe.

816
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:22,580
I love the hot dog. It's too small. Yeah small and they give me a

817
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:25,260
terrible diarrhea

818
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,340
If Jim Gaffigan is listening right now also, I want to say this is our jokes we're doing right now

819
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:36,000
You can't take anything about there's W too few hot dogs at the auntie and yeah, okay. I know that you're like

820
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,180
That's the type of content you're looking for but this is our stuff so just yeah, there's gonna be his next fucking thing

821
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:50,260
You know it is dad or whatever. Yeah. Yeah, too many auntie's hot dogs

822
00:38:50,260 --> 00:39:01,500
Jim Gaffigan, how would you make me laugh again? Mm-hmm? Yeah, cuz you already made me laugh once

823
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Yeah, let's go

824
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:10,020
Do another gaff again, yeah, because those gaffs were making me laugh do another gaff again

825
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,480
Jim gaff again, and I'll be your laughing again

826
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,100
Yeah, my dad threw me to the trash again. Mm-hmm. I

827
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,240
Got cuz my dad passed and shit my dad passed and shit

828
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,240
My report card was bad this week

829
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:29,500
My dad threw me to the trash I

830
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:38,020
Didn't pass math class. Whoa. Whoa, man, you're revealing something here. Keep going be kind of a new freestyle

831
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:44,260
Yeah, I'm retired. Yep. Yep. Hit it. Come on. I was in a class called math concepts. Holy fuck

832
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,660
I think that's what it was called.

833
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:50,260
Math concepts, I think that's what it was called.

834
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,000
They taught me fractions through food.

835
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,380
They were training me to be a line kook.

836
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,940
- This doesn't, I don't know.

837
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,140
- You gotta make a rhyme, Patrick.

838
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:04,260
- We got in trouble in the computer lab the next semester

839
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,740
when they were trying to teach us spreadsheets.

840
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,580
- No, see, you should be like--

841
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,420
- Then you're doing a robot voice now.

842
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,580
- I've become the freestyle bot, the poetry bot.

843
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,420
- It's not a freestyle.

844
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,240
- It's not a freestyle at all.

845
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,980
- I'm not doing freestyles, I'm doing poetry.

846
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,040
- You switched into human again, halfway through that.

847
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:18,880
- I'm doing poetry.

848
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,920
- I'm not doing freestyles.

849
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,480
(laughing)

850
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
- We got in trouble in the computer lab.

851
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,320
- Mm-hmm, you should've said--

852
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,040
- Because we learned that Cool Math Games

853
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,440
has multiplayer games and I made my name Goatse

854
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,560
and I had to explain what Goatse was to my friend.

855
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,440
- Patrick, here's an easy one.

856
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,440
You say, "Yeah, and the next semester,

857
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,360
"the teacher was a molester."

858
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,200
Say something like that.

859
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,360
- I didn't get molested at school, though.

860
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
- But if you do--

861
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,040
- The teacher--

862
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,880
- You might say, "My teacher was a molester."

863
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,920
- Okay, but if I was doing slam poetry

864
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,520
or any kind of poetry and I did say

865
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,680
that my teacher was a molester,

866
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,520
I think that that would be pretty bad.

867
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,640
- Or you could also, here's, I mean,

868
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,480
to go back to what you want.

869
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,320
- Yeah, that's what you want.

870
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,800
- Okay, I think I would win a poetry slam if I said that.

871
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,640
- Yeah, yeah.

872
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,200
- That's how you win a poetry slam.

873
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,040
- If we could also, I wanna add something for you too.

874
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:58,880
- I wanna add something for you too.

875
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,700
- I wanna add something for you too.

876
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,540
- Telling me how to be a line kook.

877
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,380
- If we wanna go back to the Jim Gaffigan well,

878
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,200
- And the next semester.

879
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,440
- You could say, not paying attention in math class,

880
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,240
watching Jim Gaffigan while they were trying

881
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
teach me fracassions.

882
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,240
Okay.

883
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,240
Fracassions.

884
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,240
Fracassions.

885
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Yeah, so you could add that.

886
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Fracassions.

887
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Leave this to FreestyleBot.

888
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
Let FreestyleBot.

889
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
Okay.

890
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,360
I mean, you got to do a suggestion, so it's interesting that I don't, but we can leave

891
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,360
the rest to FreestyleBot.

892
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,400
Well, I was giving you more direction.

893
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
You're giving him a specific line.

894
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,400
You gave him a specific line, too.

895
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Yeah, but mine was actually good.

896
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,240
Yours didn't even rhyme.

897
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,240
Mine completely rhymed.

898
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,240
Not even a little bit.

899
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,240
You have to get in fracassion.

900
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,240
No.

901
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
My fracassion.

902
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,400
So you're using my line and not yours to kind of tell, like--

903
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
But then you could go into science.

904
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,400
Let's let Freestyle Bot figure this out.

905
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,400
Freestyle Bot.

906
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Who's Ms. Blackishen?

907
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,400
I don't know, I'm just making up stuff.

908
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,400
That's okay, you're gonna win the poetry sign.

909
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,400
I wanna win the fucking poetry sign so bad.

910
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Go ahead, try to win.

911
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
I got molested by Ms. Brackishen.

912
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,400
She tore my ass like, nope.

913
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:57,400
I think that's too soon and too far.

914
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,400
Too soon so it actually happened?

915
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,400
No.

916
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,040
recently molested by my female just lie man it's how you fucking know bad about

917
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,480
that even if I'm thinking you think all these all these rappers are actually

918
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,320
you think all these rappers are actually um selling drugs and wearing jewelry no

919
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,040
they make it up yeah you think they're actually having sex with multiple

920
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,360
women in a year ever I'm a slam poet I'm a slam poetry robot that is it's I

921
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:29,120
thought the piece tell me what the a and P stands for in an RIP in rap rhythm and

922
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:34,560
poetry. Oh my God and poetry right and what and so as long as you incorporate

923
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,000
rhythm, you're doing all the words. All the words are the same as rap right. You

924
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,000
just maybe don't have the rhythm to it. So you can talk about sliding on your

925
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,320
ops dude pulling out that stick and absolutely putting that fire on them. I

926
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:48,880
heard the C in rap stands for country. You can talk about spinning the block

927
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,880
okay, but you just got to just kind of do it. Okay, rap bot or freestyle bot

928
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:58,480
poetry poetry, but slam poetry, slam poetry, poetry, but is there a number

929
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,800
after a cool number one the first one yeah thanks that's first of many only

930
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,160
one yeah slam poetry about one so with that in mind now talk about fucking

931
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:16,680
getting completely fucking molested do it go by mrs. brackish and mrs. brackish

932
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:23,120
in mm-hmm taught me frac asians yeah that's back to that uh-huh and then my

933
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:28,720

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,880
Yeah, she was a molester. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. In what month? In the month of November.

936
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:47,760
Come on, come on. Like a turkey and then what what'd she do? She pulled on my

937
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:54,420

00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:57,360
him what happened to the back there go when the words are gonna come next I

939
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,720
don't even know him that's a poem holy shit what if it's brackish and due to the

940
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,400
backs the backseat are you the back bro what did brackish it due to the back of

941
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,920
him yeah the brackish in the got my back again

942
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:17,720
yep she busted that back open I think poetry but I think that's a good I think

943
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,560
we should figure out an algorithm for him though because he's making up stuff

944
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:25,440
about molestation that's our I mean that's a yeah that's the problem that's

945
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,720
the problem with the AI developers that really is a new thing that has a mortal

946
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:31,840
technique actually dance with the fucking devil no no it's about is hot

947
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:38,920
well see to dance with him to dance with him you're saying what happened in that

948
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:47,360
song would be too hot I mean the devil's on fire man but is that song a little hot

949
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:53,760
no it's crazy that he says all that stuff happened to his friend cuz that

950
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:57,160
started it's like it's like yeah that happened to my friend once yeah my

951
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:03,000
friend totally shit his pants in class yeah yeah it's also funny rapping for a

952
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:11,360
friend yeah did anybody else ever this happen to anyone else I'm rapping for my

953
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:16,860
friend that's the entirety of yeah immortal technique that nasty nasty song

954
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,080
mortal technique was making some of the worst music of all time yeah yeah but he

955
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:27,040
laid exposed a lot of truths about 9/11 yeah and about about being having a

956
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,400
crap day or whatever that's I had a bad day I'm taking one down oh my god

957
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,400
I think it's that song, I gotta turn it around.

958
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,400
Holy shit, dude.

959
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,720
I just thought his name was in poor taste.

960
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,640
Um, cause I mean, the only song I've ever heard by him is Dance with the Devil.

961
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,120
I don't think it's right for him to call that an immortal technique.

962
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,400
I think that's a weird, weird thing.

963
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,400
I agree.

964
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,400
Okay.

965
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,400
Okay, and we're back from the pee break.

966
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,400
The pee can make me stronger.

967
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,400
I had to pee.

968
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,400
I had to pee.

969
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,400
We're back from the pee break.

970
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,400
See, but I have a new thing I need to show everyone.

971
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,400
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

972
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,400
I bet this, okay, okay.

973
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:58,720
It's just a dance, I've seen this dance before.

974
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,720
It's not quite new.

975
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:00,720
That one's the oldest dance.

976
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,560
- That one's the oldest.

977
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,020
- I like that one a lot, but it's not new.

978
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,160
- That one's not new either, man.

979
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,140
- If you got up and you said,

980
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,120
"Let me show you your favorite thing,"

981
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:09,840
I would be happy right now, but you kind of,

982
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,940
you blue balled me here.

983
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,700
- My balls are aching.

984
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,920
(laughing)

985
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:17,080
- Oh, okay, I do like that.

986
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,880
That's new, that's a new face and stuff.

987
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,640
- Yeah, I just, I'm out, I squirtied.

988
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,360
- Yeah, speaking of squirtied, I bet that honestly,

989
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:26,260
and I've had this theory for a long time,

990
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:29,200
how old you're pissing makes you more mentally alert.

991
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,040
- It really does.

992
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:37,040
where

993
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,880
because you are counting down the clock.

994
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,200
- See, I can't even do it.

995
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,040
- Yeah, see?

996
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,860
- Yeah.

997
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:42,700
- He said, "Boo, doo, doo."

998
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,560
- Yeah, that's not, it didn't even sound like anything.

999
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,840
- Sounds like a lot of the rap on the radio nowadays, though.

1000
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,680
- That's true, you did actually--

1001
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,800
- That mumble shit.

1002
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,640
- Yeah.

1003
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,360
- Sorry, mumble crap is what I call it.

1004
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,440
- Yeah, mumble snore.

1005
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,800
- Who's that guy who does the videos?

1006
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,480
- The guy who does the videos?

1007
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,400
- Oh, um--

1008
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
- 20 different styles of rap.

1009
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,740
- Smosh, yeah.

1010
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:00,920
No, I know who you're talking about.

1011
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:01,880
- What's his name?

1012
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:02,960
- Fucking Mac Lethal.

1013
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:03,800
- Mac Lethal.

1014
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,080
- Mac Lethal, the pancake rap.

1015
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,920
- Yup.

1016
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:07,740
- That thing was sick.

1017
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,580
- The alphabet rap.

1018
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,720
- Dude, when we were at the Life World Show,

1019
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,760
I don't know if we talked about this,

1020
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,760
but you didn't go to the first one,

1021
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,600
and we were gonna be like,

1022
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,720
"Well, Caleb's not here, but we have a video from him,"

1023
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,160
and we were just gonna play a Mac Lethal video.

1024
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,560
(laughing)

1025
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,440
- It's so funny, dude,

1026
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,000
we were gonna play the alphabet one,

1027
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,660
where he does all alliterations through the alphabet,

1028
00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:32,200
and the first one was like,

1029
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,600
It's like angry aliens attacking.

1030
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,860
(laughing)

1031
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:38,300
It was all just stuff like that.

1032
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,680
- I mean, it was pretty store core.

1033
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,520
- It was so funny.

1034
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,720
- That uh--

1035
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,520
- You think he's a store core guy?

1036
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,020
- I think that, well think about it.

1037
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:47,880
Where are you getting the pancakes from?

1038
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,880
- The store.

1039
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,120
- Yeah, or the cupboard.

1040
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,440
- Well, but where do you go first?

1041
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:53,260
The store.

1042
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,100
- Yeah, where do you get the batter?

1043
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:54,920
- Right.

1044
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,760
- Probably straight to the store.

1045
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,080
- Actually, that's a huge, great point.

1046
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,880
- We grew up in a mobile core.

1047
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,280
- I think the word cupboard is one of my favorite words.

1048
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,120
- Yeah.

1049
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,680
I think it's such a funny word.

1050
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,360
I hate when people say cupboard.

1051
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:06,360
Really?

1052
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,360
I hate it.

1053
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:08,360
Why?

1054
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:09,360
Because it's fucking annoying.

1055
00:48:09,360 --> 00:48:10,360
It's a pantry.

1056
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,360
Or a cabinet.

1057
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,360
Those are the two options.

1058
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,360
I just say cupboard because I like that word.

1059
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:18,440
I would call it a cabinet normally, but I think cupboard being spelled that way and

1060
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,600
then being pronounced that way is so funny to me.

1061
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,120
But I just don't like, if somebody's like, "Oh, it's in the cupboard."

1062
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,280
I say, "Fuck you."

1063
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,640
My mom never said cup-bird, cup-bird, cupboard, or pantry.

1064
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,800
She always just said cabinet.

1065
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,800
It's all the cabinet. Get out of the cabinet.

1066
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,800
Cabinet's normal. Cupboard is funny though.

1067
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,800
That feels like calling it...

1068
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,800
Cupboard is like British.

1069
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,800
Cabinet feels like calling the pantry a bandage instead of band-aid.

1070
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,800
Bandage, I don't like that either.

1071
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Yeah, that's not right.

1072
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,800
I mean, it's not a bandage.

1073
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,800
A bandage is just a different thing.

1074
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:53,800
Yeah.

1075
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:54,800
That is just a band-aid.

1076
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,800
Unfortunately, I hate capitalism as much as the next guy.

1077
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,400
Actually, that's not true. Band-Aid is just a brand.

1078
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,840
Yeah, I know that that's not true, but I mean when you say a band-aid, like, I guess the

1079
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,580
thing to me with a band-aid, right, is if I was going to describe what a band-aid was

1080
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,440
without saying the brand name, I'd have to say like an adhesive bandage or something.

1081
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:15,280
Because a band-aid is the kind you wrap around yourself. Like, let's be real.

1082
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,280
I think it's all a band-aid.

1083
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,360
I mean, I know it's, heck, I know, I'm talking about word feelings right now.

1084
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,360
Yeah, I think you're right.

1085
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:26,720
Is it that jingle, the band-aid jingle? They say, am I, is this like a Mandela effect that

1086
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:27,720
I'm thinking of?

1087
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,320
I am stuck on band-aid cause band-aid's stuck on me.

1088
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,760
- 'Cause it is brand, I thought it was just

1089
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,040
stuck on a band-aid.

1090
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,520
- What is this, a song about being a fly?

1091
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,360
(laughing)

1092
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,360
- Come on, what's this song about being a mosquito

1093
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,800
or a fly? - Or a small hair on my arm?

1094
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,920
- Yeah, yeah, exactly, I'm a hair.

1095
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,120
I am stuck on a band-aid.

1096
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,840
- 'Cause I am a hair on a--

1097
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,480
- 'Cause I'm a hair on an arm.

1098
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:50,320
- You know who wrote that?

1099
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,720
You know who wrote that jingle?

1100
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:52,920
Barry Manilow.

1101
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:53,960
- That ain't no fuckin' truth.

1102
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:58,960
Barry Manilow wrote Band-Aid, he wrote Stay Farm.

1103
00:49:58,960 --> 00:49:59,800
- I got my fact checkers on this.

1104
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,560
- Like a good neighbor, stay farm is a--

1105
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:02,880
- I got my fact checkers on this,

1106
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,240
and if that's fake, I'm smacking the shit out of you.

1107
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,200
- And then, no, 'cause there's Barry Manilow Live,

1108
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:11,280
I think '77, Barry Manilow Live '77,

1109
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,360
I had that VHS as a kid, and I used to watch it all the time.

1110
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,440
And-- - He's right.

1111
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,800
I just fact checked him for you.

1112
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:17,640
- Really? - He's right.

1113
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,480
I believed him. - All right.

1114
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,880
- But-- - These hands will support,

1115
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,160
you'll live to see another day.

1116
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,620
he does his jingle medley in the middle of the show and it's just a

1117
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:28,720
coyote's like a bear imagine going to a fucking Barry Manilow concert he's like

1118
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:35,320
here's some other songs I wrote like a good day did he do the Empire funny I

1119
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:41,560
don't know he did not do that but he also ends it with like the McDonald's

1120
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,520
jingle he wrote he would and then there's like I don't know if he wrote

1121
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,960
but up up a bomb loving it doesn't everyone say push a t-rope that push it

1122
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:55,240
he didn't write. That's the thing that everyone says. What? But there's a

1123
00:50:55,240 --> 00:50:59,800
there I remember. That's the thing that is always like crazyfact.com always says that. I

1124
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:05,960
remember distinctly this video. You gotta stop going on crazyfact.com. The medley ends with Barry

1125
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Mandelow and his backup singers just going like McDonald's. I didn't know that McDonald's had another name.

1126
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,280
Pusha T wrote McDonald's now famous jingle in the early 2000s while trying to make it as an

1127
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:19,360
up-and-coming rapper he claimed in a recent interview but he says he didn't

1128
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,040
get paid enough for it. So I don't know. I don't know. That's true man.

1129
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:29,520
That's the Pusha T legend in three games. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dude he's the Barry Manilow.

1130
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:33,120
I mean it's one of those things where I Google McDonald's jingle Pusha T and

1131
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:36,960
every single article is did Pusha T really write the McDonald's jingle? So I

1132
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:43,560
don't know. I'm not sure. New loafers? Stop wearing loafers. No. Stop loafing man.

1133
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:49,720
I'm reinventing myself. I don't think you are. I think I'm going. I think you're not at all. Yeah, I don't think well first count

1134
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:52,880
I'm gonna I think I'm gonna start getting I think I'm gonna start taking

1135
00:51:52,880 --> 00:52:02,000
Steroids. Yeah, I think you into my ass. I think if anybody shouldn't it should be you shouldn't why cuz you will

1136
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,760
threaten

1137
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:11,440
The president again. Why this was no, I won't I'll block you will I'll block my you'll block him on social media

1138
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,440
Which is something you don't do.

1139
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,440
No, I won't do that.

1140
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,440
So at least it's safe from you.

1141
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,440
I want to have the highest levels of DHT in the world.

1142
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,440
And I want to somehow, I want to lose every single

1143
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,440
follicle on my head. I want to die.

1144
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:28,440
Really, really soon.

1145
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:30,440
There's these guys, these like lifters,

1146
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,440
and they go up to people at the gym and they say

1147
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,440
"You natty or juice?"

1148
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:36,440
And there's a guy that they walk up to and ask,

1149
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,440
and he's like "Look at me, I'm 22."

1150
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,440
I saw that video.

1151
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,440
the worst receding hairline in the world.

1152
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,440
But he was huge.

1153
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
Dude, he looked good.

1154
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,440
He was huge, man.

1155
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,440
But, dude, imagine.

1156
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,440
He looked like he was 50.

1157
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,440
Yeah.

1158
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,440
Yeah.

1159
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,440
I think I might try and go on a diet and lose some height.

1160
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,440
That's going to be tough, man.

1161
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,440
Yeah.

1162
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,320
That guy in that video looked like if Thomas took the Bain serum.

1163
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:00,240
I want to get that fucked up varicose arm vein.

1164
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,240
Yeah.

1165
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,240
Like that one that looks like...

1166
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,240
Oh, yeah, the scary one.

1167
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:04,240
Ugh.

1168
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,240
I don't like that.

1169
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,240
The really nasty one.

1170
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:07,240
I don't like that stuff.

1171
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:08,240
Not the normal bicep vein, the one that's like a fucking...

1172
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,240
I think, yeah, I don't like that.

1173
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:15,340
looks like a flat like a lasagna noodle yeah I want that so bad yeah and you see

1174
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:22,140
these shit Eagle lift ego what is that it was not that heavy but guy I'm a guy on

1175
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,300
Instagram I think his handle is like Mikey maybe me or something like that

1176
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:32,180
but he lifts like he holds a weight around his neck and he also lifts but

1177
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:36,900
he's got like chains attached to oh yeah and like game cubes and shit I didn't

1178
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:42,360
realize you were so you were so up-to-date on weightlifting if you're

1179
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,660
wearing chains while you're doing anything you should also be wearing like

1180
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:50,700
a tattered cloak I think you should be dressed like King Kong should be dressed

1181
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:55,340
like that scene in in Transformers 3 when Megatron is on the Serengeti or when

1182
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,740
he's in the Lincoln Memorial that shit's sick yeah I don't remember yeah Mikey

1183
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,700
maybe you should go rewatch that movie so you can see that scene I've ever seen

1184
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:07,380
that one. That's the best one. That's funny. Dude it's so sick. I wouldn't call this

1185
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,340
ego lifting though. He has a shirt that says ego lifting is not a crime so that's

1186
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:15,460
why. It's ego or eco? I think ego lifting is just when you lift more than you

1187
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:21,020
should. Oh okay. Yeah. This is not, this is. What are you talking about? He's lifting way

1188
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:26,700
more than he should. This is just a funny video. He's got a whole planetary system

1189
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:31,940
hanging off his head. Dude, he rocks. That's really not that much weight. Yeah, that's

1190
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:36,620
probably one pound. That's not that much weight. That's probably 135 on his shoulders for a

1191
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:46,100
squat and also is the worst deadlift I've ever seen. So this guy's an extreme snowboarder.

1192
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:54,380
He does like kickflips and shit with like weights on him. Sick. It's not that cool to

1193
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:58,380
especially now that I'm getting on DRT. Take that shirt off right now.

1194
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,380
My shirt that says skater? I just wear this to piss you off now.

1195
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,380
It's such a funny shirt. My buddy AJ who gave me this shirt, he called me

1196
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:10,380
like three years ago really drunk and he was like, he just gave me this shirt one time when I was at his house

1197
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:14,380
and he was like, can you send me a picture of that shirt? And I was like, why?

1198
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:18,380
He's like, I'm at a tattoo shop right now, I'm going to have the skater thing tattooed

1199
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,380
on my chest.

1200
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:29,340
And I was like, it was like fucking two in the morning. He like woke me up, call me. I was like, I'm bro. You shouldn't do that

1201
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,860
He's like, I'm just um guess what it looked like

1202
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:36,540
And I don't think he ended up getting it, but that would have been so

1203
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:43,260
Yeah, can you imagine this dude? That is the game is chest because it doesn't look like like

1204
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:50,500
It looks like a roller skater thing. It doesn't like I don't know. I want to know the backstory of this shirt. So yeah

1205
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:56,780
Fucking funny. It's funny. You're saying you're wearing it to piss me off, but that is just a good shirt

1206
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,580
It's a great shirt and skater. It's so good. That's a funny shirt, dude

1207
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:05,820
Yeah, I would love to have no no other tattoos and then just on a chest tattoo that says destroyer

1208
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,160
Yeah, yeah, I do kind of I kind of want to get a tummy rocker

1209
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:14,140
That says something crazy like that. I've been thinking that too. I feel like that's that's that's

1210
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,660
Tattooed

1211
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:28,620
You can't get funny knuckle tattoos. That sucks dick. That's horrible, but you can get a crazy stupid tummy rocker. That's really cool.

1212
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,620
A sick tummy rocker. No one will see it constantly.

1213
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:38,620
I either want to get 910. It's not even about people seeing it versus not seeing it. It's just that it's so stupid to get dumb knuckle tattoos. That sucks.

1214
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,620
I keep getting accosted for my tattoo. The one spider web that I had.

1215
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,620
What if I got a tummy rocker that said awesome?

1216
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,620
Awesome in old English.

1217
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:51,900
Do you that fucking this guy came up to me and I want to go on this is cartoons

1218
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,180
Have you not talked about it? No, I've never talked about on the pod. This guy came up to me

1219
00:56:55,180 --> 00:57:01,360
We were hanging out with Philip and we went to this curio shop this guy no curio shop

1220
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,740
You know like a place with curiosities. Yes. Yeah, and this guy comes up to me. He's like, bro

1221
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,220
Do you know what that means and I went no

1222
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:12,920
He was pointing to a French word on the wall. Yeah

1223
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:16,200
You know what? That means no Patrick's allowed

1224
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:21,140
He looked at me. He looked at me and was like bro. You got to get that covered up man

1225
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,780
That means that you serve 13 months in prison

1226
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,660
13 months is also you should have told

1227
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,980
Just also to you should have been to jail. Yeah, I was in there for 13 months

1228
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:34,260
Actually 13 months you fucking did you hit the median with your car?

1229
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,100
Why are you in fucking jail for 13 months? I don't know what you

1230
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:44,140
The guy who gave me the tattoo had the same tattoo.

1231
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,780
It's the most common tattoo in the world.

1232
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:47,220
A fucking spiderweb on your elbow?

1233
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,220
Everyone has that.

1234
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,220
Yeah.

1235
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:54,620
It's like, if anything, it's more kooky because I got it and I looked up, I was like, "Alright,

1236
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:55,620
you know what?

1237
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,140
I'm going to look up celebrities who have it just so I can be like, 'Well, they have

1238
00:57:59,140 --> 00:58:00,140
it.'"

1239
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,140
You know, it's like they're not in jail.

1240
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,140
I think you should just-

1241
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:03,140
And I looked that up.

1242
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:04,140
I looked it up.

1243
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,660
The one person who got one, there's two, is like James Hetfield and fucking Jonah Hill.

1244
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:13,900
And because Jonah Hill has it, I'm just like, man, fuck, I'm the biggest fucking poser in

1245
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,900
the world.

1246
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,420
If anything, I look like more of a poser.

1247
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,260
But then he started, so he followed me out of the store and was explaining to me that

1248
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:26,060
I have to get it covered up right now or I have to wear a shirt over it because someone

1249
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:30,660
who went to prison will feel disrespected and they will probably beat my ass.

1250
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:37,140
And then he saw me again and then was like, "Look, I'm sorry, but I had to tell you, man.

1251
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:39,620
I skate, you skate, you know, like...

1252
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:43,860
Why don't you just tell him that you know that and you went to jail for 13 months?

1253
00:58:43,860 --> 00:58:44,860
Yeah, that's what I was saying.

1254
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,580
I should have said, yeah, I was at Rikers Island.

1255
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:51,780
I was in jail for exactly 13 months.

1256
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:58,740
But then I was like talking to him, like I was like, talking to him, I was like, "Well,

1257
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:00,260
what if I put a spider on it?"

1258
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,860
He's like, "No, that's even worse."

1259
00:59:02,860 --> 00:59:03,860
That's 14 months.

1260
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:04,860
Yeah.

1261
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:08,420
I think if you get the spider with it, it means you're a white supremacist too or

1262
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:11,660
some shit. I don't know. It's fucking stupid. But then I was like, okay, what if

1263
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:16,020
I put a big Spider-Man face in the middle? I think the spider web tattoo that

1264
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:19,420
means you're a white supremacist is when you get a swastika on the spider web.

1265
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:22,740
I think that's usually what it is. I think that I could go to jail. Have I

1266
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:26,940
talked about this? I do seriously think I could walk into prison, the craziest,

1267
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:31,860
hardest, maximum security prison, right? Go to the hill, right? Yeah. And I could

1268
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:36,420
go in there and I could probably just be like the only white guy who hangs out

1269
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:41,820
with the black guys. I think I think I could walk into a maximum security

1270
00:59:41,820 --> 00:59:47,540
prison I could probably beat up Magneto. They send you to like a maximum

1271
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:51,880
security prison and you're trying to do that and you immediately get your ass

1272
00:59:51,880 --> 00:59:57,060
kicked because you're like check this out and you start doing the worm on the floor.

1273
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,200
(laughter)

1274
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,040
- The running man.

1275
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,540
- You get killed immediately because you like,

1276
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,380
- Every, every race joins together to kill me.

1277
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:06,500
- You smuggled in a cell phone,

1278
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,340
you're playing that,

1279
01:00:07,340 --> 01:00:09,780
♪ At night I think of you ♪

1280
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,140
And you're doing like the four inch thing.

1281
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:12,480
- I'm just making tic tocs.

1282
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,940
(laughter)

1283
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:16,900
- Every gang comes together

1284
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,500
and they finally settle their differences

1285
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,260
'cause they just wanted to kill you.

1286
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:21,100
- I think,

1287
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,220
- You solve all the gang problems by what's in your life.

1288
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,780
- I watched a couple interviews with like some guys

1289
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,500
had been in like prison for like 10 years or whatever and they just talk about

1290
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,300
they're like yeah there's no way around it you just like like you have to stick

1291
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:35,580
with your race in prison or whatever and I was just like you know what I think

1292
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,540
that I could break that mold and I think that I could I don't and I would I would

1293
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:44,580
honestly I would walk up to anybody who I just don't want to be lumped in with

1294
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:48,380
the white guys you know just cuz I'm kind of rude they're there yeah man and

1295
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:52,140
I would be like no criminals

1296
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:58,260
kingdom guys was being like um do you know what the swastika means you do

1297
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:05,940
realize that that's actually mad fucking offensive right Jewish and yeah I just

1298
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:10,260
think I could be like listen guys I just can't do it that's actually a sick tattoo

1299
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:16,100
I'm straight white chocolate I don't want anything to do with these fucking

1300
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:20,140
these these crackers let's be real that's what they are over there I want to hang

1301
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:24,300
out with you guys. I don't want to have anything to do with them. And I think that I would be

1302
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,860
able to, I think they'd be like, they'd respect my initiative, first of all. I don't think

1303
01:01:27,860 --> 01:01:32,140
anyone's ever tried that, you know? So they'd be like, well, yeah, I guess we have to take

1304
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:38,020
you because you're like, you fit all the requirements, right? I got, I just think it would work, man.

1305
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:42,180
Yeah. Well, let's find out. Yeah. I'll even listen. I'll be a human shield. I'll be a sex

1306
01:01:42,180 --> 01:01:46,780
puppet toy. I'll be fucking, I'll be, I'll, you eat me. I don't care. What if that guy

1307
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:50,760
sent to jail last night. I don't think he got arrested did he? I don't know but this

1308
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:55,400
guy came up to us and called Alex Kid and Play and then called Pierce a retard.

1311
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:10,000
And then he went into it we watched him go into a Taco Bell and he like it was

1312
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:15,720
just like it's like watching like it's like a watching Trevor from GTA 5. He was

1313
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,720

1315
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,640
Yeah, and then we're like

1316
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:31,520
Pretending we won because I was because he tried really mad. Yeah, I was really mad

1317
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:36,500
I kept saying I want him to turn into red mist. Yeah, which is a huge is lost by saying that yeah

1318
01:02:36,500 --> 01:02:43,640
He walks away, and then you're like you fall I'm gonna die

1319
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,840
Yeah, and then you followed him to see if he got arrested then you ran away when he didn't get arrested

1320
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:55,720
Well Pierce Pierce walked up to him with the cops

1321
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,480
Pierce was on the side of the street. Just looking at the guy going like

1322
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:10,680
The only way to win that is just pretend you don't speak English dude

1323
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,040
Had the biggest yellow capris on yeah, it was so funny

1324
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:22,640
Yeah, he looked like a fucking create. He looked like a GTA online created character. Yeah, he's walking around

1325
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:29,680
He like he's more Saints Row. Yeah, but he dude those pants were so fucking funny. Yeah. Yeah, can he could rock him, dude?

1326
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,600
Yeah, I'm not gonna say shit about it. No. Yeah, he pulled it off. Yeah, it pierces like he's like, oh, what's everyone laughing about?

1327
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:39,920
What's everyone laughing about? Huh? And then Pierce is like I'm talking about my landlord

1328
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:46,180
And he was like oh you can't pay rent retard. Yeah, okay, and then he ran away really fast

1329
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:51,020
Yeah, he's you're still pretending you didn't get fucking

1330
01:03:51,020 --> 01:03:54,560
He ran away run away. He walked to the

1331
01:03:54,560 --> 01:03:59,920
Ran away, he walked to the corner and then you and then you did I will say he did walk away very fast

1332
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:00,920
And it was funny

1333
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:05,600
I don't think that it was he walked away very fast because he said retard and was like oh my god

1334
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:06,360
I need to get away

1335
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:12,960
I just say that it was funny because it seemed like that because he said because Pierce was struggling to light his cigarette and then

1336
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,580
Finally did it and then he said nice one retard and then walked away

1337
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,960
Well, that was that was funny. That was his drive-by line. Yeah. Yeah

1338
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,240
I was just mad. He called Alex kid and play. Yeah

1339
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:30,600
It's not mad enough to do anything except sit there and then wait for him to try to get arrested

1340
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:35,280
And so I was it dude. What that guy had a bottle with him. He's gonna knock me in the head

1341
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:39,280
