1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,840
- There it goes.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,360
- I should tie up my head like a--

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,640
- You need the bandage that goes all the way around.

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,480
- We could go get one right now.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,920
- And you need a, the ball, this wet bean bag.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,720
- You should put him in traction.

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,160
- We need to put you in a tiny little thin bed

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,080
and we need to have a old, old lady.

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm doing it right now with this hoodie,

11
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,980
but I'm putting a little bit of pressure on the,

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,580
here right there.

13
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,400
But yeah, I'm gonna have a real fat face

14
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,240
this whole episode here.

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,280
Do a punch in, look how fat my fucking face is.

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,120
- Yeah, take it.

17
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,720
- See right here, how bloated that is?

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,240
- Now blow up your cheeks like a chipmunk.

19
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,080
- Yeah. - Oh my God,

20
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,120
you just got so fat.

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,960
Oh, you're, wow, you look--

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,000
- It seems like the swelling's gone down.

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,840
- Remember that?

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:53,880
Salt peanuts, Dizzy Gillespie?

25
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,160
Have you seen that video?

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,800
Oh, I guess you weren't in, no.

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,600
What class did we have together?

28
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,080
We didn't have any classes together.

29
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,360
- What is going on?

30
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,040
- Are you attacking him with a psychic attack?

31
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,880
- No, yeah.

32
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,700
- Psychic boarding him?

33
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,720
- Those too many questions in a row.

34
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,560
- That was scary.

35
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,400
You were like confusing yourself too.

36
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,640
- No, we never had a, we never had,

37
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,000
I took like five music classes at Emerson

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,840
because I thought that I could just fill up

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,940
my courses with electives.

40
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:21,720
- Do you think that the biotic infection

41
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,640
is, it can reach your brain?

42
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,480
- Yes.

43
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,300
- From your wisdom teeth?

44
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,500
has wisdom teeth, he has wisdom teeth infection. I was supposed to get them out.

45
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,940
They're not impacted though, right? No, they're both impacted. They're impacted. The bottom of it are

46
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,860
impacted and then the top are fine. They're impacted and infected. This one's infected. Okay. And I'm

59
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,000
like, yeah, probably get them out in the next couple days.

60
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,540
And I was like, I'm going on tour to do comedy.

61
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:39,980
And I fucking, I flexed that thing and then never went,

62
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,180
and never went back after I, we came back from tour.

63
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,020
- Oh, nice.

64
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:43,840
- You tried to flex on the dentist?

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,680
- Yes, I did.

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,760
- You know dentists make like $500,000 a year,

67
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,600
dentists doesn't give a fuck.

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,900
- Dude, I fucking, I flexed on that dentist so hard.

69
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:57,380
on tour you lost 800 bucks in three weeks and you gained 20 pounds and you were like yeah

70
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,860
it took me so long to lose all that weight.

71
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,300
I guess though a dentist might be jealous of just being on the road.

72
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,300
Yeah true.

73
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,980
They're like a dentist doesn't get to go to you know Texas.

74
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
Unless you're a Glenn Martin DDS.

75
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,380
A traveling dentist does.

76
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,100
Unless you're Glenn Martin DDS.

77
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,140
Remember that show Claymation show on Nickelodeon?

78
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,140
No.

79
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,140
A dentist will never see.

80
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,140
A traveling dentist.

81
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,420
A New York City dentist will never see Shreveport.

82
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,420
Never.

83
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
Never.

84
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,980
A New York City dentist will never see heaven.

85
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,980
That is true too.

86
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,980
I hate dentists.

87
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
Are dentists still number one?

88
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,540
That's the most British part about my body.

89
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,820
Are dentists still number one suicide rates?

90
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,820
Mm-hmm.

91
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,820
Still?

92
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,820
Yeah, because I'm going in there and I'm putting subliminal messages to my teeth.

93
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,940
They're number two right behind men.

94
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
Yeah.

95
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,340
I hate when men kill themselves.

96
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,340
I know.

97
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,300
It's disappointing is what it is.

98
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,660
men that could have been anything, could have been in the military.

99
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,620
If you let me in a room with a guy who's about to kill himself and I slap him around a little

100
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,860
bit, he's either going to kill himself anyway or I change his mind.

101
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,660
So you might as well let me in a room with a guy who's going to kill himself.

102
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,100
You got a 50/50 shot of saving.

103
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:05,580
It really is like if you're going to kill yourself you should just join the military.

104
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
Because maybe-

105
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,580
You can just do a hurt locker thing.

106
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,940
I've never seen that.

107
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,380
I saw it when I got my elbow tattoo.

108
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,860
Jeremy Renner actually hurt his locker.

109
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,900
- Yeah, so his-- - Pull up that article.

110
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,020
- No, don't pull up anything.

111
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,180
- He might have to, Jubio's been showing us this article

112
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,100
all week, every time, before we forgot.

113
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,900
- It's still here! - Oh no!

114
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,000
Does Jeremy Renner's leg need to be amputated?

115
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,780
- That would be awful, dude.

116
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,700
- Story by promypool.com.

117
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,060
- They just start shooting every movie

118
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,740
just like they shoot the Tom Cruise movies

119
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:35,580
where they try to make a post the same height.

120
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,140
- Dude, they do the exact same thing that they did

121
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,900
for the Wakanda Forever movie,

122
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,740
where they show Chadwick Boseman's picture

123
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,940
and have people drumming and stuff.

124
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,680
- It's a picture of Jeremy Renner's leg.

125
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,940
(laughing)

126
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,300
It's like Captain America, he's being like,

127
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,560
our Hawkeye lost his leg.

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,300
How do we reckon with that?

129
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,900
And it's a really emotional moment.

130
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,640
- Can you imagine, if he loses his leg,

131
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,700
can you imagine the fucking album he's gonna drop?

132
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,540
- Oh my God.

133
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,700
♪ Heaven don't have no legs ♪

134
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,140
- It's gonna be so good.

135
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,420
It's gonna be so good.

136
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,420
- Dude, that fucking video, that music video,

137
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,620
"Heaven Don't Have a Name."

138
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,420
He's an unbelievable artist.

139
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,980
He's an unbelievable artist.

140
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:20,140
Have we talked about his music on here, right?

141
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,020
I don't know.

142
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,620
Probably not.

143
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,580
Yeah, we--

144
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,860
It's no surprise.

145
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,540
Pretty good.

146
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,220
You sound just like him.

147
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,340
You do sound just like him.

148
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,220
You could be a Renner.

149
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,220
You could be at--

150
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,340
I might drop an album.

151
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:33,860
You know that?

152
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,260
You know that?

153
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,540
You should do a cover album of just Jeremy Renner songs.

154
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,420
I might write 10 to 12 songs.

155
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,500
I will write my own songs.

156
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,100
We definitely talked about his music on here.

157
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,180
We can still talk about it.

158
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,620
There's a place in Myrtle Beach called Legends.

159
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,460
- Yeah.

160
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,220
- Where you go there and they have like a

161
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,940
Michael Jackson guy and they have an Elvis guy.

162
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:50,780
- Oh my God.

163
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,600
- And you should go and you should be like

164
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,820
I could be a Jeremy Renner,

165
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,340
kind of look alike, sing alike.

166
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,380
- Well it's gonna be a problem if they amputate his leg.

167
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:57,820
I won't be a very good look alike.

168
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,660
- No it won't.

169
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,480
Have you ever seen--

170
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,320
- You'll just get in a wheelchair.

171
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,140
- Have you ever seen the fucking

172
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,020
Monty Python and the Holy Grail?

173
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,620
You think he actually lost all those limbs that night?

174
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,500
- Yeah he did.

175
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,100
- Bloody hell you're wrong.

176
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,140
- I'm completely right.

177
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,420
- You're a complete buffoon.

178
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,260
- You lot are--

179
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,080
- If you're believing.

180
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,500
That was that scene was what invented the word bloody for the British because they were like that's a muddy

181
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,720
That's bloody and brilliant. Yes, the scene is bloody. It's brilliant. Did you just say bloody brilliant?

182
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,760
Say this forever. Yeah, the

183
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,320
Celebrity I really love celebrities who do music. Yeah

184
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:37,040
Who else is good John Travolta never heard it. Oh my god that music dude. I'm

185
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,040
I've been watching it over and over.

186
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,040
You're so funny.

187
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,040
He did this music video for the movie Old Dogs where he does a cover of Every Little Step by Bobby Brown.

188
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,040
We need to do a phone recreation.

189
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
And he's singing it to his daughter.

190
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,040
It's the funniest music video I've ever seen.

191
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Is it dope?

192
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
It's so dope.

193
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,040
It starts out, it's like him talking to his daughter, Ella Blue Travolta.

194
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,240
is John. I should have I should state the song is John Travolta

195
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,800
featuring Ella Blue Travolta.

196
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,040
Yeah. Wow.

197
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,400
And but her only in and they mix in clips from old dogs.

198
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,260
Yeah. Her only featuring part, though, is at the beginning where

199
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,320
she says, like, I want to live in a world that is full of cotton

200
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,520
candy and music.

201
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,760
And then the end is at the end of the music video where he looks

202
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,000
at her and goes, I wish I was part of your world.

203
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,320
Yeah. He says, I think we should be part of each other's worlds

204
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,920
forever.

205
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,120
He's also he like, yeah,

206
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,960
- How old is his daughter?

207
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
- His daughter's like eight.

208
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,520
- Yeah.

209
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,340
- Oh, okay.

210
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,180
- In the music video?

211
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,920
- Yeah, but the whole music video is him dancing around.

212
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,480
You can clearly tell his daughter's not fully into it.

213
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,960
And he's like dancing his heart out.

214
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,760
- Dude, he's going insane.

215
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,160
- There's a whole like 30 to 45 second part

216
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,680
where instead of dancing, they're on the computer.

217
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,500
And like, you can't see what's on the computer screen,

218
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,640
but it's like a computer in,

219
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,880
it's like this like white computer in a blank white space.

220
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,240
And it's just like John Travolta,

221
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,120
like pointing to the screen and going like,

222
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,000
like nodding and smiling and his daughter's like typing on the key.

223
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,280
Yeah.

224
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,200
And that's just like part of it.

225
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:01,800
That's adorable.

226
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,720
It's incredible.

227
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
She's watching like Barney on the computer too.

228
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,800
No, she's watching old dogs, right?

229
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
I thought there was one Barney.

230
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,720
She was going to be allowed to watch old dogs?

231
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,040
Yeah.

232
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:17,240
But there's a, the, I think it's supposed to be an homage to the, to the

233
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:21,760
original Bobby Brown, Every Little Step music video, but it's him like dancing

234
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,840
in between a big thing that says Travolta.

235
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,680
and he's but he's like doing like

236
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,760
like that that's it is a little blue there's what it is a little like that

237
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,680
like he's jumping through zone media

238
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,560
every that is also i think you like any does he does a lot of like around us

239
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,700
like these type of things

240
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,760
and then you know we don't think i watch the whole thing does the same when at the

241
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,600
end they like skip away and he like is skipping and shaking his hips and put it

242
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
at hands up in the air like this

243
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,360
do you say so it's probably the best video i'm not going to be taking that's

244
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,280
- Is that the number one celebrity music video?

245
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,100
- I think that is the--

246
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:54,940
- Music video, yeah.

247
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,800
- The top five celebrity music videos.

248
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,640
- It's really, really good.

249
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,920
- I think that's probably number three.

250
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,200
- How about Blame It by Jamie Foxx?

251
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,120
- That, no, no, no, no.

252
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,520
- Katherine Hagel is in that.

253
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,680
- That's a different subclass.

254
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,720
- And she acts like a hoe even though she's Mormon.

255
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,560
She shakes her butt.

256
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,380
- That's a fire ass song.

257
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,440
- A Mormon hoe?

258
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,800
- She shakes her butt in the fucking music video.

259
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,200
- Okay, I'm gonna have to see this.

260
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,840
- And she acts like a hoe to Jamie Foxx.

261
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,680
- What the mother fuck?

262
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,840
- And he's saying blame it on the juice.

263
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,180
She's drinking juice.

264
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,020
- Yeah.

265
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,840
(laughing)

266
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,680
- She's drinking juice.

267
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,520
- Blame it on the coffee.

268
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,340
- She's a Mormon, what else is she drinking?

269
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,180
- Blame it on the soda.

270
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
- Blame it on the die, die, die, die.

271
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,840
- Blame it on the cussing.

272
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,680
- Blame it on the die and coke.

273
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,520
Blame it on the die, die, die, die.

274
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,360
- Yeah.

275
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,200
- Or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or.

276
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,880
- Yeah, they should have done a Mormon version of that song.

277
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,360
- She was in there, you know?

278
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,200
- But they should have done four Mormon.

279
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,360
man than Jamie Foxx. That's a hell of a man. Oh yeah dude. He's got a V taper. Have you

280
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,160
seen that um that video it's like Jamie Foxx somebody's like he's at a roast and

281
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:54,720
then somebody is up on the panel and they stole one of his jokes. And he

282
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,120
starts pretending to laugh and then doing the guy's conscience yeah. Yeah.

283
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,440
Yeah that's a great that's a classic video. He's a man. Jamie Foxx is unbeatable.

284
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,360
But I think that's a different subclass of celebrity music video though because

285
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,840
It's like that's genuine like talent like genuine like like a song you could play at the club

286
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:16,800
But like we're talking to every little step. We're talking we're talking

287
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,840
Rebecca Black Friday style music video exactly

288
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,320
I used to have I used to have a fantasy when I was a kid about

289
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,840
Meeting Rebecca Black and telling her that I didn't think the song was that bad and maybe we'd fall in love yeah

290
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:33,280
Yeah, she's a little Walmart. What I think she's a lesbian

291
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,240
I used to have a recurring dream where it was like all the celebrities everybody hated Rebecca Black Justin Bieber

292
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,680
I would be meeting them in a Walmart and I would tell them like hey, man

293
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,440
I actually think you're all right, and then we become like very good friends. Yeah, yeah, I

294
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,560
Had that with probably three or four different celebrities including Rebecca Rebecca Black Justin Bieber a couple other remember

295
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,880
There is Rebecca Black like it's all done by the FAO guys. Yeah, which they weren't my age

296
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,160
So that would have been a weird friendship. I think there were like 40. Redfoo and Blue. Blue. Blue.

297
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,160
Redfoo. Blue's close. Redfoo's white!

298
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,160
No he's not.

299
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:11,160
I don't know.

300
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:17,160
There was Rebecca Black Friday, but then there was also this other girl.

301
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,160
I think she's some kind of Hispanic.

302
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Great. I'm failing today on race.

303
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:27,160
Yeah. There's the other one. I don't remember her name, but it's this song "My Jeans." Do you remember that?

304
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:29,160
They're all produced by the same guy.

305
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Yeah, that's like the really little kid.

306
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Yeah.

307
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,160
Ashley Tisdale is wearing my jeans.

308
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
That was a good one, yeah.

309
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
Kiki Palmer is wearing my jeans.

310
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,160
And it's the guy who raps in the Friday video.

311
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,160
He like pops up in the window and is like...

312
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Yeah, the guy who's going down the highway.

313
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
We'd be on fire.

314
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,160
That guy, the guy who's driving the car, there's like a 20 second rap verse in Friday.

315
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
He produced all the music, all those music videos.

316
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,840
videos yeah what's his name is a pierre pierre from he's the pierre from playboy

317
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,160
cardi

318
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:12,800
I think that they had to pay him like $10,000 and the thing is those music

319
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,280
videos are pretty well produced you know I'm sorry your kid doesn't have talent

320
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,000
but that guy is not the issue

321
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,800
yeah Rebecca Black is not talented you just say that she's a lesbo that's why

322
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:34,960
saying that. Yep. You're just trying to get in her genes. I'm big in the lesbian community.

323
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:41,680
In what way? In what world? How are you big in the lesbian community? You don't know how

324
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,360
many fan letters I get from lesbians. Do you get letters from lesbians? I get letters from

325
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,680
lesbians. They all say, "I wish my girlfriend was as femme as you." That is sweet. "I wish

326
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,680
My girlfriend is a wimp like you.

327
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,680
My girlfriend is too tough.

328
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,680
My girlfriend is too fucking bush.

329
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Why can't you be like this guy?

330
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
Just look at him. Just a wimp.

331
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
Look at this fucking wimp.

332
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,680
Yeah, you are kind of like...

333
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,680
I got told a lot by my ex's

334
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
friends that I was a male lesbian.

335
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,680
That's awful dude.

336
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
That's fucking awful.

337
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,680
I don't even understand that.

338
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
I would never ever let somebody say that to me.

339
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
I'd probably hit those girls.

340
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,320
hit him. Yeah. I wouldn't. I go like this.

341
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,720
And they're lesbians so they'd fall for it.

342
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,280
And then they'd hit their head on the wall.

343
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,760
Yeah. You must be a lesbian.

344
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,440
Lesbians are the only people that works on.

345
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,720
It's very, they're very easily hypnotized.

346
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,880
Yeah. Yeah.

347
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,280
They all got hypnotized by Daria when they were kids.

348
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,360
And then Drake stole my whole swag.

349
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,200
By saying.

350
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,360
He copied my whole flow.

351
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,320
He really did.

352
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,280
Bar for bar.

353
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
He really fucking did.

354
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,020
I don't want that many lesbians these days. Yeah, I think they don't

355
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,280
Lesbians love me

356
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,560
Actually, maybe not

357
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,040
Gay guys like me gay guys love you. I'm pretty much a gay guy

Got gay guys only some time

363
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,460
Gay, I gotta say gay guys are probably the number one kind of thing that I would like to be like surrounded by oh

00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:32,040
number

365
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,180
Being like a like a d-list celeb and gay guys love you that is the list celeb

366
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,480
That is the thing cool if I ever if I ever decide to

367
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:49,120
I mean okay listen some people may construe may some people may construe this as homophobic

368
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,480
But I'd rather have a trillion dollars than be surrounded by gay guys

369
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:01,140
Hmm a trillion it's and if somebody will take those somebody takes that the wrong way not my problem

370
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,280
Okay, I want to be surrounded by a trillion gay guys like a movie scene in India where there's just like a

It's like, "Sir, we're --"

388
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
"We don't have Hennessy."

389
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,820
"We don't have Hennessy. We only do cocktails."

390
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
"Let me do Bacardi 151." That was discontinued 10 years ago.

391
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,820
Do you have any LSA?

00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,820
Yeah.

394
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:44,820
You know, I was talking to somebody about it the other day. It was Dr. McGillicuddy's.

395
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,820
Yeah.

396
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,820
I want to have some Dr. McGillicuddy's again. It's been a very long time.

397
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Yeah, dude. We've had a lot of them.

398
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,820
Yeah.

399
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
I want to have some Dr. McGillicuddy's again. It's been a very long time.

400
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
Yeah.

401
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,820
We get 10 of those now.

402
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:58,580
Yeah, you know I wanted I was talking about somebody about the other day was dr. McGirr. Yeah, dr. McGillicuddy's

403
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,560
Yeah, I want to do dr. I don't have some dr. McGillicuddy's again. It's been a very long time

404
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:08,660
Yeah, we should go to we should go to Boston. Can you not get it anywhere else? No, it's just where you should

405
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,780
It's not like Malort. You can't get Malort anywhere. You can you saw Malort? There's a bar on

406
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:20,040
There's a bar down the street and today's globalist world you can get anything anywhere

407
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:25,760
Yeah, there's a bar down the street that used to bootleg it until like three months. Okay. Yeah, literally anything

408
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,620
I go ahead try to find me a Faberge egg right now

409
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:36,580
Jubio you do that and no not on the web in physical reality. I'll go I have mine over here. Yeah, it's right there

410
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,840
That's a Cosby surprise egg. That is not a Faberge. All right fine thing

411
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:46,260
Oh, I like this one. I like this Faberge egg.

412
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,260
See, this is perfect. Giant egg in a brown egg cup mascot costume.

413
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,260
What is an egg cup? I remember seeing the fucking nerd from Jimmy Neutron

414
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:56,260
eating one in one of those movies.

415
00:17:56,260 --> 00:18:00,260
It's like a soft-boiled egg in a cup and then you dip the bread.

416
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,260
It's a British thing.

417
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,260
I don't care for that much at all.

418
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,260
Speaking of mascots, I had the...

419
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,260
What's the best baseball mascot in your opinion?

420
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,740
- Nobody can read this by the way.

421
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,740
- Well, just go close up on it.

422
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,740
- It's gotta be the Philadelphia crazy guy.

423
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,980
- The Phanatic? - He's too scary.

424
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:23,820
- I don't know.

425
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,900
I was like, I looked up every single mascot

426
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,460
and I seen something that I'm like.

427
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,100
- The Philly Phanatic has the energy of a dog

428
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,220
that tries to fuck you.

429
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,800
It gets too excited and he gets like,

430
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,860
he's not humping your leg, he tries to fuck you.

431
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,860
The Philly Fanatic had the zoomies.

432
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,860
They would be like, oh yeah.

433
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,860
They gotta lock them in the stadium until he calms down,

434
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,860
tuckers himself out.

435
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,860
I was reading because I was like, oh like

436
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,860
what teams don't have

437
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,860
mascots and it's just the Dodgers and the Yankees

438
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,860
which I think that's disgraceful.

439
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,860
I'm gonna be the Yankees mascot.

440
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,860
Dodgers have a mascot. No they don't.

441
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,860
Me. Oh, okay. I'm being the Yankees

442
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,860
mascot and my mascot name is Cameron Jr.

443
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
The Yankees had a mascot

444
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
in 70 something

445
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,260
something called Dandy and they had to,

446
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,460
George Steinbrenner did not let,

447
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,780
I guess the Dodgers have a mascot, okay.

448
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:13,620
But the Yankees still don't have one.

449
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,740
- It looks exactly like Juvio.

450
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,580
- Yeah, I know.

451
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,140
(laughing)

452
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,300
- That is exactly what Juvio looks like.

453
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,180
- But the Yankees mascot,

454
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,000
the Yankees had this mascot named Dandy

455
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,740
and George Steinbrenner kept it in like the top row

456
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,900
of like the stadium or some shit,

457
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,580
like he kept it in like a box,

458
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,080
in box seats because he thought that somebody would go and beat the shit out of him.

459
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,080
You deserve it.

460
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,280
Dude, yeah, if you've seen this thing, Dandy, I would beat the, I would shoot that thing

461
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,280
with a shotgun.

462
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,280
Oh, Yankee Doodle Dandy, yeah.

463
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,540
I would shoot Dandy with a shotgun for sure.

464
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,540
That thing is scary.

465
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,300
You see Dandy come at you, you see Wally the green monster walking towards you, he looks

466
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,300
like Elmo.

467
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,300
He looks like green Elmo.

468
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,220
Why'd you search, you're just searching Yankee Doodle Dandy.

469
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,120
You're not looking up the mascot.

470
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,380
That's not gonna get you the mascot, buddy.

471
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,380
That's a movie.

472
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:02,380
Got at all.

473
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,540
James Cagney man that guy's funny.

474
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:06,140
Yeah.

475
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,740
Fuck me he's talented.

476
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,300
Oh but the the Astros

477
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,300
have an alien.

478
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,500
That's cool. That makes sense.

479
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,260
Yeah that is fucking cool.

480
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,540
Astros have the coolest everything

481
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:15,780
pretty much.

482
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,380
Yeah.

483
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:16,660
Yeah.

484
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
Dude those old Astros jerseys from

485
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,300
like the 70s those are fire.

486
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,440
Guy on the team named Bill Doran I

487
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,180

488
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,720

489
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,720

I want you to trow ass.

491
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,980
Yeah.

492
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,980
Trow that ass on me.

493
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,060
You know what team has a really cool logo?

494
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,180
Is the Fetter City Gangstas.

495
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,580
What's their logo?

496
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,580
It's just an F.

497
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,580
Speaking of gangstas, last night, okay, I forgot about this.

498
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:51,620
Last night, me and Cameron went to a barcade and they had a game that is the most fun arcade

499
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:52,620
game I've ever played in my life.

500
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,620
The best game I've ever played in my life.

501
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,620
I've never played a more fun arcade game.

502
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,620
What game is it?

503
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,260
It was called Namco Quick 'n Crash.

504
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,260
Or Quick 'n Shoot.

505
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Quick Drive.

506
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,500
- No, it was Quick and Crash.

507
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,500
- Oh, the one, I know this.

508
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,340
- Namco Quick and Crash, that's what it was called.

509
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,100
- I know this is Barcade.

510
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,980
- Yeah, Namco Quick and Crash.

511
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,380
- Oh, this isn't the one I played.

512
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,100
- No, maybe it wasn't Crash.

513
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,380
- Yeah. - Oh, it was.

514
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,860
Yeah, yeah, that was it, no, not that.

515
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,540
- It's Nicktoons Nitro Racing.

516
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,380
- Yeah, that one.

517
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:18,620
So it's a shooting game.

518
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,780
No, we wanna see the actual one.

519
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,340
- It's that one right there.

520
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,660
- It's the one...

521
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,740
- It is a target shooting game.

522
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,580
- Yeah, I've played this.

523
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,500
- Where you quick draw.

524
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,700
Dude, we could not believe how fun it was.

525
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,540
- We spent so much money on this game.

526
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,060
- It was the most fun game I've ever played in my life.

527
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,700
- Caleb had it, so it scores you out of 100, right?

528
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,380
Like it says you're in the top whatever out of 100.

529
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,300
And Caleb had an insane round, and he got eight out of 100.

530
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,140
- I did.

531
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,580
- And I was like-- - Eight, eight.

532
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,700
- I had a really good round.

533
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,980
- And I was like, and this is what I was,

534
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:53,020
'cause I had one round right before that

535
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,220
that was really good, but I choked on the last part of it.

536
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,660
- You're a sharpshooter.

537
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:01,140
and I and I was like I know I can do better I can't I was saying I can't

538
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:01,980
leave this

539
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:05,540
barcade this hella fun barcade until

540
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,300
I get top 10 and Akil was like he just wants to beat my score

541
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,780
and I was like no I just wanna get top 10 I know I there's no way I can beat

542
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,900
top 8 but I'm gonna get top 10 Akil was like

543
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:19,020
you're gonna get you're gonna get 9 no way that you have a mental block

544
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,660
you're acting strange

545
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,380
oh wait wait wait and then I got exactly I got 9

546
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,020
I got top 10 but I didn't beat a score I predicted what I did exactly

547
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:30,860
one because you did what you were trying to do when you objectively lost.

548
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,660
So wait, you mean eight out of a list of 100, right? Not eight targets out of 100?

549
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,540
No, no, no.

550
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,940
In my head, I thought that you guys were saying...

551
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,660
No, that's what I said.

552
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,940
I thought you were saying Caleb had a good round. He shot eight out of 100.

553
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,420
No, I got every last one. By the way, you would stink at this game.

554
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,380
Yeah, no, I'm terrible at it.

555
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,660
No, no, you would lose the first one and then you would start doing 20 something.

556
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,620
I objectively lost, but I had incredible knowledge of my skill and Caleb didn't believe me.

557
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:59,200
I had a I had a decent round where I did my hat sideways, and I held the gun sideways

558
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,660
It wasn't decent it was pretty bad, and no I had a bad one where I shot behind my back

559
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:06,060
You also had a bad one where you shot sideways well

560
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:10,460
You didn't shoot side with a single time so your thug card you said nobody else could do it

561
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:16,700
Hand your thug card over, hand it over. Hold on. I'm waiting. I'm getting it Jesus fucking Christ. Please hand it over

562
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:21,620
I'm getting it hand that hand that that's gonna be early card. I bet

563
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:24,460
No, well what other card do I have?

564
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,900
I'm gonna do looks like I thought you had more cards in there. Okay here hold on wait

565
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,540
California driver's license

567
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:38,200

Well wait to ten you don't strike me as 210. What's this one? This is class of 2015 London Derry Middle School

569
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,820
Patrick Doran you look like you were a cute little kid. I'd pinch your cheeks

570
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,860
Mm-hmm. I would have pinched your peep the peep the Boston Boston Red Sox

571
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:03,420
Zip up hoodie and the Star Wars shirt. Well. I was a fucking baller. Did you chew on the edges of this?

572
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,160
No, you did I didn't chew on the I gave it took a bite out of your chapstick last night

573
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm not talking monster. You're an animal man. My photos like going so it's like almost gone

574
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:19,540
Oh, no, your middle school photos almost gone. They're gonna stop letting you into the middle school pretty soon. I

575
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:23,200
I already told you guys this, but yesterday I went to- I can't stop thinking about this.

576
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,300
Yesterday I got my blood drawn at the doctor, and they had the thing in me, and they were

577
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:32,460
pulling my blood out with the cable, and in the middle of it, the guy-

578
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,820
I wish my head had my thing in you.

579
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:38,340
The guy- and I was looking away, because I was like, I don't want to see the blood coming

580
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,940
out of me, because I don't like it.

581
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,300
And I was looking away, and I just heard the guy go, "Uh oh!"

582
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,660
And then he said- and I said, "What's wrong?

583
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
What?"

584
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,860
and he was like, "You're drying up.

585
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,360
"You don't have enough blood."

586
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,360
- That's crazy.

587
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,620
- And then he, there was like four vials.

588
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,120
- How much did they take, really?

589
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,320
- Well, it was like, they probably was like,

590
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,760
probably like eight vials or something.

591
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,600
- That's a lot.

592
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,240
- It was a ton, it was too much.

593
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,760
- Did you feel tired afterward and woozy?

594
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,840
- Yeah, I felt pretty dizzy.

595
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,200
And I was also saying to you, I really was hoping,

596
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,280
well yeah, so when he finished,

597
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:14,160
it started going really slow and hurting more,

598
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,840
and like each vial was only getting

599
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,960
like two drops of blood in it.

600
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,620
- Yeah, then like here at the end I was like,

601
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,880
is this like, am I all set?

602
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,040
Like what you said, I was like, I had no blood left,

603
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,140
am I okay, do I, do you need to do anything else

604
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,980
or do I just leave?

605
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,320
And he was like, nope, you just leave.

606
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,880
And I wanted so badly to stand up

607
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,640
and just faint onto the ground.

608
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,920
And then be able to come to him and be like,

609
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,880
look what you did to me.

610
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,720
- Yeah.

611
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,540
- Look what you've done.

612
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,380
- What have you done?

613
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,220
- You must have real chunks of blood.

614
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,460
- Fainting instantly and just being like stuck

615
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,300
on the ground.

616
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,000
- Yeah, he'd be like, look, look what you did.

617
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,840
- Why did you do that?

618
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,660
- Why did you do this to me?

619
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,120
- Why did you take my blood?

620
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,120
It really hurt!

621
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,120
I want my blood back!

622
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,120
Put my blood back in me right now!

623
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,120
It's scary dude.

624
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,120
But anyway, I got my blood test results and there were some exclamation points that said abnormal.

625
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,120
What's your blood type?

626
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Oh you got your results already?

627
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Yeah but just the chart or whatever

628
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,120
so it doesn't explain what anything is

629
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
it just says "this is abnormal"

630
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,120
and I don't want to google it.

631
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,120
What's your blood type?

632
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,120
I can read it.

633
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,120
I know mine. Actually I have my donor card.

634
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:21,120
I got a donor card. I just forget which one I am. I'm going to show this card on camera.

635
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:26,120
Okay, here we go. No, actually don't show it because then somebody could get my information.

636
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,120
Okay? If you take your wallet out, I'm allowed to show your card. Here, you can show it.

637
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,120
Caleb, get the cards in your fucking wallet. Holy shit. That's my dad's cards. You know

638
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,120
what we need to get, man? We need to get some Ridge wallets. We should share a wallet. We

639
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,920
We should have Ridge Wallet sponsor us, give us $60,000 a day.

640
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,800
Oh, I'm A+.

641
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,300
You're A+.

642
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,600
I got an A on my blood test.

643
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,840
What's this one?

644
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,440
A+.

645
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,360
Donor ID.

646
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
And then it went through the wash, so it has--

647
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,700
all of my dates are gone.

648
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,520
It's right next to Steven Vega, the pit bull.

649
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,720
Pit bull impersonator.

650
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,200
Yeah.

651
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,520
I'm glad you keep that in your wallet.

652
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,600
That's very sweet of you.

653
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,880
I think one day we'll need him.

654
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,800
Yeah.

655
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,160
What's going on in the world, man?

656
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,760
I feel like-- is there--

657
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,240
Is it just me or has there been like two weeks

658
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,060
where there's no news?

659
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,920
- Yeah, they're getting ready for something.

660
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,760
- What's the news?

661
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,580
- What's the news that there's been?

662
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,860
- There's some shit going on in Congress.

663
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,640
Matt Gaetz is, yeah, no, don't give a fuck.

664
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,480
- Renner.

665
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,660
- I mean cool shit like, brah, brah, brah, brah, brah, brah.

666
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,260
- Yeah, I think that will happen soon.

667
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,500
- Tatiana Patits.

668
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,340
- Patits?

669
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,740
- Come on, that's a crazy name.

670
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,180
- Supermodel of the '80s and '90s dies at 56.

671
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,020
- Wait, that's her?

672
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:31,860
I recognize that bitch.

673
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,260
- Oh yeah, she's from the Freedom 90 video.

674
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:35,200
- I don't know what that is.

675
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,200
George Michael?

676
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Nah, no.

677
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,200
Freedom!

678
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
I'll say this.

679
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
I won't let you down, freedom!

680
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,160
I'm not usually one to enjoy the looks of supermodels, but that's a pretty decent looking

681
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
woman.

682
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
Yeah, I prefer girls next door.

683
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
Yeah.

684
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,720
Yeah, I just don't really like that Hollywood kind of thing.

685
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,800
I like kind of like milfy...

686
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,800
Yeah.

687
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Yeah.

688
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,720
I'm imagining kind of the paradox where my brain explodes because I live next door to

689
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Megan Fox.

690
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
And I'm like...

691
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
That would be crazy.

692
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,240
airbrushed and you're completely beauty standards,

693
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,600
but you're literally a girl next door.

694
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,660
So what do I do?

695
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,500
- We need a girl next door.

696
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,840
- Do I fuck you or not?

697
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,480
(laughing)

698
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,360
- Do I fuck you or do I?

699
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,620
- I'm knocking on our door, what do I do?

700
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,960
- Do I have sex with you now?

701
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,080
- Are you too supermodely or are you a girl next door?

702
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,600
- I really can't tell.

703
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,880
So should I just fuck you now?

704
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,560
- You're gonna love this movie.

705
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,400
- What?

706
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,920
- The Girl Next Door.

707
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,480
- What movie is this?

708
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,720
guess what the plot is tell them pray tell do am I in it no oh Paul Dan I

710
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,400

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,400

- Yeah.

715
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,300
- That's what I meant.

716
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,640
- A Playboy model moves in next door.

717
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,480
- Bro.

718
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,480
- To me?

719
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,300
- To a boy.

720
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,680
- Oh, I'm not in, I forgot I'm not in this movie.

721
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,160
- To a bro, to a bro.

722
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,720
Playboy model moves in next door.

723
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,560
- You're telling me Paul Dano plays a bro?

724
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,600
- Wait, it's just a bro and a Playboy?

725
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,200
I don't wanna see that.

726
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,040
- It's actually, no, it's actually a nerd.

727
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,680
- I wanna see a neighbor and a neighbor.

728
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,120
- It's a nerd.

729
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:18,960
- A nerd.

730
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,920
- A nerd, and I'm pretty sure it's a meal...

731
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,280
Hirsch.

732
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,120
- Oh.

733
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,280
- Meal likey, this idea.

734
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,120
- Yeah.

735
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,940
- I'm pretty sure.

736
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,940
anyone like he did in real life.

737
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,940
He hushed a lot of people.

738
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,940
He did?

739
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,940
Especially when he played Jay Adams

740
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,940
in Lords of Dogtown.

741
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,940
Who did he hush?

742
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
Jay Adams hushed a lot of gay people.

743
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
I don't know who that is.

744
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,940
I never heard of that guy.

745
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,940
I hushed that he hushed people.

746
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,940
That's why he's not in movies anymore.

747
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,940
Allegedly hushed people.

748
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,940
I read that on his Wikipedia.

749
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,940
I read it in an email.

750
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
- I read it.

751
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,340
- Could you email that to me so I can hear about it?

752
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,180
- Yeah, sure.

753
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,000
- Thank you.

754
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,840
- Yeah, sure.

755
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,420
(laughing)

756
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,380
- I read on his Wikipedia, it was like personal life.

757
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,220
- Personal life.

758
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:10,040
(laughing)

759
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,880
- Personal life.

760
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,340
I read it on his Wikipedia, it was like,

761
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,940
Hirsch was like arrested for like assaulting someone,

762
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,420
and then said like, right under it said like,

763
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,980
Emil Hirsch is also a collector of fun socks.

764
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:25,220
- I did Hirsch that he Hirsched a female was the problem.

765
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,780
- Oh, he was hershing females.

766
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,620
- Yeah.

767
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,460
- Wow, that's awful.

768
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,400
- And you can't do that as a meal in today's society.

769
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,180
- That's a good point, that's a good point.

770
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,020
- That's good.

771
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:35,840
(laughing)

772
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:36,680
- Society's good.

773
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,820
- Yeah.

774
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:42,140
Oh, no, but ultimate nerd and girl next door dynamic

775
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,620
is Sam Witwicky and Megan Fox.

776
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,180
- I really thought you were gonna say Bumblebee

777
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,460
and then I would've agreed with you.

778
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:49,140
- Bumblebee is kind of the third wheel.

779
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,100
- Is Bumblebee, is Bumblebee like,

780
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,380
- Is he like a dog level intelligence?

781
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,220
Or is he--

782
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,260
- Well he doesn't have-- - He can't talk?

783
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,260
- He just can't speak.

784
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,420
- Yeah, he only speaks through the radio?

785
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,620
- He's lassie, basically though.

786
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,060
- He speaks at one time though.

787
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,900
- But they definitely--

788
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,300
- He says, "I wish to stay with the boy."

789
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,260
- I'll say that in this movie.

790
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,580
- They definitely--

791
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:09,420
(laughing)

792
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,620
Yeah, that guy, that's definitely an animal.

793
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,620
- They definitely treat him like less than the other bots.

794
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,640
- Oh yeah.

795
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,480
- He's treated as--

796
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,860
- Well he's also-- - Not even Bumblebee was--

797
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,700
I don't know much about Transformers lore.

798
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
So Bumblebee was made for that movie?

799
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,700
What?

800
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,700
Was he made for the Transformers movies?

801
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,700
No, I don't think so.

802
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
What?

803
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
I thought that he was like a Michael Bay OC.

804
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
No.

805
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Oh, I don't know. I'm 90% sure that's not true.

806
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,700
Well, you are the Transformers expert.

807
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,700
I don't know. I've only watched the Michael Bay movies. I don't know anything about him.

808
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,700
You are going to become my Transformer. I'm going to transform you into a girl.

809
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,700
But he's the stupid one because he wants to hang out with the humans.

810
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,620
All the other guys, all the other Autobots

811
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,980
are like, they do their thing

812
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,260
and they're killing the Decepticons,

813
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,100
but Bumblebee's like, I wanna drive around with this guy.

814
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,740
I wanna watch him have sex in my backseat.

815
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,540
- I want this high schooler sitting in me.

816
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,380
- Yeah.

817
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,200
- Farting on me.

818
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,660
- This looks like-- - You think he farts in him?

819
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,500
- Definitely.

820
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,100
- He definitely, wait, he definitely fucks Megan Fox

821
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,100
in Bumblebee. - That's what I'm saying,

822
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,700
in the backseat. - Oh my God.

823
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
- That's cool, the coolest part about that movie

824
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,260
is Megan Fox opens up his guts and shows him her boobs.

825
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,100
- That is true.

826
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,100
Yeah, that is true.

827
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
That is true, yeah.

828
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,380
He's doing the pose, yeah.

829
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:26,740
She's leaning over what is probably like his heart and his lungs and stuff.

830
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,740
Not his eyes, for God's sake.

831
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
Imagine that.

832
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,000
Where is his head?

833
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,140
Imagine the hottest woman in the world flaying you open.

834
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:41,340
That would, if that was doctors, I'd be getting surgery every day.

835
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,340
You made a good point.

836
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,340
I'd be getting a damn prostate exam.

837
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,340
You made a good point.

838
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,580
She showed her boobs to the wrong part of his body.

839
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,460
Do you imagine a girl, Megan Fox shows her boobs to your butt.

840
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:50,960
Yeah.

841
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,200
Oh, what a waste.

842
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,500
I know, complete waste.

843
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,580
Imagine a boob going into your butt.

844
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,660
That's a waste.

845
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,160
Might as well be a fucking balloon.

846
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,580
Hey, I don't know if it hits the right spot.

847
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,040
What kind of boob would hit your G-spot?

848
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,160
How shallow is your G-spot?

849
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,420
Probably real shallow.

850
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,700
Your prostate's like poking out of your asshole.

851
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,960
It's so swollen.

852
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,460
It's a big red point.

853
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,120
It's a big rock.

854
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,960
It's a big risen and evil boss weak point.

855
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,760
Yeah, yeah. One of those 50s cone boobs.

856
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,680
What happened to those? Why did that?

857
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,080
Why did that go out of vogue?

858
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,320
No, what? Why did they exist?

859
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,200
Was it chemicals or was it the shape of the bras?

860
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
It was chemicals.

861
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,400
The torpedo thing, the puffy nipples.

862
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Pretty crazy, man.

863
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,440
You go back and you like look at old Playboys and shit and all the girls have

864
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,280
the their boobs are like 15 inches in front of their body.

865
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,480
Scary.

866
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,320
Yeah, I don't really like Playboy.

867
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,040
It looks like a librarian's weekly.

868
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,240
The slope is like a double black diamond.

869
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,640
It's like, could be dangerous to ski that.

870
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,760
The K-12.

871
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,280
You know why?

872
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,600
Because Dan Schneider hates it.

873
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,400
That's a better off dead joke.

874
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,200
Remember that movie?

875
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,880
Have you guys seen it?

876
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,200
No?

877
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,560
All right.

878
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,080
No.

879
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,720
OK, Dan Schneider, John Cusack.

880
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,800
John Cusack tries to kill himself because his girlfriend left him.

881
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,360
And then he meets his French girl next door.

882
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,640
I'm sensing a theme.

883
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm sensing a theme in my pants.

884
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,520
And then the hamburgers come to life.

885
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,720
I'm sensing a cream.

886
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,120
The hamburgers come to life and they sing Van Halen.

887
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,720
Friend, you've lost the plot.

888
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,320
I've not lost the plot, mate.

889
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,820
No.

890
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,520
Mate, I have not lost the plot.

891
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,020
Bruh, let's change subjects.

892
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,420
You lot are afraid.

893
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,320
Us lot are not bloody afraid.

894
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:27,920
Yep.

895
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,720
My two mates right now are pretty much--

896
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,320
they've cacked their trousers.

897
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,420
Hey.

898
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,320
You better watch it.

899
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:35,920
Watch it.

900
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,320
You better watch your tone.

901
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,520
You guys are being bloody ignorant.

902
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,320
I'm not.

903
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,420
You're acting like a Tory.

904
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:41,920
I'll rip you.

905
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
I'm not acting-- hey!

912
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
I have anything to say about that.

913
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Your Todger's going in the loo.

914
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
It's going directly into the loo.

915
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,800
Speaking of Todger, did you guys hear that Prince Harry audiobook thing where he says

916
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,800
like...

917
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I think it was fake.

918
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
Was that fake?

919
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,800
Of course it's fake.

920
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,800
Crap.

921
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,800
What was fake?

922
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
It's like a thing where like...

923
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,800
Wait, the meme lord?

924
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,800
The meme god is telling us a meme?

925
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,800
No, I think I just fell for some shit, but it was like a guy saying like in Prince Harry's

926
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:36,800
voice, "They told me that I should put me mom's lipstick on me Todger."

927
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,000
He thought it was real. Yeah. You thought it was real?

928
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,960
Speaking of funny Twitter stuff, actually something funny I saw.

929
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Oh shit. Was that fake?

930
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
You're blowing my fucking mind right now.

931
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
What, you think that was real?

932
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,960
I don't know, he's a weird guy. There's no way that's real.

933
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
Do you think that's how you would have felt?

934
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,960
Do you think that was in the audio book and there was no article about,

935
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,960
they've been posting articles about him,

936
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
what he said in that book or whatever for weeks.

937
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Yeah, you're right. I think they didn't do that one.

938
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
Apparently there was some... I fell for it.

939
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
I've got egg on my face.

940
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:05,800
- There was some comic book--

941
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,840
- This motherfucker ate the onion.

942
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,680
- Yep.

943
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,520
- There was a comic book recently

944
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,120
where the Joker got pregnant.

945
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:11,960
- I seen that.

946
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,040
- And I saw on Reddit,

947
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,960
there was somebody on the comic book subreddit

948
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,740
posted a clip of Fox News talking about this comic

949
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,080
where the Joker is pregnant.

950
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,220
And I didn't watch the clip,

951
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:26,160
but everyone in the comments is like,

952
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,920
I can't believe they're talking shit about this comic

953
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,320
like the Joker's pregnant.

954
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,000
And one of the top comments was,

955
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Yeah, it's like they don't even know that the reason the Joker is pregnant is because he's under a spell.

956
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
[laughter]

957
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,300
I was--

958
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,400
You'd think they could at least do the research before they talk shit about this comic.

959
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,000
I did see the pregnant Joker thing. That was the first thing I've seen in a while where I was like--

960
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,800
I didn't see it. I wanna see it.

961
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
Yeah, that's pretty stupid, man.

962
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
Well, he's under a spell.

963
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,800
There's already so much--

964
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,200
But the spell thing makes me--

965
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,400
It was so funny.

966
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,600
There was like--

967
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,700
They're literally not--

968
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,800
They're not--

969
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,400
They're not--

970
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,000

974
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,760

975
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,680
this is going to be this is getting a grander the fucking legend i love it i like how he

976
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,760
acknowledges the joker was a victim the victim of a spell realizes this would contradict

977
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,600
his rant and decides to brush it all away to complain about nothing.

978
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:37,920
Ingenuity positive 123, that is an awesome Reddit username. Yeah, the Pregnant Joker,

He looks good.

985
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:49,520
The idea of it is making my, it's making the front of my pants pants.

986
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,760
It's one of the comic books they do nowadays where it looks like children's book art.

987
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Yeah.

988
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760

1034
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:42,980
I've always been paying attention to you. You're not enough to know that my throat clearing you the main attraction throat pying

1035
00:41:43,620 --> 00:41:50,760

1037
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,360
He would go surfing and motorcycle back and I'd look at him. I say if your name was backwards

Oh, and then she and then it blows up cuz she's a fucking evil clown. Yeah, I'd have a gun

1041
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,100
I'd have a gun and then I pull the trigger and a flag comes out the yeah

1042
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:31,040
I'm gonna bang you I was gonna say do you think when Harley Quinn gives birth like before like you know and you

1043
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,160
They push out the placenta first. Oh

1044
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:36,100
Do you think it'd be what the hell that says bang?

1045
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,340
No, when you come on to her face the flag comes out and it says salty sperm

1046
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:42,100
- She takes a flag out.

1047
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,260
- A bunch of tiny flags.

1048
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,100
(laughing)

1049
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,940
It all says slurp.

1050
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,940
- Flags all, like the fake Skittles commercial.

1051
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,980
- It's all flags.

1052
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:48,820
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1053
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,660
- It's all flag based.

1054
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,140
- She's got a lot of red flags there,

1055
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:51,980
but it'd be so worth it.

1056
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:52,800
- I don't even care.

1057
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,260
- Be so worth it to feel her pussy.

1058
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,460
- Oh my God.

1059
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,340
- Oh crap.

1060
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,100
- I just wanna see what her clothes look like

1061
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:59,160
when she's not wearing them.

1062
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,560
- I bet she's got a big clit.

1063
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,260
I bet she does.

1064
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,540
- If she was in my bedroom,

1065
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:08,340
and we were gonna get it on,

1066
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,780
I would arrange her clothes on the ground to be shaped like her.

1067
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,560
I want to be stuck in an elevator with her.

1068
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:15,740
Because you know shit's going down in the DM.

1069
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:17,260
It go down, it go down.

1070
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:20,140
She's probably going to let out a noxious, gaseous fart.

1071
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,940
Hello, Harley Quinn.

1072
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:21,660
In the envelope.

1073
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:24,580
Might I please go down on you?

1074
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,060
Might I please go down on you?

1075
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,340
And you could fart in my face?

1076
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:29,540
I was trying to say elevator, it said envelope-inator.

1077
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,020
[LAUGHTER]

1078
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,220
That's the thing, you wouldn't want to be--

1079
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,180
you wouldn't want to have your-- that's a bad time

1080
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,140
to not get a boner.

1081
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,140
She's gonna roast you Jeff Ross style.

1082
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:39,660
Shit.

1083
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:40,400
Until you cry.

1084
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,400
Imagine if Jeff Ross roasted your boner.

1085
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Imagine if Jeff Ross' brain was a hot ass girl.

1086
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:44,900
Jeff Ross.

1087
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,900
Wait a second, Liza Lampanelli.

1088
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Holy shit, she's fine.

1089
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,900
Jeff Ross is doing cock ratings on OnlyFans.

1090
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,900
Cock roastings on OnlyFans.

1091
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,900
That would be awesome.

1092
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,900
That would be awesome.

1093
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,900
Do you see some guy, he like did a...

1094
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,900
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. He accidentally got a guy on death row.

1095
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,900
Yeah, because the guy was like in jail or something.

1096
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,860
did like a jailhouse roast thing. He was like awaiting trial. And I guess part of the roast

1097
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:14,420
was like he was doing crowd work with the guy and the guy was like, "Yeah, plus I murdered

1098
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:20,020
my wife!" And now, and then in the jury, or in the trial, they were like, "We have video

1099
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,020
of this guy saying that he murdered his wife at a comedy show."

1100
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:25,060
It's like an outtake that's on like the DVD where he's like talking to him one-on-one,

1101
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,060
I think.

1102
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,060
Oh, really?

1103
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:28,060
Yeah.

1104
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,040
I just invented the middle part, but yeah, I think he gave it up.

1105
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:35,560
hair you probably would want a middle part. You probably want some more hair.

1106
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,600
You got Jeff Ross on the brain, I'm trying to do the roasts.

1107
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,960
What's that about man? That's hurting me. Yeah?

1108
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,040
That's fucking hurtful, yeah. That's hirschful. You're hurting my femelings.

1109
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:54,600
Is emeal pattern balding? I'm emeal... Come on man.

1110
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:59,360
I'm sorry that I hirsched your feelings. You hirsched my femeelings pretty bad.

1111
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,040
I'm sorry that I hearst your familings.

1112
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,200
Thank you.

1113
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,360
Bastard.

1114
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,800
You're one of the lords of Dogtown.

1115
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,720
Bastard.

1116
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:09,440
You're a bastard.

1117
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,920
You're one of the lords of Dogtown.

1118
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,560
The lords.

1119
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,360
I think that you could get it in with the girl next door.

1120
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,360
You think I could bang a girl next door?

1121
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:18,640
Girls next door don't want anything to do with me.

1122
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,760
I don't want to harp on this,

1123
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,040
but if I live next to four or five girls ...

1124
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,520
Girls next door ...

1125
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,840
I don't even want to finish.

1126
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:28,360
Girls next door stereotype me because of how I look.

1127
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:29,640
Really? Yeah, they say I should be a gardener.

1128
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:32,100
You're not so much a boy next door type.

1129
00:45:32,100 --> 00:45:34,580
I'm not, no. Yeah, you're not made for that.

1130
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,840
People say I'm a gardener or some crap like that.

1131
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,080
You know that Drake and Josh episode where they had that song

1132
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,920
about the girl next door? No.

1133
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,520
Kind of puts all the Dan Schneider stuff into ...

1134
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:49,120
You're like, "Oh, why are these kids talking about this?"

1135
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,520
Not the 50 girls that were like,

1136
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:53,800
"Yeah, I used to lick my feet in the craft services room."

1137
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,660
It's just like one that's getting glossed over.

1138
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:56,920
It's like, "Why the fuck is Drake Bell

1139
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,160
singing about fucking the girl next door.

1140
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,560
- 'Cause he's supposed to be a kid in the show.

1141
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,400
He is a kid in the show.

1142
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,760
- It's weird that they were talking about,

1143
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,800
they were singing about fucking a kid.

1144
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:07,640
- I don't think that they even fuck.

1145
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,880
- A lot of nice girls don't like me

1146
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,080
'cause they think I look too much like a motorcycle.

1147
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,680
- Here's the worst part about the girls next door

1148
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,240
is they don't suck cock.

1149
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,080
- They don't?

1150
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:16,900
- No, 'cause they're too good.

1151
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,120
- Okay, I'm done with these.

1152
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,960
- Nah, they're too good.

1153
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:20,700
- I'm going online to buy a wife.

1154
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,140
- Sometimes I'll let you do anal, though.

1155
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,200
- Are you dead?

1156
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,080
I'm dead serious. Yeah. They'll let you do anal sometimes.

1157
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,800
You're daft. You're cray. Sorry am I being crass?

1158
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:34,960
You're being daft as well. Am I working a bit blue today?

1159
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,000
You are bloody daft. You're wearing blue.

1160
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,960
I worked. You're wearing blue.

1161
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,680
I did anal with a girl next door. For real?

1162
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,160
No. But doesn't that,

1163
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,840
but wouldn't that give me some serious points

1164
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,440
on the crack.com forums? That would get you cred.

1165
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,640
That would get you cred for sure.

1166
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,640
That would get me cred in a major way.

1167
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,160
Yeah. Yeah.

1168
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,040
Damn. Imagine if you lived in a cul-de-sac

1169
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,280
It's like you know like 10 or 20 girls next door or if you're gonna go to a football game

1170
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:04,680
Cheerleader oh my god in the middle of the field yeah, maybe underneath the tackle pile so no one can see it

1171
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,200
What if the girl was a scientist and she wanted to do an experiment on your butt?

1172
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:13,280
I'm like first of all take those glasses off second of all take that lab coat off third of all take my pants off and

1173
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,280
Fourth of all take all my sperms out of my balls

1174
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,440
Extract yep you need an emergency extraction on my sperms that would be so hot to date a surgeon

1175
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,280
I would give her a numbered list.

1176
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,280
I'd give her instructions.

1177
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,720
How hot would it be to date a surgeon and she could literally open up your nut sack, take

1178
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,600
your balls out, put them in her mouth, and spit them back?

1179
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,600
I've never seen that.

1180
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,600
Really?

1181
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:35,600
Yeah, basically.

1182
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,600
Wait, thanks for spoiling the movie for me, you fucker.

1183
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:38,600
I like to spoil a woman's boobies.

1184
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,920
I completely spoiled the movie.

1185
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,840
I'm really fucking horny all this talk.

1186
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:42,840
It made me horny.

1187
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:43,840
I have to pee so bad.

1188
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,360
We just haven't fapped in a while.

1189
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,360

00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,020
We're hushing my bladder.

1330
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,020
You just want to, you don't even have to pee.

1331
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,020
I do have to pee so bad.

1332
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,020
Hushing my bladder is weak sauce too. Hushing was the first one.

1333
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,020
Yeah, that's right.

1334
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:17,020
And we're, it's over. It's over.

1335
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:19,020
That book's good though. He gets kidnapped.

1336
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:21,020
He gets kidnapped.

1337
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,020
Master Chief does? Yeah, he gets kidnapped.

1338
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:25,020
I didn't think that could happen. Yeah. Well, that's where he gets started.

1339
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:27,020
The beginning of the book is like

1340
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:29,020
a woman's walking around different planets

1341
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,020
and she sees his ass. Is it a prequel?

1342
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:40,700
It is a prequel. Yes. And Master Chief is basically selected for the Spartan program because he's

1343
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,380
a bald little white kid.

1344
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:48,740
Oh, hey, good news. Emile Hirsch was in The Mudge Boy.

1345
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,420
I want to hear about Fall of Reach.

1346
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:53,820
It's a really, really good book. I highly recommend anybody read it.

1347
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,180
Yeah, maybe I'll read it.

1348
00:56:55,180 --> 00:56:57,740
Especially if you're a Halo fan like myself.

1349
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:59,260
I don't really know anything about Halo.

1350
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:02,620
I haven't played the last, I think they kinda started doing some stupid shit.

1351
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:06,580
I think, honestly, I can't remember but I think Halo might have gone woke.

1352
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,860
I think, uh, for real?

1353
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,860
Yeah.

1354
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:13,360
To me, I just feel like if I'm gonna play Halo I'd rather play some horrible indie game arena

1355
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:16,140
shooter that's two times faster.

1356
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:18,380
Halo goes woke.

1357
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:21,820
You're on a circle jerk subreddit, Jubio.

1358
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:26,120
Everybody is welcome except gamers.

1359
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:28,100
Another TV show ruined by identity politics.

1360
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:34,000
Oh, yeah, I forgot they did the TV show and everybody but the real complaint was that there's no master chief in it

1361
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,020
Yeah, there is it no

1362
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:39,700
I don't think so I think it's like remember when they used it when they said that Peter Jackson was gonna do like a halo

1363
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:45,380
Yeah, whatever. It's a little bit fucking insane. That would have been so fucking I was just making what Beatles the movie

1364
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,080
No, thanks. We already have that. Help. He's not even making any across the universe. It's called help

1365
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:56,260
No help me away from watching this movie. Sorry. You'll have a lonely Hearts Club, man. Yeah, and the yellow submarine

1366
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,780
Oh, just naming yeah

1367
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:05,420
No, they're not there's a Beatles movie hard day's night. Yeah, no

1368
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,160
hurt oh

1369
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:14,700
Hard day's night. Oh, okay a hard day's night. Yep. Just a hard day's night with no words switched into

1370
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:17,700
Yeah, nothing switched even a little bit not even a that

1371
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:24,540
Even the easiest I listen. I'm just glad the Beatles aren't alive to see what the Tories have done to this country

1372
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:30,860
Yeah, there's one or two Beatles that are alive one or two. Yeah, not for long disputed on whether or not that's really Paul

1373
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:37,300
That's one of the greatest documentaries ever made. Mm-hmm, and I I haven't watched it in probably ten years

1374
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:42,380
I need to rewatch it Paul. I watched it when I was 10 years old and I think

1375
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,340
Like you know, it's like that part in the documentary where it gets really serious and like the screen

1376
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:50,460
It's like whatever and then I think my dad opened the door and I went like

1377
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:56,460
So scared you got scared. I thought that I was I thought that I was a scary documentary

1378
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:00,340
It's it's shot in the same way that those are edited the same way that those like

1379
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:06,100
Scientology documentaries are on YouTube where like they use like red words all the time right? Yeah

1380
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,320
Music X-Files theme. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

1381
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:16,240
Do you think this Church of Scientology may come for us over for what we said about the disappearance of Shelly misc of it?

1382
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:20,340
I we did a whole episode where you audited me. Oh, yeah

1383
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:23,500
That's it that was pro Scientology. Yeah, I say I'm

1384
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:30,660
Slightly pro I'm leaning towards it. Yeah, they have a beautiful Lee was in it. I'm willing to hear

1385
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:33,860
I'm willing to hear them out. That's the thing Leah Remini is you're like

1386
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:40,220
You're going there in the coal mine. Hey, she was a bitch on King of Queens exactly yeah

1387
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,860
Also, you could get a hotter girl

1388
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:46,820
Then Leah Remini yeah, right there's some fi-ass

1389
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:54,020
Fiat celebrities and if they can get me doing stunts like Tom Cruise it isn't even on a smaller scale

1390
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,420
I don't need to do the job. We can loop back to that

1391
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:01,540
To play us out and watch the whole no we won't every

1392
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:05,500
Scientologist video every Scientologist has a pretty good life

1393
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:13,220
Yeah, you know Aaron Cairo and every other person has a pretty shit life. I'd say Aaron Cairo professional skateboarder from the

1394
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:19,100
San Francisco Bay Area. He's teaching everyone how to do kickflips and skate

1395
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:23,220
in glass skateboards. We already talked about this guy. He's in the Scientology DVDs.

1396
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:27,820
Do Scientologists have heaven? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, okay. They do. I don't really know what they mean.

1397
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,620
It's a volcano though. Oh no, no, no, no, no. The volcano. You're thinking of bionicles.

1398
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:37,540
No. They live in a volcano. There's so many parallels to bionicles in Scientology.

1399
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,540
Mask of Light.

1400
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:39,540
Dianetics.

1401
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:40,540
Bionicolonics.

1402
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:41,540
Yup.

1403
01:00:41,540 --> 01:00:42,540
Bionicolonics.

1404
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,540
Yup.

1405
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:44,540
The Piraka.

1406
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,540
We have to put these two together.

1407
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:46,540
Piraka Obama is a Scientologist.

1408
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:49,540
We put these two things, two religions together.

1409
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,540
Bionicology.

1410
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:54,540
Piraka and Dianetics, or Bionicles and Dianetics.

1411
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:56,540
Science, Scienceicles.

1412
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:58,540
If we get them together.

1413
01:00:58,540 --> 01:00:59,540
Bionicology.

1414
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,540
I said that first.

1415
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:02,540
You did?

1416
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,540
I didn't hear it.

1417
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,540
I was lost in my thought.

1418
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,540
But, we get that together.

1419
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:11,500
We get together like this you went like this and you're tickling you will have the greatest cult in the world

1420
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:14,020
It's not a cult neither as a culture

1421
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:20,660
Yeah, no no no they aren't cults we will make a cult all right

1422
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,540
I'm starting to dislike your attitude, so I'm ending the episode now, okay

1423
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:30,660
Yeah, the way that you're talking is play play that John Travolta song train. Don't try that play song tray that John Travolta song

1424
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:33,940
Don't wait. What is this don't do it. Don't worry about it. Bye bye

1425
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:37,940
Berserking

1426
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:39,580
