(laughing)

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,800
(explosion)

9
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,040
- And record.

10
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,680
- And record. - And we're live in the studio.

11
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,040
- I wonder why we're so out of sync.

12
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,880
- We're not out of sync.

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,700
- We're not out of sync.

14
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,800
- We're synced up.

15
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,200
- We're completely synced up.

16
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,240
- Our cycles are synced up too.

17
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,320
- I wish I had a cycle.

18
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,720
I wish I had any, I feel like women have a built-in routine.

19
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,560
- Yeah. - Isn't that nice?

20
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,120
Like I wish that I had a, I wish like once a month maybe--

21
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,500
- The male cycle is food.

22
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,680
- True, three square meals a day.

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,600
'Cause women only eat one, or at least they're supposed to.

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,280
- Yeah, yeah.

25
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,120
- Yeah.

26
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,520
- And once a month we get McChicken too.

27
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,640
That's also something that we--

28
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,280
- Man, I haven't had a McChicken in a bit.

29
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,420
I haven't had McChicken in ages.

30
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,880
- I don't live anywhere near McDonald's.

31
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,360
It's not realistic for me to--

32
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,540
- I mean, no, and it's also like everything I live near

33
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,080
is like cheap and like real food too.

34
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,560
- Yeah, the last time I ate McDonald's,

35
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:04,400
I was like insanely hungover and it was raining outside.

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,160
- I ate McDonald's out of necessity pretty recently.

37
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,000
- Really?

38
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,560
Just some nice cheap meal?

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,480
- Uh-huh.

40
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
- Yeah, you know what's also as cheap?

41
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,640
Is to eat something at your house.

42
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,580
- Yeah.

43
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,420
- To eat groceries.

44
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,600
I think groceries might be even a cheaper meal

45
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,440
than McDonald's.

46
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,280
- Nah, I hate groceries.

47
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,120
- Okay, okay, buying groceries.

48
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:22,960
- I hate grocery shopping.

49
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,120
- Okay, you buy groceries, it's like $100.

50
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,760
Buy a McChicken, that's $1.

51
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,600
- Yeah.

52
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,840
- Okay, so I'm not quite seeing--

53
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:29,680
- That's a good point, I guess.

54
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,440
- What do you mean that that's cheaper?

55
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,960
That's clearly not cheaper.

56
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,520
- To me, money doesn't mean anything

57
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,840
'cause I'm so rich.

58
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,640
Honestly, I think McDonald's--

59
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,440
- We're definitely so rich.

60
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,960
- Getting the Instacart driver

61
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,120
to bring you 100 McChickens.

62
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,000
- I think that McDonald's might be the only

63
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,680
fast food option that is cheaper, probably,

64
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,720
than making food at home, right?

65
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,560
- Yeah.

66
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,560
- It's gotta be cheaper.

67
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,680
- It's got more expensive, though.

68
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,560
The dollar menu is like, it's horrible now.

69
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,800
It's a dollar fifty nine menu these days.

70
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,720
Yeah, it's terrible.

71
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,400
Especially here in this fuckin' liberal ass de Blasio city.

72
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,200
That's right, they've raised the prices.

73
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,880
Yeah, raise the prices on the best food in the world.

74
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,720
Hey de Blasio, de sandwiches are de too much money.

75
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,040
De Blasio.

76
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,880
Yeah.

77
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,880
How about you de fix your de city that you de run.

78
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,600
De too many de bills, like bill.

82
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,680
John DiMaggio, you think Bender's a black voice? No he's done... It's not

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,560
Bender that's the problem. He did a yeah like the boondocks right? Like he was on...

84
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,720
He did a bunch of stuff. Yeah the boondock if they let you do a voice on the

92
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,600
first of all that's cool but also Ned has this idea in his head that he like

93
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,680
really has culture pinned right so there's every single episode at some

94
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,980
point somebody will do something and then someone would be like okay that was

95
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:58,940

It's like the old, Ned Schneebly's gotta be in his 50s, right?

98
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,200
I was a script consultant on that.

99
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,200
I can tell.

100
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200

Yeah, your fingerprints are all over it, bro.

My fingerprints that have white chocolate on them.

104
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:25,280
He's like, "You're seriously orange juice pilled for breakfast this morning?

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,280
Wow, that's seriously based in breakfast pill."

127
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:22,300
Hollywood see where it's now we're hiring one guy to play three guys are you

that you're passing over you're passing over so many jumping fellows there's so

130
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,140
many three guys that could have played that role and instead you have one guy

131
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,340
play it do you realize how many roles there are built for one guy I'm right

132
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:46,980

kind soul yeah yeah we all share a same soul yeah is that you can't you're

138

passing us up makes you three guys instead of just three one guy exactly

139
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,020
three yeah so you could cast one guy one guy in three different roles that's fine

140
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,700
but to cast one guy in a three-guy role so serious right now so fucked up and you

kryptonite is a raisinette. That's the ultimate dog killer. Yeah. That is a dark chocolate raisinette.

167
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,140
You cannot take it, that's why you can't take dogs to the movies. That's what the CIA canine

168
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:25,340
unit puts in their molars. It's one big dark chocolate raisinette. Just a single dark chocolate raisinette.

169
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:31,940
They just dislodge it if they're ever about to divulge secret information. I would love that.

170
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:40,060
Yeah, it's like a dog, a dog like in the back of a CIA van and it's just like, "Alright,

171
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,020
we're only gonna ask you once who's a good boy."

172
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:46,140
And then he just starts foaming at the mouth.

173
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,580
Immediately, it's not even foaming at the mouth, he dies slowly of diarrhea for his two

174
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
days.

175
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:58,260
Yeah, I would love to have a fake molar filled with maybe a nerd or something.

176
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,780
- Yeah, man, I haven't had nerds in a long time.

177
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,940
- You know what they got now?

178
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:07,260
- Dude, I'm so glad it's Halloween tomorrow.

179
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,140
- They have balls of nerds rope.

180
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,100
- It's not Halloween tomorrow.

181
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
- Yes it is.

182
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:14,500
- I guess when this comes out it is.

183
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,980
- Yeah.

184
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,620
- Yeah, he knew that.

185
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,820
- I know.

186
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,620
- Why would you say it like that then?

187
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,460
- Because he's a good podcaster.

188
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,340
- Right now when you say it, it's not tomorrow.

189
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,700
- He's not a good podcaster.

190
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,780
- Well, if the people are listening to it tomorrow,

191
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,180
it will be Halloween.

192
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:32,820
- It's true.

193
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,640
- No, when they listen to it tomorrow,

194
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,740
it'll come out today.

195
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:37,020
- No, now I'm talking to you.

196
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,420
Now I'm talking to you because you want to talk semantics

197
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,700
about what I said.

198
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,540
- You're talking to me?

199
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,380
- Uh-huh.

200
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,100
- Is it?

201
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,860
- So today is the day before Halloween.

202
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,260
- Today is Halloween.

203
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,340
- But yesterday, when we recorded it.

204
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,360
- Was Christmas.

205
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,860
was my friend Ryan's birthday.

206
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,200
It's your friend Ryan's birthday?

207
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,240
Happy birthday, Ryan.

208
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,800
Is it the Ryan I know?

209
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,080
No, it's not a Ryan either of you know.

210
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,760
It's actually a Ryan I made up.

211
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,600
Oh!

212
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,280
(laughing)

213
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,520
Don't get me all pumped up for a birthday, man.

214
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,800
I started to celebrate.

215
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,640
Yeah.

216
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,760
I started lighting a firecracker.

217
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,120
I do see that cake back there

218
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,120
that you have behind a glass that says,

219
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,960
in case of emergency.

220
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,000
- It says breaking case of birthday.

221
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,840
- Yeah.

222
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,240
- And yeah, yeah, there's gonna be glass all over the cake,

223
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,420
but they're gonna appreciate that I brought a cake,

224
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,360
you know, it's the thought that counts.

225
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,080
- Well, you just eat around it.

226
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,840
- Just eat around the glass, you idiot.

227
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,720
I've been recently, I've been just stepping on glass,

228
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,880
like, (laughs)

229
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,920
and each time I keep breaking stuff,

230
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,040
I keep breaking like mason jars and shit,

231
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,240
and I used to like be real careful.

232
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,080
- Why do you keep breaking mason jars?

233
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,320
- 'Cause they just fall off,

234
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,060
I got too much shit in my house, man.

235
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,180
They just fall off the counter and shit.

236
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,580
And now there's glass everywhere and all this.

237
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,980
- I thought-- - Can you step on it?

238
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,620
- I thought that you were having a pickling accident.

239
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,860
- I've stopped trying to avoid the glass

240
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,180
when I break glass.

241
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,780
I've just been, and the truth is, it's fine.

242
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,220
It doesn't hurt your feet that bad

243
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,180
and it doesn't cut you at all.

244
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,260
- Is that true?

245
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,100
- I'm serious.

246
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,820
I've just been picking it.

247
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,540
It just gets kinda stuck to your foot.

248
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,980
It's not trying to hurt you. - What, glass?

249
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,700
- Yeah, it's not that bad. - I think you might have

250
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,820
a different type of glass.

251
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,820
No, no, it's normal glass.

252
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,820
Might be like candy glass or like breakaway glass.

253
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
I don't have, I don't live in a prop house.

254
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,820
Okay.

255
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,820
You kind of do.

256
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,820
I don't live in a prop house.

257
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,820
All of your, all of your belongings look like movie props.

258
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,820
That is a little bit true.

259
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,820
They were all, they were all, they were all auctioned off of the Oliver Twist set.

260
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,820
[Laughter]

261
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:49,820
Okay, I have an Oliver Twist bed, but actually all my chairs are from Emma and...

262
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,820
Who?

263
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,820
That movie, Emma.

264
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,820
Oh.

265
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,160
I thought this was someone we knew.

266
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,780
They based, it's based off Clueless.

267
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,700
Okay.

268
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,540
Yeah.

269
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,380
Jane Austen.

270
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:04,620
Oh.

271
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:09,360
See, this is why I have fancy furniture and you don't.

272
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,180
Yeah, I have future furniture

273
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,640
'cause I don't think about the past.

274
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,780
You have future furniture?

275
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,040
What?

276
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,700
You have future furniture?

277
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,460
Yep, I'm sitting on a hologram right now.

278
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,360
What does that mean?

279
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,200
You're not sitting on a hologram.

280
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,460
Future furniture?

281
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,940
- You don't have the knee strength to sit on a hologram.

282
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:27,980
- And I'm actually at Caleb's house

283
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,040
where we're recording this,

284
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,780
and we didn't record this on Zoom

285
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,240
because we thought that we needed

286
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,800
an extra 20 minutes of the show.

287
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,780
So, checkmate.

288
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,360
- Don't checkmate me. - What are you talking about?

289
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,860
- You don't even know how to play chess.

290
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,860
- This is so confusing, the recording now,

291
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,860
'cause you said that the Halloween thing.

292
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,660
- What's confusing about it?

293
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,720
- 'Cause we have this special guest coming up.

294
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,640
yeah it's special guest coming to this house and it is a very soon

295
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,640

I can see the face because we're in the same room.

What a weird thing to say.

309
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:31,180
I don't remember what he sounds like.

310
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,580
Yeah, I'm Pete Holmes.

311
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,820
Is that what he sounds like?

312
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,460
Something like that.

313
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,540
It just kind of sounds like TJ Miller.

314
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,420
He had that joke.

315
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,540
The aristocrats.

316
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,780
Yeah.

317
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,500
No, no, no, no.

318
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,300
Two types of black people.

319
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,420
Right, Pete Holmes?

320
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,380
Dad is great, give us a chocolate cake.

321
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,380
That was him.

322
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,320
Yeah, my daughter's a shitty cunt.

323
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,320
He did that one too.

324
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Yeah, he did.

325
00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,540
Well, he had that one where it's just, he says, "Pier Spring Bierce."

326
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,540
Ugh.

327
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,540
Yeah, do you remember that?

328
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,800
I hate him, dude.

329
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,280
That was one of my favorite jokes when I was like 14.

330
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,660
That was one of your favorite jokes?

331
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,700
I showed it to my mom and she giggled.

332
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,380
You know what my favorite joke was?

333
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,220
Aunt jumping on a homeless guy's birthday cake.

334
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,820
That's a funny joke, okay

335
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:25,340
And in the middle of New York City ants London Derry, New Hampshire, London Derry, New Hampshire

My name is Othney Anthony

343
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,460
That's a sick sci-fi name that you just invented on accident

344
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:14,460
Othney Anthony

345
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,860
I thought you were talking about Ant the gay guy though.

346
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
No.

347
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,420
Why do you make everything gay?

348
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,420
Why not?

349
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,420
I guess that's true.

350
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,340
It is Halloween after all.

351
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,340
Yeah.

352
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,340
Yeah.

353
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
It is Halloween today.

354
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,300
Tomorrow, no tomorrow's Halloween.

355
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,140
You need to get your mind out of the gutter.

356
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,140
It was Halloween's Eve.

357
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,420
The gutters of the monster house.

358
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,420
Tomorrow is Halloween.

359
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:44,420
And today is Halloween.

360
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,420
Today is the day that we're interviewing the Dark Lord himself.

361
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
Stop, stop, stop.

362
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,420
Stop tipping it, dude.

363
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,420
He's not even here yet.

364
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,420
Why are you ruining this episode already?

365
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,420
He's not even here.

366
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,420
You're going to be so weird in the interview.

367
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:59,420
I got a text from him that says he's on his way.

368
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,420
He is on his way, but that's...

369
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,420
He was on his way like an hour ago.

370
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,420
He's got a long way to travel.

371
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
Why are you making...

372
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
I don't know.

373
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,420
I see the sun going down.

374
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,420
I know that's why we're waiting, because the sun's going down.

375
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
But he can't even be...

376
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,720
- Just wait till he gets here.

377
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,220
- He probably isn't even gonna travel.

378
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,740
Son is like pretty much gone.

379
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,580
He's not even probably gonna start traveling

380
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,460
until it's gone, right?

381
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,300
- I don't know.

382
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,180
I mean, you know him better than me.

383
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,860
- Kinda, but like just barely.

384
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,600
We've talked over DMs and shit.

385
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,260
He's not like my friend.

386
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,460
I wish.

387
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,460
Maybe he will be after this.

388
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,300
That'd be cool.

389
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,580
- I've gotta hope.

390
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,500
- We need to make more famous friends, guys.

391
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,980
- Yeah, I can't wait to ask him questions.

392
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:44,300
who's it who's it who do you think is our are going to be our famous friend we have

393
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,660
probably could be this guy

394
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,820
think shia you think we could hit up shia i think shia might be a fan

395
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,820
shia? no i met him once

396
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,660
you think he remembers it?

397
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,400
yeah

398
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,540
yeah

399
00:18:56,540 --> 00:19:02,580
i think he didn't fuck with me. when you were working at fast food? it'd be funny if shia

400
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,420
also told that

401
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:09,420
that story of meeting patrick as many times as patrick has told it

402
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:16,420
Yeah, I met this fuck. I was at Life Alive and I met this freak and he sucked.

403
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,920
He didn't say hello to me.

404
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,420
And he didn't even say, "Are you Shia LaBeouf?"

405
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:23,420
I did say that.

406
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Pretty weird.

407
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,420
I did say that too.

408
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,420
I thought he was a homeless guy.

409
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,420
Yeah, I asked him if he was Shia LaBeouf because I thought he was a homeless guy walking in because his clothes were dirty.

410
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,420
I'll say this, if I was a homeless guy and someone asked me if I was Shia LaBeouf, I'm saying yes.

411
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,420
I would say yes, yeah.

412
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:45,420
I'm saying yes dude. I'm trying to get free shit. That was just a homeless guy.

413
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,920
You're like, "Are you Shia LaBeouf?"

414
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,920
He went, "Ahhh!"

415
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
"Ahhh!"

416
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
"Ahhh!"

417
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:50,920
"I'm hideable."

418
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
"And my meal is free."

419
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,920
That was the eighth guy that Pat asked that to that day.

420
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,920
Yeah, every homeless guy came out.

421
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,920
The first one who said this.

422
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
He hit him with a, "Are you Shia?"

423
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,920
"Are you Shia? Shia LaBeouf?"

424
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
"Are you Shia LaBeouf from Newfoundlandia?"

425
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,040
I didn't hear anything yet because it we have to wait a few minutes.

426
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,160
I thought it was time.

427
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:16,240
Why are you trying to do you are a freak dude you're a fucking monster.

428
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,240
That's strike three.

429
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
You are terrorizing us.

430
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,760
You're not you're not acting like Pete Holmes anymore you just became Pete Holmes.

431
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,560
I can see your your mouth is getting humongous like that horse filter on Instagram and it's

432
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,400
turning you into it you're becoming a disgusting freak.

433
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,160
This has been so confusing for me.

434
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I know.

435
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,240
In terms of keeping the story of the thing coherent.

436
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
What are you doing?

437
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
Stop!

438
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Shut up!

439
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,200
Can we just record this later when we hang out?

440
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
No!

441
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,200
Why are you... what are you doing?

442
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,000
It doesn't make sense in my head!

443
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It's so easy!

444
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Just do it!

445
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
It's just a normal episode!

446
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It doesn't matter whether it makes sense in your head!

447
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Why are you so stupid?

448
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Whoa, what was that?

449
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Whoa, what was that? Oh, it's our guest. I think our guest might be the door.

450
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Oh, our guest is here. Our mysterious guest.

451
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
We're going to cut to the interview.

452
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
All right.

453
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Hello.

454
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Wow. Back again.

455
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Back again.

456
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Back at it.

457
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Back again.

458
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Beautiful. The beautiful show.

459
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Beautiful. The most beautiful show of all time.

460
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But it's not like a normal show today.

461
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
No.

462
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
No, it's a little scary.

463
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Not at all. It's a little...

464
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
It's a little... I would say it's intriguing. It's interesting.

465
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Eerie.

466
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
It's not even eerie, dude. Let's just...

467
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Fascinatingly eerie.

468
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,840
No, it's not even, I wouldn't even say it's eerie. Depends on who you ask, I guess.

469
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,320
True.

470
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,280
Ookie, spooky.

471
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,600
It's not ookie spooky. Definitely not ookie spooky.

472
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,000
It depends on what you're afraid of.

473
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,360
If you're afraid of interest.

474
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,240
If you're afraid of intrigue and...

475
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,800
Information.

476
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,640
If you're afraid of information, you might want to turn this off right now.

477
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,400
Because you're about to get a load.

478
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
If you're afraid of getting your mind blown.

479
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,440
Yeah.

480
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
Having your perspective maybe shifted for the better.

481
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,960
then you might want to turn this off. You might want to shut this off right now.

482
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,520
Viewer beware. Learning a little something about yourself,

483
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,880
the world, someone else. Holding a mirror up to yourself in society.

484
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,480
Or another mirror. Yeah, or another mirror.

485
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,800
Now talk about being blind. Now that's scary because that never ends.

486
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:13,120
Yeah. Yeah, that's actually really scary. So we have a guest today, but it's more than a guest.

487
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,280
I think if you've been to any barbershop in the world, they have the conversation every day,

488
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,200
day in day out top five most evil people who've ever lived.

489
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,680
Yep.

490
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,960
Right? You have that question.

491
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,920
I ask that's the question I'm asking my barber.

492
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,280
Yeah, Chucky, you know. But we have today somebody who I think gets left out of the

493
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,400
conversation all too often, Dracula. My man, how are you doing today?

494
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,120
Yo.

495
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,600
What's up?

496
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,720
What's up guys?

497
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,120
How's it going?

498
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,160
Thanks for having me out.

499
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:42,400
Yeah.

500
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,280
Good to have you.

501
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,400
Yeah.

502
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
You have an easy time getting here?

503
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,600
Yeah, it was like super simple because I just like Uber everywhere now.

504
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,000
Really? Oh, you're on that tip? Do you have the Uber lift?

505
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,360
You thought you were evil, dude. I thought you would have stick with Uber.

506
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,440
I just like, I get a ride where I can, you know what I mean? Sometimes the apps are all

507
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,200
fucked up right now because of some like legal shit, but that's why I have to do both.

508
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,680
You see, they've been like surge pricing. It's crazy.

509
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,920
Yeah, it doesn't matter for me, for my bank account.

510
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,640
Don't act like you can't handle the surge pricing.

511
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm not trying to like...

512
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,320
This guy's a count.

513
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,760
Yeah, exactly.

514
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,320
Yeah, I am.

515
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,000
The Count himself, some people know him as the Count, we know him as Dracula.

516
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,720
Yep, yep.

517
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,400
Very good to see you. Hey, I got a question for you. You got any Mardi Gras plans?

518
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,200
Damn, Mardi Gras. This year I'm keeping it pretty easy because last year I got like

519
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
crazy ass hungover.

520
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,720
Oh yes, I saw that.

521
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:38,800
There was a photo of you, you were leaving the French Quarter at like 4 in the morning.

522
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,120
Yeah.

523
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,240
Yeah, you looked fucked up.

524
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,760
It was like with all my college buddies, like we were out, you know what I mean?

525
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,360
And like on those holidays you want to get so fucked up, but then you forget we're getting older, right?

526
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,440
So like you can't handle liquor like you used to be able to yeah, absolutely

527
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,520
Yeah, I mean once you hit like the 200s, I bet it's like, yeah, it's a little different for me

528
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,760
Yeah, but I like I go to college once again, like every hundred years so I like have a new set of like buds, whatever

529
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,000
Yeah, where'd you go? Where'd you go this time?

530
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,640
Dude, yale. Yeah

531
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,200
Yeah

Yeah, no, they like knew about me. So they're just like come right in. Oh, yeah

533
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,800
How they let franco like just fucking teach and I don't fuck with franco really y'all have beef

534
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,880

536
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,720
Bad boy, whatever but and you were he kind of was stealing your swag a little bit. I can't stand pretty boys. Yeah

537
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,920
Yeah, no, I cannot stand pretty boys. No, because you kind of you succeeded kind of despite your looks

538
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,240
I would say. Yeah, a little bit, but like people still think I'm hot as fuck. Like, it's one of the

539
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Yeah, that kind of weird hot thing. Yeah, yeah. You can turn someone into a thrall.

540
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:57,520
Yeah, pretty much. True. Yeah. Uh, if- Crazy ass abilities. Here's a question. If, uh,

541
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:03,360
yo, if McDonald's did a Dracula meal, like what would that be, you think? Damn, Dracula meal, like,

542
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:09,440
so when I was a kid, right, like I love chicken McNuggets. Yeah. And like the older I get,

543
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,440
I'm like, "Yo, what are they putting in that shit?"

544
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
Like, I'm becoming curious about that kind of stuff now.

545
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
- True.

546
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
- It's the pink slime.

547
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,000
- That dude, I saw that shit, Miss Super Million, or what is it called, McMillions, or Super

548
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Size Me.

549
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
- The Founders?

550
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
- Oh, yeah.

551
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
- Never mind.

552
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
- The guy that eats McDonald's every day for a hundred years.

553
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,320
- That movie fucked me up.

554
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,640
- Dude, I was like, "I'm not eating there anymore."

555
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
You know what I mean?

556
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
- Yeah, yeah.

557
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
- But then you end up, "I'm gonna come home."

558
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,880
- But then I'm drunk as fuck, like, "You gotta have a burger."

559
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,880
- Yeah, true.

560
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,120
- You get the Casamigos in you, you're like, "Ah."

561
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,460
- I do, Casamigos Gold is where it's at.

562
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,740
- Is that your favorite?

563
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,040
- I like gold, I'll do silver on the holidays.

564
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,960
- Oh, shit.

565
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,280
- I love tequila.

566
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,860
But, yo, my meal would probably be just like

567
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,200
tall ass Diet Coke with vodka in it.

568
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,040
- Whoa.

569
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,200
- Yeah, just like crazy as a Big Mac,

570
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,980
like no cheese, no dairy for me.

571
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,700
And then just like McFlurry, M&M.

572
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,100
- You're off the dairy?

573
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,940
- Yeah, it fucks with my system.

574
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,740
- What's with the McFlurry though?

575
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,400
- The McFlurry, well the McFlurry.

576
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,640
(laughing)

577
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,740
What the problem is, bro, is that the cheese,

578
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,060
whatever cheese, quote unquote,

579
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,180
you can't see me on the pod,

580
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,300
but the cheese is not like real cheese.

581
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,140
- Oh, got it.

582
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:24,940
- So whatever's in that, but the milk they use is like,

583
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,300
I think it's like powdered or something.

584
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,740
- Yeah, it's like fake dairy.

585
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,060
- So it gets rid of the stuff you're allergic to.

586
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,220
- Plus you pop a lactaid.

587
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,900
- Yeah, yeah, exactly, pop a lactaid.

588
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,100
- Pop a lactaid, you're good, right?

589
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,940
Yeah.

590
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:35,780
- I bet when that shit was invented,

591
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:40,820

598
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,420
all human beings. Wow that's beautiful. Thank you. Were you a big, did you ever drink grog

599
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:23,760
back when that was around? Dude grog with all the pirate folk? No I didn't really fuck

600
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,600
with those guys. And women. It was a mix. Mad respect. Did you ever have like a pig

601
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:36,000
with an apple in its mouth. I always wanted to have that. They still do that shit at certain

602
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:43,000
feasts. They'll still do that. He's getting nervous around you bro. No that's all good.

603
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You're probably the biggest guest we've ever had. No really? You guys met other celebrities?

604
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:59,000
We kind of had a line on Frankenstein's monster but he's like real slippery. He kind of goes

605
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,200
Frank Sinatra, he's not all there either. He's kind of like, he got all fucked up.

606
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,880
I was gonna ask you about him. Those piercings are crazy.

607
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:12,260
Did you like know him like after y'all were kind of like popping off?

608
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,020
So yeah, I mean I can go through it, but he basically like blew up hella to a way where

609
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,560
it's like, you know like if you get famous at a certain age, like you stay that age?

610
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:26,720
He like basically became an adult the minute he was born because he was reanimated. So

611
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:36,080
So he became famous immediately, no life experience, busted women, models, money, it all started

612
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,360
to fuck with him so bad.

613
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,120
I respect him but I just cannot deal with him anymore.

614
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,880
I feel bad for him.

615
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,400
He let the fame change him.

616
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,920
He let the fame change him.

617
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
He really did.

618
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,780
That's what I like about you, you didn't.

619
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,360
You just kind of stay the same.

620
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,960
I kind of own that shit.

621
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,320
I like to get fucked up.

622
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,840
I like to be in public, like with celebrities.

623
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,320
I like to be evil.

624
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,680
- Like it's not like a,

625
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,000
you're not trying to hide it from anybody.

626
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,880
- No, I'm not trying. - You are who you are.

627
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,720
- Yeah, exactly.

628
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,400
- Except for the sun, trying to hide it from the sun, I guess.

629
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,920
- Oh, thanks for doing this inside.

630
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,120
- Yeah, of course, anytime.

631
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,180
- Yeah, of course.

632
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:14,280
- Dude, I gotta ask, if you could live inside any book,

633
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,400
like what book would you wanna live your life inside of?

634
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,160
- I know it's not like,

635
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,640
I know we don't like the author anymore for good reason,

636
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,240
But if I could be in the world of Harry Potter,

637
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,080
- Damn, yeah.

638
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,840
- I would be chilling at Hogwarts.

639
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,760
- Because you're like, you'd be like a professor

640
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,920
or a student or like?

641
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,920
- I would be a student and move up to being a professor

642
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:35,840
and live there my whole life.

643
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,280
- Well you're like super into like, castle culture.

644
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,120
- I love the occult, yeah.

645
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,560
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

646
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,120
- Speaking of Harry Potter, what house would you be in?

647
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,360
- Dude, good, I think about this every day, for real.

648
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,240
Probably Slytherin based on my behaviors, but like,

649
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,240
if I could choose, like of course Gryffindor.

650
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,240
you know what I mean? Because they get the most respect.

651
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,240
Like Harry.

652
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240
You're the main character, right?

653
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
I do have main character syndrome.

654
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
Damn. I mean, who doesn't from time to time?

655
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,240
What house would you guys be in?

656
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,240
I think...

657
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
I mean, I took the quiz.

658
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
You did? On Pottermore?

659
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Yeah, I got Hufflepuff.

660
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
I'd probably be like dual majors in Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff.

661
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,240
That's not how it works though.

662
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
I'd probably be Slytherin too.

663
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,240
I'd probably be Slytherin again just based on my actions in life.

664
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,760
in life and also because like I don't know like you're kind of an idol of mine

665
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,580
you dude like honestly yeah like you've been influenced it's crazy we got you

666
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,840
on here I know yeah I'm like well I love doing this type of shit

667
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,720
yeah like talking with normalize people like you guys like who was like your

668
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,000
idol growing up though you probably wouldn't have heard of him I knew this

669
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:52,440
guy named Fedor. How did you know Fedor? He's been dead like 400 years. Oh my god. He grew

670
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:57,000
up in my village and he was so sick. Really? Hella tall, hella dark and handsome, Spanish

671
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,840
complexion. Damn. And he just was like so, he was like one of the first to be reading

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,760
in our village. He's like your OG? Yeah. Wow. He passed the game down to you. He did, yeah

673
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,320
he did. I don't even know if he knew what kind of influence he had on me but it was

674
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:17,600
into like blood and shit? Nah, most people once they figured it once I got afflicted

675
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,560
yeah by this thing that I have yeah Dracula syndrome I basically got

676
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,000
excommunicated from my village like they don't help me anymore I don't I've been

680
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,440
Speaking of, you know, I mean 400 years, I mean you've been around, you've been around

681
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,280
the block, you know, what's like the worst thing you've ever seen?

682
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Oh shit.

683
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:57,200
The worst thing I've ever seen, basically World War I, I was fighting in the trenches.

684
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,160
This like, I mean it's fucked up, right?

685
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,320
So like we were hungry, I don't have to eat, right?

686
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,760
So I actually was eating good, World War I, because it was like fresh blood all the time.

687
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,440
So you're like, you hit every war because it's like fucking...

688
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,000
I also feel patriotic for whatever country I'm living in.

689
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Oh, okay.

690
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That one I really wanted to know.

691
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,520
What did you fight for in World War I?

692
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,600
World War I, I was with the Germans.

693
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,720
Oh, that's a better war to be with the Germans.

694
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
They weren't fighting for as...

695
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,400
They weren't Nazis yet.

696
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
They were chilling a little bit.

697
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,400
Yeah, they just had some qualms with the war.

698
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,480
It's where I was raised.

699
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
I had to go back and kind of...

700
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
True.

701
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Yeah.

702
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
True.

703
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
But, so yeah, I saw some crazy...

704
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,400
Do you see how many horses died in World War I?

705
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,400
Yeah, oh man.

706
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,600
Do you have a soft spot for horses?

707
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,600
I have a soft spot for horses and I saw a horse get taken down.

708
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Damn, dude.

709
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,600
By a cannon.

710
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
That's fucking awful.

711
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,600
A cannon?

712
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
Yeah, where there is horse shit.

713
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,760
It was near the end of the war, it's like there's no the ancient shit.

714
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,880
They ran out of bullets and started pulling out the cannons.

715
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,880
That's so fucked.

716
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
It sucks.

717
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,880
I hate to see that.

718
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,040
I don't even like to bring that shit up.

719
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:02,840
I mean, you know, just somebody that's led such an interesting life, I want to get all

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840

727
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
I did fight for the Americans and the British

728
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,680
in World War II.

729
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,000

so that you could go fight?

735
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,680
- Yeah, well actually both sides wanted me so bad

I don't want to get too into that.

743
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,320
What do you order for the table?

744
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,000

00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,400
Oh, true.

people's minds about the founding fathers. Really? Oh man. I mean, you know Hancock was

790

791
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,360
Yeah, that's all I'll say.

792
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,600
Kind of a Farley type.

793
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,320
He was like, dude, once you got a little wine liquor in him,

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,080
It's a lot of swag.

802
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,600
He thought--

803
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,360
True.

804
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,280
Is it true that he thought that he was just autographing it?

805
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,960
He did, because he was the top dude.

806
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,200
So just people were handing him shit all the time.

807
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,240

00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,480
didn't happen but I know hundreds and thousands of people that have gone so

849
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,920
It's a crazy burden.

850
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,200
What else gets you in your feels?

851
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:31,000
Just like sad ass movies like Sam Private Ryan, a lot of Spielberg shit.

852
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,960
Well I'm sure, well I won't get back into that but I'm sure that shit reminds you.

853
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,120
It was so realistic.

854
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,000
What about Take Care, do you relate to that album at all?

855
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Oh Drake's Take Care?

856
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,720
- Like mobbed up at the table, like sipping.

857
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,520
Sipping like, are you a Hennessy or a Cavassier?

858
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,560
- I like Cavassier.

859
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,960
- Nice, man it tastes.

860
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
- With a little bit of, it's like, I do like a spritz,

861
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,920
so it's like that in a bunch of seltzer water.

862
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,680
- Whoa, whoa, that's strong.

863
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,440
Yeah, so like you gotta be sitting there.

864
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,680
I mean, you've been, had ups and downs,

865
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,520
you know, to say the least.

866
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,360
- Oh yeah.

867
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:08,240
- But like at the top of the top, does it feel like lonely?

868
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,880
- Dude, it does, but then you start talking with someone

869
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,360
that's like a little more on the ground level,

870
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,560
like a busboy or like, you know what I mean?

871
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:20,760
Like a taxi driver, like, or like, you know,

872
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,340
and they're smarter than all these people

873
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,400
that you know that are at the top.

874
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
And then you realize like, yo,

875
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,640
like the hierarchy is all fucked up.

876
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,640
You know what I mean?

877
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,480
- Yeah.

878
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,560
- I mean, like speaking of like loneliness too,

879
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:35,040
like you're one of like the most eligible bachelors

880
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,880
in New York City.

881
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,160
Like you got any ladies in your life?

882
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,760
- I'm like doing a little thing right now

883
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,520
where I'm like, I need to be alone

884
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,520
because I've got my heart broken too many times.

885
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,680
- Yeah? - Yeah.

886
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,120
- Any like really badly, any really bad heartbreaks

887
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,360
that you'd be like comfortable talking about?

888
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,800
- You know, on a day at our mass.

889
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,400
- Yeah? - Wow.

890
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,560
- That's all I'll say, just like you can see in my eyes.

891
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,400
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

892
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,760
- It was a fucked up situation.

893
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,680
- Not like Kiss and Tell, but I can imagine.

894
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,080
- She went Ben Affleck, me,

895
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,440
and now she's with someone else,

896
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,200
but some other celebrity, but.

897
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
- Damn, that's crazy.

898
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,080
- Yeah, I had no idea.

899
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,920
- Knives out.

900
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,240
- Yeah. - She's some knives out.

901
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,240
A little birdie told me you've been dabbling in amateur photography.

902
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
Yeah, DSLR type shit.

903
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,240
Yeah, so this is a two-pronged question.

904
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:21,240
What kind of stuff do you like photographing?

905
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,240
And is there anything that you can't do?

906
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
So anything I can't do with photography?

907
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,240
Just can't do in general.

908
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,240
You seem to be a man of many interests.

909
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,240
A bit of a renaissance man.

910
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,240
So for photography, I love doing party photography.

911
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
But I like going incognito, right?

912
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,740
wear like the, um, you know, like the, like a mask or whatever.

913
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,000
So people sure it's easier now.

914
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,520
So those photos that you took at the, yeah. Oh,

915
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,760
the photos you took at the, uh, the JPEG mafia show, like JPEG mafia,

916
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,680
his music, I don't understand it, but I'll do like,

917
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,160
it does make me feel crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Uh,

918
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,280
but I love doing the shit where it's like, I mess with like settings.

919
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,080
And so like, you know, like when you do a photo and then you move the camera,

920
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,640
hella fast with like the long exposure the lights look all streaky and shit.

921
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,200
Oh yeah. I'll be doing that shit with every photo. Yeah. It's kind of interesting. Is it

922
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,760
weird that like do you like photography because you can never be in a

923
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,080
photo? I do because it's kind of like yeah I can't be in a photo, I can't be in

924
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,280
a mirror, I can't be in a long-term relationship. I'm proving that. Yeah. It sucks.

925
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,520
I have commitment issues. That may be the thing I can't do is you know give up

926
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,480
enough of my own time and myself to be in a long-term relationship.

927
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:43,880
Is it more about a time management thing or is it more because like

928
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,800
like you're Dracula right? Like you got like hecka like virgins like being

929
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,200
thrown at you constantly. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like how do you

930
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,280
avoid that temptation in a long-term relationship? It's mostly like it's time

931
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,060
management mostly I would say. Yeah I have crazy ass ADHD like just got

932
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,900
diagnosed in the 90s like damn I got it bad yeah so I just like can't focus and

933
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,900
shit and I'm like I'm like learning I'm selfish but I need to get over it and

934
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:15,180
yeah la-dee-da are you in therapy yeah hella nice cognitive behavioral therapy

935
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:21,380
Wow whoa yeah Wow it works yeah yeah but I don't fuck with medicine true yeah yeah

936
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,940
did you do self-medicate like yeah alcohol and music all that shit yeah

937
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,940
What about like meditation?

938
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,940
Yeah, I do that sometimes.

939
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,940
I'm having a panic attack.

940
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,940
You struggle with anxiety?

941
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,940
Crazy anxiety, dude.

942
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,940
I think you're alive for a certain amount of time and you're like,

943
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,940
"I just want to fucking die so bad."

944
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,940
And you can't and you know you're here forever.

945
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,940
There's just so much pressure to be alive for that long.

946
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,940
It's crazy, man.

947
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:52,940
Do you still ever talk to Van Helsing or any of those hunter guys?

948
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:57,620
We were beefing hard for a minute and then now we're good.

949
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,620
I just noticed he's dead.

950
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:04,300
He's been dead for a minute, but his grandchildren are all like trust fund kids, trying to be

951
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:05,300
actors and shit.

952
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,780
I don't want to drop their names, but I still will see them in a movie or see them open

953
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,100
a new restaurant and I'm like...

954
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,140
You ever run into them at parties and shit?

955
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:18,540
Sometimes because they do have good taste, I will admit that.

956
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:23,940
There is some kind of generational like just tension between us because he tried to kill me many a time.

957
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,640
Yeah. I feel you must have like some crazy like stalkers, some crazy fans, right?

958
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,640
I mean, someone your level, right?

959
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,340
I need to get my lawyer might be pissed off that I'm talking about it.

960
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,740
But oh, yeah, I do. Yeah.

961
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,640
Yeah, it's like ongoing legal shit.

962
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,440
Is there like, but probably like no paparazzi though, right?

963
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:42,240
Because paparazzi can't touch me.

964
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:42,840
It doesn't work.

965
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:43,540
Yeah. Yeah.

966
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:45,540
So they just like photograph all my cars and shit.

967
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:51,220
Yeah, yeah, which is I mean, hey, yeah more fucking photos right Clarence. I know more McLaren's like yeah as well

969
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:58,740
Yeah, like I mean, I know that's like a big night for you, right?

970
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:05,860
Yeah, especially in the in the winter the Sun goes down early. You're like, what's what whip are you hopping in head to 40/40 Club?

971
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:13,540
I like to go incognito. You know, yeah, so that's why I'm in the blacked-out Range Rover. Mm-hmm with the like

972
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,940
Crazy music playing. What year? It's like the one that Chris Moltisanti had.

973
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:21,340
Whoa! That's sick.

974
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:24,340
Like the exact one? It's the same one from the set.

975
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Like I fucked with those guys. Holy shit.

976
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,340
Big Sopranos fan? Yeah, I love them.

977
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:30,340
I love their lifestyle, like all those guys.

978
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,340
Yeah. It's awesome.

979
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,340
Dude, that's sick. Yeah.

980
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,340
This one's kind of like open-ended, but like

981
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,340
what does paradise mean to you?

982
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,340
Mmm...

983
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,340
Paradise to me means like

984
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,540
Paradise means that I would be able to get over my intrusive thoughts.

985
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,540
Yeah.

986
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:48,540
You know what I mean?

987
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:55,900
So that would be like me on vacation in Mexico, just on the beach, no crazy ass thoughts trying

988
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:56,900
to get to me.

989
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,900
Yeah.

990
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:08,380
I'm just able to relax, watch the Apatow collection, fall asleep.

991
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:12,300
Do you ever suffer from imposter syndrome?

992
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,180
- Heavily, dude, because can you imagine what it's like

993
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:18,060
to see your face in media all over the place

994
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,020
and everybody gets it wrong.

995
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:20,860
- Right. - True, true.

996
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,700
- Do you know what I mean?

997
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,220
Kids are dressing up as you, they're getting it wrong.

998
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,060
Nosferatu.

999
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,580
- The guys, I mean, they made you so ugly in that.

1000
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,420
- I know. - What the fuck was that about?

1001
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,260
- I know, dude, it's just like--

1002
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,820
- Yeah, they had Willem Dafoe play you once.

1003
00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:37,420
- I liked Willem, but, or I like him as an actor,

1004
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,260
but without all the shit.

1005
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,740
- Who's your favorite, like which actor you think

1006
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:48,700
like gotten you the best? Man, so like Gary Oldman when he becomes when he turns

1007
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,380
into like the young me because they show him old and yeah when Stoker right yeah

1008
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:59,620
so I feel like there's a touch of him that I relate to or I fuck with but it's

1009
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:03,420
hard to answer because I still haven't seen like an accurate depiction.

1010
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,700
He had like though he I feel like it's the only portrayal that understood kind

1011
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,100
how lavish you are, how into fashion you are.

1012
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:11,940
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1013
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,100
- You know, like who are some other celebrities

1014
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,820
who are like your fashion icons right now?

1015
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:18,260
- Fashion icons for celebrities like Will Smith,

1016
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:23,700
let's see, Owen Wilson back in the 2000s

1017
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,020
when he was on the come up.

1018
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,900
'Cause people don't realize,

1019
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,460
but he was being asked to model and shit,

1020
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:29,540
he was turning it down.

1021
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,380
- Yeah. - Damn.

1022
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:32,220
- What about like Jack Harlow, you fuck with him?

1023
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:34,940
- Harlow, all these young guys, I do like them,

1024
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,780
but there's something about the Generation Z

1025
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:41,420
that I don't understand. Yeah. Are you on Tik Tok? Yeah, but I like don't

1026
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,340
understand it, right? But I'm addicted. So it's like, I'm like, what the hell?

1027
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:50,060
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just sitting there scrolling in the morning and

1028
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:56,220
list doom scrolling. Yeah. I bet you like doom scrolling. Yeah. Oh,

1029
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,860
because of the horse. Yeah, that algorithm is twisted. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1030
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:04,900
It's kind of scary. That's kind of having every fucking file on your

1031
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:08,980
phone. Jesus Christ. Terrifying right? It's terrifying dude. Yeah. That's the real horror.

1032
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:13,140
Yeah like what scares Dracula? You know like what's your like what's your biggest fear?

1033
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:19,580
Yeah. Famine. Like. You've probably seen a lot of that right? A lot of that over the

1034
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,980
years and I feel like that's coming back with like global warming which by the

1035
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:26,780
way is real. Mm-hmm. And like that shit is gonna touch our world in a way that I'm

1036
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,460
gonna have to be around for this shit right? Yeah. Me and your children are gonna

1037
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:34,100
have to see the world come to the brink of collapse. Damn. Is that a scary thought?

1038
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:45,100
Very scary. Yeah. Because I don't work well with kids. So you know. So you're gonna be out there

1039
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:50,620
all these snot-nosed brats. Oh yeah trying to fix carbon. And they're gonna be and you know

1040
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,740
they're gonna like yeah they're like phones set up doing tick-tock dances and shit. I mean some of

1041
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:59,560
these kids probably never even heard of you too. I know a lot of them haven't so it's and I'm okay

1042
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:04,040
with that. My ego isn't hurt. Yeah they probably heard of Bella and Edward and

1043
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,240
shit. Yeah. What do you think of them? What do you think of Twilight Generation?

1044
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:11,600
Did that fuck with your image at all? So here's the thing right is that I do

1045
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:15,720
get like residuals when people get interest in vampires because they did

1046
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:20,600
like set me up with like some of these IPs and so whenever interest in vampire

1047
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:27,720
spikes I benefit right? True. Financially. But the way that I think what I didn't

1048
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,080
like was what Twilight taught kids about relationships. Like Edward is kind of

1049
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:38,400
this abusive MF-er, like Bella is staying... it's just like that book, I don't like

1050
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,380
that series. Just because you're like a vampire doesn't mean you're mad toxic

1051
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:47,320
in relationships. Yeah exactly, yeah right exactly. So I don't know. That makes sense.

1052
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Yeah but you don't shine or anything right? That's a kind of fufu. That is, oh yeah. I do

1053
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,760
I do love Robert Pattinson though. He's about to rock the Batman.

1054
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,760
That's going to be so tight.

1055
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,760
I can't. I watched that trailer.

1056
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,760
I bet you're going there opening night.

1057
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
The Riddler too.

1058
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Paul Dano.

1059
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,760
Oh shit.

1060
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
When the question mark's in the coffee.

1061
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
Oh shit.

1062
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:05,760
That's nuts.

1063
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:06,760
I just can't wait for the riddles in the movie.

1064
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:07,760
Me too.

1065
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:08,760
You're famously well traveled. You can fly wherever, anytime of day. Supermoon status.

1066
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,760
What's your top three favorite cities?

1067
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,760
Paris, Tokyo, and Berlin.

1068
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:11,760
Really?

1069
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Yeah.

1070
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:13,760
That's a fast answer.

1071
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:14,760
I'm not sure.

1072
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,760
I'm not sure.

1073
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,760
I'm not sure.

1074
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,760
I'm not sure.

1075
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:18,760
I'm not sure.

1076
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
I'm not sure.

1077
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:20,760
I'm not sure.

1078
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:27,720
Really? Yeah. That's a fast answer. Well because A) Paris, fashion, Berlin, clubs,

1079
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,000
Tokyo, the crazy-ass food that they have there. You ever eat this food? You like Japanese food a lot?

1080
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,680
Love Japanese food. Sushi fan? Love sushi, love ramen. You fuck with like anime and

1081
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:44,080
manga? I do like it. I just watched like Attack on Titan and I was doing like

1082
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,320
yeah I'm like trying to get into it more. Yeah. I just have some time on my hands. You said like

1083
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,720
clubs in Berlin. I'm sure you've been to Berghain.

1084
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,920
Those clubs, have you all been there? No.

1085
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,720
Can't say I have.

1086
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,120
They do it differently over there.

1087
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,120
Yeah.

1088
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,120
That's all I'll say.

1089
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:00,120
You been to the bottom floor of Berghain?

1090
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,120
I'm nodding yes.

1091
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:02,120
I'm nodding yes.

1092
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,120
I'm nodding yes.

1093
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:04,120
I'm nodding yes.

1094
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
I'm nodding yes.

1095
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:06,120
And you've seen.

1096
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,680
There's some shit there that, I'm a vampire right, there's some shit there that freaks

1097
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:11,680
me out.

1098
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:12,680
Damn.

1099
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:13,680
Yeah.

1100
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,680
Some people getting freaky in Berlin.

1101
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:21,480
Freaky animal it's just like there's some so much crazy-ass shit going on true. Was it like that in the 40s the

1102
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,320
40s

1103
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:27,680
Yeah, it kind of went a different way. Yeah, people got fucked up in a different way back then

1104
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:33,400
But it was equally freaky damn that's crazy that it's been freaky that long. Yeah, we've been freaky forever

1105
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,060
Let's do two truths and a lie. Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure

1106
00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:39,760
All right

1107
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,160
Okay

1108
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
Okay, first first thing I'll say

1109
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:53,160
My parents are divorced.

1110
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,160
Second thing, I have over $10 million.

1111
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,160
Third, I have over $12 million.

1112
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,160
Whoa.

1113
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:02,160
Okay.

1114
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,160
I think...

1115
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:10,440
You honestly, like I don't mean to be like psychoanalyzing you and shit, you do not strike

1116
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,760
me as a child of divorce.

1117
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,200
personally that's my guess. How do I tell you? Are you guys gonna guess too?

1118
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:22,560
Yeah you guys should guess. You know what, honestly I don't get that vibe

1119
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:28,360
from you. You seem like a single child, right? You have kind of single child syndrome a little bit.

1120
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:32,480
It leads you to like kind of act out like this crazy way sometimes but I

1121
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:37,280
think that you have like a real good support system or at least you did.

1122
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,600
Yeah, you're probably still like boys with your parents like as an

1123
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,500
adult yeah. That's so that's so you want me to tell you now? Yeah. All right so

1124
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:51,380
truth of the matter is my parents were divorced, are divorced, fucked me up

1125
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:55,180
heavily. I've worked a long time to like try to present this image that you guys

1126
00:51:55,180 --> 00:52:00,260
are seeing. I had hella brothers and sisters I had like 14 they died early

1127
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:07,860
on in my life and so yeah sad but and then the lie you know the lies that I

1128
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,860
I have over 10 million because I have over 12.

1129
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:10,860
Damn!

1130
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,060
So it's not 11, it's over 12.

1131
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,060
Over 12, yeah.

1132
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:15,060
That's big money numbers.

1133
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:17,460
That's still over 10 though, right?

1134
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:20,980
Yeah, I never fucked with math that heavily.

1135
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:21,980
I'm right brain.

1136
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,180
Like reading, like talking.

1137
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,180
Creative stuff.

1138
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:26,180
Creative, yeah.

1139
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,180
That makes sense.

1140
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,180
All right.

1141
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,620
Would you call yourself like a creative?

1142
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,620
Yeah, in a sense.

1143
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,580
Like I never stop creating and I never will.

1144
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,860
A lot of shit I do will never see the light of day.

1145
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:36,860
Really?

1146
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:38,700
art and shit I write in my notebooks.

1147
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:39,700
It's like, that's for me.

1148
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,700
You do poetry?

1149
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,220
I do poetry with just like pictures that I put together.

1150
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,220
Oh, so like visual poetry.

1151
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,220
Damn.

1152
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,220
Wow, I would have never guessed.

1153
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,220
You ever make like a zine?

1154
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:54,780
In the 90s and 80s, when that shit was really tight.

1155
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:58,500
But this like zine revival that's happening now, like people doing zines, it's like the

1156
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,700
internet makes it, just put it on the internet.

1157
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:01,700
True.

1158
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:02,700
You know what I mean?

1159
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:03,700
Yeah, just make it a PDF.

1160
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:04,700
Why do we gotta read all this shit?

1161
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,700
Just blog it.

1162
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,700
Right.

1163
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:12,300
You know you fuck with tumblr. I'm at the cutting edge of every new network that comes out tumblr

vampires or whatever. Damn. That's fucked up. Yeah. It's probably where she's from, right?

1172
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:49,780
Yeah. Different culture there. Different cultures in there. They're taught to fear. Yeah. To

1182
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:35,460
Yeah.

1183
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,980
Right. Yeah. Speaking of what's...

1184
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:38,740
I was like expecting to be scared straight up.

1185
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:39,380
What's your favorite...

1186
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:40,420
I'm sorry, but like...

1187
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:44,420
Yeah, like you could check my, my like, my like blood pressure right now. Like it's...

1188
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:46,180
I can sense it. Like it's normal.

1189
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:48,980
Yeah, it's normal. I mean, I have high blood pressure, but it's normal for me.

1190
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:52,340
Yeah. Yeah. Cause you're like working out, I'm looking at the jewel and all this.

1191
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:54,100
Oh, you notice it? Yeah. You think I'm working out?

1192
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,660
I love that shit.

1193
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,020
You see my pull up bar?

1194
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,500
Yep.

1195
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,940
Yep. You know, I do work on that.

1196
00:54:57,940 --> 00:54:58,980
That's awesome, man.

1197
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:02,260
Speaking of blood, what's your favorite blood type?

1198
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:06,180
Favorite blood type? That's a question I get all the time.

1199
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,940
Type O negative, A, B.

1200
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,140
I would guess O negative because it's rare.

1201
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,540
You know what? It all tastes like... I don't have type sensors.

1202
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:16,620
You don't have a good palate?

1203
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,620
It tastes like blood. Everything tastes like blood.

1204
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,340
You've been eating it for fucking thousands of years.

1205
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,940
Diet has changed some of the taste.

1206
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:26,540
There's a little richer now or there's a little more...

1207
00:55:26,540 --> 00:55:27,540
You know what I mean?

1208
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,500
But yeah, I wouldn't say I have a preference.

1209
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,300
I like do hate to kill people and do that.

1210
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,800
But I gotta do it.

1211
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,960
Do you like, are you scared about like microplastics in blood now?

1212
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,840
My doctor has asked me about that and said like that's something I should watch out for.

1213
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,220
But like I haven't noticed.

1214
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,440
I mean it's gotta be better than like when like polio was coming up and shit.

1215
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,140
Like that must have been some nasty blood.

1216
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,640
I had a lot of scares with different diseases through the years.

1217
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,440
Like the crazy diseases.

1218
00:55:54,440 --> 00:56:00,560
but I've been you know you can't kill me yeah I'm really not in the end and if you

1219
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:04,160
did kill me I'd welcome that shit cuz I'm to be honest I'm tired of being

1220
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:11,240
alive yeah damn yeah that's like that's I like that's it but that's not sad or

1221
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,600
anything yeah I've been here for so long that it's like when's this gonna be when

1222
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:19,440
we let's wrap this up yeah yeah it's hard to hear from a hero of mine you

1223
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,120
know yeah I hope I never make it to that point yeah it's like understand but I

1224
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:28,160
I get it. Circumstances like... People just have a hard time understanding other people's

1225
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:31,000
stories. That's how I feel.

1226
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:35,920

1228
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,600

00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,920
Sure.

1230
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:52,640
