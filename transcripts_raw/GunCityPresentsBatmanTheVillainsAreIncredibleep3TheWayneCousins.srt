00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Last Time in Gun City presents Batman the Villains are Incredible

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:07,620
We left off with the evil demon man giving Mr.

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,520
Wonderful some instructions on what to do ahead of the parenting parade and now here is the thrilling conclusion of our campaign

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,040
Enjoy

5
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,880
My god that was almost so fucking bad it wasn't at all

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:25,120
It's a completely empty can but if it was a full can it was a full can when I tipped over Batman voice

7
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
It would have fried

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,320
Got it, okay

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,800
The parade is supposed to celebrate Gotham's Living Parents' Day.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,120
Celebrate all the parents who are alive, in honor of famous Gotham citizen Bruce Wade

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,760
whose parents are dead.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,320
All parents, good or bad, ugly or hot, ride on top of floats that celebrate, coaching little

13
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,040
league games and helping you with your homework, installing a latch key or having the talk,

14
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,720
anything that still living parents do. The raid takes place at night, because that was

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:10,200
when Bruce Wayne's parents were murdered. And Gotham wants to show all the parents murderers

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,880
out there that the night does not fear them. Or wait, hold on. I wrote that completely wrong.

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,960
That the parents don't fear the night. That's crazy how wrong that is. And that parent murderers

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,420
should instead fear the night wow okay cool dude okay, because that is when

19
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,660
parents who are still alive or at their most powerful

20
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,580
night yeah night. Oh, because that's when they watch flight of the concords

21
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,760
and they close the attic door.

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,660
I've not had a single thought about that

23
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,180
(laughing)

24
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,180
in like a long enough time that's making me aware of my age.

25
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,980
Commissioner Gordon, who if you remember is Filipino,

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,860
watches over the proceedings intently.

27
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,060
His ever vigilant Gotham City Police Squad

28
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,780
patrolling for any dubious villains.

29
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,460
- Yeah, and you see people as you're walking by,

30
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:15,420
they're saying happy parenting to you,

31
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,140
and a wonderful parents day celebration to you.

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,040
and yeah, it's a whole parade and all those floats I described or Batman

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,120
described are going on and the scary guy voice.

34
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:38,840
A squall. Well, that's going to be pretty confusing because I already carry

35
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,060
around a lot of scrolls, so I don't know that I...

36
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,300
The blue one?

37
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,980
No, it can't be the blue one.

38
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,180
is it the right one?

39
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:57,500
No, this can't base can't be it. No, I just remembered I got this another time,

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,960
which one what color was it

41
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,720
oh, I have like ten green ones

42
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,240
forest. Oh, you should have said that from the beginning yeah, yeah, wait, no,

43
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:16,240
no, I got I got it. I got it. I got it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

44
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:23,620
So what I need you to do is go on top of the tallest float, which should be the latchkey one.

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,620
Because they turn the latchkey vertical.

46
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:33,620
And then I need you to read the scroll out loud and then you will have control of the crowd.

47
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,620
And then you will lead them to the manor.

48
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,620
And when Gotham...

49
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,620
When Batman arrives at the manor, Gotham will be ours.

50
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:54,020
worse. Okay, all right, okay, okay, okay. So yeah, there's a number of

51
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:57,480
different ways you can try to climb up this float. I mean, is there a ladder

52
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,300
on it? No.

53
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:04,460
You should climb up the... It's a first. Well, I can levitate 99 feet. You

54
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,000
have to have your claws, right? Yeah, but I also established in the first

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,180
one that I can levitate really high. Yeah. Did we establish that? Oh, we

56
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,200
So I guess I'll just do that, but no, I'll use the disc.

57
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,200
No, you don't have to use that. You can use your levitation.

58
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,200
No, that was kind of like nothing.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Keep in mind though that Gotham's cops are around,

60
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,200
and they will be beatboxing and also looking for you.

61
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,200
Stop. Come on. People got to hear this.

62
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,200
Okay, I use the disc.

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I do the disc.

64
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,700
very cool.

65
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:46,300
Describe to everybody at home tensors floating disc. Well, first of all,

66
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:55,520
it makes a disc that I can fly up to five hundred pounds or I can be up to

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,780
five hundred pounds. What I'm on it. What do you mean? You can fly up to five

68
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:03,040
hundred. What do you mean? You can be five hundred pounds. It holds five

69
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,100
hundred pounds. Okay, so why do you say I can be five of your summarizing? I

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:10,360
because there's a whole paragraph. I'm trying to read. I skip to the number.

71
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,600
Well, okay, three feet. It's one inch thick as well. You should cast the spell

72
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,780
of unending fatness and then get on it.

73
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,800
I didn't give you that spell. I'm sorry. Maybe I could. I didn't give that

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,280
spell. I'll cast minor illusion then to become honey boo boo. So I think it's

75
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,760
very fat. Cast the spell to become honey boo boo's mom. I appear 501 pounds.

76
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,960
That's too much now. But that's what I appear. Oh, I see. People are like,

77
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,560
I was doing that yeah yeah, they said that disc only holds five hundred.

78
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,340
This can only fly five hundred, but he looks about five hundred and one or oh,

79
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:44,900
I can't

80
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:51,260
I don't know. I don't know if this can go up. It can't it can't go up. I don't

81
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,880
think so. Oh, well, why do you tell me to use it? It can't go up more than ten

82
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,220
feet. I want people

83
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:02,360
what the hell are you doing? I just saw he pointed it at his head and then it

84
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,760
fell over. So how tall is this thing? I mean, I can just climb it.

85
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,100
Yeah, it's a couple. I'll roll to just climb a hundred feet. Okay, you got

86
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:13,000
well, so keep in mind, though, there are again, there are cops around. So

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,540
if you right, so can I

88
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,540
there's an illusion make me look like a key repair man.

89
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:23,640
Or what if you do an illusion to make yourself look like, I mean, you can

90
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,100
also go up buildings and then jump out of a window. You can try to talk

91
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,740
to somebody. There's lots of things you can do. Just be Batman.

92
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,900
Okay, well, I guess I'll go talk go first first things first. I'm going to go to

93
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,260
the float okay and

94
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,180
I'm still disguised as Mark Cuban, too. I never took that off. No, you never took

95
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,260
off your mark. So

96
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:48,060
I'm Mark Cuban from TV and I need to get up on your float at the highest point.

97
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,760
We're filming a show and I need to bring this camera

98
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,680
and I look around

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,800
and then I go like this

100
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,740
to the top of your float roll moral talking.

101
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,340
No,

102
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,340
can nobody see that

103
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,040
I can't do my glasses.

104
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,440
Three

105
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,340
that's a three guys like you're acting extremely strange. I'm not

106
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:25,340
going to let you near the float. Okay, does this change your mind and

107
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:29,740
I pull up to be Pluto TV on my phone and I pull up Shark Tank episodes

108
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,900
and I'm pointing and showing

109
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:37,620
it's just I'm sure right now. Okay, I can't fast for you can't fast forward on

110
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,420
Pluto TV. It's like live cable and then an ad break starts for the ice all yeah

111
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:48,420
yeah. Oh what hold on let me one second. Sd Johnson, I'm looking at it. I'm

112
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,120
screenshotting all of the the ads and check that out later

113
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,100
BAM and I

114
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,580
Batman villain style

115
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:00,720
all right roll roll your melee attack. Okay,

116
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:09,980
with my oh that's a dirty twenty yeah. You cold cock this guy roll damage

117
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:16,340
nine damage nice. Yeah, he's not out cold. Okay, then I start climbing and I

118
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,980
put on an illusion to look like him.

119
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:24,380
hold on or that's how my illusion works. It's not how it works. I quite let me

120
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:28,580
read this actually a couple of the cops are starting to stir though nearby. They

121
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,380
might have heard that a little bit. Okay, then I'd

122
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:37,260
so you just knocked out a guy who right okay. I was going to take a different

123
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,420
approach for the illusion. I'm going to use an illusion on the float to make it

124
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,980
look like a ladder, so it's normal that I'm climbing it.

125
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,660
now the minor illusion has about how much how much how big is your can your

126
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,540
illusion be again doesn't say of an oh you create

127
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,340
a bit of five you just create a sound or image of an object it doesn't say it

128
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,380
thirty feet doesn't say a size at all that's definitely it's not thirty feet

129
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,140
distance but it doesn't say any size that's thirty one feet big there's no

130
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,580
way you can make a fucking ladder with minor illusion maybe read it there's no

131
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,140
restrictions on it at all anything under under a hundred dollars should be yeah

132
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,180
you should be able to make.

133
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,740
It's a cheap letter. It's a rope letter to shitty lighter. It's a shitty ladder,

134
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,620
but it's a ladder. It's the ropes course from Jim

135
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:27,020
God damn it.

136
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,540
I hate this fuck. Oh and I'm also going to cast protection from evil on myself

137
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,340
and if the cops can shoot me, you're saying something

138
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:42,100
I'm saying bullets. I'm saying cops kill the guns, kill people, no cop cops. You

139
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,740
know what I'm saying? You said gobs

140
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,460
so you said

141
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,560
I'm a fake ladder. You're climbing a fake like Gotham. How long does that

142
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,400
last again? One minute damn it there's no way I got to

143
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,920
somebody call me. I'm not going to I could do something so crazy. Somebody

144
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,660
somebody call me. I there's not that what I just want to know how wrong I am

145
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,040
right now. What am I doing wrong, but can you seriously tell me that a ladder

146
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,260
is that crazy? That's not breaking nothing crazy about it. That's not even

147
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,720
going to work. That's what's driving me. I'm going to be mad at me. All right,

148
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:17,360
tell me of a ladder, no and a sign and a game thing be on side that says it's

149
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,780
okay

150
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:24,580
I just want to get I'm ready. The cop is trying to stir your going to start

151
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,040
climbing and we're going to cut to

152
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:34,500
the cook. So he forgot my name, the could know I didn't know. I didn't want to

153
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,040
wait for the sound to know he was going to say the chef. No, it was not Curtis

154
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,120
or something. I was going to say Curtis. You didn't even know Curtis, the cook

155
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,900
Get that gun out of my face. Stop.

156
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
Stop with the gun.

157
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,200
The butt is even scarier if you've seen action movies.

158
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,600
That's true, but you could go by Curtis the Cook.

159
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,800
No, I'm just the cook.

160
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm not trying to blame you. You and Sullivan are singing Paralyzer by Finger 11.

161
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,400
Can we sing a different song?

162
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,600
No, no.

163
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,300
Okay, sorry.

164
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,600
Yeah.

165
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,900
I'm trying to make you go to bed.

166
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,800
There's a lullaby.

167
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:12,900
I'm not paralyzed, but I seem to be struck by you.

168
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,060
When roll dexterity, sorry,

169
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,300
roll a balance bing ball saving balance bing ball.

170
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,420
Just roll the blue one.

171
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,900
It's like you need some real life.

172
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,900
Roll the big ball.

173
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
Caleb, there's already one in there.

174
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,460
Just roll that one.

175
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,820
Caleb, there's already shut up, bro.

176
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,980
Shut the fuck up.

177
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,700
And that was a fucking with my balance bing ball.

178
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,700
that is still just a eight. Okay, cool.

179
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Blue one would have rolled higher.

180
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,700
The blue one rolled me a twenty on my first roll. I don't want your stinky blue dice.

181
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,700
A chef's knife flies by you and slices you across the cheek.

182
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,700
You take four damage. Or what?

183
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,700
Four heart? Sorry, you take four heart. I lose four heart?

184
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,700
You lose four heart from the heart number. Okay, I'm at

185
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,700
one heart.

186
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,700
Whoa, mine is half down.

187
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:12,540
Oh yeah, because you took damage at when we left Arkham.

188
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,540
Don't even remember.

189
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,540
I remember that.

190
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,060
Didn't you get, you got hit by like a bug?

191
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,060
I guess.

192
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,060
What?

193
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,060
He got hit by something.

194
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,060
I don't think it was a bug.

195
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
I don't think it was a bug.

196
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
What happens?

197
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,620
And also, wait, a chef's knife, what is this, my twin?

198
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,620
Oh my god.

199
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,620
It is I.

200
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,620
Oh, it's my twin.

201
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,620
Sous Chef.

202
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,620
God fucking damn it.

203
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,220
God fucking damn it.

204
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,520
He's done.

205
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,620
You thought you were done with me, did you not?

206
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,820
Yeah.

207
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,120
Yeah, honestly.

208
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,120
Yeah, I thought that I was done with you.

209
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,120
You thought, oh, I don't not need him anymore.

210
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,520
I do not need my sous chef.

211
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,920
Well, that's exactly why you can barely speak.

212
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
And now you talk to frogs instead of cooking and eating them.

213
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,620
Talk to frogs?

214
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,420
This is a, I'm trying to, this baby.

215
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,020
I'm trying to, I'm trying to go to sleep.

216
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,320
Yeah, you need to chill, Su.

217
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,120
You gotta keep it down, Frenchie.

218
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,120
Oi.

219
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:05,060
he gets mad about that. Oh yeah, so mad that he called him French. He could have

220
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,880
called him a frog.

221
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,060
Yeah, it's all been solving in the end of the suit. You have to have the same

222
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:10,860
realization about

223
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,520
it's like you're like kind of like oh yeah, there was a

224
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:22,200
could have done a thing here like a moment. He's like no, it is my time for

225
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,440
revenge and revenge is a dish best served with you dead.

226
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,080
That's another reason why I didn't like you being my sidekick.

227
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,080
Shut up. Roll the initiative.

228
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,080
Your lines are bad.

229
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Roll initiative.

230
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,080
Exclamation point?

231
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,080
Sorry, roll exclamation point.

232
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
I got a three.

233
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,080
Roll bang.

234
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Okay.

235
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
Alright.

236
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,080
Sorry.

237
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,080
Alright, what'd you say? You got a three?

238
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,080
Yeah.

239
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,080
Okay.

240
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,080
Sous Chef is going to go first, unfortunately.

241
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,080
I don't care.

242
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,080
Sullivan's kind of sleepy, though.

243
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,080
Shouldn't a sous chef wait and listen to the head chef?

244
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,080
Well this is the proving grounds.

245
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
This is topsy turvy world.

246
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,080
This is chef vs sous chef.

247
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,080
Chefs or sous chefs can do whatever they want in Gotham.

248
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,080
Now that Batman has taken the law into his own hands.

249
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,080
Patrick is fully out of frame.

250
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,080
Disgusting.

251
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,080
I don't know why that keeps happening.

252
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:16,080
Patrick is slipping out.

253
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,080
He's addicted to leaving frame.

254
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,080
I've taken which.

255
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,080
He learned.

256
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,080
There he is.

257
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,080
You have taught me.

258
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,080
I think he hit the frame.

259
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,360
I have the master the gumball better than you ever could. Oh yeah, fuck you.

260
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,760
Bro, you don't have to cook gumballs at all, you just chew them.

261
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,480
I don't know what kind of master chef bullshit you're doing now,

262
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,680
what kind of Michelin star gumball you're making.

263
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,760
That would be so good. A Michelin star gumball?

264
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,240
He takes out... Because you know it would have flavor the whole time, all day.

265
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,480
We're thinking of Willy Wonka. And it would be rosemary flavored.

266
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,680
No, I'm thinking of a Michelin star gumball.

267
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,440
And it would have a rosemary flavor to it.

268
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,880
Somebody should do a...

269
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
They should have done a Chef's Table episode.

270
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,600
Oh my God, yes.

271
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,320
They should have done a Chef's Table episode about Willy Wonka.

272
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Yeah.

273
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Oh.

274
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,200
We should do a Willy Wonka campaign.

275
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,640
Stop it.

276
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
He turns invisible.

277
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Oh, he's gone.

278
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
Thank God.

279
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,640
All right.

280
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,640
Back to burping.

281
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,240
Ha, I am not gone.

282
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,240
My conscience?

283
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,240
No, no.

284
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,920
final my calm. My God, your come is that my come talking my come is talking

285
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,240
your come. Let me guess you want to get out. No, I'm I'm now know where he is by

286
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,760
the way. Yeah, because he's talking

287
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,660
he's like a little bit off to the left. It's your turn. Okay, I'm going to use

288
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,600
my gumbo to teach him a little lesson about gumballs. Okay, you have some

289
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:51,520
gumbos stored up to? I have fortifying broth. You have speedy, spedy. So sorry,

290
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,900
yeah. So you can do that or you can cook up a new gumbo and then use it. Are the

291
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:01,740
gumbos, do they, are any of them like instantly damaging type gumbos? Some of

292
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,960
them will, some of them will like be like, can be like poison that you can

293
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,860
apply with a knife or something and then it's random. I'm going to take my

294
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,780
chances. Any gumbo you're going to roll the dice will be instantly damaging.

295
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,100
(claps)

296
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,600
- That's a 10. - Cheese.

297
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,100
- Cheese. - Cheese.

298
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,980
- Cheese.

299
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,980
- Nice, okay.

300
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,980
Insatiable hunger.

301
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,900
The cook prepares a dish that induces intense hunger

302
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,100
in all creatures within a 30 foot radius.

303
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,860
Each affected creature must make a DC 14 wisdom saving throw

304
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,700
or spend its next turn consuming any available food--

305
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,460
- I use it. - Or rations within reach,

306
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,540
taking no other action.

307
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,500
- That includes Sullivan.

308
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,060
- I use that. - Does consume.

309
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:39,900
- Does include Sullivan. - That's fine.

310
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,980
There's plenty of burp on my--

311
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,720
plenty of bird that he can eat. Okay. Sullivan passes.

312
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,320
The chef does not. The sous chef does not.

313
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,760
I'm so hungry. Well, how about you eat your fucking gumball bitch? No,

314
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,000
I do not want to eat my gumball. Well, if you know,

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,240
here I'll make, I'll make you something. If you just start,

316
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,280
stop being invisible. No, no, no, no, no. You have to eat it.

317
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,960
It's the rules of my dice. It's the rules of your dice.

318
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,760
Can't he just make himself his own food? He's a sous chef. He's only a sous chef.

319
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,120
He has to follow orders. He panics. He doesn't know recipes. Yeah, exactly.

320
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,920
And he eats his knife and he takes six damage. Oh, shit. Oh, God.

321
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:32,680
You are a moron. No, you do this to me. Okay. And it's back to you. Okay.

322
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,460
Okay, so you've been terrorizing the people there and it's time.

323
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,960
Oh, I've just been voice.

324
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,660
Should I point it out of a window or?

325
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,160
Yeah, you're doing well.

326
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,060
It's it's a side Batman.

327
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,260
Hey, man.

328
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,960
How you doing man?

329
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,060
If I can bring you in a bit man fucking shit.

330
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:57,060
What have you done man?

331
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,860
I don't even know man.

332
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,760
I just picked up this shit from the girls room.

333
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,160
You first of all you then I went downstairs.

334
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,120
I don't know. I just I forgot your power. This is gonna. I've been just showing it

335
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,920

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,440
He would lose his mind.

365
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,440
Why did you kill the mayor?

366
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,440
No! The mayor! He's my friend!

367
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,440
And then I say, "Follow me, come look at the mayor."

368
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,440

Wait, hold on.

374
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
He laughed.

375
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
I'm scaring my voice. Okay, okay, stop.

376
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,440
I'm showing Batman my tongue, my sober tongue.

377
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:27,140
you need to give up. I remember do not. I have a plan and I'm trying to make him

378
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:32,020
go back to the other room right now. Okay, so I'll let you do your thing go

379
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,940

380
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,260
your dash. You just run sixty feet. You go back around and you go back into the

381
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,980
room and that's actually a good cue because we're back to you. You're

382
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,880
climbing the ladder. That was his dash sound, so we'll need another one.

383
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:53,580
okay, you're like sixty feet up now at this point, and so some of the cops are

384
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,460
trying to notice you.

385
00:20:54,460 --> 00:21:00,060

He's going to try to do his worst. I don't give a shit. Do chef.

518
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:31,460
Do chef. He has another 12 damage to you.

519
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,300
Whatever. All right.

520
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:39,780
You're up to, this is like the, I haven't hit him for anything. Yeah.

521
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:42,820
This is a real, okay. I'm gonna use my cleaver again. Go for it.

522
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,440
There's no way I get another two.

523
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,840
- You're gonna get something good.

524
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,680
- Yes!

525
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,680
- What'd you get?

526
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,600
- A 23.

527
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,960
- That absolutely hits.

528
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,800
- Okay, 2D6 plus four.

529
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,640
- Yes.

530
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,840
- 13.

531
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,880
- Describe your kill.

532
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,700
- Oh!

533
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,160
- Wait, wait, wait, before you describe your kill,

534
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,000
check this out.

535
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,680
- Like Batman.

536
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,520
- Oh, that's me hurting him.

537
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,680
- When they beat them up, when they beat,

538
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,840
ooh, ah!

539
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,840
Well, well, well.

540
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,840
No, please! I underestimated you.

541
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
You just missed so many times.

542
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
Those were distractions.

543
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
So that I could hit you with the final blow.

544
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,840
I would have thought that you'd learned from me.

545
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,840
And you would know that this was my signature move.

546
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
But I guess you're just too fucking stupid.

547
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
I guess I am. I'm stupid.

548
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
So I'm gonna ask you one thing.

549
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
Okay.

550
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,840
Hand over your apron and your knife.

551
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
You're chopped.

552
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Oh, that wasn't...

553
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:45,720
God damn the question that was sick. He didn't ask me anything. He asked you to

554
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,400
hand over. I asked you to and don't be a bit. Okay, here's my command. You say

555
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,680
like I'm gonna ask you to hand this over. That's not nice. Something the

556
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:58,280
same. He's something hand over your knife in your apron. You're chopped.

557
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:03,560
It's that simple. Be pedantic. You're 86. Get the fuck out and you kill him. No,

558
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:08,280
I don't kill him. Oh, you just taste 86. Oh, that's so much worse. Yeah, he's

559
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,380
not a chef anymore.

560
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:15,520
He like shrivels up to the left

561
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:23,420
what happened. Oh man, you de chef to don't worry little one. I won't thanks

562
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,240
for saving us. I throw him like a football

563
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:35,960
cool. We're back to you. You're fighting a batman into this into the room.

564
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,620
She's on fire with the girl. Is she dead?

565
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,980
She's not dead.

566
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,580
Okay. So I have an opportunity to hide.

567
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,620
Actually, sorry, I just realized the thing you didn't notice.

568
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,340
Roll dexterity saving throw.

569
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,740
What symbol is that?

570
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,480
Sorry, roll balance ball.

571
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,380
God, I'm so bad at this. I'm sorry.

572
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,420
You can move this. This can move around.

573
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,980
It's clipped onto this.

574
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,340
It's not like moving it will change.

575
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,980
Well, I can't move like my chair.

576
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,860
Yeah, that is a 20.

577
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,580
OK, no.

578
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:17,340
What is it? I was I almost 17 plus whatever you

579
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:20,780
oh wait, 17 plus balance ball was balance ball.

580
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:23,180
That actually is a dirty 19 again.

581
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:27,740
OK, you see at the corner, I

582
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,660
what looks like the mayor's daughter inside of hamster ball.

583
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,660
And she's rolling towards you and you get out of the way just in time.

584
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:42,260
She had a hamster ball. Wait, is she the hungry hamster?

585
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,260
She's hungry to

586
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:48,260
hamsterina. That's right. Wow. Damn. Yeah.

587
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:55,260
Oh my goodness.

588
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,660
She's Greta the Hamsterita and she says, "Ah, damn it! I almost got you!"

589
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:01,660
And see Batman...

590
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,660
Hungry... Hey, Hungrita!

591
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,660
Batman.

592
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,660
Wait, is she good or bad?

593
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,340
She's against you. She's trying to kill you.

594
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:11,220
But is she against me in the same way that the sous-chef was against him, where they

595
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,060
used to be partners? Or is she...

596
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,660
No, she's partners with Batman.

597
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,660
Fuck! Okay.

598
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,780
She's like a catwoman, but she's Hungrita the Hungra.

599
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:24,140
But catwoman also has bad moments.

600
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:26,700
where she's a bad a bad kitty. Yes

601
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:36,480

602
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,800

603
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,380

604
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,240
but yeah,

605
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,480
so

606
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,700
did we have a history?

607
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,940
My boss won't let me be. Does she stank?

608
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:54,580
but she's thinking I don't know man. Yeah, she's pretty gross. Do we have an

00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:25,740
Rambler and she's like yeah. Well, we sort of and then I turn around and then

615
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:31,940
I take off the skin on my face and I turned a batman with the gun and now I

616
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,880
reveal my true identity.

617
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:46,020
I've been the Rambler the whole time. Wait, I knew

618
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,980
*laughter*

619
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,980
This is fucking with my head in real life.

620
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,900
*laughter*

621
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:58,980
I've been the- I've been the rambler this entire time, Batman, and you were none the wiser.

622
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:04,900
Now, me and Hungry- oh, and let- no, we're not, 'cause she is on your side right now,

623
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,340
because I've done- gone and killed her father.

624
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,840
*laughter*

625
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,340
That's right, you did!

626
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:10,840
How could you?

627
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,840
By accident,

628
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:15,220
I put a flashlight on his face.

629
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,780
It was not by accident, I know it wasn't, 'cause I'm a girl now!

630
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,160
What?

631
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,940
Sorry, I was just noticing my voice.

632
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,940
No, she knows it wasn't an accident.

633
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:25,820
There's no way.

634
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:29,820
Well, I was in disguise as a French diplomat.

635
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,060
[laughter]

636
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,060
So I had to do what he would do.

637
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,180
Role talking.

638
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,180
Role talking with advantage.

639
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,380
Oh wait, no, a Mong- Mongolian?

640
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:50,080
Man of Mark and however you say it Monica Monica Monica gay skin a

641
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,880

642
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,480
But now I've been I'm in my true form the Rambler.

643
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,880
What do you get on the and I got to

644
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:00,180
don't look at it.

645
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:03,380
14 cells can see 14 plus my talking.

646
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,980
So that's an 18.

647
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,380
You roll again by way of advantage.

648
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:07,880
Okay,

649
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,780

It's a Batman says

653
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:29,300
no, it can't be true. It's all true baby. Yeah,

654
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:33,100
I can't believe this.

655
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:37,260
What are we going to do hungry to hungry to

656
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:44,820

know we need to stop you. We're gonna stop you right now. I'm just gonna go roll initiative.

658
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,340
You bitch.

659
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:58,980
Dang it. Just put it in the account or no, no, no, put it in the box. Just roll it. 17

661
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,260
that anyway. She really is the only one who has to roll initiative.

662
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,540
When in Rome, what you get?

663
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,040
Seven.

664
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,060
Dumb bitch. All right.

665
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,460
So, okay.

666
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,140
God damn it.

667
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,340
All right. You're up.

668
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,580
Okay. First thing I'm going to do.

00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:22,500
So all three of you are kind of like upstairs by where her room is in the

670
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,060
manor.

671
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:28,140
So do my attacks like Babble Blast, is that a, that's like a, is it like a cone

672
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,540
of damage?

673
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,580
It's an area of effect.

674
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,460
I am just...

675
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,020
Not an area of effect, but it's a cone. Yes.

676
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:40,540
with my babble blast. I am going to look at them with the gun. I'm going to point it and

677
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,700
then I'm just going to start reciting the entirety of the great Gatsby for memory.

678
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,620
Oh man, how much does the Rambo remember of it?

679
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:54,460
Roll brain.

680
00:37:54,460 --> 00:38:00,460
That looks like a three. That's a three minus one, so that's a two. So I'm just going.

681
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:05,960
Full score and seven years ago I was the great Gatsby, baby.

682
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,960
Yeah.

683
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,860
What does it say for what I have to roll?

684
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,300
What I have to roll?

685
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,800
What you have to roll?

686
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
3d6?

687
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,300
No, no, the middle one.

688
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,580
It'll be the middle number.

689
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,580
3d6?

690
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,580
You mean 36?

691
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:20,580
Wisdom 14.

692
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,580
So DC wisdom 14.

693
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:24,580
Okay, they're going to roll against that.

694
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,140
Okay, the bat does well.

695
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,300
And Greta does not.

696
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
What happens to her?

697
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,220
3d6 damage? Yeah. Oh, she fucked.

698
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:39,140
Well, she's already damaged cause I lit her on fire. Yeah.

699
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:42,420
All right. She's not looking too good. So she hears it.

700
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:46,020
She's like, Oh God, it's like our arguments again. Oh,

701
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,660
all our fights when we were, were we dating? Were we an item? You're,

702
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,420
you're sort of in charge of this.

703
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,620
I don't really remember most of my life.

704
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,980
Ah, you're so fucking thoughtless.

705
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,180
He's like aloof.

706
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,500
He is. It is.

707
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,140
It is.

708
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,140
Aloof is my middle name.

709
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,340
That wasn't your voice though when we were dating.

710
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,020
What was my name again?

711
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,060
Manor.

712
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,260
Manor Aloof Dilfroy.

713
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,980
So you think your name.

714
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,420
My name is Manor Aloof Dilfroy.

715
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,020
So I'm revealing my identity.

716
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,820
And I work at Kinko's.

717
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:28,220
All right. Yeah. So, yeah, no, you did a lot of damage to her.

718
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,940
but now it's the Batman's turn. Whoa.

719
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,820
This is why he can't wear the glasses.

720
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,740
He keeps missing it.

721
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,860
I know I want it to be seen by the world.

722
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,620
All right. So Batman, Batman has to go to attack you.

723
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:44,660
He misses. He goes, he tried to like, just do his like a Arkham,

724
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Arkham city kind of combo. I'm doing this.

725
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:53,020
You're doing what? What was the first one?

726
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,620
That's me touching him.

727
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,620
Yeah. Pink Panther dodges.

728
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,620
- Panther dodges. - You're like, "Whoa!"

729
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,120
- Yeah, right, yeah. Okay.

730
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:02,120
He's gonna try again. He misses again.

731
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Just like whiffing completely.

732
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:08,120
- He did the same exact moves twice in a row!

733
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,120
- Your dodging abilities have only improved since I put you in that asylum.

734
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,120
- And that's why they called me the Rambler, because I ramble around.

735
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,120
[laughter]

736
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,120
Like a dust buddy.

737
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,120
[laughter]

738
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,120
- Or a tumbleweed. - It's her turn now.

739
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,920
So she's going to try to roll up at you again.

740
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,880
She's going to try and roll.

741
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,680
She's trying to charge.

742
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,320
That is

743
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,280
she's charging.

744
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,640
What has gotten into you?

745
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,600
She's changed my whole identity.

746
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,640
Like a jiggly puff and smash.

747
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,080
And she's got which so and she's going to try to attack you and she misses.

748
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,920
But she's going to do a good.

749
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,200
But she comes back around.

750
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,440
You rolled all saving throw or second attack.

751
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,680
I started bouncing ball.

752
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,560
Is that you can't see that, Caleb?

753
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,080
You got to look at that.

754
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,720
Well, no, wait, you show me the dice.

755
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,060
show the dice cam.

756
00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:00,700
You kind of like really look, I think it's a problem when it just goes in

757
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,000
this corner, so you just stop rolling into that corner.

758
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,300
All right, so I screwed.

759
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,560
I screwed.

760
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,580
So I screwed.

761
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:08,800
You take seven damage.

762
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,920
Seven, yeah, it's not bad, it's only 25.

763
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:11,780
Cool.

764
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,800
So I screwed.

765
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,700
Story of my college life.

766
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,880
Let's get back to you.

767
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,380
All the way back, all the way, literally before I was even in school.

768
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,760
what's what's happening.

769
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,360
What's happening to you right? I told school literally when I was being

770
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,500
babysat as a baby, my in my middle school teacher, middle store, middle

771
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:37,720
school, whenever I went into any store in my childhood, I was eating pussy me

772
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,600
with my dentist

773
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:43,040
me with my dentist, me with my doctor,

774
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,600
me with everyone who lived on my street, I'm up at a zigzag across the street

775
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,440
and I was boning them and doing them and I was boning them and doing them hard

776
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,200
boning. So

777
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:02,720
literally five bonings a day. Pause here on this. Let's just pause. You never

778
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,080
said anything gay. Yeah. No. He was just talking about how much he would jizz

779
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,840
inside of women and bone them. I was boning women. From jizz. How long?

780
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:13,520
Jizzing in them.

781
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,240
Okay. Now, the first thing I actually want to address

782
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,820

791
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,580
Cause they eat the fucking children.

792
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,080
So he still did a really good job.

793
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Hamsters eat their kids.

794
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,080
We should have stopped at I don't practice hamsteria.

795
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,080
Hamsters eat their children.

796
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:05,080
I don't run inside a ball.

797
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,080
He said live, they don't live in a ball.

798
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:11,080
But I was trying to think of I don't have no, and I was trying to think of what that

799
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,080
water bottle.

800
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:14,080
I don't have no water bottle.

801
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,080
I don't have no running ball.

802
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:21,480
So, Mr. Wonderful, you are up on the parade.

803
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,480
I'm a cage.

804
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,480
You're completely, you lost it.

805
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,480
It's too tall.

806
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,480
You are at the parade right now.

807
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,680
The parade has now at this point become a full mob of people rating you highly on Uber,

808
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,560
marching towards the Peaches Manor.

809
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:35,800
You could see the manor in the distance now.

810
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:39,800
It's like not, it's like, you know, it's pretty close by.

811
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,640
I heard that if you get like a high enough rating on Uber, they could send you a golden

812
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:44,640
car.

813
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,640
I heard that too.

814
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,360
as a driver. So really how most over drivers, how high is that rating?

815
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,600
That's too heavy. My rating. I'm checking my phone. What's my rating?

816
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,200
Can I roll

817
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:59,640
to see my rating? You have to roll. Can I roll five stars first ever six

818
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,800
star? Well, I want to try and get more than five. Max is five. Yeah. So

819
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,040
what are you gonna try to do? I just want to know if there's a good

820
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:13,440
rules. This must be this must be this. There can't be any other Uber driver

821
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,040
in the world. Who is having the experience I'm having right now? You

822
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,240
can't look me in the eye and

823
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,200
calls your phone

824
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,440

I'm also writing in a car made of all the people

829
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:51,600
what you're not writing up. You're on top of a parade float right now. It's

830
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:52,400
made of a latch.

831
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:59,440

You're chilling with Sullivan right now. What are you guys doing?

You guys killed Sous Chef.

838
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,080
You're just standing by the button that releases the animals, which I think...

839
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:22,780
Smoking weed.

840
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:26,080
Is everything in here was, would we say it was dogs and humans?

841
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,180
It's dogs and bugs.

842
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:27,980
And bugs.

843
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:28,580
And humans.

844
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:29,980
Dogs and bugs and humans are in here.

845
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,780
Screaming humans.

846
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,280
Yeah.

847
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,080
So, yeah, I mean, you're just chilling in here and you're smoking weed, you said?

848
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,000
I mean, I actually don't think Sullivan could probably smoke weed. I think he might get...

849
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,240
I don't know. What's Sullivan... What is he like doing? We're just killing time, right?

850
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,240
Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

851
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,240
Yeah. So...

852
00:45:49,240 --> 00:45:50,240
You guys are probably playing...

853
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,640
And I don't know that I hate him yet, so...

854
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,380
Yeah, you're probably playing war.

855
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,480
I'm down to play war. I'll play war with Sullivan.

856
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:56,480
What about Rummy?

857
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:58,640
Rummy's too complicated for Sullivan.

858
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,280
Yeah, definitely. Also, not as good of a two-player game.

859
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,360
Would be good, yeah, but then you can just tell him... You can make up your rules as

860
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,040
you go along and can confuse him.

861
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:08,400
- Do you start to realize he's a bit of a mark?

862
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,960
Like when you start playing cards together?

863
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

864
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,080
- He's a W-A-R.

865
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,160
- Sullivan, I have a really fun game we could play.

866
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:14,980
- Oh, what?

867
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,820
- Do you have three cups?

868
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:18,560
- I can go get them, hold on.

869
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,400
- And he goes to the back room.

870
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,200
- Say the game is called Fuck the Frog.

871
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:22,920
- He comes back with three cups.

872
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:24,680
- One of them's a different size than the other one.

873
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:25,500
Is that okay?

874
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,040
- That works, and do you have a ball?

875
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:29,560
- Hold on.

876
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,400
- And he goes back to the room.

877
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,880
- I crumbled up a piece of paper.

878
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,720
- That works too.

879
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,560
- Oh, awesome, okay.

880
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,640
- Do you, wait, actually, do you have one more ball?

881
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,340
Okay, I crumbled up a different just in case. I need an extra yeah. I crumbled up

882
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,300
two pieces. Okay, amazing. This game is called fuck the frog. Okay, so I'm going

883
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,680
to put one, so I'm going to put one. How much money do you have? I got like

884
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,600
three hundred dollars. Okay, let's bet three hundred bucks to start. I love

885
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:55,520
telling my friends how much money I have. Yeah, amazing. Okay, so

886
00:46:55,520 --> 00:47:01,240
could you put it on the table? Yeah. Okay, amazing. Now just follow the ball.

887
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:04,980
Okay, I'm going to put it under this cup. Okay, right, so follow the ball and I

888
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,440
have it right on the edge of the table that I'm doing this on you're

889
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,320
definitely you're just a roll roll balance ball. By the way, balance

890
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:14,960
beside it doesn't have to be very high for him. It's a nineteen. All right,

891
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,240
whatever you do, you're going to trick him. Keep going like yeah. I mean I go

892
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:23,200
ahead, pick one left, middle, right at least roll inside to see if he crits.

893
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,120
No, okay, you got you got a three

894
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:32,720
subtract five from that base. Okay, okay, so what you said to go ahead, pick one

895
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,760
middle left right

896
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:40,480
left is the best that doesn't really round, but okay, okay, sock him in the

897
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,360
face and I take his money and I'm just running away. Okay,

898
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:49,080
damn it, where are you running to? I think I'm going to run to the parade.

899
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,560
Okay, cool, wait, wait,

900
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,280
and I fart to you know there's a there's a faster way to get to the parade.

901
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,920
I fart there's a faster way than running to get okay. Well, you know what

902
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,500
I've run to the exit of the zoo and I'll call a fucking uber. Yeah, and on my

903
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:08,440
phone I get like and I go, oh shit, hold on everybody and we

904
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:13,420
tied like a hard right. I go down the stride going towards the zoo. The zoo's

905
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,940
got to be close to the parade. While you're doing that,

906
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:18,160
you make this hard right.

907
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,680
The float starts to fall over

908
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,700
as you're making this hard right.

909
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,540
There's a number of things you can do to try to prevent this. Okay. You should

910
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:33,700
start to come up with them. Okay, well, and I'll give you, I'll give you help if

911
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:36,320
you're having a hard time coming up with ideas. Are the people still under his

912
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,040
control? They absolutely are. Oh, so you can have them push it back? So I was

913
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,560
thinking about it, yeah. I guess, well, before they push it back, I'll have them

914
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:45,440
get under it.

915
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,120
They're all under where it's gonna fall, so they can catch it if it does fall all

916
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,440
the way over. They're gonna catch it. Yeah. All right. I guess it's a float.

917
00:48:56,460 --> 00:49:00,500
It's a lot of people too. And it is. How much does the how much force is the

918
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:04,580
float exerting? How much weight is it falling over? Just a float. Let me ask

919
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:08,620
Chad GPT. I can give me one second. Just give me an over under 500 pounds.

920
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:12,660
Oh, like okay, like per person, right? Like that kind of thing? No,

921
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,700
just the whole thing. Oh, I mean it's

922
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,740
Is my disc that can lift 500 pounds? Can it lift? Can it push it back?

923
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:24,780
No, it's a car, basically. No, it's also unwieldly, yeah. Right.

924
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,740
Maybe it's not like the whole force of it yet, because it's only leaning a

925
00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:32,700
little bit if I act fast. You could negate 500 pounds of the force and we

926
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:37,460
can, I can adjust the DC for that, if you're, for whatever you're gonna do, but

927
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,540
I'm not gonna give you like advantage or anything. Okay, then maybe I'll have everyone go to

928
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:45,960
the other side and pull it. Okay. All at the same time. Okay. And then maybe also do

929
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:51,820
the disc to do 500 pounds. Okay. To try and do both. So spend your, spend your

930
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:59,300
spell for that. I'm going to roll for their strength. Their strength check for

931
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:03,740
this. Not great. Solid six.

932
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,140
You said solid. That sounds okay to me.

933
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,140
Yeah, I guess that's a good point. So yeah, what do you say to command them,

934
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:10,640
by the way?

935
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,340
Go and pull on it.

936
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,980
Yes, master. And they all like run around, children first, because they can

937
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:22,080
just it's like a yeah, you know it's like in a video it's just whatever the

938
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:25,720
smallest thing goes through the closest units are craft yeah exactly there's a

939
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,940
little zerglings and they're going over there to and just like a good like

940
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:33,600
thirty percent of them are just crushed by the flow. They're pulling there on

941
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,500
the other side. Oh the on this I'm sorry about that. I hate it on to them. So

942
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:43,980
they're so strong. No yeah, you start to fall over this float is like I mean

943
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,280
it's pretty high up by the way, so like I'm going to give you I'm going to give

944
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,060
give you a chance. Am I driving or I'm not driving riding on top of the flow?

945
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,520
That's what I thought I was driving. No, no, no, because how'd I turn then

946
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,180
what you commanded them? Nice try. I thought you were doing

947
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,740
interest. I'm gonna tell you what that one on perception. There's some other

948
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,500
reason. Yeah, so I assume

949
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,100
yeah,

950
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:09,500
so it's gonna fall is the sense I'm getting it's gonna fall and you're gonna

951
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:10,940
okay. Well, I'll levitate

952
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:15,820
you're gonna levitate with what I could levitate before,

953
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:20,300
but I can I'll stand on my disc that I made to push it. Your disc is all the

954
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,360
way down there.

955
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:25,420
What I was- It doesn't move at lightning speed. What do you mean? No, it's

956
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,180
pushing it back.

957
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:30,420
It's not like under it. You were on the disc pushing it back. No, the disc was-

958
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,140
okay, if I can imagine here. Well, it still fell. So, let's imagine, let's say,

959
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,980
is this what the- can we say the float looks like this, maybe? Eudropean. And

960
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,860
these are the wheels?

961
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:44,660
Yeah, no, I don't even know if you have to show the camera, right?

962
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:45,160
it.

963
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:51,940
That's what the flow looks like from the side. What is that? Yes, yes, that's

964
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,260
already covered that and okay, okay, and then this is and

965
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:58,980
this is me clinging on to it. Yeah,

966
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,380
right, the beauty mark. Wait, hold on.

967
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:08,820
That's me clinging on to the floor near the top of it right. We can is that

968
00:52:08,820 --> 00:52:11,780
true? We parts the top yeah. I don't know why you're a lawyer. It be, but

969
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:15,560
yeah, we could agree on that. Okay, the top would be roughly this area, so let

970
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:19,020
me draw an arrow to point out where the top is yeah, the folks at home just

971
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:23,860
listening he's he's drawing the rest of what you imagine you would draw for a

972
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:27,060
penis. If you're so that's an arrow pointing to where the top is and I drew

973
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,500
a little line to divide off the top for sure. I might have to put this in the

974
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,300
discord and it needs to be what you said. Can you do me a favor when you're

975
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,980
done? Send that to him? What's up? Is that just yeah, just keep going, but

976
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:40,140
Okay, okay and then let's say that

977
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,900
there's a bunch of people here, but

978
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:50,940
from the hair below the balls right after people, we mean hair, okay, I mean

979
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,160
those are wheels. We'll just put a hole at the top of that, so that's a

980
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:57,620
common. This can come out of stuff, but anyway, the point of the point of this

981
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,620
is that I would love to know what that was. So let's say it's Lee. It was Lee.

982
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:05,420
It's leaning over this way right. It's going like this, then my disc is was here

983
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:09,140
like pushing against it right. So can I not just get onto my disc?

984
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:14,560
Yeah, you can. Okay, that's what I would like to do. Alright, can you show that

985
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,260
to the camera?

986
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:21,360
What's this character sheet I think? That's my toad I drew.

987
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:24,700
You drew a toad? It's eight tons by the way.

988
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,360
What is it? That's how much it weighs. Eight tons? Eight tons. This thing

989
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:32,980
weighs eight tons? Yeah. Thank you, Julio. But yeah, so... Julio.

990
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,440
I

991
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:34,940
and

992
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:38,120
I've just get off onto my disc.

993
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:43,440
Yeah, you're fine. There's going to be some collateral damage for okay. Well,

994
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,240
that's fine yeah, not too much

995
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:50,900
because I don't weigh more than five hundred pounds. No, certainly not okay,

996
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:52,240
yeah, okay,

997
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:56,320
and then I need you to roll dexterity. Oh wait, no, you know what I just

998
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,040
realized this whole thing didn't matter because it can only go three feet off

999
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:03,160
the ground. Well, it's three feet. I'm saying three feet from off from where

1000
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,280
you were on the float. If you let me do that, but I don't

1001
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,740
what does it say? It was three feet for you are it's three feet above the

1002
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,380
ground, but you would think about the ground you're on. If you're in

1003
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,560
Colorado and you're going three feet above the ground, just because you're a

1004
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:21,700
mile up, I'm three feet off the ground right now. Oh, are you floating to the

1005
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,200
on the side of it? That's what I was thinking I was doing. Oh no yeah, yeah,

1006
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,160
so I maybe I'm just going to have to jump off

1007
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,100
or try and climb down really fast.

1008
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:34,680
Okay, which one do you want? I'll climb down really fast and I'll command them

1009
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,840
to catch me if I fall down.

1010
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:42,280
Here's the thing, I mean this is all happening so fast. Yeah, let's have you

1011
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:42,820
roll

1012
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:48,820
acrobatics or athletics first, just to see how you do it climbing. Sure, and

1013
00:54:48,820 --> 00:54:55,800
those are both balance ball? No, one is one is one is our arm and the other is

1014
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:58,840
balance ball. So, pick which one you want. I'll do balance ball. Okay,

1015
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,380
that's a ten. Okay, all right. And then,

1016
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:08,880
God, all right. I am gonna need you to roll talking 'cause you're basically

1017
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,440
kinda communicating with them really fast, and I feel like this has been

1018
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,200
happening really fast, so I wanna make it a little bit more difficult.

1019
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,280
Talking is another ten. All right.

1020
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,880
So, what do you say to get them over there to catch you? Get over

1021
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:25,080
here. Get over here! You do it twice. Exactly.

1022
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,980
yeah, you're going to take some damage. Okay, so we can't be that much damage.

1023
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:33,820
Can it do me to distract him? Oh, my glasses fell off. Oh, look at that this

1024
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:34,080
time.

1025
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,200
Oh, you drew. Oh, cool. Hold it up.

1026
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,840
Get out,

1027
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:41,760
you take

1028
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,720
nine damage. I'm at one. My distraction didn't work at all. He just showed him

1029
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,200
a nine nine nine. Okay, you're not

1030
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:59,120
You're at one health right now. Yeah. And you also see on the ground. We can't lose

1031
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,800
another campaign.

1032
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:09,360
Your worst nemesis. Oh no. Is it Batman? The floater. No, not the floater. Damn,

1033
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:14,360
that's a good idea though. No, Professor Magical. Oh fuck. Oh my god. No.

1034
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:24,260
I've taken shit. I've destroyed your float. Now I will destroy you. I cast

1035
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,500
detect magic, the one to stop it.

1036
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,260
Is he magical? He's not

1037
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:36,140
I'm show I'm showing him the result of the detect magic. I'm somehow I'm like

1038
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:41,140
it's like making a like a hood come up. It's like no magic detected. I'm like

1039
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:44,980
witch thing. Yeah, I'm showing him like you're not magic.

1040
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:50,500
Oh, I hate you for that. Okay, Mr. Normal. I'm not Mr. Normal. I

1041
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,540
professor magical and I hate you professor scientifically normal. Not

1042
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:57,740
even a professor. I am a professor. You should make him show you. Okay,

1043
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:01,980
the guy who said make him show you his show me a thing. No,

1044
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:06,380
not you got it. Mr. He's crazy. He's a villain. They'll show you this

1045
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,340
thing for no reason. Oh my God, that's really roll for initiative.

1046
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,460
What does this thing look like?

1047
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:15,020
It looks awesome. Can you describe it to the vein? What is an awesome thing?

1048
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:19,820
Blue. Blue? He is magic after all. That is a 14.

1049
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:27,820
That's gonna be besides that. Yeah, it's a 16. So he is. I'm gonna die y'all.

1050
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:34,780
Damn. I'm dead y'all. Yeah, okay and I'm waiting for my Uber. Yeah, but this is

1051
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:39,380
all your fault. I saw the little cartoon float that was coming. It fell over on

1052
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:43,960
on the map, so I'm going to walk over to the parade. Okay, that's true. Yeah,

1053
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:47,160
wait, can I press the button? Can I press the distress signal that all uber

1054
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:50,340
drivers have that sends a distress signal to their to their rider? Yeah, so

1055
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:50,740
you can go

1056
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:57,120
you press it. He's not going to go faster, but he is, but he knows that you

1057
00:57:57,120 --> 00:58:02,080
know, you're in trouble. You still have people you can control to okay, cool. So

1058
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:05,760
the first thing I'm going to die before that, though, probably he's going to run

1059
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,300
up to you and just try to like wacky with his staff, because again he's not

1060
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:14,140
magical. Okay, that's pretty okay, pretty cool that you clock that, but

1061
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:20,280
okay, he's definitely missed. Okay, sick, he's got one more. It's his wiener

1062
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,300
swing around when he swings the thing does that probably hits you

1063
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:30,320
fifteen AC, fifteen. Oh, is it really yeah? You wrote the fourteen and I saw

1064
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:34,720
it and he has no strength. He's all owned damn. Did you guys see that he

1065
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:38,040
this almost killed me unfairly. I wanted to I he wanted to kill and kill

1066
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,700
didn't even ask

1067
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,820
I thought your a you to you pulled out that d six any number on that any

1068
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:47,020
number on that d six would kill me and you know it and you don't get to see

1069
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:47,760
my drawing.

1070
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,780
Where's where is it? Oh, nowhere

1071
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:54,700
we erased it, but you can look at my toe. You don't get to see it. Oh,

1072
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:59,860
now I realized what you meant when you said that I can see it now. Yeah,

1073
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:00,780
you can see it in the thing.

1074
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,860
you know anybody who looks like this

1075
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:09,360
man,

1076
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:15,260
I mean probably the folks listening Caleb drew a pussy and a butthole. Yeah,

1077
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,360
yeah, where's the arms? She has no or

1078
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:22,660
or maybe they're taking the picture. I'll give her arms. Hand jobs are

1079
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:26,160
useless. So let's talk about it. Yeah,

1080
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,460
your turn, my turn. You have an army. Yeah, do it.

1081
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:36,700
can I control the army and also cast? I can't believe you fuck. I feel like I'm

1082
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:40,780
sorry I almost did that, but also I'm pissed off that I didn't get to kill

1083
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:41,020
you.

1084
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:46,120
I did not mean to do that. Do I what's that? What's that? Do I get to command

1085
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:49,020
the army and cast a spell or is it either or I think that the command

1086
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:53,180
armies in action? It's okay, it's too am I do I get the sense that well so yeah

1087
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,560
what can what can they do? I mean you can tell them to go. I mean the whole

1088
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,260
point was that they would go tear tear Batman apart. Yeah, turn them into a

1089
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:04,700
But can I imagine, can I gauge by looking, like, is it like spaghetti arm

1090
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:10,960
adventure time type guys? Is it, you know, is it Terminators? Because I just

1091
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,860
want to know if I should use them or if I should cast a fire spell.

1092
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:18,400
For sure. So, I mean, immediately around you, the people you got to pick you

1093
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:21,440
up again were just kind of random folks. So you have some strong people,

1094
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,900
some are like...

1095
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,000
But there's a lot of them.

1096
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,160
there's like there are like you could reasonably get like

1097
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:33,640
twenty five, twenty six people to just mall this guy right now, okay, I guess

1098
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,940
fucked that's I think I'll do that. I think that makes more sense than a

1099
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:42,540
fireball. Yes, he tried to like stab you with his staff and you just like

1100
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:47,760
backed away and he just hit the ground yeah and I go and I say eat him

1101
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:54,520
well, they go gobble gobble gobble gobble and they just run up and start

1102
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:58,240
eating him. How many people is it just just twenty five twenty seven, but you

1103
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:01,800
see other only twenty five, but other people now are that I eat that much

1104
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,880
eat. They're all trying to get in on it. Now the whole they like the idea of it.

1105
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:09,740
Yeah, I kind of unlock the twisted true nature that a good villain

1106
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:14,160
isn't just fighting. The hero is also revealing something about society.

1107
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:18,480
Most people are hungrier than they believe possible. That's what my that's

1108
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:23,780
but my whole revealing is about yeah. People love to eat. I'm a cook. People

1109
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:26,980
love to eat. That's what he's revealing. That's crazy, Patches. I know, I've

1110
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:27,780
gotten that wrong like

1111
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:30,140
eight times. That's crazy.

1112
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:34,960
It's like the scene in Day of the Dead. Exactly like that, but if you can

1113
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:35,500
imagine,

1114
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:40,460
it takes a tenth of the time, because there's so many more people.

1115
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:44,260
He doesn't even have time to say a joke on him. It's like the nematode

1116
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,060
SpongeBob.

1117
01:01:47,660 --> 01:01:52,560
Sorry, but anyway, so you guys, you guys, I mean you did that now. I

1118
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:57,060
think, keep in mind, you don't have, you have a limited amount of time

1119
01:01:57,060 --> 01:02:00,780
you can have these people under your control. So once you've done eating

1120
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:04,900
them, you should probably start marching back. You probably arrive at

1121
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,900
this point, like, "Oh yeah, I don't wanna waste any time." I'd

1122
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:10,620
dap him up. Yeah, you'd dap him up. Let me hear one second.

1123
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:17,460
That's a 15 on performance. I assume it's balance ball. And we're gonna

1124
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:24,500
back to you. So you were just dodging Batman. So we're gonna go back to, oh my God, my brain,

1125
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:28,460
the Rambler. So you were dodging Batman and Hamsterina.

1126
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:39,460
Ha! What a futile attempt at trying to hit me, Batman, you bitch. Give me that Batman

1127
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:46,460
voice. Oh yeah, sorry. Oh, I hope it's all set up. Hello? There's your classic voice,

1128
01:02:46,460 --> 01:02:53,620
Batman yes, it's my classic voice that I've heard but I hate you and I hate your voice

1129
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:56,380
But I love your suit Batman

1130
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:59,820
What I love the way you're dressed

1131
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:05,420
Like a bit really you look like a fucking bet

1132
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:08,180
but also a man

1133
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:15,420
And if I wore it I'd look different

1134
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:21,760
and because I'm I think I'm shorter than you, I think I think it's I would look

1135
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:28,360
like I was in my daddy's suit. It's your because it's bigger. What are you still

1136
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:33,440
doing the ram? What do you want to kill? You want to sorry attack that man or

1137
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,040
hamster? You know what do you want? What was I doing before? Because I had like

1138
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:44,060
I had some thing that I was, I had this big plan in my head.

1139
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:47,060
I hit Hamsterina's on the desk door.

1140
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:48,060
She's not doing well.

1141
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,060
Yeah.

1142
01:03:49,060 --> 01:03:50,060
No.

1143
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:51,060
She's not doing too well right now.

1144
01:03:51,060 --> 01:04:01,060
I guess me saying, me talking about how if I wore Batman's suit, it would be as big as my daddy's suit, is a Babble Blast.

1145
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:03,060
Oh, I like that. Yeah.

1146
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:05,060
So I'm going to roll for Babble Blast.

1147
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,060
Roll it.

1148
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:11,060
that is a six plus.

1149
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:15,060
Or is it a DC? Is it a DC for Babble Blast?

1150
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:17,060
Yeah, I think so.

1151
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,060
Because it's 3D6, right?

1152
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,060
What did I put for your own thing?

1153
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:23,060
It is! It's a wisdom save.

1154
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:24,060
So he's going to make a wisdom save.

1155
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,060
So you don't have to worry about that.

1156
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:26,060
Oh, alright.

1157
01:04:26,060 --> 01:04:28,060
Here comes Batman. Unfortunately, he is pretty wise.

1158
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,060
Oh my God, it was a 19.

1159
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,060
And he got a 19, so he's able to withstand it.

1160
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:34,060
What about Henrietta the hamster?

1161
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:36,060
Yes, it is a cone. That's a good point.

1162
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:38,060
That's a good point. Henrietta's a hamster.

1163
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:39,060
Ham-ri-etta.

1164
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,060
Henrietta the hamster.

1165
01:04:40,060 --> 01:04:41,060
Hamster-ietta.

1166
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,060
Oh my god!

1167
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:44,060
Damn, they both resisted your battle blast.

1168
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:46,060
Um, yeah, they know that.

1169
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:47,060
I gotta say.

1170
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:52,060
From dating you, I learned how to avoid your crap voice and your shit stuff, you see?

1171
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:56,060
Now you just know I'd be tall enough to wear Batman's suit and it wouldn't look like my daddy's.

1172
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,060
It's not gonna work.

1173
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,060
'Cause I'm the same height as Bruce Wayne, Batman.

1174
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:03,980
Now you're just annoying me in real life.

1175
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:05,100
Just kidding.

1176
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,300
Just a little joke.

1177
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:10,420
Bruce Wayne is your identity Batman.

1178
01:05:10,420 --> 01:05:11,420
What?

1179
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:12,420
No.

1180
01:05:12,420 --> 01:05:14,900
No, it's no, it's not.

1181
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:15,900
Wait, hold on.

1182
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:16,900
Maybe Batman.

1183
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:17,900
What?

1184
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:18,900
How did you shut up?

1185
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:19,900
No, it's not.

1186
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:21,900
My name is my name is Batman.

1187
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:22,900
Obviously.

1188
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:23,900
Bruce Wayne.

1189
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:24,900
No.

1190
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,900
Batman.

1191
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:26,900
No.

1192
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:27,900
Bruce Batman.

1193
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:28,900
Nope.

1194
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,900
Nope.

1195
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:30,900
Not.

1196
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:37,280
Bruce when Goose man, man, your name is on Bruce Gooseman. It's not Bruce

1197
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:41,560
Gooseman. It's Gooseman. Fuck you. I'm not. It's my turn. That one's good

1198
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,240
try to attack

1199
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:51,220
whoa trick shot. Eleven plus LEM or what you're saying my AC is a

1200
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,640
fucker.

1201
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:53,860
Yeah,

1202
01:05:57,460 --> 01:05:59,860
How much stop?

1203
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,940
Stop. That's enough.

1204
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:02,260
Roll. Yeah, roll one more.

1205
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,220
One more, one more.

1206
01:06:03,220 --> 01:06:04,380
The seven damage.

1207
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:05,340
OK, it's not that bad.

1208
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:07,140
Yeah, and he's going to do it again.

1209
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:09,860
I have 11 health.

1210
01:06:09,860 --> 01:06:11,860
Stop. It's an eight.

1211
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,420
And yeah, that's not going to do this.

1212
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,420
OK, and then hamstring is going to roll on through.

1213
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:20,020
So all age a charity saving throw.

1214
01:06:20,020 --> 01:06:25,060
What we say she was five fifty thousand twenty twenty four.

1215
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:26,100
Fifty thousand.

1216
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:30,640
I have a net. Oh, the measure. One fifty thousand, like thirty thousand one

1217
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,400
thirty thousand. Yeah. Yeah.

1218
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,800
What do I get to do? One fifty thousand one. Yeah. You dodge that. Okay, but now

1219
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,760
she's going to. It's just a dodge. I don't even get like an attack of

1220
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,740
opportunity because it was such a good roll. No, the whole, her ability allows

1221
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:48,120
her to negate attack of opportunity. You said her, by the way. Rolling by, but

1222
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:52,640
now she's going to roll back around and this time it becomes a hit and that

1223
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:53,440
does hit you

1224
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,520
for

1225
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:56,020
here

1226
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:59,940
for damage,

1227
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,840
so

1228
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:09,960
looks like you're looks like you're out of juice. Rambler looks like I'm out of

1229
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:13,140
juice. Batman what no what no

1230
01:07:13,140 --> 01:07:17,640
stop stop stop copying me

1231
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,480
the

1232
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:33,280
old man with his head turned on his children to I said arms. I said a

1233
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,080
different thing. I win I'm the bad yep. That's because I've run out of juice.

1234
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:43,380
That's what I was saying earlier. Let's cut back to you guys. So you're

1235
01:07:43,380 --> 01:07:45,940
marching on to this scene

1236
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:53,500
and you finally get to the to the door. So you can enter door the ramble. Yeah,

1237
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:57,800
The Rambler, you hear this crowd outside and you guys have made it

1238
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,400
and this is what they sound like.

1239
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,740
Can we have a toast, please?

1240
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:06,840
Okay, so I was like you did a while to probably go.

1241
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:09,940
That's how is that them banging on the door at something?

1242
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,340
It's a glass door.

1243
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,740
They're very delicate banging with a girl. They're running.

1244
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:20,840
It's the back door. It's the back door like near the patio.

1245
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:27,300
yeah his peach lido's a little peaches drug wife is just in the pool. Just

1246
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:27,780
hanging out

1247
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:31,940
this is them knocking on the door.

1248
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:37,880
No, no, it's not. No, that's some playing that's actually this so

1249
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,420
Batman.

1250
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:46,480
What what is that? Oh, it seems I've run out of juice, but the whole

1251
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:50,840
there's there's a there's a lot more juice outside.

1252
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:52,980
Yeah, that's some bullshit.

1253
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:53,980
I don't know.

1254
01:08:53,980 --> 01:08:56,220
People crash through the door while you're like trying to find the quip.

1255
01:08:56,220 --> 01:08:58,740
There's a bunch of fuckers.

1256
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,300
And Batman, Batman like...

1257
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,340
And they're bitches too.

1258
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:05,500
Batman says, Hamsterine, here give me that.

1259
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:07,060
Sorry, I keep doing this.

1260
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:08,060
No, Batman.

1261
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:11,060
Hamsterine, we gotta go.

1262
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,180
This is getting too fucked up.

1263
01:09:13,180 --> 01:09:16,140
And then she says, "You're right, Batman.

1264
01:09:16,140 --> 01:09:17,700
Let's get out of here."

1265
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:20,460
And they start to try to run out of here.

1266
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:25,460
And then you hear crush, crush, crush, crush.

1267
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:28,180
And then you hear the dogs barking.

1268
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:30,980
And you hear the bad guy, the main bad, the amazing.

1269
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:35,060
(evil laughing)

1270
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:37,140
I've got you now, Batman.

1271
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:40,700
And we've all got you.

1272
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:43,660
In crashes through the manor,

1273
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:47,060
what looks like Optimus Prime,

1274
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,780
yo, the robot who saved you.

1275
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:54,840
and if you take Maisie up up town, which ends in an E, you reverse that

1276
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,080
anagram. No make

1277
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,820
optimus Wayne. No

1278
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:03,780
we should have known I should have done that earlier. Yes,

1279
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:07,280
to this way, your cousin Bruce,

1280
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,680
and I'm here to finally kill you

1281
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:16,180
and one more thing and he pulls out a scroll that looks a lot like the

1282
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:17,860
declaration of independence.

1283
01:10:17,860 --> 01:10:22,220
my God,

1284
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:25,260
I can't believe you've done it.

1285
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:32,620
We've been trying to do that for years. You've successfully stone of

1286
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:33,540
independence.

1287
01:10:33,540 --> 01:10:41,660
He's like how you do it. He's familiar with the movies, he does an appreciation

1288
01:10:41,660 --> 01:10:42,720
and he says

1289
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,580
it's not the question of independence, then fuck that. I don't care

1290
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,820
(laughter)

1291
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,120
- It's a counter spell.

1292
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,240
- And he casts it.

1293
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:55,040
And all--

1294
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:57,380
- Oh wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, wait, wait.

1295
01:10:57,380 --> 01:10:59,160
(laughter)

1296
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,000
- Wow.

1297
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,360
- Damn it.

1298
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,880
- He casts a spell and all the people there

1299
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,560
are now under his control.

1300
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,400
- Oh fuck.

1301
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:08,960
- Who gives a shit, he's on our side.

1302
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,640
He's on our side, right?

1303
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,160
- I'm not on your side.

1304
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:13,980
- That's what!

1305
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,280
- It's 'cause I said F that when he pulled out the scrolls.

1306
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,880
Hey, it's not because you said

1307
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:31,080
I don't care. I just want

1308
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:39,580
he's got five stars on Uber and I'm his friend. So and we get free rides and

1309
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,180
there's going to be a golden car.

1310
01:11:46,180 --> 01:11:48,180
I really don't care at all.

1311
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,180
We're kind of all kind of middling villains anyway.

1312
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,180
We're not, didn't really aspire to do that at any point.

1313
01:11:52,180 --> 01:11:54,180
I changed my voice too.

1314
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,180
In my whole thing.

1315
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:58,180
Oh.

1316
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:00,180
I was all like,

1317
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:02,180
I was all like shit, I better like make sure

1318
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:04,180
I betray them.

1319
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:06,180
I got the frog.

1320
01:12:06,180 --> 01:12:08,180
The frog was going to release the animals just in case.

1321
01:12:08,180 --> 01:12:10,180

1349
01:13:58,160 --> 01:13:59,220

1350
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:04,100

1351
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,920

1352
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,140
that you I know that I know that there I will never have. I will never feel

1353
01:14:12,140 --> 01:14:18,380
greater than I do in this moment. It's all downhill as my rating at five. He

1354
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:22,060
said it himself. You can't go above five point. Oh, what if you what if you

1355
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:25,940
roll? The only one place for me to go is my rating four point nine nine. What if

1358
01:14:37,700 --> 01:14:42,820

1359
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:46,700
trying to think because I mean think about also just not to get into my

1360
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:50,020
character's psyche too much, but think about his brother. Mr. Wonderful is

1361
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,420
famous as a TV show. You could have a cash cab show.

1362
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:59,580
Taxi cab confessions meets cash cab where you ask trivia questions about

1363
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:06,440
fingering fake uber foober foober foober. If you roll, you can make food to

1364
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:11,920
higher than a fifteen or four over by a d twenty. Yes, okay, you get the gold

1365
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,080
higher than what than a I get the gold car right now. If you get higher than a

1366
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,480
fifteen, you get it right now.

1367
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:26,520
What do you get? I got an there's a card in the way. No, no dice, no dice. Why

1368
01:15:26,540 --> 01:15:31,140
we okay, okay, wait, so many years, I say no, just kidding. I don't need to kill

1369
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:36,660
myself. I just wanted to trick the DM into maybe giving me a golden car. Damn,

1370
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:40,860
I thought that I was going to say we should go by Cilo rules for a second.

1371
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:42,200
And if you get three, four,

1372
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:47,140
four, five, six, four, five, six, four, five, six, we got my dad. I don't like

1373
01:15:47,140 --> 01:15:49,900
taking things away, but we got it. We got to we got to add a little bit of

1374
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:53,400
flavor there. So it's do you guys roll initiative, by the way? Yeah, I got a

1375
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:55,420
I got a two.

1376
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,420
Should I roll initiative?

1377
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,420
Am I dead or alive?

1378
01:15:59,420 --> 01:16:01,420
I mean it's up to you. Did you want to die just now?

1379
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:03,420
I wanted to die but I basically got convinced by my friends.

1380
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,420
We need your wizardry.

1381
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,420
I'll stay alive and I got a 19 on initiative.

1382
01:16:07,420 --> 01:16:09,420
Oh man, only if you got that roll for the golden car.

1383
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:11,420
And then let me roll for our friend.

1384
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:13,420
Friend? He's our foe!

1385
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,420
Our foe.

1386
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:17,420
Okay, plus...

1387
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:19,420
Oh, minus.

1388
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,420
Okay.

1389
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:29,380
first. Okay, thank God. All right, so first is going to be you, Mr.

1390
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:33,880
Wonderful with that 19. All right. Oh yeah, you don't want it. You don't want

1391
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:38,380
to die. You want to you want to take the freebie I gave you. I basically okay. I

1392
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:43,500
have completely had resolve my resolve strengthened. I don't want to ever die

1393
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:47,660
okay in my entire life. It's you're so scared of die. Yeah, I have a new fire in

1394
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,740
my heart, but I still also have one hb

1395
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:53,700
yeah. When you rolled that that eight, it's like

1396
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:59,180
the ceo of uber text you and saying, but maybe one day I had no, I think

1397
01:16:59,180 --> 01:17:02,940
actually what happened is he texted me. He's no, he's he texted me a picture of

1398
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:07,540
himself riding in a golden car and said you will never have this and it made me

1399
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,860
like lit a fire in my heart where I was like I'm going to become the greatest

1400
01:17:11,860 --> 01:17:14,940
going. I'm going to kill that guy and I'm going to take that golden car super

1401
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:18,780
Super Saiyan, because I deserve it because no one else has ever done

1402
01:17:18,780 --> 01:17:22,180
like I did uber in Gotham City. Yep,

1403
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:26,940
you send back to you, I never get this. You'll never get this. You send and

1404
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:31,580
then one day he gets I get this. Yep, you send back a picture of your

1405
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:36,020
face, photoshopped on his face in the car. Yeah, and you say we'll see

1406
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:36,880
yeah,

1407
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:40,940
yeah, I know I've been seeing I killed it. You killed it. You got it.

1408
01:17:41,100 --> 01:17:47,500
I want to cast a gun as ours scorcher. I'm gonna have their scorcher. Yeah, and I

1409
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,100
need a red dragon scale.

1410
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:55,300
You have one. Yeah, don't pay attention to material. Okay, you dragon tail

1411
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:56,000
motherfucker.

1412
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:02,000
I can as our scorcher about a cadaver. I've ran one campaign where I cared

1413
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,700
about material components and that was

1414
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:09,800
that was annoying because I'm not smart. It has to make he has to make a

1415
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,200
Dexterity 14 saving throw. Okay.

1416
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:18,700
He does succeed, but he gets half. He gets half.

1417
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,600
Half damage. What does he get? Let's see. He gets half of 3d8.

1418
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:26,600
Damn you. You still have spells. I haven't cast any of my spells.

1419
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:29,100
Really? You just gave me way too many spells.

1420
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:31,900
Yeah, I wanted you to have all the funny names.

1421
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,400
So I went a little crazy there. What the fuck?

1422
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,700
Oh, that's nine damage. All right. He's not he's doing okay,

1423
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:44,200
but as a level to spell take up two slots. No, I also didn't say that, so I

1424
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:45,280
can't let you do that.

1425
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:50,180
I should have said that, though we're gonna kill this robot. I should have said

1426
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:53,280
that up top. That's really it. You know what can I tell you something cam? Yeah,

1427
01:18:53,280 --> 01:18:54,360
it's a really good idea.

1428
01:18:54,360 --> 01:18:59,580
I just assumed that that's why I never casted this. Yeah, save the best for

1429
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:03,500
last. Well, you always give him the best shit in these games, man. That's not

1430
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,500
safe. No, I just I'm the only person that's gonna read crazy. Yoda's gave him

1431
01:19:07,500 --> 01:19:20,460
the

1432
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:21,460
That one's good.

1433
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:23,460
But it doesn't work on like anything like the...

1434
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:24,460
Like a monster?

1435
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,460
It worked on the first campaign.

1436
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,460
Yeah, it doesn't work on the monsters.

1437
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,460
I mean, the last campaign we did...

1438
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:28,460
That's because you're always picking like a paladin.

1439
01:19:28,460 --> 01:19:30,820
You're always picking like the strong guy.

1440
01:19:30,820 --> 01:19:35,140
You guys just don't have the brain like me where I figure out how to make shit broken.

1441
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:37,540
I want something so overpowered that it's...

1442
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,540
Like when I gave Leo the gun.

1443
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:39,540
Yeah, it ruins everything.

1444
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:40,540
Yeah, that was fun.

1445
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:41,540
I like that.

1446
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:42,540
Yeah.

1447
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:43,540
Okay, all right.

1448
01:19:43,540 --> 01:19:44,540
I'll give you something.

1449
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,540
And I never get...

1450
01:19:45,540 --> 01:19:48,020
I have a knife and I can make a soup.

1451
01:19:48,020 --> 01:19:49,020
I have speddy broth.

1452
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:53,180
I think next. What the fuck is speddy broth man? You never even explained what

1453
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:56,220
speddy broth is. You wrote it down wrong. At the end of this thing you'd never

1454
01:19:56,220 --> 01:19:58,540
explained what speddy broth is. This is what he was just saying, you can't read,

1455
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:02,380
so that's the whole thing. I can read completely fine, watch this. Max HP,

1456
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:06,540
current HP. What if next campaign... Balance ball. What if next campaign,

1457
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:10,340
regardless of what it is, you are the Kool Aid man and you get to

1458
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:11,940
break down the wall?

1459
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:17,740
That's crap. Yeah, I thought of it on the spot, okay? It didn't work out

1460
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:29,980
Well, whatever it's you got a right yeah, yeah, your turn. I am you blast him

1461
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:34,560
with agonizing scorcher and it's just like like a fire blasting into him.

1462
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,140
Those it's actually a line of fire line of fire. Oh yeah, right. A line of a

1463
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:42,660
line of roaring flame. He holds up his arms, try to block it and it just it

1464
01:20:42,660 --> 01:20:46,200
still goes through him and he doesn't melt him a little is like an anime. I

1465
01:20:46,220 --> 01:20:49,420
I think he I think since he's a robot and he's metal, maybe and maybe some parts

1466
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:53,820
of plastic since the transformer you have fairy fire. You can do that. Whoa,

1467
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:57,620
but I just want him to be ugly is all I was going to say. Maybe he gets a little

1468
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:01,420
ugly from here. It's a little droopy. Well, I can I can I can do something

1469
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:04,020
maybe he sounds like this. Maybe he's

1470
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:11,620
guys. Is it doesn't really come across? Okay,

1471
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:19,220
What I'm going to do is roll and I'm starting to understand speddy broth

1472
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:23,120
here. Why? Because it looks like it's going to be a character in something.

1473
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:27,220
No choice. I'm going to roll verbal distrabident.

1474
01:21:27,220 --> 01:21:32,220
What? Is that what I wrote? Verbal distrabident.

1475
01:21:32,220 --> 01:21:35,220
Give me that. Give me that.

1476
01:21:35,220 --> 01:21:39,920
This is distraction. I have the handwriting. Let me see. Oh, you do

1477
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,120
I think it's maybe possible that you put speddy broth. I didn't write that.

1478
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:48,920
You wrote that. Prove that. Prove that right now. This is verbal distra...

1479
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:51,960
That is your handwriting. What the fuck? You also drew a fucking giant pussy

1480
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,760
on the back of this piece of paper. What the hell? Can you show that one

1481
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:57,840
time to the camera? You already showed this to everyone. Did I show this

1482
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,320
to the camera? You show your drawings too many times. Okay. Well, that was...

1483
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:03,600
And I'm gonna rip this in half if you show it again. No, don't.

1484
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,040
That's nice. I just wanted to show off the king of pop.

1485
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:11,880
See, he just showed it again. He literally just got it showed and he showed it a second time immediately.

1486
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,880
Okay, so I'm rolling verbal distratadim.

1487
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:16,880
I wrote the word down.

1488
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:17,880
Okay.

1489
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:21,880
I just, there are certain times where the lowercase letters become kind of their own cuneiform.

1490
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:23,880
You turned a T into a T.

1491
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:24,880
Cuneiform, my friend.

1492
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,880
Is it cuneiform?

1493
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:27,880
Okay.

1494
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:28,880
Oh, really?

1495
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,880
No, you have to roll a wisdom saving throw.

1496
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,880
I'm trying to sound smart, but I sound like a loser.

1497
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,400
You have to roll a wisdom saving throw.

1498
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:37,400
Yeah, for sure.

1499
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,520
And it has to be higher

1500
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:42,520
than a 14.

1501
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,500
Well, let's see what his wisdom is.

1502
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:46,600
Yeah, he gets a plus

1503
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:47,600
on that.

1504
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,280
Sorry. It was literally a 13.

1505
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,960
I would. He gets a plus two on that.

1506
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:53,360
So, damn it, dude.

1507
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:55,320
I love doing this with you guys.

1508
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:58,000
Really? Yeah, I never want to stop,

1509
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,840
man.

1510
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,840
Man, me too.

1511
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,440
So.

1512
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,120
What is out from his Wayne's turn?

1513
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:11,220
He is going to

1514
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,720
shoot out his missiles out of his fucking hand.

1515
01:23:15,720 --> 01:23:17,020
Bitch.

1516
01:23:17,020 --> 01:23:19,320
So all of you guys roll DC.

1517
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:21,920
Well, what if I take my speddy Brother right now and I sped up

1518
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:23,920
and down. Roll a balance ball.

1519
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,920
Balance ball.

1520
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:30,620
That's a six. Thirteen. Ten.

1521
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,620
Speddy.

1522
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:39,420
your bed, a broth, you all take ten damage. Okay, can I have a moment to

1523
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,060
dead?

1524
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:48,100
So basically I just I just shot my my fireball and I'm like I'm having I'm the

1525
01:23:48,100 --> 01:23:52,100
and I'm completely anime and my teeth are gridded and I have the sharp tooth

1526
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:56,060
and I have and my eyes are shining and sparkling and I'm having like my

1527
01:23:56,060 --> 01:24:00,840
internal monologue and I'm going like let this fire symbolize the fire in my

1528
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:05,140
start that I will never give up that I will pick up and drop off as many

1529
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:09,780
passengers as I can to get that six star to get that golden car away from that

1530
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:13,740
piece of shit ceo, because ceos have everything nowadays and there's nothing

1531
01:24:13,740 --> 01:24:17,740
left for guys like us little scrappy villains like us just trying to do

1532
01:24:17,740 --> 01:24:20,940
what's right for ourselves in our own sense of twisted morality, where we

1533
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:25,460
believe evil is good and good is evil and this is the last straw. I'm going to

1534
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:30,240
take this robot down and then I get exploded by the missile and it's tf

1535
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:34,940
two vibes. Oh fuck, how do you know when it does all the chicken nuggets fly

1536
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:38,940
everywhere? What they're both down? Yeah, yeah, I have to HP. You have

1537
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:43,900
healing potions. How much damage did I take? You took ten and how low can you

1538
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:47,620
get before you outright die? Oh, it has to be negative your own HP, negative

1539
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:51,300
your own HP, not a negative hat. Okay, no, no, I gave your max. I'm at negative

1540
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:56,280
He has healing so can I go get him off his body? I'm chunks. Well you you make

1541
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:58,000
I

1542
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,960
Mean, of course I make well if you get healing potions

1543
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:05,740
Fortifying broth and I've speddy can you

1544
01:25:05,740 --> 01:25:09,820
Bake the healing potions into a loaf of healing bread

1545
01:25:09,820 --> 01:25:12,560
That would take I'd have to wait

1546
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:18,360
Okay

1547
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:23,100
least, so I'm the only one alive. I mean yeah, I'm going to go try to I'm going to

1548
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:26,440
go try to get the health potions off of his body.

1549
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:32,400
Okay, what health potions you do? I gave you potions. Oh my God, look at the

1550
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:35,760
bottom of your wizard. Those are those are spell potions. Oh, there's only for

1551
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,080
spell. Let's say potions for replenish two slots. That's my best go along with

1552
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:44,760
it. You've after you're the one who had healing potions. I have a spiny,

1553
01:25:46,120 --> 01:25:50,960
steady and okay. I do have three. What are your potions advantage on persuasion

1554
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:54,360
and deception? I can, I can cook three things. I'm not a potion. Can I cook

1555
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,360
three things right now?

1556
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,400
What I'm going to cook three things. I have three ingredients

1557
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:05,520
three. It costs like it'll cost a bonus action to cook right now. I don't give a

1558
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,400
fuck. Okay, that's just you better be careful. It's the only chance using a

1559
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,240
bonus action.

1560
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:14,500
so I just rolled the twenties right

1561
01:26:14,500 --> 01:26:19,200
yes. I walk into a restaurant, say let me use the kitchen. I'm a cook three

1562
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:19,600
things

1563
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,860
yeah

1564
01:26:21,860 --> 01:26:23,960
yeah, let me cook.

1565
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:31,920
Okay, yeah, I'll have you

1566
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:36,880
things. I'll you do it. Let's do it twelve, please be a thirteen or a ten

1567
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,360
and a fucking nine. Okay, eleven is

1568
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:48,320
bewitching aroma. That's going to be an aroma, not even a food. No, just a

1569
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:53,400
scroll. He just cooked a smell. The cook creates a dish, the captivating aroma

1570
01:27:04,440 --> 01:27:05,460
seven twelve and nine

1571
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:09,980
so when we finish saying what it does, though yeah, I can all creatures within

1572
01:27:09,980 --> 01:27:13,980
a thirty foot radius centered on the cook must succeed on a DC fourteen

1573
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:16,960
wisdom saving throw or become charmed for one minute.

1574
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:22,480
Regarding the cook as a trusted friend number twelve disorienting spice

1575
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,800
he

1576
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,860
still

1577
01:27:30,700 --> 01:27:34,660
popped up a bunch of chicken and put it in a pot and made a spice

1578
01:27:34,660 --> 01:27:37,940
and turned it into powder.

1579
01:27:37,940 --> 01:27:39,740
You like boiled a leek.

1580
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:42,180
The cook adds a potent spice to a dish.

1581
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:49,860
Okay, I take back what I was saying about Caleb not being able to read.

1582
01:27:49,860 --> 01:27:51,780
You did not give him anything cool.

1583
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:52,580
No.

1584
01:27:52,580 --> 01:27:55,020
You're trying to make him smell the spice.

1585
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:56,260
I just looked at a bunch of random-

1586
01:27:56,260 --> 01:27:57,620
No, no, no. I'll be honest.

1587
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:00,180
I looked up a bunch of shit and copied and pasted it.

1588
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:03,020
all right. This one will work this one because you can make you can make you

1589
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:04,980
can add you can make a spicy petty.

1590
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:10,880
I'm so excited to hear what the third one is. Cretan cloud, you are cloud of

1591
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:14,800
disorienting particles. That's that's to each creature with a fifteen foot

1592
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:19,140
radius, said third on the cook must make a DC constitution saving throw or be

1593
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:22,340
blinded for one minute. Okay, I'm a number nine

1594
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:29,460
it out right now. I wish I read these

1595
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:32,260
acidic surprise.

1596
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:39,080
I knew there was I made sure there were a couple because I knew there was

1597
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:42,520
going to be an arc, at least a moment. We're going to deal with the mayor,

1598
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,000
but I didn't read all of them. The cook prepared a dish

1599
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:53,420
he mother fucker actually he he the cook prepares a dish

1600
01:28:53,420 --> 01:28:55,520
that release

1601
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,420
an aroma, a spice and a surprise

1602
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:03,720
I'm making a surprise

1603
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:07,260
okay, okay, what is

1604
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:13,320
a corrosive acid? The cook makes a range attack against target within thirty

1605
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:17,800
feet, dealing three D six acid damage on a hit. Okay, can I use I'd like to

1606
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,720
use disorient

1607
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:25,360
to blind is blind. I want to blind. It's a fourteen. Do you see fourteen

1608
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,900
constitution saving throw? All right,

1609
01:29:26,900 --> 01:29:30,900
Roll to see if you can get the lid open on the spice.

1610
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:34,900
Dude, 19.

1611
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:38,900
So you release the spice.

1612
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:42,900
I have to dodge one attack.

1613
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:46,900
You have sensors.

1614
01:29:46,900 --> 01:29:50,900
You're dead. You're in chunks.

1615
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:54,900
You're in chunks.

1616
01:29:54,900 --> 01:30:00,500
Yeah, yeah, go ahead. He does try to attack you this time. He's trying to

1617
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:04,820
just smash down. You think I fucking lie about these roles. I've been watching

1618
01:30:04,820 --> 01:30:11,100
him like Patrick has been watching keeping 18 dude. How much how much I

1619
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:15,500
have to HP dog. We're done. Yeah, you guys are done. You thought you had to

1620
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,700
two H. P. I had to oh my God, HP

1621
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:22,120
yeah you die.

1622
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:26,600
We're all dead. I don't I'm so afraid of fucking dying.

1623
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:32,460
I don't want to die. I just I don't want to die him do okay, wait, wait, wait,

1624
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:37,000
all right, what's up? Can he can he get a hail Mary? Can he can he cook as he

1625
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:42,060
slips slips out of consciousness? Can I takes out you take out your materials

1626
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:45,880
on your ingredients and your tools, you take out a mandolin. Yeah, I'll let him

1627
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:50,600
let all of the of shallots. Let me look with my chunks and nobody's going to

1628
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:55,320
want that dog cook with he cooks. I think that is the save here is you are

1629
01:30:55,320 --> 01:31:00,120
allowed to do one more turn. If you cook with his chunk, I cook with his chunks.

1630
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:05,360
I cook with his fucking what electable dish. So he's really dead. Can I get the

1631
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:11,040
rambler up? If I win this? No, you just have to get another turn. Why you could

1632
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:14,080
You can hide, you can run, or you can hide.

1633
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:17,080
Well, what do I need to roll to use as chunks?

1634
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,080
You just need to roll a d20 to see what happens to his chunks.

1635
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,080
Hopefully it's not something...

1636
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:23,080
17.

1637
01:31:23,080 --> 01:31:24,080

01:31:37,080 --> 01:31:40,080

01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:46,680
Oh my God, just killing the role. Yep. Okay. He just that's a loaded dice dude.

No, this is...

1661
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:48,520
You're good.

1664
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:51,520
This is so fucked, dude.

1665
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:52,520
We're done.

1666
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,520
I'm done.

1667
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:54,520
All right.

Let's hear this.

1669
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:56,520
Let's hear this.

1670
01:32:56,520 --> 01:32:57,520
Can we hear?

1671
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:58,520
Fine.

1672
01:32:58,520 --> 01:32:59,520
I'll read it.

1673
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:00,520
No, this is fair.

1674
01:33:00,520 --> 01:33:01,520
Maybe I made him too overpowered or maybe you were.

1675
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:02,520
I don't know.

1676
01:33:02,520 --> 01:33:03,520
I don't know.

1677
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,520
I don't know.

1678
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:05,520
I don't know.

1679
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:06,520
I don't know.

1680
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:07,520
I don't know.

1681
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,520
I don't know.

1682
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:15,480
you were just goofing around like usual. Or maybe you gave me twenty pieces of

1683
01:33:15,480 --> 01:33:20,080
food to make that all suck shit. No, they were all actually pretty good.

1684
01:33:20,080 --> 01:33:23,560
Why are you like talking different when the filter's on? Pretty good, because I

1685
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:27,840
don't, no, pretty good. I was just talking a little bit higher than usual,

1686
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,680
because now I'm adjusting to the voice now. Okay, do it again, but talk lower.

1687
01:33:31,680 --> 01:33:34,200
Alright, let me try that. I'm gonna try to sound more... I'm not even like

1688
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:37,000
thinking about it. I like this

1689
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:46,280
Batman. Oh man, all right, Batman kind of cringe

1690
01:33:46,280 --> 01:33:50,680
I was like that, but if I had the squeaky voice of

1691
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:56,400
stop man, no, if I had the squeaky voice on, we've been fine. Okay, what's it?

1692
01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:00,160
What happens? What's the this is the worst ending we could have got? Yeah, so

1693
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:03,200
Optimus Wayne now

1694
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:13,100
takes has all the people and he has them all. The spell he casts cast them in his

1695
01:34:13,100 --> 01:34:14,200
as long as he lives,

1696
01:34:14,200 --> 01:34:20,460
they will be under his control. Wow, so he boards up. This is them. He turns the

1697
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:22,300
mansion into his fort

1698
01:34:22,300 --> 01:34:24,620
and

1699
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:28,980
rules over Gotham and spends the rest of his days trying to find his cousin.

1700
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:36,080
Bruce. It's actually a manor instead of mansion. Manor, yeah. Yeah. Okay. But yeah, his insatiable

1701
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:40,600
need for revenge has never... So this is like a Dark Knight, or this is a Dark Knight Returns

1702
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:47,840
style thing where it's like Bruce Wayne and Hamsteretta or whatever. They're training

1703
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,320
in secret. They're going to do like an uprising. Yeah, but here's the thing. Alfred is still

1704
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:56,820
still alive. Oh my God, I forgot he was at the dinner. I too is still alive.

1705
01:34:56,820 --> 01:35:01,980
Wait, wait, wait, Dylan ending. I need to hear it again. Say don't is still

1706
01:35:01,980 --> 01:35:04,740
alive. Dylan is still alive.

1707
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:08,460
That's

1708
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:11,380
doing the

1709
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:13,180
the Dylan

1710
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:16,880
and he gets a little self conscious. So he just starts bobbing his head and

1711
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:17,760
yeah, he goes like

1712
01:35:19,780 --> 01:35:25,380
he's pointing down yeah he's off beat yeah when you're a star, check my star

1713
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:26,820
yeah

1714
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:29,100
so there is

1715
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:31,180
because because

1716
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:32,820
Dylan is a

1717
01:35:32,820 --> 01:35:36,500
myself. It is blue and my favorite shirt,

1718
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:43,860
and my own shirt, so maybe maybe Dylan will find a way to win to to conquer.

1719
01:35:43,860 --> 01:35:48,020
You have a Dylan monologue. I do have a monologue. You have a deal in monologue,

1720
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:52,700
Dylan one. Okay, can you improvise a Dylan monologue after your monologue?

1721
01:35:52,700 --> 01:35:56,020
Sure, yeah, I can or start with a Dylan one. Yeah, I do Dylan. Yeah,

1722
01:35:56,020 --> 01:35:56,380
sure.

1723
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:58,980
That makes a lot more sense. Yeah.

1724
01:35:58,980 --> 01:36:00,660
Okay.

1725
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:07,500
Well, it's been tough. I gotta really figure out a way to stop this guy.

1726
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:11,820
He's super strong. Why does he need to stop the guy? I don't know. He's not

1727
01:36:11,820 --> 01:36:16,020
a superhero. He's driving his car. He levitated through the building. He

1728
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,380
he thinks he's got to stop the guy

1729
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:23,560
Dylan has powers, but he only one of the powers still and thinks he's the only

1730
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:24,240
guy who gets

1731
01:36:24,240 --> 01:36:27,980
doesn't know about

1732
01:36:27,980 --> 01:36:35,700
so stressed out. It is room he's on a computer right now he's writing for his

1733
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:39,780
blog yeah and he's just like well, it looks like I got to stop the guy and

1734
01:36:39,780 --> 01:36:44,580
he's like has like and it's his blog is words of an insomniac blog spot dot com

1735
01:36:44,580 --> 01:36:45,580
good.

1736
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:56,540
Oh man, like even I'm going to need my sleep and he is a little winky emoticon

1737
01:36:56,540 --> 01:37:01,780
yeah and he goes and he goes into his closet. He opens it up and he sees,

1738
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:05,300
first of all, all the same blue shirt, but only one with the gold star

1739
01:37:05,300 --> 01:37:13,240
and he puts it on and when he goes to he says Mom, I'm taking the table cloth

1740
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:16,840
and he goes to get the table cloth and ties it around his neck. Yeah, and he

1741
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:20,960
is like, oh, I almost forgot and he goes and he puts on his favorite pair of

1742
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:25,360
jeans and he goes, yeah, wranglers, they're wranglers, they're a little bit

1743
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:28,320
distressed and he thinks that's the coolest shit in the world. And his shoe,

1744
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:33,120
what's his cool superhero shoes? New Balance. Those are the cool dude. No,

1745
01:37:33,120 --> 01:37:36,800
what is it? I know, I know what Dylan's shoes are. He wears New Balance maybe

1746
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:42,080
normally. No, he wears those, what are they called? Starburys. No, wait, that's

1747
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:47,420
a good idea. He's wearing a pair of all birds, but then his super hero shoes are

1748
01:37:47,420 --> 01:37:48,420
starbreeze

1749

01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:57,560
Who knew my own cousin would betray me and round up my strongest foes and then

1798
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,160
pray them also.

1799
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:02,640
Sometimes it seems all people crave is chaos.

1800
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,480
It's a pain.

1801
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:06,800
It's the next great thing.

1802
01:41:06,800 --> 01:41:13,320
The next distraction, a respite from the slow death of life in Gotham just shows you what

1803
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,200
a place, what kind of place this is.

1804
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:19,560
I wonder if it's even worth saving.

1805
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:25,620
Maybe I should hang up the cape, the cow, the costume, put away the mask, go back to

1806
01:41:25,620 --> 01:41:30,620
to telling people to jump when they get close to the platform edge at the train station.

1807
01:41:30,620 --> 01:41:35,380
Or maybe Gotham needs more of an enlightening rod for the most sadistic people in the city

1808
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:41,020
to organize violent campaigns around. Maybe it needs something more substantial, something

1809
01:41:41,020 --> 01:41:49,260
that can last. Maybe a why. Maybe I'll make a why a really big one like, like five like

1810
01:41:49,260 --> 01:41:54,540
like five stories, but you pay for membership with crypto, but it's built on a sustainable

1811
01:41:54,540 --> 01:42:00,340
all block chains like environmentally sustainable. It's powered by solar wind

1812
01:42:00,340 --> 01:42:06,360
and not stupid. No one. I don't like that stupid. Maybe I'll stress up like a

1813
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:10,700
fucking bad. I don't know. He already did that. How does anyone like themselves,

1814
01:42:10,700 --> 01:42:11,020
man?

1815
01:42:11,020 --> 01:42:13,940
God, it's hard.

1816
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:17,500
I feel like we're all having a hard time, you know, in the city.

1817
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:24,260
The pandemic. In politics, yeah. Like, is voting enough? I don't know. Like, I

1818
01:42:24,260 --> 01:42:26,260
I consider myself a leftist but it's like damn

1819
01:42:26,260 --> 01:42:30,260
I should open a Y

1820
01:42:30,260 --> 01:42:32,260
and that's it

1821
01:42:32,260 --> 01:42:34,260
Wow

1822
01:42:34,260 --> 01:42:36,260
Something in the way

1823
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:38,260
Something in the way

1824
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:40,260
Yeah

1825
01:42:40,260 --> 01:42:42,260
Don't have any feelings

1826
01:42:42,260 --> 01:42:44,260
Blue shirt with gold star

1827
01:42:44,260 --> 01:42:46,260
Something in the way

1828
01:42:46,260 --> 01:42:48,260
Blue shirt with gold star

1829
01:42:48,260 --> 01:42:50,260
Blue shirt with gold star

1830
01:42:50,260 --> 01:42:52,260
Blue shirt with gold star

1831
01:42:52,260 --> 01:43:17,600
