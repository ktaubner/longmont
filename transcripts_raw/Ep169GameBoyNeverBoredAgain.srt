00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,040
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,860

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,700

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,540
- Okay, now recording.

8
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,360
- You know when you've been--

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,200
- Smells like Yoda's yurt right now.

10
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,880
- You know when you've been really gassy

11
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,040
and you've been sitting in your room like all day long?

12
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,880
- Yeah.

13
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,400
- And then you go to the kitchen and you get some water.

14
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,240
- And you go back in.

15
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,080
- And you come back and you just smell--

16
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
- Stink wave.

17
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,560
- Yeah, you haven't even farted in like an hour.

18
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,400
- Yeah.

19
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,220
- And you're in your room.

20
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,060
- It's just still in there.

21
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,880
- I just bought these two--

22
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,920
- It smells so bad.

23
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,300
You know those like gel like the things like the glade like gel things?

24
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,420
Yeah, the volcanoes?

25
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,140
Yeah, about two of those and then like these two things that like you stick

26
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:40,920
onto like the wall.

27
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,920
You went hard.

28
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,920
That says last like 60 days.

29
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,260
Yeah, because my room smelled like farts.

30
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,920
So I like left and then just like brought a bunch of like air fresheners to make it not smell.

31
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,920
That's so dominating though when you bring somebody over to your house and you've been gone all day.

32
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Why does it smell good?

33
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,420
And it still smells like farts.

34
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,420
Oh, I thought you were saying like, why does it smell good?

35
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:04,420
It's so dominating, have a nice smelling room.

36
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:08,420
Well, this smells too good. It smells too good, like what's the reason?

37
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,420
Yeah, it's clear that you're covering something up.

38
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:14,420
You know what the best, if it smells just like laundry, then it's like, okay.

39
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:16,420
This guy's never farted.

40
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,420
I'm gonna start boiling a fabuloso.

41
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,420
If I get a pair of pants clean, they smell like laundry for about 90 seconds when they're on my body.

42
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:30,940
on my body. And then I'll take them off. They're immediately dirty because of my stink and

43
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,940
my stench.

44
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,940
Me too.

45
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,940
Yeah, and my smells are there too.

46
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,220
Oh, I told you about I didn't do laundry for like a month.

47
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,220
Oh, yeah.

48
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,140
Yeah, and then, you know, I mean, my clothes smell good now, but there was like probably

49
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,100
like a week where I was just, you know, coming to hang out and just smelling like...

50
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,100
What's your limit on a shirt and a pair of pants?

51
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,400
i mean uh... pair of pants all rewire it's harder 'cause like

52
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,140
if i sweat in them when i was skating

53
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,760
parents like

54
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,540
ten months honestly and uh... six months maybe a bit

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,920
asserted her bidding the uh... i've heard like like

56
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,540
if i'm if i'm being really lazy and disgusting play like three days on a

57
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,020
shirt from the city of white shirt one day

58
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,380
well depends if you get a lot of pain and also at like you that's true yeah i

59
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,620
And if I'm wearing a shirt multiple days, it's because I'm literally just sitting in one place

60
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,620
for three days.

61
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,220
I mean, I do a lot of laundry because I, like, I don't know, I go out and skate too much.

62
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,220
But I didn't do...

63
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,220
You just told us you didn't do any laundry.

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
Yeah, and I also never fart, too.

65
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,220
I never fart.

66
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:34,220
I mean, I have a bunch of clothes is what I mean.

67
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,740
You do have a lot of clothes.

68
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,740
Yeah, I have two.

69
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:41,300
I just bought, like, I realized I only had two jackets, so then I went out and bought

70
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,300
four jackets.

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,860
Yeah, you remind me of a store.

72
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,980
Yeah, you are kind of like a store.

73
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,260
You're always getting new items and selling other items.

74
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,260
Yeah.

75
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,260
Yeah.

76
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,780
And like there's customers too.

77
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,780
Yeah.

78
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
A cash register.

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,900
You always got mad, now I think about it, you always got mad customers in your crib.

80
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,900
And your open and close sign, it always be changing.

81
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,900
True.

82
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
I guess that's true.

83
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
I guess you're right.

84
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:04,900

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,900
I guess that's right.

87
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,900
That's right.

88
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
You do kind of strike me as a guy who's going to turn 50 and open up a shop.

89
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,900
You do kind of strike me as a store.

90
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,900
A little bit.

91
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,900
You kind of, you're kind of like a...

92
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,900
I've always thought of you as a store.

93
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,900
There's something about you.

94
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,900
Maybe it's like, oh, I'm a little bit like a...

103
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:02,900
where they just sell dildos, bongs, and Donald Trump flags, and Wally sits like a

104
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,540
mannequin in the window of the shop to get people to come in. He just like sits

105
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:12,900
there all day. Wow. So now I have a pilgrimage. Yeah. Yeah. Now I have like, I

106
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,940
think, I think I have to, right? Like Islam dude, I think I have to do, I have to do my...

107
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,940
What? Islam. What? Say it like that. Islam dude. That's what it's called. What do you guys say?

108
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:30,300
Why did you say it like it's long? Islam. You're saying it like it's long. Islam.

109
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:43,420
Islam is long. Islam. Islam. Why are you saying it so long? Islam. Islam. That's a cube, you

110
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:48,060
gotta go there. It just makes sense. You gotta see the cube. You gotta kneel in front of

111
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,140
the cube. You gotta say hi to the cube. Do you kneel in front of the cube? Huh? Do you

112
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,860
kneel in front of the cube? I think you probably kneel when you pray. I think you glee to the

113
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,860
I think the thing is it's cool about Islam is that the cube you don't get

114
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,940
lead off like a card where they check to see if you're actually Muslim right you

115
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,660
go see the cube yeah you just gotta wear the white stuff you know that you know

129
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:26,500
I've been flip-flopping between becoming Reddit atheist and very TradCath. I don't know which

130
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,500
one is more annoying. You're gonna become TradCath? I'm gonna be very annoying. Are you gonna

131
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:39,900
become TradCath at Dimesquare? You fucking idiot. Between Reddit atheism and TradCath?

132
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:44,940
I'm gonna do Reddit atheism. I honestly hope a trucker kills you. I swear to fucking God.

133
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:50,460
I hope you get completely just meat-grinded by the front end of a Peterbilt.

134
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,060
No you don't.

135

I do.

136
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,060
That'd be so...

137
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,180
Yeah, and you're sitting there, you're smoking a fucking camel blue, talking about being Trad

138
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,100
Catholic Dimesquare, and some guy just turns you into mush.

139
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,820
Anyway, I think I'm going to become traditionally Catholic.

140
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,300
Now that'd be pretty cool.

141
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,780
I'm going to become Trad Muslim, dude.

142
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780

I'm going to get real into it.

145
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,780
Which one's more annoying?

146
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,660
I just finished reading Dune and I feel like I'm ready to become Muslim.

147
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,620
White Muslim or a traditional Catholic guy?

148
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,940
No white Muslim is cool as hell.

149
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,940
White Muslim is so sick dude.

150
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,940
It's awesome.

151
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:26,060
If I became white Muslim as a bald guy.

152
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,660

That's what they're doing to Timmy Chalamet.

160
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,620
Literally yeah.

00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,620
what? really?

170
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,620
no the worm is baron harkonen

171
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,620
yeah baron harkonen

172
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,620
patrick likes what he does to kids in the book

173
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,620
oh fuck i forgot about that

174
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,620
god damn it

175
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:13,340
And I forgot that they just made the villain of Dune just like a gay floating pedophile.

176
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,100
Yeah. So everybody's bad in the movie? There's not a good guy?

177
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,100
There's no good guy in Dune except the worm.

178
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,140
The worm sounded pretty cool. The worm is cool.

179
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,780
They should make a movie about him called Worm. Yeah.

180
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,940
Yeah. They should be mostly worm.

181
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,460
No. No.

182
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,020
Do they ride the worms? They do.

183
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,260
Yeah. Dude, I gotta fucking read this book.

184
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,580

187
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:51,020

188
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:58,620
cool as fuck he's cool he's like the movie was going to be so good everyone's

189
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,740
like he's a genius he's a fucking genius that thing where he was like for the um

190
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,220
What is it the ankle and call the history like comic like he was doing this thing recently

191
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:13,040
He's like I'm gonna announce the director soon like it's gonna blow your mind. Who's directing this and it was taiko with TT. Yeah

192
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,020
so cool, so funny to tease that for like a

193
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,980
Period of time like not just that's something you just have to come out and say yeah. Yeah, you can't get people hi

194
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,180
That's yeah, you gotta say like I mean who?

195
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:31,620
Who even is a director that would have been worth the hype? I mean him. I guess he's like a hundred years old

196
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,820
old. He's I think he's like ninety seven. Yeah. Yeah. It is funny that

197
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,740
Taika Waititi was first like I'm going to adapt Akira and then he's like no

198
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,340
you know what like people get mad if I do that. I'll do it.

199
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,140
Jodorowsky instead. The coolest thing about that Jodorowsky guy is his like

200
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:52,940
most famous movie. It's just like him and his son who's completely naked just

201
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,060
like hanging out for an hour and a half. Yeah. Yeah. He's a cowboy. His son is a

202
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,660
naked little boy who was a wiener out the entire movie and they just walk around.

203
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,660
Yeah.

204
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:05,860
He's like, "My soft penis was very funny in the movie."

205
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,860
Very cool.

206
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,860
I want to become an eclectic, I think.

207
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,860
Yeah.

208
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,860
I think I'm going to become eclectic.

209
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,860
Eclectic?

210
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,860
I think I'm going to become.

211
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,860
Eccentric or eclectic?

212
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,860
I think I might be both.

213
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Okay.

214
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,060
But that's also one of my eclectic and eccentric quirks is not knowing the difference.

215
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,060
Yeah.

216
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
Yeah.

217
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
I think I might become.

218
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,060
I thought I've been doing that.

219
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:33,020
just a mental disorder. Yeah, which disorder? ADHD. That's not eccentric. No. Or a disorder.

220
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:38,540
You need to be, to be eccentric you need to really hurt people's feelings. Yeah. I think

221
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:42,460
I'm gonna start flipping people off more. I'm like basically the most eccentric guy

222
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:48,340
like in the city. No, I'm becoming a white Muslim. I'm pretty. Oh, deep go go go go go

223
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,020

beard and the guy freaks out so hard that he leaves the room the guys that

240
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,760
somebody freaks in like improv and shit and you see like in every improv class

241
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,640
there's always like one guy who every time he's in a scene with like a female

242
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:35,240
like a female person he's sitting there and they're like okay start the scene

243
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,760
and he goes I mean he's like uh hi I'm a professional pussy eater and I'm here to

244
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,560

245
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,760
keeps doing it every year. So cool. There's always someone who like

246
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,600
literally can't yeah like there's a mental block that they can't not do

247
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,640
stuff like that. The episode of The Office where Michael Scott keeps

248
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,920
having the gun, that guy doesn't exist but the guy who his gun is that he's a

249
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:05,400
sexual predator is in every single class. Yeah. It's so cool. Yeah. What a

250
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,240
beautiful art that is. Yeah. As a white Muslim I'm like that's like I think

251
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,560
think one of the big pillars right now is improv is evil.

252
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:19,560
I thought you were going to say one of the big pillars of Islam is improv.

253
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,680
It's improv, graffiti, knowledge.

254
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,680
That's big.

255
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:31,880
Improv, graffiti, knowledge, where to get the best curtains for your apartment.

256
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,440
And basically just chilling.

257
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,440
And a square hat.

258
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,920
Yeah, that's the uniform. That doesn't like go into the pillars. I want that square hat so bad.

259
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,800
Yeah, it's so cool. It fixes any head shape. Yeah, yeah. I would like to join a

260
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:52,640
religion where I can wear a knight's helmet every day. You can be a Templar.

261
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,680
I would love to be a Templar. You should become a Templar. In my religion,

262
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,240
Pasipharianism, you can wear a colander on your head. Yeah, my

263
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,720
jousting lance shall strike thy head from thine shoulders. So, and I'm gonna

264
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,120
pray to I'm gonna pray to Muhammad to shoot you with a laser yeah yeah he's

265
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,800
got a laser I know that it's got everything dude he's practically God

266
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:23,080
jr. you're not allowed to see what he looks like cuz he was he was he was an

267
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,920
awesome creature he's a what he was a creature I don't know if we can continue

268
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:37,280
you this bit. And he looked like this. Can we just reverse this whole... You can't draw him, but you can say what he looked like.

269
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:40,840
You can't say... I don't think you can say what he looks like. He had a cherubic face.

270
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:48,120
And he had a corn pop. He looked exactly... He had a corn cob pipe in a button nose.

271
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,480
He looked exactly like the puppet from Saw. That's what he looked like.

272
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
I don't think this is a good move for us.

273
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,480
He looked like Cheesosaurus Rex.

274
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
He did.

275
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,480
I don't think this is...

276
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,480
And he would skate on cheese all through the Middle East.

277
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,480
And everybody's like, "What the fuck? That guy's like God's junior right now."

278
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,480
Is there going to be a fartwa on us?

279
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,480
There's going to be a fartwa on you pretty soon when I fart on your mouth.

280
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,480
This is not good.

281
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,480
I'm declaring a fartwa on Patrick.

282
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
If you see him, you have to fart on him.

283
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
No, don't do that because someone will really do it.

284
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,640
That's why I'm hoping somebody if someone comes okay

285
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:30,940
If you don't have the self-respect if a stranger to fart that farts on you like if you don't have the self-respect to punch them in

286
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,520
The face that's on you. There's not um that is on you if you see Patrick. Please go if you're crazy, please fart on

287
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,040
Please come up to him while he's skating. He bends over to pick up his board. You just fart his face

288
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,920
I will fucking hit them with my trucks. Thank good. That's a big

289
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,620
I've always wanted to do that.

290
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,600
- Hit someone, you've never--

291
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,760
- You psycho! - Never done a truck smack

292
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,220
someone? - What's wrong with you?

293
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,580
- I've always wanted to truck smack somebody.

294
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,060
Dude, it's so-- - Now I'm instituting

295
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,540
a gun law on you, where somebody has to use their gun on you.

296
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,260
- Like, it's so sick, like I've seen it in a movie.

297
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:03,980
- Truck smacking, is that what they call it?

298
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,580
- Yeah, you grab it by the other truck

299
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,260
and you just kinda like swing it.

300
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,600
- I gotta say, that would hurt.

301
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,040
- Yeah. - Yeah, that'd be bad.

302
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,100
- Yeah, it's metal and wood, the two types of bats

303
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,460
combined into one. - True, oh my god,

304
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,080
it's a super bat. - And a wheel.

305
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
Yeah, and polyurethane.

306
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,080
Yeah, that's a serious bat.

307
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:20,580
Yeah.

308
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,080
It's true.

309
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,080
Probably one of the scariest bats of all time.

310
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Besides, hey, Dracula in his bat form.

311
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,080
You think that's the scariest one, but which one do you see more often?

312
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,580
Dracula in his bat form.

313
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,080
Really?

314
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,080
Yeah, he's in my window most nights.

315
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,080
Ah, damn. I'm sorry, man.

316
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,580
Yeah, it's kind of annoying.

317
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:38,080
Yeah.

318
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,580
Yeah.

319
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
He's always asking to hang out.

320
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,080
He's always tapping on the window. He says, "Hey, can I come in?"

321
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,080
I say, "Like, maybe tomorrow, man, because I don't want to be, like, rude."

322
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:51,320
rude. I mean you can't just be like no. Yeah he has a dark board. Yeah it's like every few

323
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,400
hours. Tap tap tap tap tap. Where did the thing that Dracula can only be in, he has to be invited

324
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,680
in, where did that come from? He's like really awkward low key. Yeah. Like he doesn't, he's

325
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,040
the kind of guy who like he doesn't get invited to stuff and he sits around and he's like

326
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,720
man like I feel like I don't have any friends but if he reached out to people they'd be

327
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,280
like come on come out but he just kind of like you know. He just like doesn't make that

328
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,280
extra effort to actually be social.

329
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,400
Yeah, he doesn't really put himself out there.

330
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,240
I do like to think that maybe that rule was like Dracula was trying to go into someone's

331
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,240
house and he was like, "No, no, no, no, no, no.

332
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,160
You can't come in here unless I invite you."

333
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,480
Yeah, it was maybe somebody's house rule that he thought was a rule about hair.

334
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
Yeah, and he was like, "Ah, shit.

335
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
This is a rule for...

336
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,880
I just turned into a damn Dracula.

337
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,880
I don't know.

338
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,400
I don't know any of these goddamn rules."

339
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,280
Well, what happened was he saw like a cheeky, sarcastic welcome mat that was like, "You're

340
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:46,000
not welcome in here and he's like oh my god yeah words have a sort of power back

341
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,920
then true that's what I said the penis might ear than the sword mm-hmm it's

342
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:59,360
true yeah I'm seriously just getting that mm-hmm the power of words whoa I

343
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:09,280
love wordplay so much yeah yeah it's this abracadabra which is oh my god what

344
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,160
you do you take away all this word that's what I always got their words you can

345
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,200
speak anymore

346
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
all the old real alakazam

347
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,680
what the fuck is a big ever could have a good normal again

348
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:28,400
I'm actually think I feel like I do

349
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,800
how much do you guys believe in magic uh not that I says before I don't think

350
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,240
bad I think energy

351
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,320
it's a little energy do you think we can maybe like try to harness it sometime

352
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,540
i think we could i think we should get i think we could read a spell book

354
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,400
all of the subject of the handbook of america still have a we need to create

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
one hundred and i don't know our own type of like chaos magic thing yeah i

356
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,180
think we could develop a decision making

357
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,740
huh sigils yeah we can make sigils to be part of it

358
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,840

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,440
now uh... those are the symbols that that the draw

360
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,280
there'll be a little bit of sigil to dispel nightmares

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,320
stuff like that smiley face

362
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,840
smiley face that's good to know that it'll spread happiness

363
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,880

00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:42,320

420
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,600
something the Aki way he gets at the Aki way he goes no this isn't what I aced

421
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:53,040
for yeah I wanted it the Auckland way that's pretty good mm-hmm yeah yeah New

422
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,640
New Zealand guy in New York is pretty funny to me.

423
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,340
Yeah, imagine if that happened.

424
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,540
Imagine if two New Zealand guys lived in New York and they sang songs.

425
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:06,220
I mean like, you know, like cool New Zealand.

426
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,140
Imagine how crazy their fan would be too.

427
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,140
Yeah, oh my god.

428
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:17,240
And they would have a crazy manager who works at the fruit stand being rude to them.

429
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,460
But then it turns out many years later that he was actually the reason for a few women.

430
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,380
I think I love their song about robots as well.

431
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,300
Yeah, I think I might love all their songs.

432
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Yeah.

433
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:30,180
And I think I might often get them confused with Bo Burnham if they did that.

434
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:31,980
That was my favorite show when I was a little kid.

435
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,980
Really?

436
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Yeah.

437
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
You must have been so annoying.

438
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Yes, I was.

439
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980

440
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
You know what my favorite show was?

441
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,980
You don't think I'm annoying now?

442
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,980
No.

443
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,980
No, you're my good friend.

444
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:41,980
I would never call you annoying.

445
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
You know what my favorite show was?

446
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,460
You don't think that's continued on into my adult life?

447
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,460
Fuck no.

448
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Come on, dude.

449
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,780
I'm just trying to get people to fart on you.

450
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,220
I don't dislike you. I just want to see you smell.

451
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,420

452
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,060
I'm preying on your smell fall.

453
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,180
Your downy fall.

454
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,420
Because you're going to have to wash your damn clothes.

455
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,380
You know what?

456
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,460
Have you guys ever seriously considered getting one of those pads that makes your fart smell good?

457
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,100
Yes.

458
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:09,660

Especially.

462
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,820
It's like a fucking pad that a woman wears for her vagina.

463
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,700
Oh, come on.

464
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,820

466
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,100
will say that

467
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,140

475
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:47,260
to be a point where you get a hemorrhoid minute

yeah you serious like a big emerald right now you're worried about farting

479
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:09,700
out a blood bubble yeah that floats out of my like back

480
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,700
it's a little rascal

481
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
it just pops up out of your pants

482
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
it pops out like

483
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,700
it flies, you watch it

484
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,700
it goes out the window and floats down

485
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
and like pops on like a grandmother

486
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:24,700
it floats down 5th avenue and just hits Imrata in the face

487
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,700
like a big bubble gum

488
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,700
just pops, he's covered in red

489
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:33,700
oh sorry, that's my hemorrhoid fart

490
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,700
whose hemorrhoid blood bubble fart was that?

491
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:47,540
that? Not me! She just goes like, "It was you!" And he's more like hemorrhoid-a.

492
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:52,660
Oh my god. But if you had that pad the bubble would be clear and beautiful and

493
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:57,000
when it popped on Emrata she'd marry you. Yeah she'd say, "Who was that? It was you!"

494
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,260
And then you'd probably suck your dick. It smelled so good when it popped all over me.

495
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:08,880
is that your bubble that bubble that bubble smelled so good it's like a

496
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,540
clear bubble but you can see like green gas inside it floating floating around

497
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,540
and it pops in her face yeah it looks like the remember all from a Harry

498
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,140
Harry Potter, she becomes

499
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:25,020
like it's like the Palantir, Lord of the

500
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,060
Saron's eye.

501
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:35,040
It's like a like like a roiling fog with like a burning red eye and it's seeking

502
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,100
out amrata down the street.

503
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,120
It's like swerving around a homeless women. She's running

504
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,780
whatever he'll break. She's back

505
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
(laughter)

506
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,780
It just swallows her whole?

507
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
Yeah.

508
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,780
And then she falls in love with you and you get to swallow her whole.

509
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:56,780
I'm worried that that's going to happen with, because I have a hemorrhoid.

510
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:58,780
That exact situation is going to happen.

511
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:01,780
Is it that Emorada falls in love with you and becomes your fart slave?

512
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,780
She's not going to become my fart slave.

513
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,780
What the hell are you fucking talking about?

514
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,780
If she likes it, she will.

515
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,780
I would never have a fart slave.

516
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,780
Why not?

517
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,780
You know why.

518
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:12,780
I've seen your fart gear.

519
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,780
You might already have one.

520
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,180
You might have a... I saw your butt to face tube. I would have a fart employee.

521
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:26,380
Alright. You'd pay them? You'd get paid in farts. That's what a fart slave is. You pay them in farts, they love it.

522
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:31,280
Yeah. They're a voluntary slave. I saw your butt straw in your room. I know what you're up to. My butt straw?

(laughter)

527
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,680
I saw it in your closet.

528
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,680

535
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,680
(laughter)

536
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,680
And then there's another crock pot that you fart into

537
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,680
and cover and cook it.

538
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,680

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:04,440
It was the worst things I've ever seen feels me on there. They'd call it Poodo TV

And like it like just like literally like it just felt like a shit sick dude. It's so it's crazy. What like I

610
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,520
I'm I live in fear of what yeah, it's like when I was watching let's plays in middle school

611
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,100
I settled for this a guy talking in a monotone voice

612
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
for an hour with nothing.

613
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
I mean that shit was boring as fuck though.

614
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
I hated watching it. I watched like episode

615
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
one of every let's play and then I was just like

616
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,400
yeah I don't even care. I shut it off halfway

617
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,400
through like I don't give a shit. Yeah I always think like

618
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
I would always think like oh I can't like

619
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,400
play this game so I'll watch someone else play it and then I'd try

620
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,400
to watch it and be like this isn't worth it.

621
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,400
I'll just pretend the game doesn't exist.

622
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I don't want it anymore. I can't watch Pluto TV anymore.

623
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,400
Yeah? Yeah. I changed

624
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
a channel to this one channel and it

625
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
was just a camera of the back of my head watching

626
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:16,360
I just gave up on it. That's how it's free though. That's true. That's how they pay for it. Yeah.

627
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,600
I look back there's nothing behind me. Yeah. It's a very scary experience. You know what,

628
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,200
on Pluto TV Fail Army, they sometimes they'll play the ones where it's like dads hurting

629
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,760
their kids by accident. Yeah. Those dads should be put to death. I agree. They just play the

630
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,480
Daddy of Five videos. That segment makes me so mad. Careless dads hitting their kids in

631
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,480
the face because they're trying to do a fortnite dance.

632
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Dude, that shit does not fly as well.

633
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,480

00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,480
"This is funny as shit, this is good

638
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,480
content." No. No.

639
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,480
Damn, that was a crazy saga. What did he did?

640
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,480
He like,

641
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,480
did this, it was this thing called

642
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
the invisible ink prank where him and his wife just

643
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
put a bunch of like,

644
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,480
disappearing ink on their carpet

and he's like "It's just a prank!" like he like made the kids like cry like so hard.

648
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,080

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,600
Holy shit.

651
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,240
And then he would make the kids fight each other but one of them like two of

652
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,320
them were like his kids from a previous marriage.

653

667
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,560
for the rest of the day.

668
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,560

669
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,400

670
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,840
- Like I don't own a book, you fucking idiot.

671
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,400
Like it's all just, I have DVDs in my room.

672
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,240
What are you gonna do?

673
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,760
- Do your parents ever try to implement the like,

674
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,280
it's like, oh, you can only play video games

675
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,840

676
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:53,680

677
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,500
- Fuck no.

678
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,000
- That shit was the worst.

679
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,440
Yeah, I think they gave up on that in middle school and I discovered like...

680
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,800
They tried that every two weeks and then gave up on it within the hour because we would

681
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,440
just fight each other?

682
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Yeah.

683
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,120
Well, for me it was just that like, yeah, that was all I did.

684
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,120
So you couldn't...

Right, me too.

687
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,520
My mom would try to get me off the computer and it was just like, this is all I do.

688
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Yeah.

689
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:27,040
put a they tried to put a like a a fucking web like watcher on my computer

690
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,360
yeah like blocked me from shit and they didn't realize you could just close the

691
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,960
app yeah yeah so I just oh yeah that was yeah

692
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,920
all day you my uncle my uncle Paul I think I talked about this before but my

693
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:43,640

695
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,400
went to a new web page you would have to type in a password and only my mom knew

696
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,960
the password so I just kept going to like a website that would just keep having

697
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,760
like pop-up windows and then eventually my mom got so annoyed by it that he made

698
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,160
her him like shut it off she's just like look I don't know I just I guess my kids

700
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,360
examples was like oh look at these watching fucking porky pigs swearing

701
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,960
Porky Pig shouldn't be swearing.

702
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:25,400
Do you guys remember the first like naughty thing you saw?

703
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Like the first bad flash video?

704
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
I saw the first...

705
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,800
The raunchy flash video.

706
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,800
I tried to go to...

707
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,400
I thought askjeeves.com before it was just ask.com.

708
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,320
I went to askjeeves.com, got a pop-up that said like "Find your dream girl" and it was

709
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:45,000
a nude woman and I got so scared that my parents were going to see that that I closed the laptop

710
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,760
and I ran to my room.

711
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:54,520
I mine was it was this video that was it was like a like a newgrounds video and it

712
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:59,600
was like a like a kid's cartoon of a guy saying like singing the ABCs and then at

713
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:07,600
the end he was like he's like next time what won't you suck my dick fuck you

714
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:16,400
I just wanted to know why he sees. No. It was awesome dude. He's like, fuck you suck my

715
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,520
dick. Fuck you. I think, do you know that that one, uh, this, this is different, but

716
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,200
you know that one weird Al song that's about like, like Santa killing everybody. Oh yeah.

717
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,080
We printed out the, the, the lyrics to that. I had that like in elementary school. Yeah.

718
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,000
That one. I think that was probably, I don't know. There's probably something I don't remember

719
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,400
though. There was a big one. The flash video of him killing all the elves and shit, that

720
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,520
was cool. Happy Tree Friends was up there too. Happy Tree Friends like scared me too much

721
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,800
I think. Me too, I like to watch it. I like watched one and I was like oh my god. That

722
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,000
follow up video. Honestly, when you're a kid it's as bad as an ISIS beheading video. Yeah,

723
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,520
it's so scary. Dude that follow up video, follow up boy video, Carpal Tunnel of Love

724
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,520
is a Happy Tree Friends like collab and I saw that and I was like why are they doing this?

725
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:10,100

726
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,160

727
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,960
yeah that's like yeah that's like oh like this is that's like the equivalent

728
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:21,840
of like a dark web video yeah when you're when you're a kid yeah exactly

729
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,320
like why does this not as if you're watching this is yeah two guys want it

730
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:30,080
should be arrested for making somebody needs to arrest these these branches and

731
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
things that the squirrels are falling on to.

732
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,080
Alright, this list here.

733
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,080
Top 10 best letters in the English alphabet.

734
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,080
If you're wondering why we went long on the non-list stuff today,

735
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,080
it's because they don't like this list, but I think it's a great list.

736
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,080
Number one is A. What do you guys think of the letter A?

737
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,080
I think the letter A is doing too much.

738
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Yeah? Here's the top comment here.

739
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Such a revolutionary yet grotesquely beautiful letter.

740
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:59,080
Words can't describe how linearly three of those lines form

741
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:03,280
with graceful angles making such a perfectly shaped triangle of such sheer

742
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,920
beauty bound within those strong lines there's some words right there bitch with

743
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:10,680
the letter a you have the power to save even the worst world problems currently

744
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:14,320
existing in this planet called earth but not many people understand this letter

745
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,720
is the way and the true meaning that unlocks the essence of life what was that

746
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:28,120
I got supper yeah junkyard dudes without a earth is just earth that's so true

747
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,880
A is the angelic letter and represents the number one. A is awesome in all ways. Say

748
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,360
it with grades or with always coming at first. Even in alphabates, it represents the first

749
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:44,880
letter. Awesome! Wow. I think this letter sucks. I'm not a fan of A either. I think

750
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,560
A is for assholes and asshats. Yup. Yeah. Fuck it. Easy A? Yeah, more like fuck you

751
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,040
A. Talking about that movie? Yeah. With the fucking Emma Stone. Stupid ass bitch. I don't

752
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
I don't remember her name.

753
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
I respect her as an actress.

754
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,040
I'd like to kick some dirt under her shins.

755
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
No!

756
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,560
Disrespect her shoes a little.

757
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:06,560
She needs to go to the dentist.

758
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,560
She's good in Superbad.

759
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
She needs to get a paddle.

760
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,560
She needs to be paddled by the principal.

761
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,560
What other movie is she in?

762
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,560
Easy A.

763
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,560
She was in Easy A.

764
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,560
She was also in Superbad and Easy A.

765
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,560
And then I think back in 2008 she was in Superbad.

766
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I remember Easy A, the whole thing with that movie.

767
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
I remember Easy A, the whole thing with that movie.

768
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
I remember Easy A, the whole thing with that movie.

769
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
I remember Easy A, the whole thing with that movie.

770
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,560
I remember Easy A, the whole thing with that movie.

771
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,560
I remember Easy A, the whole thing with that movie.

772
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,560
And then I think back in like 2008, she was in Superbad.

773
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:24,960
Yeah.

774
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,360
I remember Easy A, the whole thing with that movie was like,

775
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:30,240
what if she might show her nipples in this?

776
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,440
And she didn't. It was like, this movie's fucking stupid, bro.

777
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,080
It's about the Scarlet Letter and then we had to read the Scarlet Letter in school,

778
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,000
so they'd be like, oh, well, this is like, oh, yeah.

779
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,360
Yeah, it's just like Easy A.

780
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,680
Can you guys just draw like literally a big circle and then a small circle on the board?

781
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,120
I feel like a bunch of like English teachers probably paid the director of that movie to

782
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,380
to make it yeah yeah can you can you can you as you know teachers control

797
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
Just like not understanding at all.

798
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
It's like everyone at your new church is mad at you.

That's like our number one guy, you fucking idiot.

Number two.

805
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
Now I'm the fourth right scholar on it.

806
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,320
So y'all like Vinnie Pass?

807
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,320
What's up?

808
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,320
Jerimon, heavenly divine, steadily shining 99.

809
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,580
(laughing)

810
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:37,640
- Do you think he like crushes at his mosque?

811
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,480
- Probably.

812
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,760
- Do you think like he let his mosque like him?

813
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,600
- Oh yeah.

814
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,420
- You think so?

815
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,260

816
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:44,100
So.

00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:44,920
- Yeah, well kinda, yeah.

818
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,760
- He probably gives back.

819
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,200
- But he's famous also for like talking about like

820
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,280
shooting the Pope in the head.

821
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,120
And he shows up at the mosque.

822
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,720
- Well, the Muslims would like that.

823
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:53,680
- I guess, I don't know.

824
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,520
- Yeah, right?

825
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,360
That's what they want, right?

826
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,200
- That's the whole thing.

827
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,280
- You know all the religions have like a big like,

828
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,880
like anchorman style battle at the end of the year.

829
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,380

913
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,500
name in the last letter of the middle name.

914

So true.

915
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:31,400

It's a very sweet ladder.

Damn, it's crazy they got Borat on here.

924
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,920
How did they get Borat for this?

925

My country names start with this letter, so I love it.

932
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:13,160
My name starts with S, and that's from Sean.

933
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,760
Someone had all three, I saw in an earlier comment, all three names start with an S.

934
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
Whoa.

935
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,160

00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,280
Yes, it is for the best courtoon, SpongeBob.

The thing is like, what are some...

940
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,680
I can only think of bad things when I think of the letter S.

941
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,680
I think of bad words.

942
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,680
Yeah, put two of those together, it's the worst thing in the world.

943
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,680
Sinister.

944
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:45,680
Snake, Sinister, SJW.

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,000

Oh no you don't.

1013
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,380
Stupid ass.

1014
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:52,380
Seeing him hail a cab is funny.

1015
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:59,680
Yeah, but the letter s is pretty yeah pretty good third letter e e

1016
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,220
Yeah

1017
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:17,860
Fuck my BFF Ellie is awesome. She is energetic and everything you can possibly be that's so true. Here's

1018
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:23,460
My name is Emmett Martin

1019
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,460
That's all it says.

1020
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,780
It's twice in a row.

1021
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,180
Oh cool, now we're doxing people in the podcast.

1022
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,460
English starts with L.

1023
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:36,700
Here's my name is Emmett Martin, it begins with E. Another comment.

1024
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:41,500
I'm Emmett Martin, best letter.

1025
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,260
There's gotta be more, right?

1026
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,260
Let's see.

1027
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,260
Oh no, the last comment's just yes.

1028
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,420
Alright, fourth best letter, Z.

1029
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,420
Z?

1030
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,260
I feel like Z is maybe number one, dude.

1031
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:52,260
Z is pretty good.

1032
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,180
is the rarest letter. It's one of the most exclusive letters. You ever play the uh Scrabble? The

1033
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:02,860
alphabet game in the car? You try to find all the letters? Dude, Z, J, and Q. Those are some

1034
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:08,100
rare letters. Yeah. J you'd think you'd see more often because of how many people are

1035
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,940
named Jim. Yeah but people don't usually, that's like gone out of vogue to put your

1036
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,980
first name as a vanity plate on the back of your car. I remember there was years, everybody

1037
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:24,780
had a fucking just their name I'm a shit ton of vanity plates Doug hmm

1038
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:32,980
zoo Hitler bought in New York this is bad news zebras that I wonder what it's like

1039
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:40,060
with SS stripes I wonder what it's like to be a cop when you're like you like

1040
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:45,940
calling in like a pursuit on a guy with a vanity plate yeah yeah yeah

1041
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:49,140
Red Lamborghini, license plate says Tweety Bird

1042
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:52,540
TWTYBRD

1043
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,060
License plate says Hitler

1044
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:00,700
I saw, I don't know if I can say it

1045
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,780
because it's like an antiquated slur

1046
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:08,300
but I saw a license plate in Boston that had

1047
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:13,140
ok then they did it on purpose yeah and it had a big bald eagle on the back of the truck

1048
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,140
That's cool. What did it say?

1049
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,140
Can I... Hold on.

1050
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:19,140
Can we pause it?

1051
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,140
I'll pause it.

1052
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,140
Alright, my bad. It was a different word.

1053
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,140
It was mulatta.

1054
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,140
Yeah, he said it. You know what Pat says?

1055
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,140
If it's good enough for Huck Finn, it's good enough for him.

1056
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,140
[laughter]

1057
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,140
You said I could say it.

1058
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,140
No, I didn't.

1059
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,140
We said not to say it.

1060
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:39,140
That kid in overalls holding a frog behind you.

1061
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:41,140
Check this one. I found Link and Park.

1062
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,140
Link and Park is so good.

1063
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:45,140
I have a lot of license plates.

1064
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:47,140
I had a folder on my old phone of all the license plates.

1065
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:49,140
I really wish I got a picture of Mayhem.

1066
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,140
That's my favorite one I've seen.

1067
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,140
Check this one out.

1068
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:55,140
I found Agony.

1069
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:57,140
Agony is way better than Mayhem.

1070
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,140
It was on a poor focus.

1071
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,140
New Hampshire plate that just says Estrogen.

1072
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:03,140
That's good.

1073
00:53:03,140 --> 00:53:05,140
My favorite is still the one I saw in LA that just said Da World.

1074
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,140
New Hampshire plate.

1075
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,140
Evil Dead.

1076
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:13,580
around it that says I love my Siberian Husky.

1077
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:19,980
Yeah. This is a good, this is the best one I ever saw. Oh I did, I did. This was, this was

1078
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,860
it, so there was a dentist that when I lived in Laconia and I went to community

1079
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,940
college there I would ride my bike past a dentist's office and one of the

1080
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:37,220
dentists had Killary as his license plate. That is the sickest shit I've ever seen. Yeah. I did see, I saw, I saw, I saw DC Joker with a

1081
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,780
the bumper sticker that said I don't play well with others on it and I saw a

1082
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:47,540
sports car with black Goku as a license plate that's so this is a handicapped

1083
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:52,580
New Hampshire plate it says meme that's good and then the main one that says

1084
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:57,780
L'chaim cool with a lobster on it you should be able to get you know you can

1085
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:01,220
get the handicap like the guy in the wheelchair on the back you should be

1086
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,660
able to get anything there I think yeah I should be able to get bad luck Brian on

1087
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:12,100
my on my that'd be good. Here's one. Yiffin. Okay. You know, like furry sex. I

1091
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:33,020
that in the parking lot of I'm pissed off. I'll never think of a better one

1092
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,020
and then agony.

1093
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,820
I feel like that's like the funniest one to me.

1094
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:39,100
This is a crazy one I saw in New York.

1095
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,100
What is that guy's?

1096
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,100
E1 patron.

1097
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,100
Yo!

1098
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,740
That was in New York?

1099
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:45,740
Yeah.

1100
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:46,740
E1 patron?

1101
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:47,740
Yeah.

1102
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,060
I guess someone who's a big fan.

1103
00:54:49,060 --> 00:54:54,260
It says E1 patron and there's a picture of Scooby Doo and Shaggy on the back.

1104
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,540
I wonder what that actually means.

1105
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:57,020
I think that's Branson's car.

1106
00:54:57,020 --> 00:54:58,020
That might be Branson's car.

1107
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,020
Not a bad idea.

1108
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:04,420
Yeah, if it fit I would love to get one that was like suffering on like the worst car ever.

1109
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,920
This one, Black and Tan.

1110
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:06,920
Nice.

1111
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,300
I'm flipping that car off when I see it.

00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,300
That's sick dude.

1113
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,300
I flipped that shit off.

1114
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:12,300
You don't like black and tans?

1115
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,260
Oh well you already said the mulatta thing so.

No.

1117
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,260
That's not what that means.

1118
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:17,260
I heard that.

1119
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:19,020
This is one I keep seeing in my neighborhood.

"Ahh! Stop! See I told you!"

It's like a completely... the reaction I can't control.

00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,560
It's like you're hitting the top of my kneecap.

1147
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:04,800
I just instinctively go like "Ahh! Don't do it again!"

1193

1194

*laughter*

1197
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:41,720
He's done. What's the next letter? I'm white as a sheet. No, you're as red as a red sheet.

1198
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:54,500
Next letter, number six is X. Yeah, shout out to Xavier. That's our boy. Letters that start

1199
00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:02,960
with Z sound cool. Change that Z to an X and now it looks cool. True. Symmetrical and underused.

1200
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,960
Plus you know it's all about...

1201
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,960
AHHHHH! Stop!

1202
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,960
Alright, I'm serious. We have to stop.

1203
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,960
It's going to be too loud.

1204
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,960
People won't like it. It's not very fun.

1205
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,960
It's not fun to get...

1206
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,960
It's not fun.

1207
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:18,960
It's not fun.

1208
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,960
It's not fun.

1209
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,960
I'm serious.

1210
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,960
It's not fun.

1211
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,960
You have to do a sound.

1212
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,960
I have sensitive ears.

1213
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,960
I love X.

1214
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:32,960
I used to put XXX a lot.

1215
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:33,960
Whoa, hold up.

1216
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,960
What do you mean by that?

1217
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:37,960
Nobody uses this thing.

1218
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,960
I use it.

1219
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:41,960
It's in my fucking search bar.

1220
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:43,960
Number seven is M.

1221
00:59:43,960 --> 00:59:45,960
That one, oh that's just a list of words.

1222
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:47,960
Yep.

1223
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:55,960
It makes such an appealing, comforting sound and starts some of my favorite words, which I appreciate for the way they sound or how it feels to say them.

1224
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:59,960
Melody, music, moxie, marvelous, m-

1225
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,120
(yells)

1226
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:01,960
- God damn it, dude.

1227
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,320
- No, I'm controlling it now.

1228
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:04,960
You've done it too much, I told you.

1229
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,800
- You overdid it.

1230
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,280
- And you leaned in and I knew you were gonna do it.

1231
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,240
- You overdid it.

1232
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:09,560
- I'm desensitized.

1233
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,280
- I'm going back and editing them all out.

1234
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:12,120
- I'm desensitized.

1235
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:12,960
- You soured it.

1236
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,760
- I thought I had one more in me.

1237
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:17,440
- No, it's because there's no situation normally

1238
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:20,680
where you would try to read a list of words this long.

1239
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,080
- You would literally be--

1240
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:23,960
- It was way too out of character.

1241
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:27,000
You started the first word and I was like, really?

1242
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,840
- Yeah, I was like, wait,

1243
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,940
Pat really wants to like read the list.

1244
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:30,880
- Hmm.

1245
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:31,720
- What?

1246
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,560
- Look, I--

1247
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,480
- He's not like eating a chip.

1248
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,160
See, that wasn't loud enough.

1249
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,000
- Yeah.

1250
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,120
- Yeah, although the hand kind of got, it almost got me.

1251
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:39,940
- Yeah.

1252
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,400
- Yeah, he outstretched his hand like a 3D movie.

1253
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,160
But Pat kind of ruined everything.

1254
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,440
- Yeah, I think I got fucked up.

1255
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,440
- He scared me enough.

1256
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,560
I think I'm over my fear of loud noises.

1257
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,400
- Yeah, we did CBT. - And sudden.

1258
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,240
- Congratulations.

1259
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,520
- I'm over my-- - We did CBT on Caleb.

1260
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,360
- I used to have a real fear of--

1261
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,280
- Yeah, I have a fear of immersion therapy.

1262
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,360
- Okay, I'll say that. - Caleb Pits.

1263
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:58,080
guys, I'd like to thank you both. I used to have a real fear of sudden things,

1264
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:02,960
but now I've gotten over that fear and now sudden suddenly doesn't ever scare

1265
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,840
me anymore. Suddenly the number eight is C. Well, that's scary. It starts with

1266
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:11,760
suddenly. That's true. That's C. I love C.

1267
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:18,480
It's my favorite letter because I'm Caden with the C and I'm the biggest

1268
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,800
Ryan C. Crest

1269
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:25,600
Ryan Seacrest.

1270
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:30,100
Siri says, with a C, says, "Take a guess while I voted for this one."

1271
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:30,600
True.

1272
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,600
Damn.

1273
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:33,600
Number 9 is L, Caleb's favorite letter.

1274
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,600
Number 10 is J, Patrick's favorite letter.

1275
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,100
Yeah, because it's backwards L.

1276
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,600
Because he smoked a damn J.

1277
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,100

Bye.
