1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,320

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,020
everybody saw it was caught on video. The video is crazy. It was the spirit of

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,320
a ghost. So guys, if you haven't seen this video, yeah, basically mark norman

4
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,780
is doing his set. He's going

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,920
comedy yeah.

6
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,920
I'd like to get everybody's uproarious laughter throughout the venue. Yeah, you

7
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,820
can see the click was abound people enjoying the show. Yeah, I turn mine up

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,340
to yeah. I don't know what happens just a slight bit. Yeah, it's a little bit,

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,200
but there's there's people laughing their friggin heads off in this. There

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,320
are people rolling in the aisles. This New York comedy club. Yeah, was it in

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,400
New York? It was in New York. According to the sign behind him, it was in the

12
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:57,300
New York Comedy Club. No fucking way being funny. I'm not being for I wasn't

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,340
being funny. You didn't read the sign on the back of the I'm typically when I'm

14
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,980
watching a video of a comedy show, I pay more attention to the jokes than the

15
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:09,700
sign in the back, but it shows how you are a clout hound and hungry for you.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,060
You're saying, oh, what venue is that? Can I perform? I wasn't a clown, but if

17
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:16,020
you haven't seen the video, I guess I haven't even heard of New York Comedy

18
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,580
Club. That's how the opposite of a clout hound. You're you're my I feel like my

19
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:24,420
headphones feel crazy to me to what's going on. What have maybe we're getting

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,500
attacked by the same ghost? It wasn't a ghost. It wasn't a ghost. Basically,

21
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:32,420
what happens guys is that somebody jumps on stage wearing a beanie and looks

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,700
very like that looks like this jumps on stage like you looking scared. Mark

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,260
Norman goes like this. Oh,

24
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,580
basically, if you were there and you were blind, you would not be able to tell

25
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,540
that anything different had happened. Yeah, and then he says a crazy. I think

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,260
which is like what's is a migrant and then he says this is a swinger sex party

27
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:55,380
thing and the guy runs. Someone comes up, takes the guy by the hand, runs out a

28
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,120
door and then he said mark norman says somebody just got tased yeah and then

29
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,500
everybody goes what the hell and you see everyone filming and then some people

30
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,960
from the venue come in. They reach for mark normans mike and he goes like yeah,

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:14,220
okay, he's making the craziest noises as they escort him and that's a

32
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,760
changes pay. Well, you can just hear the microphone go away from his mouth to

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,160
see first you hear is really like oh and then yeah

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,300
and then he fucking and then a lady comes on stage. You looks like do that

35
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,980
lady. She looks like she's a back a cry. Yeah, it looks unbelievable. She's

36
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,580
like fully about to cry. She's confused. She's like having talking like a

37
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:39,540
stroke victim. It's like everything's fine, but but it's really you have to

38
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:44,140
run. I mean stay where you are, stay where you are, but you have to go and so

39
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,140
the

40
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,400
context that I saw this video and then wait we're not at the end of the end.

41
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,440
She

42
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,600
she's up there for like you know, twenty seconds doing the being like guys,

43
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,640
nothing is wrong. It's all okay. You have to leave, but stay in your seat and

44
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,280
then someone has a guy is so great and then another guy comes up and he gets a

45
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,100
second microphone. It's also there and he goes guys. I'm a producer. I'm part

46
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:13,120
of the taping tonight. You all have to go. You need you to get out of here

47
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,700
right now and then everyone goes what the what okay and then somebody asked. Why

48
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,160
are you recording? It's like because this is awesome. Yeah, what do you mean?

49
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,400
Why are you recording? I have to record that there has to be on the

50
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,560
intimidate theories. First, let's get into what does the government say this

51
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,640
is so being okay sure we so government being Robert Kelly, Robert Kelly said

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,120
that that he was just he was discussed

53
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,640
he looked at Sam with disgust,

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:49,160
and I tried to tell him because I saw from a reputable source, some

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,880
Twitter user using cigarettes said that there was

56
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:57,000
an attack from a paranormal. So this is my

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,920
I want to read the official one before we get into the theories, because this

58
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,560
is ridiculous. This is bullshit. This is clearly this is

59
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,040
a cover. This is we need to read this so that we understand, so we know how

60
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,600
I debunk this this is from NY comedy club, then one of the most famous comedy

61
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,400
clubs in the world, New York, New York, it's a New York City, it's under the KGB.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,320
Oh my God, we've received a handful of inquiries regarding a viral clip of our

63
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,320
club being evacuated last night. First and foremost, nobody was harmed or

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:31,200
injured. The disruption was part of a filming by at high high, the producers

65
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,000
that rented out our venue for the night. So since this took on a bit of a wild

66
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
narrative. If you were in attendance for this taping, we'd love to host you for

67
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,120
an actual show for free. Please pls email us at info at new york comedy club dot

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,680
com and we'll throw that email address up on the screen and this is what

69
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,760
Robert Kelly said

70
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,800
something about

71
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,920
Norman

72
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:56,200
Robert Kelly, Robert Kelly, newly appointed to the bonfire after Dan

73
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,680
Soder left. Oh interesting, I didn't even know that mean either for Robert

74
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,160
Kelly. Yeah, people hate him.

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,960
I looked at their reddit the other day and it was just like when is blobby going

76
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,440
to shut the

77
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,640
blobby? My dad used to work with him at a restaurant. I know so I back him yeah

78
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:17,920
yes, he's he's a he used to drink shots of whiskey with I'm a blob. I'm a blobby

79
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,920
kelly to big shoes to fill Dan Soder

80
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,520
probably size sixteen or something as tall as fuck. He filled up with a big

81
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,120
shirt. Yeah,

82
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,240
Robert Kelly says told you as a great at not Sam once said to me when I asked if

83
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,840
beef between two wrestlers was real. What are you and mark then looked at me

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,080
with disgust, disgust as in they discussed it looked at me with disgust.

85
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,120
He was disgusted by so apparently they have a beef. We're getting too much into

86
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,640
the the blobby. Yeah, yeah, this part doesn't what I want to do with this

87
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:54,040
episode is do a full on investigation investigation. Maybe we should make a

88
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:59,480
diorama of the New York comedy club, yeah, and do like a JFK thing and have

89
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,720
let it be here's this thing happened here. Here's where we felt there was a

90
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,320
pocket. We have this to do calculations on the spiritual

91
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,480
why

92
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,480
because it's not like you're trying to change the top. I'm not trying to change

93
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,440
the top. Are you in this way? I'm not involved. You know what he's not

94
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,400
involved. Blue is low too early. He said paranormal and now we have nowhere to go.

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,560
You should have waited to say paranormal and then we could be now. That was the

96
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,460
only thing the only thing I knew about it was somebody saying that there was a

97
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,340
a paranormal occurrence. That was the only thing you knew. I didn't see any

98
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,900
other clip. I didn't see any other clip except for what Robert Kelly said, and

99
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,940
I'm going to take those two, those two people's statements as bond. Okay, this

100
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,580
is why you would literally never make it in the Lone Gunman or the X-Files or

101
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,980
any of those organisations. No, I wouldn't. I'd be the guy that I put my

102
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:53,220
suit jacket behind my badge and I say, "Well, it's the damnedest thing." Do you

103
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,860
guys want to hear, see my, this is my impression of a character that's only in

104
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,100
his first three minutes of the X files episode. Okay,

105
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,780
hello,

106
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,600
oh that's him. That would be me. That's you he's he's hello and then night

107
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,700
warrants long as flashlight yeah, two foot long, but it's like working in a

108
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,380
museum looking into the room with all the sculptures of the apes. Hello, would

109
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,280
I at least going back? Hello, cut to black, would I at least tell them the

110
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,180
investigators that it's the damnedest thing or no you'd be dead. You're

111
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:26,420
completely or the guy who dies or a you'd be disappeared and then they would

112
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,940
find you your head implanted into a giant blob monster because he like he

113
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,940
took you in and you're part of and you would be talking in unison with a bunch

114
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:39,180
of other yeah, you'd becomes part of this giant board thing. Okay, so then

115
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:42,900
you be would be the guy that says it's the damnedest thing we can't make heads

116
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,100
or tails. Let me tell you where I was yesterday when I watch this video and

117
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,700
why it was so let's get I'm sorry I'm getting too into this X files. Why it

118
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,660
was so affecting to me yesterday I decided on a whim I left the gym as a

119
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,900
rainy day and my wife had had her siblings over and they smoked a joint

120
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,220
and a joint was sitting on my kitchen window sill. Disgusting. And I said,

121
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,860
"You know what? I haven't smoked weed in a very long time, like six months.

122
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,180
I'm going to hit this weed two times

123
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,740
and play Assassin's Creed Valhalla, okay?" Which is on Game Pass now.

124
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,460
I sit on the couch. I know you guys hate me for this. I sit on

125
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,500
my couch. It's disgusting. I open up Assassin's Creed Valhalla. As soon as I

126
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:34,480
open it, I get bored and I open my phone and I look, I look at this video and

127
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,860
this video made me so, that's the video, fucking scared. This video made me so

128
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:44,300
fucking scared. I was freaking out. I put on my Apple watch and checked my heart

129
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:47,860
rate. It was a hundred and twenty seven BPM sitting on my couch. That's a like a

130
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,260
watching a song. You could I know could get down to a house song to a heart

131
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,980
like that. This video was killed. See woman by Chris. I saw where I was where

132
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:02,740
I was when I saw this video is I it popped up on my reddit feed, our

133
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,660
slash stand up, which I do not subscribe to. I started frequently popping up

134
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,780
into my reddit feed due to me looking at some posts on there. Yes, and

135
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:15,900
this popped up. I watched it with no sound because what it was was it was it

136
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,140
it wasn't a video like post. It was like a text post that said and the thing

137
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,980
just said anybody know what the hell happened at Mark Norman set last night.

138
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,340
It's like well, I got you got to see what happened here. Maybe yelled at

139
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,500
somebody yeah, maybe he went so you made a yelling yeah, maybe he said

140
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,980
something, maybe he said, told a joke. He does that to yells and I click on

141
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,060
it. I watch the video without sound. I go whatever what do I care it pops up

142
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:46,860
again on my twitter this time. I watch it with sound and I am entranced. It

143
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,500
took over my day. I watch it probably twenty times. Oh yeah, the energy that

144
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,300
this woman has when she comes up. Can you pull this up? It's full. I'll send

145
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,020
you the video right now, so you can pull up the video and we'll watch it one

146
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,020
time and then we'll stop. We won't do any more. She has it. She has a need to

147
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,540
everyone needs to hear this woman's voice. The way she's talking. She has a

148
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,660
full the energy that she brings into this video is the same as the lady who

149
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,740
as the who like starts speaking gibberish on the news broadcast that

150
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,540
one time where she just looks so scared. She doesn't know where she is

151
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,860
instantly. She's looks actually so terrified. Well, I wonder what happened.

152
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,460
It's fucking chill because all that Norman said was some shit got fucked up,

153
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,620
which means... What does that mean, man? That's what the government says when

154
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,700
you're covering something up. It is a full cover up. Yes. And the fact that

155
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,060
we have not had a play by play. Here, we'll play the audio of this

156
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:43,060
video. We have a migrant here. I don't know what that means. Who are these people? See

157
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:54,540
these are security for the venue maybe? But then there's a cut right here. By the way,

158
00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:03,820
he's bombing. Yeah. What do you mean? He's killing right now. He was bombing before this.

159
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,660
I think everyone's too scared to laugh at that.

160
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:17,340
And he just, he waddles like a penguin out of the fucking thing.

161
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,840
Why is he walking like that?

162
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:23,040
He does the walk you do after you're really embarrassed.

163
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,400
Everybody's getting up, they're switching seats, they're playing musical chairs.

164
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Look at this.

165
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Harry, no, this is a little bit...

166
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,400
Interruption.

167
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:41,400
Um, just stay, get up, get out, the taping, um, can we get out or what?

168
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,400
Yeah, I'm one of the producers of the show.

169
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Um, yeah, we just need everybody.

170
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Why is he wearing a lanyard with a...

171
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Nice and slow, nice and slow, everything's fine, but...

172
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,400
If anyone's got any photos or video of what just happened...

173
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,280
what you have any father video of what just happened cut out their true actual

174
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,520
cover. It's actually

175
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:05,960
fully sober is even scary, believable. It is

176
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,480
I watch this multiple times. I never I only just caught just now the part we

177
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,480
said. If you have any photos or videos of this incident and it cut out, that's

178
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:18,760
crazy, that's actual X files yeah dude. I government cover and here's the second

179
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,760
theory we've heard the paranormal theory. This is the other theory that I've seen

180
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,300
people

181
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,680
posting in the in the twitter replies. I think you sent so one of these guys. I

182
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,600
think this is the shot heard around the world very soon. Comedy will be illegal.

183
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,240
Somebody said pretty legal to make no jokes. Yes,

184
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,160
there's a last time starting with Norman. They're starting with the most

185
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,600
powerful and they're going to work their way down. They're going to work. I

186
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,800
first came for Norman and I didn't say anything yeah because because I don't

187
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,160
care.

188
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,280
dude that and they came for me and then I still didn't care that much. I just got

189
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:55,400
a

190
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:02,460
guys. This is the beginning of the stand up bubble popping yeah. You think this

191
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,600
is it? I think this is this

192
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,320
the text, but that is so they're going to put this one great social studies.

193
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,480
They're going to be studying this video, the Norman Jesus Christ dude. It really

194
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,720
scared me and it's crazy and I've been worried for days. She goes like just

195
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,360
they sit down, get up and stay and you have to leave. Yeah, taping she

196
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,060
doesn't know what to say. She's completely lost. I love that how how

197
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,460
like flustered and how much evil energy do you have to be giving off to be on

198
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,960
stage, trying to inform people about an emergency and someone in the audience

199
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,520
goes. What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, yeah, but I read it.

200
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,240
Any situation where someone is on stage doing that, like everybody in the

201
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,320
the audience is dead silent. Oh my God, which I'm of course, yeah,

202
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:52,000
all instructions, let's go. What the fuck? What the fuck are you talking about? I

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,160
read another theory and I think this one could be also true is that those

204
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,680
security guards are the men in black and that man was a time travel alien event

205
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,520
uh-huh and that man was a time. I traveled from like four years ago,

206
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,800
though, yeah, time travel man that's still pretty impressive. Time travel

207
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,520
that doesn't really impress me.

208
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,820
it impresses you. I'm not impressed by forward time travel. I'm if I could go

209
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:20,380
bro. If I could go four years back in the past and future, you can only go

210
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:20,820
future.

211
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,300
Okay, okay, what would you do? I'm not it's fine. No, no, I would go. We can

212
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,500
only go in the day that they

213
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:32,780
go four years into the future. I'd probably go to I would say January

214
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:36,840
twenty twenty eight. Most likely is where I go. If that's what I could do to

215
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:40,660
see who's been who's the president, just see whatever happens. I messed up. I

216
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,780
messed up by shutting down your idea where what would you do if you go for

217
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,500
years, not a good enough idea. Now you have to justify. You may tell me what

218
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,200
you would make a stink about. I made a second joke. I made a

219
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,000
inauguration bringing it back. Would you go to the inauguration? Would you go to

220
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,260
just somewhere like you can't go far back enough? I guess of four years to get

221
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,180
to January six.

222
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,300
Okay, or what year was that? Was that four years ago? That was three years ago.

223
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,620
Okay, then I go to January six and I'd be there. You know you could kill. I was

224
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,380
at the dentist that day. Take a bullet for Ashley. I would invest in sourdough

225
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,400
sourdough starter, though yes, that's what I was a good idea to invest in the

226
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:19,200
like yeah, just in the entire in the entire thing. Okay, invest in sourdough

227
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,680
starter that you're not selling is what you're saying invest in it like on the

228
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,400
stock market. I'd go to the stock market with ten million dollars and I'd find

229
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:31,800
whatever stock code is closest. I'd just type in s r d h and I just put a ten

230
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:36,440
you know. I just watched the wolf of wall street or not. No, I walk in

231
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,380
Wall Street and I watched the big short yeah. I re watch both these movies and

232
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,580
in the big short they they they do that, though they walked they go to Wall

233
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,500
Street. They're like we want to put money on something that doesn't exist and

234
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,980
they're like oh okay, we'll do that. So you can do that yeah. You can definitely

235
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,220
walk in. Well, maybe you can't do that anymore because they did that.

236
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:00,700
So you think you can't walk in and say I'd like to put my money on bubble gum

237
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,100
yeah and do you think now if you've done it because two thousand and five

238
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:09,000
whatever it's the fucking little. Do they know bubble gum going way up chewing

239
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
tobacco going way down in the major league baseball and then you make money.

240
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,600
Yeah, I think because of the big because of the big short the event mentioned in

241
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,400
the movie, the big short I'd rather watch the shorts big yeah, we about

242
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,300
death runs.

243
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,700
The big shorts,

244
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,300
shorts big

245
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,000
shorts big.

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,300
It's a documentary about new metal. It's kind of more an artistic name. It's

247
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,200
like saying like the brothers three, then big shorts. No, the short big. I

248
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,700
don't like this name. I like them big shorts or the big shorts better than

249
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,700
big shorts. The big shorts is too close to the big short. You'd be but it was a

250
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:51,140
alien style sequel. It's supposed to be close. It's a reverser. You know that

251
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,160
guy's pet is, but it budding he's budding money again. No, I don't know.

252
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:58,360
I never saw the short. You never saw the big short. No, it's pretty fun man.

253
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,560
They got Margot Robbie in the tub. Margot Robbie gets in the two. I thought

254
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:05,380
that happened in the Wolf of Wall Street. No, she gets in the well, she gets in

255
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,420
her nudity both now. Yeah, but then in the big short, she sits in a tub and

256
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:13,920
she tries to explain stuff and I still why she's as she really must be so

257
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,660
obsessed with money to be in both of these movies and Barbie as well. This

258
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,380
money made more movie than any movie ever. It makes so much movie. This money

259
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,820
made a two hour made a long movie. Yeah, I made a very long movie guys. Have

260
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:31,460
you seen Barbie? Have you guys either? Yeah, I saw Barbie. I saw I did too. I

261
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,600
I liked it. It was fun. Yeah, I thought it was funny. I saw Oppenheimer. I

262
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,620
thought that Ken Gosling was so my brain is melting today. Yeah, what's going on?

263
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,420
He was so fucking funny and I think we're affected. I think that when he

264
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,620
says, can I please go to your house? Can I come to your house today?

265
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,980
It still makes me laugh. That's cute when he says he goes, please, do you

266
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,940
want to hang out tonight, Barbie?

267
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,740
Yep, and that makes me laugh. That makes me laugh. I haven't seen it. I don't

268
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,300
know you. That was the first clip they released from the movie. I haven't seen

269
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,760
I find a look at anything from it. Why did nobody here's why did nobody ever

270
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,820
take the barbie and the can in that movie and go

271
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,560
and make them do it and make them fight now you all may they fight in the movie,

272
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,680
but they don't they fight in the movie yeah. They have a big they get it. They

273
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,500
have a civil war disagreement. They have a basically a class divide civil war

274
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,340
interesting, so it's like Dark Knight Rises kind of did Ryan. It's a lot like

275
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:27,440
get a and Oscar Oscar nod. Maybe I don't remember it. If he did he get an Oscar

276
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,020
nod Ryan Gosling for Barbie because I'm only just now processing how funny that

277
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,820
is. Yeah, you got yeah best supporting actor God that is really everyone

278
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:40,140
pissed off that Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie didn't get into guys. I mean

279
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:40,760
to be fair,

280
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,940
out of the movie he does deserve the best guy. Yeah, but then, but then let

281
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,860
him steal that movie. America Ferrara still got nominated for best supporting

282
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,820
and everyone's just like oh fucking the the two that I like didn't get it.

283
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,520
America Ferrara the she's the one who gives the model. She's the mom. She's

284
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:03,260
mom barbie. No, she's a mom of humans. She's a mom of a human woman. Why is she

285
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,200
there? It's just see

286
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,560
the most simple movie of all time. Speaking of movies, man, couple of new

287
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,720
camera yeah, so if they look like if the colors are off, they'll be fixed soon.

288
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
So don't believe it is. I know you guys are going to leave some fucking comments.

289
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,800
good news. We don't like the therapy gecko. Well, guess what? How would you

290
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:29,140
feel afforded this? How guys I saw a lot of people. I saw a lot of people

291
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,300
upset about the episode we did with therapy gecko. They said they didn't

292
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,460
like that guest and they thought they didn't like him. Now, how would you

293
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,220
feel if I told you that five minutes after he left the studio, he got hit by

294
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,780
a car? He didn't, but how would you how would you feel if that happened?

295
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:46,420
Probably feel and you'd probably feel terrible. You would feel terrible and

296
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,700
I'm talking to you, Draven. That's the only guest. That's the only person I

297
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,620
remember we've said your name on the show. We are going to be having so we I

298
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:57,880
mean what are the what is a new paradigm of guests guys? What are the chances

299
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,760
that we're going to be back next week? He's back. I was just about to say

300
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,040
he's on this episode. He's

301
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:06,640
he's sitting in the corner. He's over there. We are going to have so many

302
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,660
guests that none of you know who they are. We don't know who they are. Well,

303
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:16,300
just to be on the show. I think it's not even I guess maybe this is over the

304
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,100
line, but maybe

305
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,840
it's the funny part here is not that it's nobody knew who the guest was.

306
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,080

into the room and started dancing. They're buying their husband's tattoos.

321
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,540
They have the most violent crushes on post Malone that it's possible for a

322
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:32,220
forty or fifty year old woman to have and one of them posted the other day.

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,820
tumors in her brain.

326
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,940
twenty twenty. Can you imagine you're living your life? You're dedicating

327
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,180
your entire life to this disgusting smelling raccoon man with with tattoos

328
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:57,940
covering his entire body. You're you're snubbing your husband for sex because

329
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,740
you're a man. You're imagining you're you're in a trash can with a stinky

330
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:06,580
you're drawing your little you're doodling you're doodling your name

331
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,220
when barb wire, Gertrude Malone, yeah, you're a kid, you're Gertrude Malone,

332
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:15,140
your your your children are embarrassed. They don't want you to drop them off at

333
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:18,660
school anymore. Say Mom, stop listening to this music. Please listen to

334
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,600
something normal like Roy Orbison

335
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,940
and then you find out all along the reason that you've had this crush is

336
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,020
because you have twenty two.

337
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:31,740
Like when they cut open a pedophiles and they find that they have a giant to

338
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,220
they're like the doctors yeah, the doctor's like all right and that's

339
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,020
seventeen eighteen.

340
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,420
I'll go here. I

341
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:45,060
sat of a and you know you know the gallows, you're opening your phone and

342
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,300
just leaving the group. Yeah,

343
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:52,380
what have I been doing with my back to the gallows humor that these surgeons

344
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:55,300
have. They're going to look at this lady and go, Hey lady, you got some brains on

345
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:59,940
your tumor. Yeah, classic, classic surgeon. You know what this this woman

346
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,060
should do, though, is literally she should

347
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,020
she should take these twenty brain tumors and to auction them off and give

348
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,860
so yeah, auction them off to other members of the group who are not so

349
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,140
serious about post Malone and completely put them in their head. These are post

350
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,420
Malone tumours. It's the tumour that does it. You put the tumour and how many

351
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,540
times is he going to go crazy? Twenty. Have you guys heard? I was going to ask

352
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:23,500
as a twenty times. I think we talked about this with Rex at some point. You

353
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,980
have you heard that he has an aunt that is like fully being catfish by somebody

354
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,860
pretending to be post Malone. No, that's exactly the the demographic. There is

355
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,560
front is like going like flying across the country, flew to Vegas for for like a

356
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,960
VIP, because Post Malone was like yeah, I'll put you on the list and then she

357
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,800
got there and they were like these tickets don't exist.

358
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:49,640
It's crazy. That is a very funny person for older women to get involved. Yeah,

359
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:53,440
it's really funny yeah, because he talks about he likes. I mean, I mean, I guess

360
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,480
that's the only that's that's the type of bad boy, the younger bad, because they

361
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,400
don't have a real

362
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,040
anymore. There is a no no. What do we got? But he doesn't make music.

363
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:08,200
Jacob, a bad boy. He wears a leather jacket in the trailer for the movie

364
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,120
where he plays a biker. Oh, that does look cool. He's playing Elvis in a

365
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:12,560
movie.

366
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,840
He's the closest thing I could imagine to the type of bad boy that an older

367
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,920
woman might want to get involved. That shit where Austin Butler did the Elvis

368
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,760
movie and then couldn't lose the voice. That is funny as fuck. So fucking sick.

369
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,560
And everybody's saying, oh, it's a stunt. We lived it, guys. We know. This

370
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,580
We got stuck in Donald Trump voice. We did. We did that for months. Genuinely.

371
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:39,580
Yeah, the whole month of the 2022 tour? Was that the year? Yeah. Way too late.

372
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,580
Six years after he was in the election. Six years after it was funny. Yeah.

373
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,580
And we did that for a long time. And we were obsessed.

374
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:50,580
And this happens to a lot of great men, I think. You put yourself too far deep into the role.

375
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,580
Heath Ledger, Us. Heath Ledger did it in The Joker. That's the only two.

376
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,980
22. Well, he fledger Austin Butler, but I could see that me doing this with other

377
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,100
roles as well. Oh, yeah, percent like what what rules

378
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:07,900
well, what do you think I'd be up for in my future? Mr. Hit man, hit man. I think

379
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,260
I could become silent. Mr. Clean. I think he doesn't talk much either. Blue

380
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,980
Caillou blue. Okay, so this is a really bad idea for me to bring this up. If we

381
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:22,620
put it, if yeah, if we put a big thing on your nose, you could do in this shirt,

382
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,980
you could do a perfect Squidward. No, because I'd still need to do the

383
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,620
Squidward. I would still take... Can you just do your best...

384
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,520
Do your best to talk... Oh my God. It's not that good. It's pretty good.

385
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,320
Why do they give humans Squidward hair? Yeah, that's fucked up. It actually

386
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,860
does kinda look like me if I had no hair. The first picture looks a

387
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,280
lot like you. Well, that looks a lot like me. Click that first one,

388
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,100
the first drawing.

389
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,940
That does look like Caleb. Wait, what? That's the hat you always wear too.

390
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:50,680
But he would never say K star LL me. What does that mean?

391
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,680
He would if he was human. He doesn't know about death. Yeah, he would say, "I'm

392
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:00,760
gonna kelp myself." He'd say that. He'd say, "Eeeh." Dolphin noise. He's a squid.

393
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:04,680
But dude, someone... No, that's the swearing. Thank you. A man of culture.

394
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,760
Yeah. I know the most about squidward at this table, probably. Broskies, I'm

395
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,680
sorry as fuck. Have you guys seen the video where they... I don't know if it's

396
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:15,480
real, but I saw it when I was a kid where it was like you... It's the uncensored

397
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,000
version of that episode. Oh, yeah. Where they actually say the cussing. Is it

398
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
real. They did you guys see the

399
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,640
leak? Did you guys see all the

400
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,260
leak? A disgruntled employee. That

401
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,920
one is that's not real. I think

402
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,600
if I remember correctly, but

403
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,200
recently there was a bunch of

404
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,000
there was a bunch of production

405
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,720
drawing sketches and drawings that

406
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,400
did leak of like all the sponge

407
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,720
Bob characters with giant dicks

408
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,000
fucking each other. And why is

409
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,120
this one? Why is this? You guys

410
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,280
haven't seen this? Hold it up.

411
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,200
We're on Patreon. You can show it.

412
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,760
This is real. I'm serious. There

413
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,560
it's a bunch of the characters all

414
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,200
saying insane stuff and getting

415
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,480
and getting fucked. Why are they

416
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,160
fudging violently fucking because that's just what cartoonists do. They have fun.

417
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,760
You know what I mean? That is how and then and it's so funny. I got I was

418
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:59,960
looking at them on Twitter and it's all the like it's like, you know, 12 year

419
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,980
old SpongeBob stands on there all like I can't watch SpongeBob anymore. This is

420
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,800
the most evil thing I've ever seen in my life. Speaking of just like kids

421
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,840
animation stands. Have you seen the children who are obsessed with a family

422
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:21,280
got or South Park. Yeah, that are like what I mean. They've never really watched the show

423
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,720
for it's for adults. It's not for kids. Yeah, I know, but there's these children who are

424
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,720
obsessed with South Park so much that they have like Cartman X the Yowie. Yeah, South

425
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,520
Park Yowie. It's the only cartoon that has a warning on the front of the cartoon. That's

426
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,320
not like cigarettes drawn together. Well drawn together as well, but they stole it off South

427
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:44,440
Park. Well, they I think they had to legally what is Yowie. That's when two boys two boys

428
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,960
is kiss. Kiss on a comic. This is called yaoi. Yeah, comically kiss. It's Japanese. To kiss

429
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,560
boys have it called yaoi. Well, it's gayness. It's gay boys kissing. Okay, so they're doing

430
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:59,480
it. You never heard of this? You're probably the number one guy I would have expected to

431
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,260
know about this, man. Yeah, why? Because I play Persona? Yeah, it kind of honestly shows

432
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,800
a huge gap in your cultural research. Persona has no gay stuff in it. You were talking about

433
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:11,240
tsundere and stuff like that, and you don't know yaoi. Well, because I played one game.

434
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,240
but what's in dairy? I don't remember now. It was a long one of them is about

435
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,940
yeah. I don't know which is which and one of them is about stupid you idiot

438
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,640
about it. It's about being fake and the other one's like

439
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:35,760
yonder. I know, please, which one's that I'm telling you. I don't remember the

440
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,360
difference. I think that's the end area. One is one and one is the other. Well,

441
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,840
I don't get involved with this. No, you're going to get involved. I'm not

447
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:07,460
I'd like to rewind. Sundari is the yelling, but yeah, let's do this again.

448
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,180
I try to fuck me and Pat went

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,920
yours. I'm yandere to you because you sit there and you say I'm going to get

459
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:57,280
your butt. I'm going to get your you say I said, I said stuff like that, but

460
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,840
never get your butt and then that's not this is I guess if we're talking with

461
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,580
there was a romantic dynamics here. I feel like I'm always trying to get

462
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,080
Jubio. He always he he kind of what's the one where he just basically coldly

463
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:13,960
ignores me and doesn't say a word when I text him things like I want love or I

464
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,200
love you or I want to hold your hand. He doesn't say I love you back. He doesn't

465
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,700
say that I've told him I love you. You have to

466
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:24,540
drop you at the airport. I say I love you and you say, well, maybe you don't

467
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,180
know. Maybe you're saying Teyama to be he's not saying he doesn't he doesn't

468
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,800
love us. I have a text not from yesterday. I said I want love and this

469
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,020
is what he sent me. Oh well, that's actually myself. He's telling you to

470
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:40,040
love yourself. He's sending a picture of me back. Speaking of shot, I art of

471
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,820
you speaking of a shops, somebody had to submit to the master troll two days

472
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,600
ago. I heard about that. I got I got some I got owned. You had to submit to

473
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,660
the master, the master jester. I'll say explain what happened. I will explain

474
00:30:53,680 --> 00:31:01,480
happened. So our friend Connor kept texting us and asking us to make AI voice of Too Lazy

475
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,360
to Try. And you did it. So I did. I didn't know this. I had the file on the computer.

476
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,040
I already had the AI voice. If you don't know who Too Lazy to Try is, he is a drama YouTuber.

477
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,600
He probably will watch this Mark Norman thing. Maybe. After we finish this story, we need

478
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,600
to get back to the Mark Norman thing. Dark Mormon. More theories to drop. Yeah, I have

479
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:30,720
theories. So he does these videos. He's basically like Real Housewives for the Roganverse. And

480
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,080
we are obsessed. We are completely obsessed with him. We're obsessed. We love him so much.

481
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,960
So I did an AI voice of his and then I texted Caleb and I said to him, "LOL, too lazy to

482
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,360
try. Just made a video about your Tampa shows with Adam." Not my Tampa shows. On his Patreon.

483
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,080
You said on the Patreon. On his Patreon and you said, "LOL, what's he saying?" and I said,

484
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,600
"Hold up, I'll screen record it for you." And then, do you have the video on hand? Because

485
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,880
my phone's charging. I think I sent it in the group chat. But... Will you find the video?

486
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,980
So this is... So I sent this to Caleb and he fully... He said he'd screen record. I fully

487
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:14,800
believed it for the first 10 seconds. This is not... And then I got pretty mad. Jubio,

488
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,320
This is not the text.

489
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,960
That is a good text though for Patrick.

490
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,200
He says, "Ironic racism is still racism."

491
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,960
And there's a picture of him.

492
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,040
This is not the text I was talking about.

493
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,040
Okay.

494
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:34,880
All right, so recently I went and saw Adam Friedland in Tampa and my God, what a fucking

495
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
mess that show was.

496
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:40,720
First, he had this opener, which seemed like he might have worked for the club.

497
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
I don't really know.

498
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,720
but then this other comment came out and I think his name was Caleb Phipps. I

499
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,640
don't really know. He told this embarrassing joke about getting his wife

500
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,880
taxidermied or something. Okay, so burning my material at the crowd,

501
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,120
which wasn't cool because I'm afraid of screaming. Then he announced he is gay.

502
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,760
Yeah. So at what point, what point did you honestly, honestly, I'm not even

503
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:12,360
maybe kidding FIPS. I believed it fully until FIPS at Caleb FIPS. I was like

504
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,640
hmm. I don't think that that

505
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,580
is real

506
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,940
and then I

507
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,020
submitted to the master trial. So here's what I don't like. Can I tell you? I

508
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,280
feel pretty proud of this. I thought it was fake as soon as the first like

509
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,920
weird pause when he says what a fucking mess.

510
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,260
that's how we talk. So what a fucking mess sounded really, but I've never I've

511
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,660
never watched this guy's video, so I don't know. You got to get in. Yeah, you

512
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,820
need to buy that was where I was like. Oh, I think this is fake yeah yeah and

513
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,420
even after that it it I still was would say I was only ninety percent

514
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:53,860
even when he said that I said I was I still was like yeah, I don't know it's

515
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,400
possible,

516
00:33:54,400 --> 00:34:01,740
but it did scare me yeah. You got me good, the mark normand thing. I believe

517
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,040
here's a couple other theories. Okay, I think that one possible thing it could

518
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:06,300
be

519
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:07,400
a

520
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,060
bad smell

521
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:14,600
of who fart it could have been a poo. This guy farted and the lady behind

522
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:18,200
jumped up, jumped up on stage because it smelled so bad

523
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,780
and

524
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:29,140
are that you, but the lady in the back, the lady in the back that was trying

525
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:34,340
so you guys can stay and then smelled it right get out right now. Everybody in

526
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:36,760
the seats doesn't know what's going on, because the smell was localized to the

527
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,860
stage, because this is farts moving in patterns like wind yeah yeah for

528
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:44,540
torioles coriolis effect, coriolis effect, so it's moving across people.

529
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,360
There's different different temperatures that it's weaving in and out. People

530
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,780
had big hot buffalo wings plates of buffalo wings. It was causing it to

531
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,760
sandwich between two buffalo wings between the seats, not hitting anybody

532
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,220
exactly this guy and maybe it didn't even run because of smell. Maybe it was

533
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,320
was powerful. It pushed him on stage. It blew him away. I mean, pull up the video

534
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,440
again, because it does, he does jump,

535
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,040
and then he's getting dragged out. It's like, "You don't understand! You gotta

536
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,760
get everybody out of there! The fart's too big!" Here's another theory I have,

537
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,240
is that I believe it also could have been that guy who jumps on stage,

538
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,240
I believe. See, okay, he's bent over, right, and this woman is chasing after

539
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,960
him, so maybe... He's looking, he's seeing if he can smell, he can smell it

540
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,600
anywhere, but maybe he crop dusted her right and he she is so mad or maybe she

541
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,300
tickled him. Maybe she

542
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,700
and that's the start of all this. It could have been a tickle monster. Oh my

543
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,800
God, the tickle monster was loose in the New York comedy club in the New York

544
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:42,300
comedy club. Oh my God, I think that is a terrifying sight. Also, he could be

545
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:46,700
trying to get this guy who jumped on stage. The beanie guy could be trying to

546
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,500
get an Instagram real stand-up clip because this is a clever trick here. He

547
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,700
jumps up on stage. He just uses premiere to crop out Mark Norman from the side

548
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,980
that be really funny. That would be really funny. We should do that. We

549
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,200
should go to the stand and just jump up on stage and start doing it.

550
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,440
What if this... And have your captions and have no captions for what the

551
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,780
other person is saying? Yeah, get off stage. Get off... What the fuck are

552
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:11,840
you doing? You're getting dragged off stage. What if this is like a

553
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:16,400
reoccurring problem now that people... Like maybe this is the new streaking.

554
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,760
Theory three, this guy was wearing a bomb vest, he was trying to kill Mark

555
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,160
Norman yeah, his detonator did not go off. So then he's looking around,

556
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,600
he's looking around like go press the or someone else is holding the detonator

557
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,400
also similar clothing.

558
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,600
Maybe that's his long lost brother and he's kind of trying to sit next to him

559
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,160
so that people go wait, go sit wait a second. There's two marks. I can't tell

560
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,140
who's who here's another theory that I've seen this one is not one. I came up

561
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:47,400
with but one that I saw that it was fully staged for whatever this taping was. I

562
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:52,300
Mark Norman was doing a joke where he was maybe because he was bombing. He

563
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,420
wanted to look like everyone was getting evacuated. I how bad he was. I also saw

564
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,940
this theory that it was stage. This is why I think actors are bullshit. No

565
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,900
actor could pull off that performance of that lady did on stage. Yeah, the best

566
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:10,300
actor in the world could not do that. That was so fucking real. It's also like

567
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:14,940
if it is if it's completely staged, that's fully like evil to do yeah. Oh

568
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:18,900
really evil. That's if I was in that crowd, I would believe I was going to die.

569
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,380
Yeah, no question the way that that lady came up on stage, the way they grabbed

570
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,500
that guy, I would have thought that there was five guys converging on the

571
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,740
theater with a are fifteens. I I agree. I like yeah, it was being surrounded.

572
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,600
Yeah, fully it's like you have to get out right now or stay.

573
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,660
I'm my I'm so fascinated by I need to

574
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,820
okay. We should go to an investigate anybody. We need to go do an

575
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,540
investigation, but also if anybody was there or knows any mark Norman fans who

576
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,440
we have been there that night. We want to interview you. We need to put together a

577
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,480
documentary. I just decided right now there's going to be a normal

578
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,760
investigation into this. We're going to do at least a twenty five minute.

579
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,440
Oh, my God, we need to go to the

580
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,640
comedy club. Yeah, they'll let us in. Here's what we do. Look under all

581
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,960
these. Oh, my God, here's what we do. Okay, we tell New York Comedy Club,

582
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,440
hey, we want to do a live show at New York Comedy Club

583
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,280
and that's how we get to

584
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,640
that's how we get it's under cover investigation. We all are walking in

585
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,480
wearing spy glasses, and we record everything. Oh my God, we just want to

586
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,440
look right at the museum to yeah and then

587
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,480
we get you so right. We get mad up here and we do a full. We have here. We see

588
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,120
if there's any paranormal it in this. We somehow try to sell it as part of the

589
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,560
show, yes, but it's not it's not

590
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:39,960
part of the show. We have Matt walking around using his BVP, the EVP reader

591
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
trying to find hot spots and cold spots. Guys, can I tell you something right

592
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,040
now? Yes, well, as since we started discussing this, there's a man standing

593
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,120
out the office door staring at us and has been for the past five minutes. Oh

594
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,520
my God, we are literally getting men in black right now. I'm not kidding. He's

595
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,120
literally just staring at us. He looked at me and then I looked up at him and he

596
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,680
nodded.

597
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:02,920
What should we pause right now and see what he wants? I don't think so. Did

598
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,640
anybody remember to lock the door? Because I don't think I did when I came

599
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,460
I think I did. I hope that I did because I don't really, really he's leaving. I

600
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:15,160
think he's waiting for the bus. He's been made. I think we're on to home.

601
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,520
Mike, you don't know. He's just kind of casually walking away. Rose up in a

602
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,480
crazy fucking way. We got a wait a minute. Norman. We got fucking Norman.

603
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,800
Oh, we got Norman just like him. Yep. A man who's that man jumped on what could

604
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,900
to be technically our stage. Yeah, front step. Our front step is a stage.

605
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,760
That's crazy. Holy cow. There's a guy with a beanie.

606
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,760
Oh my God, an orange beanie. No, it's a red. It's well, he's wearing red.

607
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:48,440
Yeah, it's a red beanie. It's not the same guy. It's when the similarities

608
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,420
stack up. I mean, that was why was he? He looked at the nod that he gave

609
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:56,080
and he looks, he has a scary. He just walked by again. He's wearing a

610
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,580
and for everyone, he was wearing a hoodie in all black. Yeah, and he only

611
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,440
he was coming to eliminate. It was a nod. It was a nod like I know he nodded and

612
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,580
he left after we stopped talking about the incident. We started talking about

613
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,680
him. Let's see if we talk about it again and he comes back. What if a

614
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,340
different person

615
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,960
I'm getting really scared? What if we've stumbled on to the greatest? What is it

616
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,280
really is? This is a completely saying he that nod was. I know you're talking

617
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,960
about you were never really here. This is where we're fully in we're in it. Now

618
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,200
there's no way out. We're under the Silver Lake. The only way to get out

619
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,240
under the New York comedy because we gotta go through yeah. Oh here's another

620
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,480
thing we could do you're right. There is a bar above New York, New York City

621
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,600
comedy club or New York comedy club KGB. We go up there saw

622
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:47,560
we wait to Jerry Tom and Jerry saw down into the club after closing hours. I

623
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,000
don't really know why they'd let us in a KGB, but not New York comedy club,

624
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,960
but we could find out a way to get in and then we saw up and

625
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,160
and then we just patch it on up when we leave nobody yet. No, no, no, the wiser

626
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,800
and we leave with the truth. We have to make this investigation. Doc, I bet we

627
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,420
get a new to New York comedy club. We go do our show. We get into the green room

628
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,000
and then straight up Resident Evil style. There's an eagle medallion on a say that

629
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,520
you have to find like that just for last mascot. Yes, that weird bug thing. Yes,

630
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:23,800
the green guy. I don't know his name bug or whatever. Not muzzy some no. It's got

631
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:47,800
the

632
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,640
rap world, a glizzy is slang for a glock handgun. The evolution of the word to include hot dog

633
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,640
dog comes from the extended magazine of a pistol, which is about the length of a

634
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:58,780
hot dog more. What happens inside an eater's body after the Nathan's hot dog

635
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:03,940
eating contest? Do not test me on hot dog knowledge and what happens inside an

636
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,820
eater's body,

637
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:11,220
probably digestion, most likely digestion, but I mean we could I can't

638
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,500
believe there's another man outside is the right there moving stuff. Don't

639
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,800
worry about okay, maybe he's a mover, maybe that's what the guy van is

640
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,760
literally the number one surveillance type van. I'm not. Oh my God, you're

641
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,400
right. If it the only way this could be more suspicious is if it was flowers,

642
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:30,300
the van has flower delivery on the side. I've never seen flowers get delivered

643
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:36,680
like no and as soon as you've big white van with no window, I'm running like a

644
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,040
drug operation. I'm a hacker. I've got like a trillion terabytes of like

645
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,860
sensitive government information on the hard drive and I look at them. We're

646
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,520
I guess my neighbor's getting flowers delivered. I mean I'm in I'm in

647
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,360
completely the slums. Oh,

648
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:54,280
it looks like he's getting an edible arrangement.

649
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,760
I have binoculars. They're probably trying to see where in the house the

650
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,600
flowers would look the best. Yeah, what's the what's the place of the most

651
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:04,440
sunlight in the apartment? Yeah, exactly. They're trying to do all this

652
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:06,240
sort of measurement. That's okay.

653
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,080
Oh, my God,

654
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:11,000
you need to stop being. Yeah, I know I'm

655
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:17,880
that glass door is now metal. We got to get frosted glass stuff for it. We could

656
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,680
you know we could glass sticker. We could just move this whole operation to the

657
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,980
New York Comedy Club to know we need to move this shit to Texas right now. Yeah,

658
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,660
we need to move this operation to Texas or Florida. We got to start going to the

659
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,520
mothership. Did you guys see that is my only safe mother ship is somebody's

660
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:38,040
gonna save space. They're trying to invade Texas or some shit. Yeah, what's

661
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,780
What's going on with that? I did not see what any of that was. I don't really know either.

662
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:46,760
Who's trying to invade Texas? The federal government is trying to run around Texas.

663
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:51,000
They're trying to run around? I guess Greg Abbott, who I just found out is in a wheelchair.

664
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,080
I didn't know that. He's very famously in a wheelchair. Not for me. He's very famously

665
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:00,540
a rightoid scumbag, if you ask me. That's what he's famous for. For me, he's most famous

666
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,660
for being named Greg. That's pretty much all I knew about him. And Abbott. And every time

667
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,060
I think Abbott Elementary, this TV show, but I think that he's a character in that.

668
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,060
He's not in elementary school.

669
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,060
I get him confused far from it.

670
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,340
No, no, he's graduated high school and college.

671
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:17,980
There was some baseball player who had one arm and his last name was Abbott, I think.

672
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,280
And you think that that's Greg.

673
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,620
I get them confused because there's some physical disability that they both have.

674
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,620
Well, here's an easy way to do it.

675
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,340
I don't think many baseball players are in wheelchairs.

676
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,340
Kenny Kawaguchi.

677
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,900
Well, maybe after.

678
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:32,820
Kenny Kawaguchi from Backyard Baseball.

679
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:37,660
true. Yeah. Yeah. How'd you buy that was a crazy pull? You know the name of all the all

680
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,660
I know is Pedro Pablo Pablo.

681
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:50,080
But yeah, I guess Greg Abbott wanted to put up razor wire to kill pregnant women when

682
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:55,820
they try to cross the border and Biden was like screw you man and now he's sending people

683
00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:00,160
to take up the razor wire and I think that there's going to be a clash at the border

684
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,760
Clash of Clans. Yeah, it's gonna be a year the Texas succeeds. I did. I don't want to

685
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,360
lose Texas. I love Texas. I like Texas. I love Texas. What? I don't want to lose Texas. I

686
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,560
saw a really funny picture on Facebook. Yeah, this is non Texas. Okay. All right. It was

687
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:19,360
one of those things where they say Simpsons predicted everything. Yeah. And this was, you

688
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:25,200
know, this that most epic selfie ever. Yes. Bradley Cooper, Ellen, Kevin Spacey, Julia

689
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,400
the Roberts. This was a completely this is from a serious conspiracy page. This

690
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,600
was not a jokely. It was probably someone made it as a joke and then this serious

691
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:37,120
conspiracy page posted it thinking it was real and it was the top. It said

692
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,680
Simpsons predicted everything. It was the picture of the most epic selfie ever and

693
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,640
then it was a picture of a Simpsons fide at the most epic selfie ever. That was

694
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:45,920
captured in one

695
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,200
and it had Ellen and

696
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:50,720
whoa

697
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,800
We need to look to see if the Simpsons predicted this Norman ship.

698
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,440
I think there's a strong possibility.

699
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:03,920
The McBain stand up clip?

700
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
That could be it.

701
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,920
That could be fully.

702
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:06,920
Or it could be Krusty the Clown.

703
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,720
Krusty the Clown and Sideshow Bob.

704
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,480
And Sideshow Bob jumps on.

705
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,360
What color is Sideshow Bob's hair?

706
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,360
Reddish.

707
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
What color is that guy's jacket?

708
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,360
Reddish.

709
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,360
What color is his hat?

710
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,360
Don't remember.

711
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,360
Fashion brain.

712
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,360
Simpsons yellow.

713
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:23,360
Scanned the outfit.

714
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:26,000
Well, it's because he's wearing the same outfit as Norman.

715
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I couldn't have told you either of them.

716
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,080
You're the only person who saw this because you have a fashion brain.

717
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,080
Okay.

718
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,560
So, I bet you know what I'm wearing right now.

719
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Yes.

720
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:38,560
Fashion brain.

721
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,920
You're wearing a Squidward colored shirt.

722
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:45,000
I look at you and I just see crap.

723
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
You see crap?

724
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,160
I just know if an outfit is good or bad and that one is bad.

725
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,160
How is this bad?

726
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,960
It's similar to stuff that you wear.

727
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,140
wearing diarrhea colors. I'm not wearing diarrhea colors. Brown and dark green. You wear the

728
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:00,220
same thing. Yeah, I stopped though today. You stopped though today because you thought that

729
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:05,300
it was diarrhea colors? That reminds people of diarrhea. No, you know what it could remind

730
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:09,440
people of? It could remind people of beef and broccoli. That could be food. No. If broccoli

731
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,860
was that color and beef was that brown, I would not be eating Chinese food once every

732
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:16,740
other day. Why did the guy who jumped on stage not even say anything? Maybe he was about to.

733
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:20,580
He just jumped on stage and he just stood there. He wasn't trying to heckle. He wasn't

734
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:25,880
he was trying to get away from something, the ultimate heckle, but even getting

735
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,080
away from something he didn't even he wasn't even like he didn't point at

736
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:34,100
anything. He wasn't like whoa, he was completely up there. He got up there to

737
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,360
get a better view of what was happening in the club. He gets up there just so

738
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,840
that he can look around because you can't see everything from the dark.

739
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:44,480
Only place you can see the only vantage point and he gets up there and he's

740
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,900
looking around and now that I see a look a little closer, he's wearing a chain.

741
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,040
man. So he could be a gangsta yeah or he could be an escape. He could be

742
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,720
escaped from like a facility where they chained him up. That's true. He could

743
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,640
have been chained up to a wall like this, trying to break away,

744
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,280
and then he ends up in this thing, because I was thinking yeah, maybe he

745
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,200
is a time traveler is trying to warn something and he, but then he didn't

746
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:09,840
say anything.

747
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,240
It really is upsetting to me. It's this whole thing is fucking me up in a

748
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,420
crazy way. I need to and you know what the worst part is. You know that this

749
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,140
minute is going to get memory hold within a week. You did

750
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:27,780
remember the Norman. I what I want to promise everybody who's watching this

751
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:31,700
episode. We will never forget about. We will never let this story die. What if

752
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,120
this becomes our this episode and I don't care if you don't really find this

753
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:40,080
very because the new intro, the new intro is a full the full, the full video

754
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,280
every single time show becomes called the Norman files, the Norman files. We

755
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,520
we'll get to the bottom of this. We started the museum to the norm into

756
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,300
five. I'm going to take somebody right now and ask if they have Norman's phone

757
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:58,280
number yeah. This is where this is going to give him a call yeah. Oh my phone is

758
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:01,700
dead. God damn it man. Okay, this is where that by next episode we're going

759
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:05,720
to be. I will have a full prank call. I phones coming back on Holy shit. I have

760
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:11,820
a full prank call attacking Mark Norman, but where I ask him what hell what he

761
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:15,800
did, why yeah well, we just need to interview say because we need to

762
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:18,840
interview him. Yeah, we literally need to interview him to get to the bottom of

763
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,640
this, because if he spews some of that bullshit, we can pick it apart. You know,

764
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:26,760
he's going to be talking about this on every single podcast that he goes on.

765
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,080
Well, I know that, yeah, but that's the thing, I want to scoop him, because now

766
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,800
he has time to think up a cover. He's probably-,

767
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,880
here's what he's probably going to say. I mean, he's probably on a plane back to

768
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,800
the Bahamas. Exactly, where he's from. He's probably going to say,

769
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:45,680
Yeah, there was a fucking SJW in the crowd and jumped up on stage.

770
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:46,680
He was triggered.

771
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,160
Got mad at me because he was triggered.

772
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,560
I guess that's comedy.

773
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,480
And that's comedy these days.

774
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:53,400
And thanks for asking about it.

775
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,200
And Mark, I'm going to see through your fucking bullshit.

776
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,200
That's right.

777
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,200
X-ray vision.

778
00:49:58,200 --> 00:49:59,200
The man with the x-ray eyes.

779
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:00,200
You are lying.

780
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:06,520
The worst part about this is, to me, as a comedy fan, he didn't get to say when he was getting

781
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:10,280
pulled off the stage, "Thank you, I've been Kevin Hart."

782
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:11,280
he didn't get to say.

783
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,280
Fuck me, I didn't even think about that.

784
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:13,280
That's incredible.

785
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,280
He didn't even get to say thank you.

786
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,280
He didn't even get to do his funny.

787
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,600
He said op op op op op.

788
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,600
Right now he...

789
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
Maybe that'll be his new...

790
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,600
Oh, hey.

791
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
Oh, hey.

792
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,560
That is the best part of the video is that he cannot shut up for some reason.

793
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:25,560
He can't shut up.

794
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,560
Oh, okay.

795
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:27,560
And then he walks like this.

796
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,360
The walk is fully the walk that you do after you like, you go up.

797
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,840
That's a walk you do if you're up on karaoke and you fart loud enough it gets picked up

798
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
by the mic.

799
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:46,420
he's trying to serpentine his way out in case there's fire gun fire. Look at

800
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:50,100
his arms. Look he's holding his hands in front of him like he's doing like a

801
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,680
dance.

802
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:56,080
You can see just his head go back and forth as he wobbles out of the hallway.

803
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:01,620
He just goes his head has like a full there's a foot between each side where

804
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,240
he wobbles his head. He's walking like a South Park character, but at what point

805
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,740
is he when he okay when he gets off stage and he's walking away and he does

806
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:12,080
that walk full sprint yeah. At what point is he doesn't walk like a normal

807
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,900
person? How long do you think that's his normal walk? That is not no. He does

808
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:19,080
that when people are looking yeah. When he gets back onto the street, he walks

809
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,860
like a normal person. I'm sure he's not waddling around. He doesn't waddle in

810
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:28,340
the subway. Okay, you be right now. I want to we need a practice here. Okay,

811
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:32,160
you be mark normand mark normand is coming on the podcast. We're asking

812
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,080
what I want to show you how I would drill mark norman to get the truth out

813
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,920
because you're about to spew the bullshit, right?

814
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,280
We have to lull him into obscurity.

815
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,280
So first, we'll be like, "Oh, hey, Mark. Nice to see you."

816
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
"Oh, what are you going to call this podcast about math?"

817
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:44,480
Yeah, we actually...

818
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:46,480
It's close. Thanks for doing the show.

819
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,480
What's going on around here?

820
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,480
It's a video podcast.

821
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,480
You should call it "Podcast about fish."

822
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,480
There's a fish on the wall.

823
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,480
Comedy.

824
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,480
What are you going to call this podcast about water?

825
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,480
Because they've got a water bottle here.

826
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,480
It's an empty water bottle, Mark.

827
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,480
I just went to a comedy show the other night, and it was like...

828
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,840
huh comedy. It went really. It was kind of like everyone was bombing and that

829
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,180
was really awkward. So I was wondering like what's the craziest show you've

830
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,480
done recently? Oh well, the craziest show I've done recently is oh

831
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,000
oh oh wait. Where you going mark? Oh my watch this now stay now.

832
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,900
Mark sit down.

833
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:31,280
Sit down mark. Now I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you my man. No

834
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:33,460
this is how I would break his spirit. Okay,

835
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:40,660
so Mark, what happened at that one show?

836
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:49,340
I'm not Mark, I'm Kevin Hart. Oh, hello, Kevin. Hey, Kevin, did you hear about

837
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,100
Mark Normans?

838
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:51,700
What do you think?

839
00:52:51,700 --> 00:52:57,500
Kevin Hart, will you wear a dress for us, please? No, no, no, that is the

840
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:00,820
funniest shit ever. Do you see that in the Cat Williams? Oh yeah, where he's

841
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:06,000
like yeah, I'm like the only comedian that they didn't get to wear a dress and

842
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:11,760
he's like Kevin or the dress. Yeah and he thinks the entire Illuminati is about

843
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:17,320
getting comedians to wear dresses. It's really, really awesome. Yeah, I'm

844
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,920
surprised we didn't talk about the Cat Williams thing either. Well, it was just

845
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:25,100
everybody. What do you think Cat Williams thinks of Mark Norman? Probably

846
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:28,240
loves him, man. Yeah. I mean maybe not after this, he's gonna say this is a

847
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,060
the full Illuminati. Yeah, it's going to say this is Illuminati for sure. It is

848
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:34,740
full Illuminati. And I'm with him. I mean, he was right about it. The guy who

849
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:40,440
jumped on stage is a clone of Norman, who was in the early gestation phases. He's

850
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,660
still kind of his body still adapting to become the reason he got up on stage and

851
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:48,240
stood next to Norman's like that was because the Illuminati was standing in

852
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,720
the back of the room and needed to get a good look, saying take a pick so they

853
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,400
can compare features and see what they need to tweak. It's like it's like

854
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,440
something it's like doing a me and you making a me on the we and you you make

855
00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:01,720
a me on the we and you hold up your phone and you're looking at what's that

856
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,300
potion in Harry Potter that turns you in a poly juice, poly just potion where

857
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:09,420
your skin is bubbling yeah and you're kind of slowly transform. That's exactly

858
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:14,120
what I saw a skin bubble. Yes, I think I saw the skin bubble on God. I still

859
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,680
can't believe if you have any pictures or videos of this event, please, please

860
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:23,920
don't use them. Yeah God damn it man. I mean I'm willing to

861
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:24,920
spend

862
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:29,060
three years invest three years and forty thousand dollars

863
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,640
to get

864
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,680
right. I'm actually willing to ruin my life. My wife comes home. I have a big

865
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:38,320
the big pin board in the red. Exactly going everywhere. So the act full

866
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,760
killer, full, full mind.

867
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,080
I

868
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,800
live in your car,

869
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,880
bottle of Jack Daniels, just just drink, counting it. She knows that I don't

870
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,820
didn't care about the story that much. I just wanted to drink and leave her and

871
00:54:53,820 --> 00:54:57,400
I'm just kind of pounding it doing one string back and forth between mark

872
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:01,080
Norman, New York comedy club. That's all I have doing a string between New York

873
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:02,040
and comedy club.

874
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,100
The only thing in the middle is three years,

875
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:10,100
then there's one really long red string that's going like all the way across

876
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:14,120
the room. There's a frame photo of Jim Gaffigan. I know he has something to do

877
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:14,640
with this.

878
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,060
Oh my God, his alternate personality.

879
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,800
you think that was Jim Gaffigan turned around. I was going to get a

880
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:23,160
Potter the head on the back.

881
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,600
That's why we're the beanie to cover up Jim's face in the front. This is

882
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,520
exactly. I didn't say anything. Oh my God, can I tell you guys what happened

883
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,580
when Mark Norman walked out? He walks out of the theater, he goes, he's

884
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:38,360
freaking out, he speed walks down the street, he sits, he gets in his car,

885
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:42,720
he sits down in the driver's seat, turns it on, lights go on silhouette in

886
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,380
the back seat.

887
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,480
he's driving his car. He's trying to start his car. Can you take it to

888
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,600
mcdonald's? Mark, he doesn't know a bomb will go off as soon as the

889
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,120
ignition.

890
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:57,820
The heck

891
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:03,460
he still doesn't realize. Well, I think that we're losing track of who the who

892
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:08,020
doesn't probably set this up on who probably set this up is Robert Kelly. I

893
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:11,920
think Bobby Kelly said, yeah, Bobby, Bobby, Kelly, Bobby, Kelly from the

894
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,200
bond, likely he's trying to dispel it to he's saying like this was he said it

895
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,180
this bullshit. Well, it really doesn't make any sense. I tried to tell him

896
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,020
boy. The first post he made was like I told you this was bullshit or

897
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:24,800
something, which wait a second. I told you this was hold on. I'm going to pull

898
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:27,260
up this first post you made and I'm going to read it because he says I told

899
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:30,220
you this is blind. I told him in the replies. I was trying to tell him about

900
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,760
the theory that is going around that is a paranormal. I think he did not

901
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,980
respond. I think that it is paranormal. I think that there was some kind of

902
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,260
air Norman comedy. Yes, see thank you. He said I love that everyone stayed like

903
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:47,000
cattle this bullshit. Anyways, this bullshit anyways, this bullshit

904
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,940
anyways, and then in the other post ready starts it with told you what I

905
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,700
mean stayed like cattle, because they don't understand cattle stays cattle.

906
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:57,620
Just one of the main things about cattle is they stay. Usually it's not

907
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:01,180
usually when people are making a metaphor about cattle, it's like oh and

908
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:05,820
they all stayed. It wasn't that they all did the same thing or went somewhere or

909
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:09,000
did something to say it wasn't that they could be all stayed, which cattle, by

910
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:13,820
the way famously cannot be moved or heard it right. I always just stay what

911
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,520
when people say they're like cattle. They mean that they're not listening to

912
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:20,220
what someone's telling them and that they're staying yeah and it's not and

913
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:24,860
the cattle are hearing the farmer and they stay. We do you think he could

914
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:28,580
have been the I'm sorry, I'm just thinking more. I know it's more acts

915
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:31,780
axes, more ways we could approach this problem.

916
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:37,200
This show certainly had an opener. Yes, right, there's no way it was straight

917
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,500
Mark Norman jumping on stage. Certainly at a host, certainly at an opener.

918
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,880
We could look at the lineup.

919
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,900
And I'm sure if it's like the kind of person who just does host spots at New York Comedy

920
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:53,280
Club, that they are a friend of a friend. We could find out what happened there.

921
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:54,940
Let's pull up the lineup. Let's figure out.

922
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:55,940
I don't know if it'll be posted.

923
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:56,940
It's @hihi.

924
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,400
How many days ago was it?

925
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
This was...

926
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Two days, one day ago.

927
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,180
It was not last night, but the night before.

928
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,300
Yeah. Well, the post was yesterday.

929
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,660
The post was yesterday, but in the morning, they weren't doing a show.

930
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,660
The show was at night.

931
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:13,900
Yeah, the show must have been on the... Wait, what is today?

932
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,900
26th.

933
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:15,900
It must have been on the 24th.

934
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,900
Okay, let me try.

935
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:22,860
And this is going to be a legendary date that you're going to need to remember. 1/24/24.

936
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,700
Yeah, because it... Oh my God, 24/24.

937
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,700
Exactly, yeah.

938
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,140
Wait, wait. Okay, so that's another thing.

939
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:31,460
Oh, here's an article about it from USA Today.

940
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:32,460
Oh my God.

941
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,460
A comedian was escorted off stage during a stand-up show in New York on Wednesday

942
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:41,460
in a strange incident he now says was a planned surprise that he was not involved in.

943
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:46,460
That's bullshit! That is a cover-up! We know!

944
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:49,460
That is such bullshit, dude! We know that that is a cover-up, Norman!

945
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:52,460
A planned surprise? In a statement provided to USA Today,

946
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:55,460
Norman said no one was harmed or injured during his performance

947
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:59,460
and that the disruption was part of a planned surprise activity by show producers.

948
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,460
but Norman said he had no prior knowledge that this was going to

949
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,560
happen in an earlier post on his Instagram story. Norman said his

950
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,760
team was still trying to put together the details.

951
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,760
Planned surprise.

952
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:13,460
A plant just tell us what the fuck you're talking about adding

953
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:14,560
to the intrigue.

954
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:19,060
Donald Glover shared several of high highs posts on his Instagram

955
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:22,260
story, including a screenshot of a TMZ article about the Norman

956
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,160
incident high high available.

957
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,960
Now one of Glover's posts said a Vanity Fair report published

958
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:33,120
Thursday said Glover's upcoming show Mr. And Mrs. Smith features a mysterious entity nicknamed

959
00:59:33,120 --> 00:59:34,120
Hi-Hi.

960
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,940
USA Today reached out to representatives for Glover.

961
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:42,480
The Hi-Hi Instagram account also shared videos of Tyra Banks being surrounded by two people

962
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:47,040
in furry costumes at an NBA game this week, clips of which also went viral.

963
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,360
Wait, is he saying, so Mark is-

964
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:50,480
This is all a global conspiracy.

965
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,480
He's claiming this is a prank-

966
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:52,480
This is a Glover conspiracy.

967
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,360
Involving, he's saying that this is, they're saying this is Childish Gambino's fault.

968
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:00,040
They're saying that this is all marketing. That Childish Gambino orchestrated this.

969
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:05,720
And this is all marketing for a new show. That is not true. That is not true.

970
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:11,080
That is not fucking true at all. No. We reject your reality. That is such an...

971
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:15,800
People are so used to this shit of like, "Oh, this thing happened at a thing and it turns out

972
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:21,480
it's Sacha Baron Cohen." Mark Normand. They set up this fake show that is going to be in production

973
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,520
fiction forever, so that they can always say, oh, that was happening because we

974
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:30,440
were doing a prank for the show, but it's bullshit. Mark Norman is back at

975
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:34,760
New York Comedy Club on Wednesday. We have to come back in town. We'll go. We

976
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,840
will have to go. I will be there. No, I think it's a weekly show. They matter

977
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:44,080
mark norman what and I will be charging the stage. We will be rushing, rushing

978
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:49,160
and picking him up and kidnapping him, bringing him back here. Okay, take a

979
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,680
kidnapping and bring him here, sitting him down and interviewing him. I

980
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,120
don't have

981
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:58,840
yeah, and he will immediately because he's such a showman right. He's going

982
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,040
to have no choice but to sit here and broadcast with us for a couple hours,

983
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,200
and I will play him in skate. It won't let me view the past date, so I can't

984
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,000
see who was on the show. Fuck, there's no way. We'll find out. I'm going to put

985
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,080

February second. Oh yeah, sure yeah, coming on, but watch out for January

1020
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:25,780
thirty first. Why watch out

1021
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,940
there? Like I said, watch the news. I don't think we're making it to January

1022
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,100
for thirty first after this.

1023
01:03:31,100 --> 01:03:33,100
Oh and

1024
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:37,580
don't be playing donkey kong with Cameron. Okay, I won't be happening

1025
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:48,620
more

1026
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:54,140
And so I'm like, alright, maybe the first step is to not drink Yoo-Hoo's at 3am.

1027
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:57,900
And then I'm like, how do I- alright, now I'm trying to get into that, uh, you know, so-

1028
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:58,620
The sugar rush.

1029
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:01,100
Yeah, so I'm on a bit of a spiritual journey.

1030
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:01,600
These days, that-

1031
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,700
Indian sugar makes you happy, though.

1032
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:03,620
These days, that whole-

1033
01:04:03,620 --> 01:04:04,120
They do.

1034
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:05,620
That's the premise of Willy Wonka.

1035
01:04:05,620 --> 01:04:06,420
Well, that's true.

1036
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:07,620
Did you guys see the Wonka movie?

1037
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:08,120
Not yet.

1038
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:08,620
No, my wife did.

1039
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,620
Okay, it sucked.

1040
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:10,620
Yeah, I heard it was terrible.

1041
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:11,120
It was terrible.

1042
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:15,120
I rewatched the 2006 Willy Wonka movie. It rocks.

1043
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:15,620
With depth.

1044
01:04:15,620 --> 01:04:16,120
Really?

1045
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:16,620
Yeah, with depth.

1046
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:18,860
I mean also by the way, they don't give a fuck about it.

1047
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,060
I like that Willy Wonka because he,

1048
01:04:21,060 --> 01:04:25,740
like the new Willy Wonka is kind of like a dope,

1049
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,180
but this, the Johnny Depp one, he hates children.

1050
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:29,020
- Yeah.

1051
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:30,340
- And he's mean to all the kids and his wife.

1052
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:31,220
- Well this is his origin.

1053
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:33,620
- I hear the new one is Woker.

1054
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:34,940
- Oh shit.

1055
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:35,980
- No way.

1056
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,340
- Willy Woka or something.

1057
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,580
- Oh my God.

1058
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:43,420
- They drop a slur in the fucking, in the 2006 one.

1059
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:44,340
- Oh yeah, sure.

1060
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:45,180
They were cussing up the story.

1061
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:48,860
It's funny when they're Wokifying the new Willy Wonka,

1062
01:04:48,860 --> 01:04:52,660
they're like, "How do we fix the Oompa Loompas?

1063
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:56,820
How do we make this not Willy Wonka having a bunch of jungle slaves?"

1064
01:04:56,820 --> 01:04:57,180
Yeah.

1065
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,500
And then it's that they put Hugh Grant small and he's like,

1066
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:03,380
"Oh my God, I can't believe you fucking enslaved me."

1067
01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:10,940
It's just that he still has a slave, but now it's a quippy British smug slave.

1068
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:15,540
Isn't it, well he has multiples of Hugh Grant in the movie?

1069
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:16,860
I don't know man, I didn't see it.

1070
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,180
Do we have a Wonka expert that can call in?

1071
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:22,740
I just remember in the trailer that he catches Hugh Grant in a glass thing like a cockroach.

1072
01:05:22,740 --> 01:05:23,740
He catches him?

1073
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:24,740
Yeah, yeah, he catches him.

1074
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:25,740
Yeah, he catches him.

1075
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:26,740
What the fuck?

1076
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:27,740
There's only one of them.

1077
01:05:27,740 --> 01:05:30,500
I think the thing about the Oompa Loompas that's cool is that they're a bunch of little

1078
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:31,500
guys.

1079
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,500
I don't care that there's just one.

1080
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,780
He only had one Oompa Loompa in the sequel?

1081
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:35,780
Only one Oompa Loompa.

1082
01:05:35,780 --> 01:05:41,060
Sometime between the prequel and the original, the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa is fucking, is

1083
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:43,060
He's asexually reproducing.

1084
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:45,060
He's putting a pipe down.

1085
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:49,060
