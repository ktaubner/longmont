1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
I

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:15,480
am little today. I'm really just get up bigly get up in a bigger way. You're

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,700
also vanishing into the background in a funny way. Oh yeah. I made it worse. We

4
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,060
left

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:26,160
this day right there. Don't move a muscle hold on. This is how big I'll be.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,960
Do I get to be big today? Wait hold on I'll be big

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm at maximum height actually. You can be big any day you want to. If you don't understand

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,960
what I'm saying. You guys are down here. I'm so small that I'm dead. I'm taking this away

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:47,880
from you. You're not allowed to have this microphone, but I am. No, nobody's allowed

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,080
to have it. Why did we buy this? Jubio bought that for you for your birthday. Is that true?

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:59,800
Isn't it? Did you buy this for me? Yeah. That's extraordinarily sweet. Get a look at your

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,100
years ago. That's like

13
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,700
a concha. That's how sweet that is a concha a conch shell. Is that what you

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,420
said? No, what's that? Is that no? It's not called a chancla. Are you thinking

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,660
of the chancla? I went to elementary school. I think a concha is a kind of

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,600
sweet bread. Yeah, yeah, it is look. Oh, my God, I was right. I remember having

17
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,260
this. I went there's a Mexican bakery in Wilmington that I used to go to like

18
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,160
every once in a while and I went one time and this always looked so delicious

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,200
Contra is mid and then I ate it. It was terrible. Contra is mid. Why do they

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,440
make it different colours? They all taste the fucking same. Is it just bread?

21
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,960
Is it in Mexico or is it just made here?

22
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,200
It's a little dry. You're supposed to, like, have it with, like, coffee. Oh,

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,880
so it's, it's like Mexican biscotti. That explains why it was mid, 'cause I

24
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,480
ate it dry. So, so it's not even a food, it's an ingredient, that's what you're

25
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,560
telling me. It's a stirrer. And that's your, that's your... I mean, I mean, you

26
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
could say the same thing for donuts. Shut the fuck up. You can't say the same

27
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,640
perfect for done. You're supposed to make doughnuts with brides and grooms on

28
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,880
top. That's how it is true. Yeah, they make doughnuts. I don't know. There's

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,560
also nowhere near as dry as a con that's true. A doughnut is a doughnut isn't

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,440
even dry at all. Yeah, my my there's some types of doughnuts might be dry.

31
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,640
I see you. That's a failing of a specific doughnut. I've done it as a

32
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,360
form. My concha dries up when I see you. You have a concha. Yep, and it dries up.

33
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,920
Oh yeah. When you see me, I mean that's nice. I guess I would be. I wouldn't

34
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,560
I want you to get wet when you saw me. Is that some kind of slaying in Mexico for

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,040
pussy is is girls getting wet like boners to they get it where they have to

36
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,000
stand up in front of class yeah and they have a wet ass. They have a wet ass, a

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,920
wet ask him sitting in it the whole time yeah, but in the mornings you sit there

38
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,400
and you're like oh my God on the bus at seven. I take a plane. Are you like oh

39
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,600
fuck I'm why am I randomly wet as fuck on this plane

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,840
randomly wet. I think they do. We need this info. We never had a girl on the

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,840
show. That's not true. That's not true. Oh, we've had a few girls. We've got

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,320
thousands on the girl show on the girls. We're the girl show. No, we're not that

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,240
we're the girl show. Now, apparently, according to Caleb, that we've had a

44
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,760
thousand girls on the show. I'm just curious about women's bodies and I

45
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,960
think I randomly wet. We okay. We should just have one. We should have like

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,120
Dr. Ruth or somebody come on and explain every single who's Dr. Ruth. She died.

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,720
Oh, she's dead. Then who's the old lady who talks about sex? She died and she

48
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,120
passed on the Supreme Court to the conservatives. Oh, you're right. She was

49
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,220
being bloody selfish and decided that she wanted glory. She decided she wanted

50
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,020
the glory of officiating a wedding. Yeah, that is. And it gave her COVID-7000.

51
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:43,320
That is so funny actually that. Her soul teleported to Jupiter. Those people's

52
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,840
their wedding decimated. It was not their wedding that killed Ruth Bader

53
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,360
Ginsburg. It was it was their wedding that killed Roe v. It was me. It was

54
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,640
Cameron. I dropped a germ in her mail slot.

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,880
Yep, he put he delivered when he dressed up like a mailman and he had a germ in

56
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,880
a little while. I had it in a vial of a germ, a little bouncing with tweezers,

57
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,760
green germ.

58
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,520
He said, buddy, listen, germ, there's a really old lady.

59
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,600
I heard the germ had blue hair and was a liberal. I didn't want to do it. Well,

60
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,100
that's why that's why he screened it. He made sure it was a really nasty

61
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:22,720
mucinex germ yeah and not a SJW germ. It was by the way, which is Cove in one

62
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,800
doctor. Fowchee has been creating a shade. They got green germs on mucinex.

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,360
This was a red germ. Oh, well, I'm not just saying that because it was

64
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,280
politically like on the red end of the spectrum, but because it was dangerous

65
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:39,840
yeah, yes, and also very hot. Exactly like red yeah. Why would you choose red

66
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:46,240
be your politician color. Right? Well, I guess red means strength. But red doesn't... When

67
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
you look at color theory... You say red, I think of blood and not just that. I think

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,320
of Nazi Germany, Hitler. Yeah. I think of... The Rising Sun. Yeah. That's true. They should

69
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,560
have thought of that when they were founding the GOP. I guess it just makes sense because

70
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,840
it's Republican red. Then it's Democrat blue. It should have been... Democrat denim. Well,

71
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,960
dark blue denim, Democrat denim, because they're so red. And you know what? I like denim. Whoa.

72
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:18,320
Okay. Yeah. That's right. I'm a I'm a lib. Okay. American apparel. Yeah. See, I would

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,320
have done either white or black. Yeah. White versus black is how you would have done politics.

74
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:31,040
No, that's not a good idea. Maybe. Oh, actually, here's a great idea for all the same color.

75
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,520
You just said you want a rainbow party.

76
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,360
Because they're the same exact party.

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,760
Rainbow is all one color to you?

78
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,400
Yeah, well it's every color in one.

79
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,400
No.

80
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,160
Or brown I guess is that.

81
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,760
What are you saying?

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,520
We should have done a brown party.

83
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah.

84
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,520
There's the green party.

85
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,620
Yeah, which by the way, just because I want you to have a new color doesn't mean you need

86
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,640
to name your party after the color, asshole.

87
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,640
Yep.

88
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:00,080
And just because I voted for you when I was 17 doesn't mean you can send me mail.

89
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,160
when you were 17 you did voter fraud. I did voter fraud. I was 19. When was the election?

90
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:13,160
It was 2015. I think I was 18. I think I just turned 18 because my birthday is on the 23rd.

91
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,500
Are you guys excited for politics to come out? God damn it! The Hungry video was not

92
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:26,160
even real. No it's real. It's real. Just say it's real. I saw a Forbes.com article about

93
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,420
don't believe for fucked up man. I believe part of the videos with whoever's

94
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,260
voicing it over. They don't say they say

95
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:38,220
hungry. That's the that's the secret. That was the one hung. We have the

96
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,480
obvious funny part, but is so funny when you see love this about you that your

97
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,080
mind just always goes to the

98
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,940
details. You're like our slash movie details. You're like a video details,

99
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,320
movie details. That's a good reddit that you should make just our

100
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,240
details. I'm so hungry,

101
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:05,480
hungly we need a see that, but anyway that goes back to what we're saying

102
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,200
this guy, Rhonda Santas, he's not even funny yeah. The only the funny, funny

103
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,400
thing, him somebody else did somebody was making him don't get on his ass.

104
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,600
Somebody was bringing him back to it. That's all I'm going to say bring him.

105
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:22,040
I'm going to do it's like this. I bring him back, bring him back, make him just

106
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,340
something I don't care what he is. I just want to be into in something again and

107
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,720
you have to I don't care again. I don't care what it is. It doesn't have to be

108
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,620
the number one spot. It can be any other spot. He should get the unplugged

109
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,780
controller. He should be like the

110
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,060
queen in who

111
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,920
shall not be named

112
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:48,380
Donald Donald Trump needs to be a he shall not be elected a queen style

113
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:54,300
smart like like head of head of the state yeah right figure head a figure

114
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,540
head where we made and I'm fine to pay. I'll pay for him. I don't give a fuck

115
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,240
sure yeah, whatever I'll buy his his no because you know, it's really going to

116
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,040
pay fine. What I was really going to pay is women in POC.

117
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,920
I don't think if he was the king, okay, then we'll just have we'll just get rid

118
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,880
of all the women in POC and the government and then you won't have

119
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:17,560
anyone to mess with right. That's a solution. He can't assault any, but any

120
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,700
minute. Yeah, I get rid of every single one and all the fall. If you make him

121
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
his own office,

122
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,100
no, we just clean. So it's an office that's full. Here's what I think. We

123
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,200
build him an office inside the Lincoln Memorial. He should be in space.

124
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,600
Now, they have a little door under his seat. He should have a matrix style

125
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
room where he has a screen of everything he needs to see. Did you just say

126
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,300
they have a little menorah? Do they have a little door under Lincoln's seat

127
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,300
in the Memorial? I don't actually know. I don't know anything. Everything

128
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,680
I've learned about Washington, D.C. is from National Treasure. I was just about to say

129
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:54,180
I feel like if they had a door under there, there would be some kind of crazy secret, maybe

130
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,000
his head, Futurama style. I think, okay, I honestly think... And only the 1% get to talk

131
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,620
to Lincoln. I honestly think if I could be, if I had access to any single building in

132
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:11,080
the entirety of the restricted United States, I don't think I would do Area 51. I think

133
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,140
I would do the Smithsonian because I guess they got some crazy shit. I would put on

134
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,820
Jim Henson sweater. Yeah, they have different butterflies that we've never

135
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,820
seen. I would go into the CDC and I would be going in and just opening all the

136
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,820
doors and walking around. They don't keep the viruses behind a door.

137
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:30,340
They keep them behind three doors. What do you, yeah, what else would they keep

138
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,340
in a box? One door to decontaminate and then two doors.

139
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,100
They have the gloves so they can play with the virus. Yeah, that does seem very

140
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,300
fun. I remember, I would love to see like

141
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,860
what putting a germ in somebody's body does to them.

142
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,260
It does. We already know. You know what that is.

143
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:53,280
I would love to be the guy at the CDC whose job is to walk up to people with the bear mace

144
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,540
and just spray a whole virus at a person. That's not a job.

145
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,620
They wear a hazmat suit. The person is sitting in a padded room and is like, "Oh, thank God.

146
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,620
Thank God you guys."

147
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,620
"Thank God I'm being bear sprayed."

148
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,420
"Thank God. Thank God somebody's coming in here to help me. I don't know where I am. I

149
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,420
don't know how I got here."

150
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,260
And then you spray them with the virus.

151
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,940
isn't it? Have you guys ever been, have you ever needed money bad enough that you were

152
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:17,900
thinking of doing a human trial? Yeah. Yeah, but you don't get paid that much. That's the

153
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,620
problem. You get paid like 200 bucks and maybe you die and maybe you're forever red. I did

154
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,260
a human trial. Look at me. I did some research stuff in high school. Now I'm shrunk. Did

155
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,980
you do like for high school though? No. You did like it for money? Yeah, they paid me.

156
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,700
What'd you do? They MRI'd me for one that I think was about, I think I was the control

157
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,620
group for one that was about alcohol like I didn't drink and they wanted to MRI.

158
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:45,380
So they MRI me and that might have even been middle school because I think I was

159
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,900
listening to American Idiot and the MRI machine. That's my they let you listen

160
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:54,020
to fucking music. They put a CD into and they play because it makes a terrifying

161
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:58,500
noises. Yeah, it does. They play music inside. Yeah. Well, I mean that's kind of

162
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,860
a cheat and then I did a bunch of ones that were just like I don't even know it

163
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,940
or remember what they're for, but it's just a bunch of ones. They ask you a

164
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,940
a bunch of questions and you do all the like yes. No, I got a survey taken when I

165
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,240
was

166
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:16,140
eight years old down at the public pool is my mom. My mom like

167
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,540
I think she did it. So I would have like 50 bucks for my birthday, but like your

168
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,640
kid do a cannonball

169
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:29,840
who can do the best belly flop in the entire pool, but I remember I'm pretty

170
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:35,600
sure the woman who was like proctoring this survey was asking me about Taco

171
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,920
Bell.

172
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,120
If I remember correctly, I don't remember what it was. I just had a

173
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
Taco Bell survey.

174
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,480
I swear to God. And you took a Taco Bell survey at the pool and

175
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,000
you're saying these are the same thing? These are similar, yeah. These aren't

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,040
similar at all. These are similar because they were testing... He was the

177
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,000
control for an alcohol test. That's the same... And you took a survey for a

178
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,960
that is that is my brain chemicals. That is the same thing. Well, you did it.

179
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:05,480
You did a thirteen year old, a thirteen year old being made to like

180
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,460
being the control to talk about Taco Bell, a thirteen year old being the

181
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,880
control for an alcohol test is nothing

182
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,240
you you talking about you were asked about the Mexican pizza. You're probably

183
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,120
why they got rid of it. Have you ever been an MRI? It gave me scars. I've

184
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,940
I've never been in it. Really? No. Oh, but it is scary. It's really scary. I

185
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,180
don't especially because, you know, if you have any metal on you, you will die.

186
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,260
I don't think that I would do a metal. If I had cancer, I would not be doing

187
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,380
radiation. I would not be doing chemotherapy. I would I would breaking

188
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,660
bad it. Yeah, dude.

189
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:42,180
That shit, it's too expensive. I wouldn't go to the doctor. That's all I

190
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,020
mean. Yeah, he goes to the doctor, but only a few times. I don't go to the

191
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,820
doctor like at all. I haven't been in a long time. Me neither. Last time I went

192
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,860
doctor. I want to put her on blast to be honest, but I do it wait. No, talk

193
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:58,140
shit, talk your shit. No, he's being a big person right now. Talk is no, no,

194
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,180
no, I want to hear that. I have another appointment in August. I'll do it after

195
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,140
that. Okay, see if she's got one more chance this and I'm going off and I come

196
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,460
in for this appointment. Oh, you have it could get dangerous. You have a new type

197
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:15,840
of cancer. Yeah, something could happen. She's going to I told you what she did to

198
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:20,360
me. She put me in a trap. What we talked about this. I actually don't remember

199
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,980
that's what happened. She put me into a glass box. Yep. Oh, I kind of remember

200
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,500
this, but it's a bit. He was put into a glass box and then he walked out and

201
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,940
they he wasn't supposed to leave. Yeah, I don't remember. They put me in a

202
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,900
glass, but I said I have. I told her I had asthma. Oh, that made you breathe.

203
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,940
And she was like, well, I don't I'm not sure if you have asthma or not. I've

204
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,140
had asthma my whole life and she's like, well, I'm gonna have to do some

205
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,100
gross on you and she gave did saw trap tests on me for a day. Really? And the

206
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,540
results were Yep, you have asthma and then they charged me hundreds of

207
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:53,280
I hate going to the doctor and the dentist in New York City.

208
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,840
I hate going to the doctor and the dentist anywhere in the entire world.

209
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,680
I hate the dentist a lot.

210
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Me too.

211
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,480
But the dentist in New York, it's all like, it's either like the tiniest private practice

212
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,880
and you can't tell because it just looks like somebody's building or it's like some place

213
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,400
that has just pictures of teeth everywhere and things that are like the...

214
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,680
I'm never going to find a new dentist again in my life.

215
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
if I have so much I can't go back to my family dentist, I'm never going to the

216
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,480
dentist. Yeah, I got to go to you don't go to New Hampshire to do my people

217
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,880
didn't go. I do for years. I need the dentist pretty bad. One of my crowns was

218
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,720
put in incorrectly and I didn't know and there's been food getting stuck in

219
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,680
there. How fancy are you? The food be like

220
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,080
yeah,

221
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:40,600
that's what I'd be saying. Yeah, no, then I got that. I cracked that tooth and

222
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,640
I've had to be like I have a temporary feeling put in there and it's

223
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,600
the crown be like

224
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:54,300
talking to the other teeth. I wish yeah, the other teeth be like yeah, yes,

225
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,720
master, yes, master king of all the I wish I had a king tooth that told them

226
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,460
what to do. Then they would say they would say promise you have fight all the

227
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,200
infections. Yeah, you have a you have a power struggle. Yeah, you have a

228
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,980
shrewd elism. This side of my mouth and this side of my mouth are warring. You

229
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:14,000
have a blood mouth and a crypt side of your mouth with teeth. I had that

230
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,780
infection on my wisdom tooth that was so crazy. His wisdom to be like no. His

231
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,700
was in like well,

232
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,520
he's thinking oh yeah. Well, yeah, I was having the infection. Plus he can't

233
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:27,880
think

234
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:35,040
I'm infected because of my infection. I had a dream about saw the other night.

235
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,400
We're a new one really saw x. Maybe I'll include the trap that I thought of

236
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,640
- Paw Socks. - In my dream.

237
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,480
- Could be about them, could make the whole movie different.

238
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,960
- Well, this is something where I had this thought

239
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,760
and then I actually, have you ever had a thought

240
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,320
and then you have a dream about it?

241
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,160
- No, yeah.

242
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,320
- I had this thought and then I had a dream that was Saw

243
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,840
and it was my, the Saw trap was that I had to explain,

244
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,540
I had to explain stuff to my dad was the Saw trap.

245
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,520
So I had to explain like a 240 hertz monitor to my dad

246
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,500
or else I'd die.

247
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,980
And it really scared me when I woke up.

248
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,820
- Yeah. - I woke up crying.

249
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,060
crying wake up because like the the punishment was that your dad thought

250
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,560
you were gay. No, I'm in this. I'm in the bear thing and then they he's like

251
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,060
call your dad on the phone and try to explain to him. I don't think high

252
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,060
refresh rate gaming monitor. I feel like you're dead. Explain anything to

253
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,300
anybody. I was under threat of death. I don't know that that whole thing just

254
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,060
seems like your dad would just go. Oh, okay, but I had to really get into

255
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,060
the has to explain. Okay, he takes a test at the end. Oh, got it. Got it. Okay,

256
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,060
which that is scary. The idea of having to explain are you allowed to say that

257
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,260
you're going to die if he doesn't explain it right, because it's because

258
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,500
my dad would get too nervous. He would he would keep him from doing it or the

259
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,440
scariest part is what if my dad's like okay, I don't care what if he takes this

260
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,340
as an opportunity to let me go and pass on to the next world right and he

261
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:58,180
doesn't give a fuck about me. What I'm thinking is like maybe he since you

262
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:01,920
can't tell him you're going to die or that saw has you maybe he's like he's

263
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,020
like yeah. I'll do the test and he doesn't do it like I'm at work. I'll do

264
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,040
the test. That's what he would do actually knowing my dad. Yeah, yeah, he

265
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,680
would be on the golf course. You have to basically be like no, this is so

266
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,600
important. There's different things if what if you called 911 and your dad

267
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,120
picked up

268
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:20,920
my dad would be true. I would hang up and call back to talk to someone else. I

269
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:25,640
would yeah, it's a conflict of interest. Yeah, and I the job of a 911 operator is

270
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,200
to decide whether the emergency is important or not and whether to send

271
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,320
people true and my dad's always going to send people. My dad, my dad would

272
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,380
I'd probably not send anybody. He would be like so if I call if I send an

273
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,740
amulet, it's going to be too expensive. You're just going to have to figure this

274
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:41,800
out. I'm just because you know I don't really I can't really figure out whether

275
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,620
I should be calling 911 or not because it's too close to home. So I'm calling

276
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,420
on one. I'm like I'm out of bread. I have a pb. I have j. I got no bread. I

277
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,520
saw an operator should say this is not an emergency hang up, but I call my dad.

278
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,040
My dad says you should go to the grocery store. He's tying up the line. Oh God, I

279
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,240
saw a guy the other day and I think he was faking dying on the ground. Yeah, I

280
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:06,420
me and my wife. We were walking by this guy and he was like and I normally I

281
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,220
would think he was dead dying in a real way, but he was on the ground and he

282
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,220
was he was completely lifeless and not moving at all and just kept doing this

283
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:16,940
well, but there was a crowd and at first I was like Holy shit, but then

284
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,820
there was a crowd around him that seemed to be like his family and every single

285
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:24,140
one of them. Nobody was helping them. They were all just arms cross looking at

286
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,020
a kind of like tapping your feel like oh my God, what the fuck is this like

287
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:31,300
saying like pointing at him, like yelling at him in Spanish going like

288
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,400
like pointing at him and screaming and then the fire department showed up and

289
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,900
all of his family, instead of like waiting to see what happened to him,

290
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,020
they just walked away.

291
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:46,440
So I am and I told my wife, I was like I think that guy's dying and she was

292
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,380
like wait, wait now that guy's faking it and then we and then we got a little

293
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,040
bit closer and he was as they're like loading him into the ambulance. He's so

294
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,620
he's fully like eyes open, pretending to be a dead guy for a while and then they

295
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,180
we're loading him into the ambulance and he goes like this. He goes oh and

296
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,760
starts grabbing his stomach, like it's a stomach.

297
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:10,780
So I just don't know if this guy like if they told and it was right in front

298
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:14,240
of a bank, so I don't know if he was like somebody was like trying to get

299
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,520
him to write a check or something and he was just like you had a fake die.

300
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,140
You have to get money. You have to get money out to pay your rent and he's

301
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:22,600
just like

302
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,000
well. First you try being completely lifeless and then you realize at some

303
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:31,840
point you're going to have to pretend to be alive again. So yeah, your first

304
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,840
instinct is to instantly die, but at some point there needs to be some kind of

305
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,920
symptom that you're actually having. So you hold your stomach, you go, oh, I

306
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,040
would get out of it. I would instantly pretend to be dead, and then when the

307
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,520
ambulance got there, because I didn't want to pay the bill, I'd just be like,

308
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,040
"Oh, my God, I'm sorry, guys. I thought I was dead. I died for a couple of

309
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,440
minutes there, but God told me to come back. God told me to come back and tell

310
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,880
you that heaven is completely different." Sorry, I got confused. I

311
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:00,920
thought I was dead, but I'm not. I actually completely live yeah. I live

312
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,420
well. That's what that's the only the only thing that made me. I'm a new guy.

313
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,140
I'm a new soul just came into my dead guy. What the hell am I? Who am I now?

314
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,500
What the fuck I've been jumping around different people. Do you guys want to

315
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,760
be my family? You look like me. Do you guys want to be my family, but you have

316
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,180
to forgive every debt that this old guy? Yes, I'm the same guy. I'm a different

317
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,720
guy. I didn't do any of that shit and I'm young yep, so I'm ready to fuck and

318
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,760
I'm from London

319
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:31,120
and I don't care about it's. Okay, that I said that in front of you guys,

320
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,360
because I don't know you yeah, I'm back and you're my daughter. I'm going to

321
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,320
fuck all your friends

322
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:39,160
right now, because I'm a brand new guy. I'm going to marry that woman. I'm

323
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,660
just somebody wants that run from two thousand and nine. Oh my God, I was

324
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,400
really I got to this guy's body. Oh, the one where him and Vince Vaughn switch

325
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,000
bodies. No Matthew Perry

326
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,740
it was Matthew Perry. Vince Vaughn is a different man entirely. He's the same

327
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,680
they are not the same. He's the same. He's the same. One of them is more

328
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,380
sarcastic than the other. They're both sarcastic. They are both very sarcastic.

329
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,020
Vince Vaughn, have you guys ever seen a picture of young Vince Vaughn? Yeah,

330
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:08,340
he looked good. He was hot. Crazy. Yeah, dude, in Psycho. He was so hot. Psycho

331
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,280
remake, he was a good looking guy. Dude, in Swingers, oh, he's good looking.

332
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,220
A real good looking guy. And then now he's,

333
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,500
I hate to say it, he gives me Fred Claus vibes. He does. He's doing cool

334
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,780
ass movies with S. Craig Zahler though, have you seen any of that? No. Like

335
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:25,380
sprawl and sell block ninety nine and never cost. No, your cell block nine

336
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,020
nine school. Those movies are his name is S Craig or is it as dot Craig S dot

337
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:33,260
Craig, okay, but you don't say the dot. It's just an initial. Yeah,

338
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:38,300
that would help me. I thought his name was S Craig. I was like, Oh, who is

339
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,380
this? Who is this?

340
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,800
You should watch

341
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:46,500
concrete. That movie's so cool. Is it about being odd? It's about two cops who

342
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,260
they do police brutality. It's Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn. They do police

343
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,340
brutality at the beginning. There's a guy they get they get they get in

344
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,180
trouble and then they're like they're like fuck this. We need to make some

345
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,740
money on the side, so they go and try and stop a bank heist. I get in trouble

346
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,000
for brutalism. I know then the yeah the police keeps like I like if it were up

347
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,700
to me, I wouldn't I wouldn't do shit, but you've been caught one too many

348
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,180
times.

349
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:14,980
It's so the politics of the movie are so evil. It's so sick, it's cool, it's so

350
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,180
fucking cool. You know it and it's fun. It takes place in a fictional in a

351
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
fictional U.S. city called Bulwark.

352
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,220
Bulwark what?

353
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,220
Bulwark where? They don't say.

354
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,220
It's gotta be in the Midwest. So cool.

355
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,220
Vince Vaughn was in this movie a couple years ago.

356
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,220
It was made by

357
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,220
the guy who made all these

358
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,220
skate videos and tried to make like these

359
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,220
kids pay 700k to get their

360
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
footage back. Like you try to make

361
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,220
16 year old kids pay him 700k

362
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,220
because he's got like a Pharrell endorsement

363
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,220
and he did this crazy

364
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
Doritos commercial where he's like

365
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,300
his skate company was doing a collab with Doritos

366
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,460
and he was like you know the triangle

367
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:57,500
represents so much and they're like just doing shit like that but Vince Vaughn plays the dad

368
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,620
He did Phil Jackson?

369
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,340
What's that? The triangle? I don't know we should watch that video

370
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,820
of him talking about the Doritos stuff because it's like

371
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,660
the Doritos merch is like little doodles he made and it looks like

372
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:14,140
absolute horse shit but Vince Vaughn plays the dad in his movie

373
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:20,140
that's about a teenager going pro skating and he dresses like a 50s greaser for

374
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,140
some rare no like a 50s like so for some reason for some reason because it's cool

375
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:31,940
no it looks really bad shot it's that kid from I guess he the reason he got

376
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,740
this movie made was because he was like the consultant on mid 90s he like Jonah

377
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:43,040
Hill either hey I know you're I know you're I saw it in the theater I didn't

378
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,300
I'd seen it in the theaters. I saw it on Showtime.

379
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,720
I bet you brought your board.

380
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,220
No.

381
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,720
You did.

382
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,220
I will say...

383
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,720
You held it by your tr-

384
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,220
No, no, no, no.

385
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,720
You all grabbed it.

386
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,720
I will say the mid is- mid 90s is correct.

387
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,720
Now he can say it because Jonah Hill has been eaten by a shark throne.

388
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,720
I've been saying that's been bad forever.

389
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,220
Yeah.

390
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,720
I've been saying that's bad.

391
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
So why haven't you been saying anything about Jonah Hill?

392
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,720
Because I don't know too much about him. I know that he's fat.

393
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
You are mistaken, my friend.

394
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,080
He was fat, then skinny, then fat again, and skinny, and then fat again.

395
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,080
And guess what happens?

396
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,280
Guess what happens with skinny guys?

397
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,400
They do inappropriate stuff in relationships.

398
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,400
They really do.

399
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,560
And Cameron, I hate to say it, you're as thin as a fucking bean pole.

400
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,640
It happens when you go from fat to skinny.

401
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:37,200
That's why we've been calling you fat, to make you, to get that out of your brain.

402
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
To get what out of my brain?

403
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,200
Your misconduct.

404
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,200
My misconduct.

405
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,100
conduct. I do think that guys who go fat to really skinny are dangerous.

406
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,360
Well, because it's like being a great carnation, it's like waking up and being

407
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,020
like... I don't mean necessarily dangerous in a relationship, but I think

408
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,740
they just are in every sense of the word dangerous. Skinny to fat, real

409
00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:00,860
paper thin to fat guy. Skinny to fat is a good man. Yeah. That's a great

410
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,800
man. That just means your life got better. You're as jolly as a horse.

411
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,520
That means that you learned about maybe different kind of ethnic foods.

412
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,720
exactly Jonah Jonah. He should be in like that. That's what that means.

413
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,440
Jonah Hill is like the text book, weight change guy. You wake up, you eat five

414
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,680
slices of paneer cheese every single morning,

415
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,400
because you're trying to broaden your horizons,

416
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:25,840
because you thought it was tofu because of the texture. Yeah, exactly. Realize

417
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,920
it's just it's just cheese. Yeah,

418
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:33,920
that's what they would you would use Jonah Hill to teach in a weight change

419
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,560
class. They would say, look at this example. This is what happens. This is

420
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,280
the model. Yeah. Yeah. He grew out that beard. There's like videos of him like

421
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,740
surfing and he's just, he's, bro, he's snaking everyone. What is, just shut up,

422
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:53,380
man. He's snaking me. What do you mean? Is he doing that? You said you surfed as

423
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:57,220
a kid. I thought you would know. What snaking me? I surfed like four times

424
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:01,720
when I was eight years old. Snaking's when you like cut off someone's wave.

425
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:07,160
No. No, wait, their wave? Yeah. How are they going to get another one? Getting in front

426
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:14,040
of somebody and ruining their shit. Oh, God. Oh, God. Blood. Yeah. That would be, if Jonah

427
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,320
Hill did that to me, I'm... That is a surfer's greatest nightmare. Pulled the chopper out.

428
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,160
Okay, imagine you're like a dude who surfs every day in like LA, then all of a sudden

429
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,640
fucking Jonah Hill is like snaking you, cutting you off. You'd be pissed. You'd be so mad.

430
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,200
I'd probably be so chill that I wouldn't give a fuck.

431
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,040
- Me too. - Yeah, that's true.

432
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,200
- I'd probably be so fucking-- - Dude, that's crazy, dude.

433
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
- I'd probably be so high on opium--

434
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,600
- Yo, is that Jonah Hill?

435
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,440
- That I wouldn't even notice.

436
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,000
- What is that, Superman?

437
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,480
- I'm in a movie, dude.

438
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,320
- I wouldn't give a fuck.

439
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,140
- I love Superman.

440
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,840
- That's the thing, you can abuse surfers all you want.

441
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,400
That's why Jonah Hill tried it,

442
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,760
but he didn't realize that this lady was a poser.

443
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,160
She wasn't even chill.

444
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,980
- She was a kook.

445
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,800
- She was a kook.

446
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,600
Wait, no, she's probably a nice lady.

447
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,800
probably nice about fine lady, breaking my silence.

448
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:09,600
I don't think she sounds like that. I'm going to be honest.

449
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:18,960
I don't know how that voice is funny to me. That voice is so stupid. It's the

450
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,440
funniest voice in the world.

451
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,420
he's a sick puppy.

452
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,320
No,

453
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,320
here's the thing. I don't understand. He's using therapy speak to you.

454
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,120
I don't know why more actors who get caught doing cannibalism. Oh, have you

455
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,620
guys watched the hammer documentary? There's a documentary. It's on. I think

456
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,120
it's on HBO or Netflix and it's called like the hammer effect or yeah,

457
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,520
it's

458
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:54,720
it's got a hammer. I don't know. It's some stupid as name about his name.

459
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,120
Yeah,

460
00:27:55,420 --> 00:28:00,300
yeah, but I haven't one or me. I haven't watched it yet because I don't want it.

461
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,260
I literally the reason I haven't watched it is that I don't want it to be. It's

462
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,540
going to be yeah, it's going to be so much less interesting than literally

463
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:12,420
that's the one if he had done anything cool like actually yeah, anything we

464
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,020
would know about exactly. I don't I really want to document. I really,

465
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:20,060
really don't want to watch it and find out that he was like I mean he was just

466
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:25,100
a normal. He was a weird kinky guy who was abusive and wanted to do say weird

467
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:29,540
sexual. I wanted to stay him thinking he's Dracula in my brain. I don't want

468
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,380
it to be anything but that if it's anything but that it's really gonna make

469
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:35,220
me sad. Was he in Fifty Shades of Grey? No.

470
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:41,480
No, he was in I think he was in, he was in I think,

471
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,340
I think he should be gay. He played the driving cruder. He was

472
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:53,900
What did you send me the other day? Would you rather go to prison for life

473
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,900
or be the drag.

474
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,900
Or be stuck as the driving crooner forever.

475
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,900
Yeah, that's a pretty easy decision.

476
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:05,900
I was sending Cameron some hypotheticals the other day, and he didn't even message me back.

477
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
I was asleep!

478
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
I was asleep, but he texted me all night.

479
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:09,900
That's not an excuse.

480
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,900
You wake up in the morning and you answer them.

481
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
I did.

482
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
I asked him.

483
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,900
He did answer one.

484
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,900
I said PlayStation versus Xbox.

485
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,900
And he said PlayStation.

486
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
Cringe.

487
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
And then I said pizza or Crunchwrap.

488
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
No answer.

489
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,900
Sleep pizza.

490
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,200
do pizza and then and then he hours later while I was still asleep,

491
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:31,100
emphasize the question and then sent another one. How long did you sleep and

492
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:34,860
how long were you in the middle of night? Let me let me look, you know how

493
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,700
we what time yeah, he always gets home from something very drunk and text you

494
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,500
the worst hypothetical question. It's not the worst. How is that the worst

495
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:48,360
piece versus pizza versus those aren't even a that's nothing that's nonsense.

496
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,960
no eggs were as baked potatoes. He just want to make my phone buzz at three

497
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,300
am foods at all. You see why I'm not answering. No, that was it. Okay,

498
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:02,260
you are not asleep at nine thirty six PM. I probably was. I've been having

499
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,360
some trouble sleeping nuggets or tacos. That one is the closest to an equivalent

500
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,940
food. I'm just not I'm just if I wake up and I see that you were

501
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,560
texting me that in the middle of the night and I wasn't responding and you

502
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:17,400
emphasized it. I'm not responding to you. You don't you're not getting that

503
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,540
I don't get why you wouldn't want to answer these. Then he said it's crazy

504
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,080
to watch Amanda Bynes clips and taken how effervescent of a performer she was

505
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,100
and how she totally her surrealist brand of humor took over my generation,

506
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:32,800
literally human analog to sponge Bob, an incredible contribution to culture. She

507
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,760
deserves the greatest care and respect.

508
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,060
What is that from

509
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,060
something I thought of

510
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:44,300
I don't remember. I copied a piece of that from somewhere

511
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,340
Amanda Bynes, she used to have it like that.

512
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,060
Yeah, she was funny.

513
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,080
Dude, Amanda Bynes was funny as hell.

514
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,620
You know what was--

515
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,140
She was human Spongebob.

516
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,740
Who the fuck says that?

517
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,240
There's a sketch on the Amanda show I remember.

518
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,460
I remember, yeah, Maha, Tony Pajamas, but I remember being six years old and

519
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,700
like I didn't realize like it was supposed to be a parody of like a

520
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,740
commercial and I saw Meatloaf Crunch and I was like, I like meatloaf. I like

521
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,220
cereal. Oh, that's a perfect combination.

522
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,960
I would eat that. I wanted to eat Meatloaf Crunch so bad. Was it Mad TV or Amanda Bynes

523
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,960
show? The Amanda show rather. That had the soap opera. Moody's Point. Moody's Point used

524
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,400
to make me cry. Oh wait, because the dad was stuck in a hot air balloon? It literally would

525
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,980
make me cry every time it came on. I was such an emotional child. Wow. They should not be

526
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:45,260
be allowed to do that man. What make a fake Dawson's Creek? The part where his

527
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:50,660
her dad's in the it's sad. It's not that sad. He's stuck he's gonna fucking die.

528
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,360
No no doesn't her dad know her mom's in the hot-air balloon that's her dad loses

529
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:04,700
his big toe or something yeah it's like a huge. Oh I didn't realize how much I

530
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,820
remember of Moody's Point. That is crazy. Dude just the idea that your mom or any

531
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,180
any parent really. If you have any variations. My mom is stuck in a hot air balloon.

532
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,540
Bro, I am eating chips every meal.

533
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:21,900
I would, you would not feel good about that. If your mom was stuck in a hot air

534
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,780
balloon somewhere way above the stratosphere. I would feel good for the first two days.

535
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,620
No, you wouldn't, dude. That's Jimmy Neutron movie vibes. That's Jimmy Neutron movie.

536
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:31,460
You're ripping it off. You just copied Jimmy Neutron to the movie. Great. I

537
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:34,780
watched that movie so many times. That movie made me cry, too. That made, you

538
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:37,380
know what also, what part of it made you cry? The aliens were too hungry. The aliens were too

539
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,420
when she's in the shower. Who the hell is she?

540
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:48,160
You know what? What are you talking? Sheen? You think that's a name? You know

541
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,020
it made me real hungry, though, was

542
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:55,460
seeing those green guys turned into eggs, turning fried eggs. I end where

543
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,780
Carl eats the egg. I thought that what is that? What is that egg holder that

544
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:03,220
eats the egg out of? Oh, that's a British thing. Yeah, I never saw. Well,

545
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,860
guys, you can dip them in the piece of toast. You all remember Poultra? What big

546
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:12,620
chicken monster? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was so cool. I remember Sepoultra. And it

547
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:17,900
goes down. Yeah. One of my, one of my mom's friends. Your mom was in Sepoultra?

548
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,240
No, one of my mom's friends, I told him that I liked, like, Black Sabbath when I

549
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,720
was nine and he showed me Sepoultra. They're sick. Yeah, I never listened to

550
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,660
them though. They're cool. He was a grown man who had snake bites. I'm the kind of

551
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,840
I haven't seen Snake Bites in a while. Me neither, but they are on the way back. I think the

552
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,120
last time I saw Snake Bites might have been in high school. Yeah, it's probably been at

553
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:45,360
Snake Bites in Monroe. I mean, you can see, I saw someone with a Monroe the other day.

554
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,200
That's not a good thing. You ever know anybody who had the girls who get the dimple piercing?

555
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,800
Amanda Bynes. Oh yeah, true. You knew her? I knew her, personally. I knew of her, but

556
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,120
I didn't know her. We ran in some of the same circles, but we never crossed paths. We were

557
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:05,000
hanging out in hipster clubs in 2012. Yeah. With the weekend. You weren't hanging out

558
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,680
with hipsters. I was a damn I was in these hipster clubs in 2012. I would see her going

559
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,160
to one door. I was doing Indie Sleaze crap. I would be in a hallway I'd see her going

560
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,960
to one door and I'd be going to another door. Then I'd come out she'd be going out across

561
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,640
the hallway to another door and then I'd like go into that door and she'd come out to another

562
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,640
one and then down the hallway. Then I would think I would think I'd see her then I'd turn

563
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:29,280
around and then it would be Penelope Taint. Her last name's Taint? Penelope from a band

564
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,520
to show. Oh, shit. Her last name was Taint, which funny AF to get that on to TV. That's

565
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,000
like Poker Face. Which you listen to that now. This should, this song should not have

566
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:46,320
been on the airwaves. This lady's pretending to be having sex with a woman. Fuck her face?

567
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,400
No. Yeah. You're thinking of If You Seek Amy. No, Poker Face. She says, Britney Spears. No,

568
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:56,560
Britney Spears. No, Poker Face is about a woman having sex with a guy and pretending

569
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,960
it's a woman. But she says "fuh fuh fuh" or "puh puh puh poke her face, fuh fuh fuck her

570
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,480
face." No. Yeah, she admitted that she said this. She said this. She did a, she said this.

571
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,440
Lady Garga? Lady Gaga, Lady Gargle, fucked a face. Lady Garga, fucked a face? Yeah, isn't

572
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,000
that awful? Wow. And that got. That really changes my whole perspective. That's like

573
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,960
how Fall Out Boy got away with saying "God damn" on the radio. This ain't a scene, it's

574
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,640
a god damn arms race. I remember that one. That's a good song. No it's not. That's a good song.

575
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,440
No no no no no. If you see K-Me though, that was on the radio. I remember that one. You

576
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,240
say that one fast enough, F-U-C-K-Me. I would not. I never thought Britney Spears was hot

577
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,160
man. Even when she was 17. And making those music videos or whatever. I didn't think she

578
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,860
was hot. Well I was younger than that Patrick. I thought she was weird. Yeah that's true.

579
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:54,940
I don't I didn't like her. I thought I loved Britain never did it for me. Yeah,

580
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:00,540
I was more of an in sync fan. I loved her music. Wow. You did not love her music.

581
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:05,560
I did. All right, drive me crazy. Okay, what did you prepare for us today that

582
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:12,440
we don't know about? So today, if you have looked, I have the I'm not talking

583
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:19,660
to you is the 250th episode of podcast about list and yeah. Oh wait, hold on.

584
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:23,720
That means we're halfway to 300. We're halfway there, guys. 500 we end.

585
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,060
You said halfway to 300?

586
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:31,440
Yeah. If we started at 200, yeah. We're halfway to 200.

587
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,660
Half of 200 is 250.

588
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,560
Half of 200 is 250? Half of that is plus 50.

589
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:46,560
If you're looking at it like it's a dollar. If you're looking at it like it's a dollar.

590
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,460
Right.

591
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,560
2.50.

592
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:55,960
that's two and a half right plus another half, which is fifty right would be

593
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,760
three. He's right that we only have one more half until we get to three hundred

594
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,760
half of something. Well, half is fifty or five. It makes sense in my head. So

595
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,860
then I will say it, but you did say it stills a halfway to three hundred when I

596
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:14,560
said two fifty. We're halfway to three hundred from two hundred. We're giving

597
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,160
him a hard time for this. He makes sense. It's not he's not a genius. No, he

598
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,760
never claimed to be a genius. He doesn't have to know. I've never claimed to ever be a smart

599
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,920
person. It's just a funny thing to say. It's not that funny of a thing to say. I don't

600
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,360
even know why we're, this is a waste of our time. He's getting anal retentive. Getting

601
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:42,360
anal retentive? Wow. And metrosexual. I'm not metrosexual. People used to say anal retentive

602
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:47,440
and metrosexual every single day for about five years. Anal retentive then became, oh

603
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,640
he's so OCD about that. And metrosexual became autism.

604
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,720
People say that guy is... People, we used to just, if somebody didn't know how to

605
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,640
match their clothes, you'd say they're metrosexual. Now you say, "That guy's

606
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,840
autistic." Last night,

607
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:07,840
my girlfriend said that she thinks that I have autism,

608
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:11,760
because I was stimming and I didn't realize it. What were you stimming? I

609
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,960
was just, I was sitting there just going...

610
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,580
- This fucking bitch thinks you're autistic.

611
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,760
'Cause you were singing?

612
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,560
You were stimming, you were singing.

613
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,040
- I guess I was doing it for really long.

614
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,600
- You're doing Patrick Lee-Lee-Lee

615
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,680
in the middle of the day

616
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:28,060
and she thinks that you're autistic for that?

617
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,600
- I was doing it a lot.

618
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,240
I was doing it a lot, I didn't even,

619
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,040
I was in the other room just doing that.

620
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,680
- I've had the Grinch song stuck in my head for two weeks.

621
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,040
I'm not stimming, I'm singing my song.

622
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,360
- I don't know.

623
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,480
I think--

624
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,580
- You're not autistic.

625
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,560
- I think that I should take a quiz right now.

626
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,920
on a web no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I think that I should die.

627
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,520
Alright, explain the two hundred and fiftieth episode. What are we doing?

628
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,440
What's the so let me ask you guys a question. What's the number one thing

629
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,840
that has got us to where we are list? That's true, but what's the more number

630
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,560
one thing questions to be? It's a quality equality. It's a quality. Oh,

631
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,840
it's not equality. Far from

632
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,720
humor. It's evil evil. You can't you can't get to two hundred and fifty

633
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,380
episodes without how that's two hundred and fifty, not even including the

634
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,360
patrion, not even that's true, not even including that at all.

635
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:30,040
You gotta be if you want to make it in this biz, you gotta be evil. That is

636
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:34,520
you have to be more so ruthless, ruthless, which is a subtype of evil. I

637
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:38,080
guess you're right. Yeah, you gotta be evil and I thought for the two hundred

638
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:41,120
and fiftieth episode because you know two hundred and fifty that's a lot

639
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,800
eventually we'll have to stop maybe a two hundred fifty two or two hundred

640
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,480
fifty three. Yeah. When we run out of space on our hard drive. I'm surprised

641
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,720
that so we're going to need we're going to need some other people to fill in

642
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,240
the gap when that happens. So I thought maybe that we could look at

643
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,760
you know if you're looking to create your own podcast empire. Yeah. Can you

644
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,120
click on the power point? This is when we this is where we become influential

645
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:09,600
how to act evil. Oh my God. So I found my God. Look at that super villain ass

646
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,920
name. The name is already as evil as they come. So here's the problem. I

647
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,000
found this how to act evil. It's about acting.

648
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,580
It's about preparing for a theater role, and I was pretty disappointed by

649
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,740
that 'cause it's all stuff how to read your lines, how to do your

650
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,220
costume, whatever. But... Can you give us an example? Can you... No, 'cause

651
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,000
it's all boring and I didn't prepare it. No, I mean, can you like

652
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,900
do... Can you just do like a... Like an off the dome evil monologue

653
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,760
with evil acting? No, because I'm not an actor. Well, you could probably do it. I

654
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,000
am. I don't know why you want me to do that. What is my what's my scenario?

655
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,720
What's okay? So the scene is that you are the evil ice cream man.

656
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,120
Basically, do you remember Max Keyboard? Yeah, we have two flavors today,

657
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,080
bone and blood.

658
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:03,000
That's my evil ice cream song. That was Woody the Woodpecker. Yeah, that was

659
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,320
I was what either would pick what's that

660
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,520
that again we do it more evil and more sinister.

661
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:18,120
Today we only have two flavors blind and bloody bone.

662
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:22,600
Okay, that was really good, but today is not an acting episode.

663
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,280
That's what I was trying to say here. This we're not doing how to act evil,

664
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,120
but what we are doing from how to act evil something that is attached to this

665
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,000
this wiki how is they have a really big Q and a section where people who found

666
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,800
this article type to ask their questions and the author answered them. Okay, so

667
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,400
these are people who found this wiki how clearly did not read it and are just

668
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,000
kind of asking free freestyling questions based on the name. I like this.

669
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:51,840
They're asking Alina Boko, Colovia, yeah, go, Vickova, Boko, Vickova. How do I

670
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,040
become super evil

671
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,580
acting selfishly without regard for the feelings of others will make you super

672
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:03,800
helpful. 196 said that was helpful. 41 people tried this and it did not work.

673
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,680
Yeah. It didn't work at all. I tried being selfish and it just didn't work at

674
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:10,400
all. I tried cutting in line, I was not super evil. Yeah, well, the point, the

675
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,960
sticking point is without regard for the feelings of others, because they probably

676
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,400
cut in line and were like, "Sorry." Yeah, I can't say that. Yeah. I don't think

677
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,000
you can teach evil, honestly. Well, no, you just, it's nurture. Yeah. It's

678
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,960
nurture. So, you just taught... Or nature. No, it's nature. Yeah. It's nature. I

679
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,480
think it's maybe a combination of nature and nurture, but the nurture is

680
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,140
large. I think it's opposite nurture, where someone has to be evil to you and

681
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,940
not to lack of nurture makes you

682
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,780
and the lack of nature. I think that kids who were put on baby formula instead

683
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:45,280
of fed from their mother's teat are probably more than 50% more likely to

684
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,300
become evil. Definitely, I nephew learned that he was breastfed recently and has

685
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,040
been making fun of his brother for also being breastfed. Well, that's a that's a

686
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,700
classic stones in a glass house kind of sit. It's a pretty funny thing to do,

687
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,740
though. I will say that is funny. I guess

688
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:08,900
I guess they got into an argument or something and he said yeah. Well, you

689
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,580
used to suck mom's boobs.

690
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,780
Sheesh

691
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,580
I didn't come back from that. I guess you did too,

692
00:43:16,580 --> 00:43:20,940
but then you're you're not winning. Then you're just both on the same level.

693
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,900
Like there's no point even saying no, I didn't. I pretended

694
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,660
I pretend I put it behind my mouth and

695
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:33,980
can I have a high doll like voice and make it sound creepy. It is difficult to

696
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,060
make a high voice sound creepy, but it can be done practice speaking in a

697
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,500
squeaky voice, but weigh it down with a horse. Darth Vader, you can have a

698
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,740
whole high, dry this voice right now squeaky voice, but with a horse Darth

699
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:45,380
Vader tone

700
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,820
Whoa.

701
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:50,660
- Hi. - That's creepy.

702
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:51,780
Oh my God, I'm getting shivers.

703
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,580
- I'm getting shivers. - I'm gonna eat you.

704
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,020
- Oh my God. - That is scary, man.

705
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:57,980
- I'm gonna turn you into food.

706
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:58,980
- Into fruit?

707
00:43:58,980 --> 00:43:59,820
- Into fruit.

708
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,660
You're gonna become a berry.

709
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,660
- This is just-- - A berry.

710
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:04,500
- Gollum.

711
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,940
- Yeah.

712
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:06,900
- I just realized.

713
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,020
- Yeah, it's just Gollum. - Not that impressive

714
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,020
'cause we've heard-- - Eat you.

715
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,460
- Wow! - Whoa.

716
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:12,580
- I'm gonna eat you.

717
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,860
- That's better.

718
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,620
This is an original kind of character.

719
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:16,540
- This is a frog.

720
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,500
(frog croaking)

721
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,420
- No, this is a-- - What do I, yeah,

722
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,920
I don't know the evil toad

723
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,120
say we have two flavors today, blood and

724
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:31,720
I guess I found out I'm not an actor. I'm more of a writer.

725
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,320
No, don't go really.

726
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,420
What

727
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:40,720
I thought of even an even better evil ice cream man. Okay,

728
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:48,320
oh my God, because the thing I would eat a bone ice cream blood

729
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,920
probably not yeah. Depends on the type of one, though I don't I've never eaten

730
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,520
that shit. It's not good enough to be ice cream. It is food, but you want to

731
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,060
have ice cream. I guess there's an ice cream place around here that does a

732
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,840
black sesame.

733
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:06,860
How can I be an evil person's sidekick? That's a that's kind of nice yeah. No,

734
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:10,680
that's I mean that's guys. This guy's a loser. Yeah, if you're already going to

735
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,680
already decided,

736
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,360
yeah, I've already decided to be evil and then you're like, but also I want to

737
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,380
a henchman. It's like you don't even have the kind of confidence needed to be an

738
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,140
evil mastermind. Yeah, you kind of just become

739
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,660
an evil person sidekick through like years of abuse. It's basically luck.

740
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:31,380
Well, this person says find someone evil and ask if they could use an evil

741
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:34,820
henchman to aid them with their evil deeds. Say you'll do all the dirty work

742
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,300
and you'll discard the bodies when asked. Okay, I mean that's pretty good.

743
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,580
I guess that's fine. That's good advice. That doesn't even tell you how to find

744
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:46,640
like no, you really need you need somebody and it could be anybody doesn't

745
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:49,160
have to be me who makes maybe some kind of like

746
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,540
Patreon Siri web series of how to get your foot in the door of the

747
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,560
industry. I mean that more than anything else. Yeah, 'cause this is fine advice.

748
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,260
A master class. How do you fucking find someone who's evil? They don't usually

749
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:07,240
like telling people that they're evil. So... Their evilness is actually displayed

750
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:10,120
through their actions. Which you need or you need some kind of detector,

751
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:14,580
but at that point tell it to your and make some money yeah also at that point

752
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:18,320
you're an inventor and you could be evil yeah. You don't really get a finders fee

753
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,520
for finding an evil person to reporting them to the police, because guess what

754
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:26,600
you'd be reporting the police all the time. Yeah, I mean we disagree on that,

755
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,640
but yeah sure

756
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:32,680
what should I eat if I'm evil eat anything that really makes your taste

757
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:36,520
bud pop being evil. You could also ignore all the advice about sugar,

758
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:41,020
additives, fats and everything else, or you could be extremely precise and weigh

759
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:45,400
every calorie and a shoe all sugars and fats really eat as you want your evil

760
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:48,520
and capable of thinking for yourself. This person is kind of saying that it's

761
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,440
evil to be big and fat yeah and eat whatever you want, but like that's the

762
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:57,120
thing. Don't you think somebody being more like the precision like what says

763
00:46:57,120 --> 00:47:02,120
how I like a lector eats like who's that mother fucker that ate one P on death

764
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,840
row? It wasn't Hannibal lector as a real person. That was Hannibal lector

765
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,480
kind of like peas, he liked peas, he likes fava bean, skinny Fred, skinny Fred, yeah,

766
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,160
he was, he was a notorious serial killer with even one pea, he was, yeah, he had a

767
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,840
small stomach, yeah, and he drove him to evil, he killed all the workers at

768
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,640
Burger King, no, he wouldn't even kill him, he would cannibalize people, would

769
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:25,040
just eat like their one fingernail, yeah, and he'd be so stuffed, one fingernail

770
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,960
clipping, yeah, and he'd go, oh, God,

771
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,320
you filled me up, yeah, yeah.

772
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,600
How can I be a dark princess? That's a good question. Looked the part by

773
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:39,380
wearing dark clothes, do random evil acts, adopt an evil nickname and be

774
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:44,040
mysterious. This is the most bullshit advice man yeah. Okay, what's your

775
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:49,340
advice? Be okay, how can I be a dark? Here's how you do it first of all red

776
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:55,500
or red or black or red and black dress okay tiara made out of maybe thorns or

777
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:01,900
or ivory something some kind of material, you know or ebony or or day

778
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:05,460
day trick stuff, some kind of day trick. I don't know what that is, but yes,

779
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:10,780
something bad that is either white or black that has some kind of spell on it.

780
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,380
First of all, this is now you need specifics, right? You need a spell, you

781
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,500
do random evil acts, give out parking tickets, people are gonna pay them,

782
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,620
they're not gonna check. What about the evil nickname? Evil nickname?

783
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:30,340
Throw some out. The Queen of Shit, the Queen of Ass. The Queen of Ass, yeah.

784
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:34,660
the queen of our rated movies. Yeah, anything like that is going to be fine

785
00:48:34,660 --> 00:48:38,700
yeah, because it just needs to be the queen of something evil or the princess

786
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,940
princess prejudice print yeah perfect dude. That would be a good super yes

787
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:44,300
dude princess fucking

788
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:51,180
normalizing stuff yeah, and normalize a d i e princess normalizing

789
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:55,420
heterosexuality yeah, exactly as princess normalizing monogamy exactly

790
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:59,620
princess vilifying prince. Here's what a lot of people think is

791
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,100
big snack for a lot of meals. The thing is also evil has changed every single

792
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:10,660
year of the world, so so evil this year, somebody could say guys, I'm princess

793
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:16,060
Christianity and honestly a huge portion of the American population would say get

794
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:20,660
out of my face. I spit on you. I actually want a chip into my left hand, some kind

795
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,300
of mark of the beast and then half the other half of America is like I want to

796
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:27,340
chip in my left hand and then put in my mouth. I'm a fat, so what the hell has

797
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:32,520
what happened to America, born, serum eating fat, chit after seed oil, all

798
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,420
that kind of a seed oil. That's a great.

799
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:40,540
Our codes on the restaurants on the telephone poles on computer and another

800
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:44,820
thing. If I have to show my Vax card before going into a restaurant, I'm

801
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:49,620
dipping and what the fuck of my fries and the fucking dip. I'm staying yeah

802
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,580
because I like that

803
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,980
and whose fucking idea was it to make the Roku app have a remote on it. See

804
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:59,480
that. Oh, let me use a regular. I don't want to use my phone. Oh, okay, I got it

805
00:49:59,480 --> 00:49:59,820
guys.

806
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,000
You could be princess

807
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,260
activision or princess, a games, something as a blizzard. You could be

808
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:12,400
princess, DRM says blizzard, princess, DRM. See that's the thing evil is so

809
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,220
subjective, really good, evil, so subject that to some nerds in this world,

810
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:19,620
they're going to hear princess activision, princess DRM, assume that

811
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:24,060
you're doing micro transactions right. So some people hate micro transactions.

812
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:28,800
the other half hate microaggressions and the other half love micro greens and the

813
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,880
other half are microscopic. Yeah, exactly. Some people are short, some people are

814
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:35,680
vegan, some people are gamers and some people don't like microaggression. It's

815
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:40,800
all a spectrum, really. The spectrum of evil. Yeah. And there's also billions of

816
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,640
microscopic human beings in America and they're called sperms. Yeah. Life begins

817
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:51,640
at sperm. And you know what? Most of them die in a towel or a napkin. A towel? Why

818
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:56,280
maybe waste a towel. I don't know or waste your spunk. Hey, you gotta ask

819
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,380
these evil people. Yeah, you gotta ask these evil beings why they're putting

820
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:04,740
loads and towels. Oh, that's I would be princess planned parenthood. Yeah, yeah,

821
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:10,380
he p p p p p p p p p loans. A lot of evil people got p p p loans during the

822
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:15,080
plan. Demi lone wolf is just facts. You should I fight with everybody?

823
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:20,520
Not necessarily insulting and mocking people will probably be enough. Yeah, me

824
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,760
him got insulted and mocked the other day when we were. Oh yeah, before the show

825
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,440
some we got we got homophobically hate crime. He called us F. A. G. I. T. and

826
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,680
said he would put his cock in our asses because we were gay and he and he

827
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,760
wasn't saying it politely or propositioning you in a polite. No,

828
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:42,000
that's the thing. I said, Hey, yeah, that's the word. That's the word that

829
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,720
you say. Oh, motherfucking ass. Maybe his voice just sounds like that. He

830
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:48,520
might have. That's what I'm saying. He had a gay accent and he was like, I

831
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:52,420
I'll put your dick in my mother. He said, Oh yeah, he said he was gonna put our

832
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,320
dicks in his ass. That's what it really it was some very, I think he said both.

833
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,040
He said that I'm gonna do it both ways. Yeah, I think he said, I think he said

834
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,360
he was gonna do it both ways, but we were yeah, and then he just like walked

835
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:07,380
around my car a couple of times. He also did see us unloading like costume

836
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:12,740
and we looked a little gay. Yeah, it's gay about costumes. We did have a sword

837
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,780
though. We could have done the entire world. Where's costume?

838
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,080
that's what we should have done. We should have challenged him on guard,

839
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:25,120
but basically we both flighted instead of fight it, but but did you find him

840
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:29,920
to be evil? I think he maybe was. Did you find him to be evil? Yes or no? It

841
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,220
depends. Yes or no? He would be able to say yes or no. I think he was evil

842
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:37,940
because if you're saying no, that means that maybe he did have to fight with

843
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:42,160
everybody. Maybe insulting and mocking isn't enough. It wasn't maybe in today's

844
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,280
America. Maybe it's not enough. You have to resort to physical. You have to fight

845
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:50,460
with everybody, everybody. He was also kind of an old guy. Sure, we probably

846
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:54,580
could have fucked him if we wanted to, but we really didn't want to that bad.

847
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:58,500
No, I mean we had to go, we had a lot of tech we had to set up for that show.

848
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,100
I think the only thing that either of us said was I said, okay, yeah, that's

849
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,340
what you should say. That's all you can say, right? Yeah, you can't say like,

850
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:06,900
you say, okay, it's like

851
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:12,600
maybe he'll mistake it as like the go ahead, but go ahead man. I don't care as

852
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,080
as long as we're done by eight o'clock, I have to load in for this. Yeah, yeah,

853
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,140
you can do whatever to me. I'm fine with it.

854
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:23,440
What if I am evil, but I want friends and no one likes me? People generally

855
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,280
don't like bad or evil people. The purpose of the article is to help you

856
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,900
act evil for fun while pretending to be a character, not to actually become an

857
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,780
evil person in your everyday life. If you want to have friends, you should be

858
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,800
nice unless you can find other people who are also evil. Most evil people like

859
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,900
to work alone and not with the help of people, but that is totally your choice.

860
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:44,240
I love that this is like first half being like doing like listen this article

861
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,480
it's it's not real. It's about acting. You should be nice to people unless you

862
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,000
go with other evil people.

863
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,660
What I don't understand what if this person's already evil, why are they even

864
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,880
looking at this fucking article? They should be writing the article good.

865
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:02,040
Yeah, true my two cents, but yeah, if you're evil, you have to have evil

866
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,480
friends or else you have a war on your hands. That's no you would not be

867
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:08,680
getting along with folks or you can be have a good friend and keep them close,

868
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:14,600
be secretly evil. But keep them closer. Yeah. The most evil thing you can do is actually

869
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:20,840
I think maybe be evil. Right? For sure. But also have a second life where you are nice

870
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:28,680
a la Barry. Do you think evil guys get on World of Warcraft and they play the good guys?

871
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,660
Yes. Because they want to feel like. Because they're so evil in person. Whenever I play

872
00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:36,960
an MMO or any kind of RPG, I always go full evil because of how good I am. Uh huh. Right?

873
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,660
so I'm only I have gray skin. I'm playing the old Republic and I'm saying Bastila

874
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:49,080
you're going to be my evil Queen. I'm not helping them. I hate Cartho Nassus, but

875
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:53,800
if a good guy plays nights, the old Republic, he's probably got a blue lights

876
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:58,180
or a bad guy. He's got a blue lightsaber. I'm so I have a horn. I have horns

877
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:01,220
growing out of my head, which is how it should be. God should have made real

878
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:02,680
life work as well, by the way. Yeah,

879
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,220
will my will any tattoos make me evil? Yes, it depends on what kind of tattoos

880
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,520
you could research evil looking tattoos, but keep in mind that a tattoo is

881
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,140
permanent. So you want to make sure you'd want it forever. See I got all

882
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,840
these evil tattoos on me.

883
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:21,140
I think that's a pretty evil doctor evil right there. You if you you should

884
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:25,020
have just gotten evil that would have been a much that would have actually

885
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,640
been that would have been hard. Yeah, this is kind of goof. This is goofy.

886
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,520
It's good. I was going to be getting it's getting a little tattooed on. This

887
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:47,520
is

888
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,920
Evil makes me think of a good guy.

889
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,120
You're going to cover this up one day.

890
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,120
I don't think I will.

891
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,120
Do you feel my cold hand?

892
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:56,120
Jesus Christ.

893
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,120
Is my hand cold?

894
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,120
Yeah, well my hand feels mine.

895
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,120
It's cold in here.

896
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,120
Yours are warmish.

897
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,120
Mine are so warm.

898
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,120
Yours are very warm.

899
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:07,120
You have a temperature regulation problem and that's why you always turn the ACs to zero

900
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,120
degree.

901
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
I think us with cold hands are the ones that are bad.

902
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,120
No.

903
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,120
Well, whatever.

904
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,120
I think I do have a temperature regulation problem.

905
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:15,800
I have normal circulation and my limbs don't turn purple at any time of my life every day.

906
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,440
I sweat whenever I walk even in the fall

907
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:25,320
whenever you walk. I walk in turns gray and frankenstein in yeah, you do you

your heaven is that we said I'm heaven

911
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:40,080
to gamers that mean something else. What kind of music will make me evil

912
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,400
try heavy base dubstep songs. Skrillex is a good place to start. I would say try

00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,240

you're entering a dimension, exorcist theme song that'll make you scared or

919
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,600
evil. There's no difference to me. There isn't much difference. People you tend

920
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:17,160
to act evil when they're scared, yeah, especially the most evil looking people

921
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,600
are actually sometimes the nicest.

922
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,620
I disagree. No,

923
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:26,480
yeah, I don't agree either. No, I agree. You agree. I mean, I don't agree. I

924
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:31,560
agree with him disagreeing against you. I agree against you. What other advice

925
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:35,220
do they have? Would dressing in a more edgy way make me evil? No, it will

926
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:39,920
likely not. What does it even mean to be edgily dressed? You wear a stud, you

927
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,620
are studied. You are studied black shirt. You wear a black shirt. I almost wore a

928
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,420
black shirt today and I said I'm going to look like Steve Jobs. I'm not going to

929
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:52,100
do you have a shirt that says evil on it. Do I e dot v? Oh yeah, what is it? I

930
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:55,980
don't know. I just thought it was funny. This evil on it. What is like a little

931
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:59,540
picture of a dragon doing something on the back? Got some Godzilla thing on it.

932
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:00,460
I don't fucking know.

933
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:06,700
How can I be evil if everyone thinks I'm cute and sweet? This is a brag. This is

934
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,600
but I ask every day. I think I only put in one of these, but there's like five

935
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,360
of these questions. I think this is the same person who asked about the doll

936
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:16,400
high pitched. Oh, okay, and they have a bunch of questions. I was like what if

937
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,480
I'm cute and I only dress in pink and I'd be evil. There's a bunch of stuff

938
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,180
like that you can if you want to look the part, try perfecting the smirk that

939
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,600
cunning smile when you know something they don't that look on your face when

940
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,360
you suddenly hatch a perfectly evil plan. This is like asking this is like

941
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:36,480
asking I'm four foot eight. Can I make it in the NBA? No, you could need.

942
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:41,500
What do you guys think of my smirk? You look like a bird and you look like a

943
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:45,100
pirate and pirates are evil pirates. Pirate

944
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:51,180
that's not a smirk. That's not a smirk at all. You look like Bill Skarsgard just

945
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:55,460
then. Wait, how was mine? I'm changing my newest smirk. I got like it. No, this

946
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,540
is not a real smirk. You look ugly. You look like Igor.

947
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,940
No, you look ugly as fuck. You both look like shit. Honestly, you look like

948
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,080
about this one. I don't

949
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:09,380
that one's not evil. No, you don't you're incapable of an evil face. You have an

950
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,500
ugly one about this one.

951
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,540
You just face is ugly. You can't do any of these. Is this face evil?

952
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:18,740
This is kind of itchy. You're coming a bitch face.

953
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,460
You look like you were

954
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,900
coming. You only tried one face and it was bad. So you don't really have any

955
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,380
like a watch.

956
00:59:28,780 --> 00:59:32,380
no, not evil at all. That's conscious and intelligent. That's face that's that's

957
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:36,220
like English teachers, Facebook profile picture. When you think you find your

958
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:39,700
English teacher on Facebook and then his profile picture is him sitting at his

959
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,300
computer like

960
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,100
how can I make my cat and dog evil to

961
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:49,940
this is what you need. You need a summoned to pay yeah yeah well some and

962
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:53,660
your cat is probably evil already, but your dog might take a little more work.

963
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:57,060
You may want to consider giving your pets evil looking access accessories like

964
00:59:57,100 --> 01:00:01,540
a dark spiked collar, sinister looking tags or a bandana. If your pets are

965
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:05,500
newly adopted, try giving them creepy or evil sounding names like Vex or Crimson.

966
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:10,340
I know a dog in this neighbourhood called Necro. That's sick, what kind of

967
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,220
dog? He's a German Shepherd, he's like an all black German Shepherd. He's very

968
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:19,420
sweet though. That's sick. Yeah, and his owner's like this like Norwegian, like

969
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:24,180
black metal guy. Yeah, it's cool. That's very tight, that's really cool, that's

970
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:28,660
extremely cool. Would wearing latex make me look more evil? Yes, latex and

971
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,540
leather are pretty good choices for looking you yeah because of doctors

972
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,040
they're wearing latex.

973
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,580
That is a really good point and they're wearing the leather lab coat. Uh

974
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:44,220
well, I go to there. Steve Martin and fucking the big plant. Yeah, plant the

975
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:47,500
movie plant plan. They should have called it plant. The movie should that

976
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:50,780
is basically the number one plant. Here's what I there's no other movie

977
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:53,180
that's more plant than that. Move through here's what I would have called

978
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,240
the movie, though there's reverse the reverse vegetarian. That's good

979
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:02,200
vegetable that eats a person. That'll be a good tag line. The revenge of the

980
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:06,200
reverse vegetarian. That's what I would have revenge of the plants revenge of

981
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,040
the reverse vegetarians a better. Yeah, that's true, because the reverse

982
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:12,400
vegetarian would be a plan. But then people would be like, what is that? Is

983
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,320
that the one about the tomatoes or the plant?

984
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:18,280
Well, in to me, I would call the killer to go. I would try and class it up a

985
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:23,800
little bit and I would title it in which the plant terrifies, oh and sings God

986
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,540
damn in which a sing in which the plant terrifies the musical and here's what I

987
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,420
would have put at the end of the movie fin

988
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:35,440
and I would have put at the beginning of the movie players in alphabetical order.

989
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,520
Yeah, I would have done all that shit yeah, but they won't let me make movies

990
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,640
would a luxury car fit my evil persona. It depends on the character you're

991
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,040
playing. It could, though I like the one person that said this is not helpful.

992
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,820
I must have been the dude who like owns like a Mercedes Benz dealership. No, it

993
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:54,200
would have been a it's a that's a hater. That's somebody with a junker jalopy

994
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:59,540
style car yeah and it wasn't me. I don't have a jalopy. I fixed my mirror, so I

995
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:03,080
do not have a jalopy. I put a new mirror on. You have a jalopy. I do not. I want

996
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:05,440
to be very scary and possessed. What should I do?

997
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,460
Acting possessed needs a lot of work. Make sure the person you want to scare

998
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:13,080
is a bit of the jumpy type. If the person doesn't seem very jumpy, focus on

999
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:16,600
their weaknesses and try to scare them using that focus on their weaknesses.

1000
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:19,880
this one the answer isn't so good, but I do really like the question. I want to

1001
01:02:19,880 --> 01:02:23,980
be very scary and possessed. You don't choose to be possessed, but yeah, the

1002
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,400
devil to you on it. You're not going to get a watch pot never boils. You try

1003
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,200
play. Did you guys ever play the midnight game? No, no, you do a so I

1004
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,520
actually know I did play the midnight game. A few times you put salt on the

1005
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:38,040
ground. I never got a game where you do a salt to a salt. Well, he he

1006
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:41,160
interrupted me. Assault circles what I was going to say, but assault would also

1007
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:47,040
be an evil style your circle. No, my circle is not open for assaulting.

1008
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:49,240
I tried to play the midnight game.

1009
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:52,700
I never got any points, though

1010
01:02:52,700 --> 01:03:00,280
my circle

1011
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:07,120
that's funny is being evil, a subculture, yes, evil, no evil is a

1012
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:11,000
mindset, not a subculture. There's no single way to look or act evil.

1013
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,240
Hippies are evil. Hippies are evil. They are so evil, evil and then usually

1014
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,720
the monks are kind. It's kind of a purse what you would think. Yeah, you would

1015
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:23,120
think that hippies would be kind, but they like drugs and premarital stealing

1016
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:28,480
hard core guys are straight edge. Yeah, hard core guys and as long as you as

1017
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:33,900
long as you only pay attention to what they do during the day. Yeah, and when

1018
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:37,280
and when they're not in the presence of people who are younger than them, yep,

1019
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,160
then they're then they're upstanding citizens. Yeah, they all work at they do

1020
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:46,500
acrobatics. Yeah, they all work at Trader Joe's. They all work at Trader Joe's. They wear that

1021
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:52,220
Hawaiian shirt. Yup. They all wear watches. Yup. They don't look at their phone, they

1022
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:57,900
look at their watch. I've been feeling for a minute that the tide is turning on Trader

1023
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:02,940
Joe's. And Trader Joe's has now become... Has it fallen? I think Trader Joe's is cringe.

1024
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:10,220
Yes! I'm sorry. I don't like saying that. I don't want to have to say this. This is

1025
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:14,220
is the kind of thing you'll only hear here. But as a cultural commentator,

1026
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:17,220
Trader Joe's. It's time to call it. I'm ready. I've seen enough. I'm ready to call it.

1027
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:21,220
It's over. It's over. Trader Joe's is cringe.

1028
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:27,220
Fuck you, Joe. I mean, Joe's over. Joe, Ming, Jose.

1029
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:31,220
It's Joe for me. It's Joe for me. All of them. Yeah.

1030
01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:35,220
I don't care how good that everything in the Elote dip is.

1031
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:39,220
I don't care how convenient the pork belly is. It's over. I'm going

1032
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:44,100
somewhere else. I'm taking my business to Aldi. I'm going to Aldi. Is Aldi over?

1033
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:48,180
You know too much about Trader Joe's to be dissing it. You clearly are a patron.

1034
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,980
You're asking if Aldi was over? Aldi never began.

1035
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,980
Damn.

1036
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:56,980
Aldi's nuts in yo face.

1037
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,980
How many?

1038
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:00,980
Aldi's.

1039
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:04,260
Aldi, yeah Aldi never began.

1040
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:06,260
Yeah.

1041
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:10,780
We're never doing it's by the way when I say Trader Joe's is over every single

1042
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:14,180
alternative supermarket is all foods all foods.

1043
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:19,980
We're going local all the no, we're not going local. Not even we're doing the

1044
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:23,380
we're doing whatever the big chain supermarket is stop and shop Harris

1045
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:28,180
Teeter Publix Crocker Market Basket Market Basket. Now, Market Basket has

1046
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:33,180
been a little over, but they could be back soon, but right for now. It's over

1047
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:38,900
now. We do not and anything by the way anything that is local to an area is over as well.

1048
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,860
Yep. The Stop and Shop is local to the northeast. But it's not like people don't have prior

1049
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:49,100
experience. From now on we are only going to any supermarket where they have one in

1050
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:54,220
every town in America. If there's even one town that doesn't have it, we're not going

1051
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:58,340
there. Pigs and Wiggly is not funny anymore. Shaw's, you're done. Every supermarket. Or

1052
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:02,180
or it all has to be owned by the same company. Hannaford supermarket,

1053
01:06:02,180 --> 01:06:06,060
Walmart grocery stores are back. Yeah, here's what I'm saying. And you can

1054
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:10,660
actually and here's how back they are. You can actually buy Wagyu beef at a

1055
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,280
Walmart. Yeah, so that's huge. You know what else you can get at Walmart?

1056
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,820
Every other stuff in your house.

1057
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:25,980
You can get a curtain rod and Wagyu steak and beer, depending on the area.

1058
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:33,200
and they have good deals on movies, DVDs and hey trader joe's. Here's why you're

1059
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,760
over by the way. No dvds, no dvds first of all, but also guys no cds. Hey guys,

1060
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:42,720
if I'm buying an avocado, I don't need to see a picture of the farmer.

1061
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:47,800
I don't need to know his story. I don't need to know that he's been farming

1062
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:53,480
avocado since he was 15 with his family. Shut the fuck up and here's another

1063
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:58,440
thing, Trader Joe's. Why do you have all these parodies around the store?

1064
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:03,160
Yeah. Why do you have these parodies that say like, like, uh,

1065
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,360
empire strikes, whatever, some kind of thing.

1066
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:10,120
Hey, Trader Joe, nice chalkboards.

1067
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:13,200
How about I outline you in chalk when I kill you?

1068
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:18,400
Yeah. Outline, outline you in shock. That's right.

1069
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,400
And you said outlaw. I'm going to outlaw you. You're an outlaw now.

1070
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,360
also Joe and I'm pointing to a camera. We don't have, but

1071
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:31,700
we left all the cameras in Caleb's car. Yeah, that's why we have just two

1072
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:35,220
cameras today. Now I'm pointing at this one, but because of the show we did

1073
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:40,600
and trader Joe, you're gonna you have a fearless flyer. I will become the

1074
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:46,060
fearsome flyer and I will haunt your store with wings and Costco.

1075
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:52,340
Welcome back. Costco's back. Costco is Sam's Club. Sam's Club. Welcome back.

1076
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:57,180
Sam's Club is still technically Walmart. BJ's, guess what? You never left because it's always

1077
01:07:57,180 --> 01:08:03,300
been funny to say your name. But Trader Joe's. Oh, Trader Joe's. You poor bastard. You little

1078
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:08,180
Trader Joe's. Hawaiian shirts, you still think that's funny? You're making me gag. Look,

1079
01:08:08,180 --> 01:08:12,660
you're making Cameron throw up. If you want to switch all the girls to bikinis and all

1080
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:17,300
the guys to suits though, you will be back. You will be back. That's the only bargain

1081
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:22,440
you have a if you have a corporate hose and CEOs party yep every day, you will

1082
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:27,780
be back, you will be back for now you're done and that's enough on trader Joe and

1083
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:29,160
we can finish now yeah.

1084
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:33,780
We can finish now is that all the slides, I don't remember, let's check

1085
01:08:33,780 --> 01:08:35,460
we'll check really quickly.

1086
01:08:35,460 --> 01:08:39,760
Can I wear fancy clothes and have a fancy hairstyle when acting evil? Can I

1087
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:44,040
wear makeup as well? Of course, in fact, that will up the evil factor. I think

1088
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:48,240
but a fancy clothes is okay, but a fancy hairstyle is not evil. I agree unless

1089
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:50,420
you well unless you're some kind of dark judge.

1090
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:55,880
That's a wig, though that's a hairstyle yeah is the evil laugh cliche when

1091
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:59,020
acting evil, not necessarily just try to put your own spin. Let's all put our

1092
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:00,740
own spin on it. Okay, ready?

1093
01:09:00,740 --> 01:09:08,240
That's a class. It is no, no, okay, okay, okay, okay,

1094
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,240
wait, I got it. I was good. I got one. Are you ready? Yeah,

1095
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:14,340
that's

1096
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:16,940
you know somebody who laughs like that they're evil.

1097
01:09:16,940 --> 01:09:22,280
You have a don't how do I imply I'm evil without being evil dress like you're

1098
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,440
evil. The way you dress can imply that you're evil, but you could be the nicest

1099
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,440
person ever. Here's my implications. That's just evil my implications. What

1100
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,920
if you maybe put it on your ID card? Here's my implication. Here's my

1101
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,480
assumption. What if they put that on your driver's license when they ask

1102
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:40,440
what's your height? What's your sex? What's your age? My age is six or good

1103
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,120
and you could just say well, I'm evil yeah.

1104
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:48,480
I came here for a more broad context in theater with that in mind. Do you have

1105
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,780
any more tips on becoming a villain? Villains never think they're the bad

1106
01:09:51,780 --> 01:09:54,360
guy. They never see themselves as sadistic or wrong. They're the hero of

1107
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,500
their own story. Keep that in mind. That's right. I think this next one

1108
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,320
might be the last one.

1109
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:02,320
No, do I have to wear accessories like a choker? My mom doesn't allow me

1110
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:08,440
here we go. This is the last one. What if you accidentally murder people while

1111
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:12,480
acting evil. Will it still be considered a crime after you stop being evil and

1112
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:16,240
the person says of course murder is murder. If you're not legally insane,

1113
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:20,820
you'll be charged with murder. Oh my God, so there's no such thing as they

1114
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:25,360
got rid of the evil, evil defense, the evil to your honor. My client was evil

1115
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:30,560
at the time, but he's not anymore, but he's come nice. Oh, he was just acting

1116
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:33,720
evil when he did the that is kind of it was an accident. A lot of evil villains

1117
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,600
and movies kind of get off on that at the end. If they are turned to the good

1118
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,280
because they realize that it's wrong to be an environmentalist or whatever.

1119
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:40,780
Yeah.

1120
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,640
Why are so many evil villains environmentalists also?

1121
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,360
It is funny.

1122
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:45,800
That what is that going on? What's going on with that?

1123
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:46,600
Eco-terrorism.

1124
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:47,160
Yeah.

1125
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:50,760
Yeah. Why is that? Why is that being evil? That seems like it's nice.

1126
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:53,560
Well, they're just guys who blow stuff up.

1127
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:54,760
Yeah, true.

1128
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,280
Well, they're blowing up bad stuff.

1129
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,640
I'm an ego terrorist.

1130
01:10:57,640 --> 01:11:01,640
Yeah, that's right. You figure out what that means. All right. Goodbye.

1131
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:02,440
All right. If you...

1132
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,800
Oh, wait. The what day?

1133
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,940
Monday, shareholder meeting is on Monday, the next Monday, twenty fourth

1134
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:14,780
is at the twenty fourth and if you want to see me open for Dan Lakata in Austin,

1135
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:19,120
Texas, I will be there the weekend of the twenty eighth, twenty eighth and the

1136
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:24,320
twenty ninth is two shows. There's a real good poster that my old roommate

1137
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:31,300
Neil drew where Dan is Bam and I am fat Phil from CKY three. You don't need to

1138
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:35,240
plug the poster when you plug the show. I like the poster poster. I have to pee.

1139
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:40,080
I keep plugging stuff and then on the 26th, I have a there's a show with the

1140
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:47,160
Pitbull impersonator. He's hosting the show and then I think maybe the yes,

1141
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:53,500
the Sunday, two days before this, three days before this will be my birthday,

1142
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:58,320
the 23rd, the day before the shareholder meeting. If you don't have anything

1143
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:05,080
planned for my birthday, guess what? You will get struck by the back of my hand.

1144
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,080
and

1145
01:12:07,080 --> 01:12:09,080
Cameron will be at my birth.

1146
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,080
No I'm not.

1147
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:13,080
(static)

1148
01:12:13,080 --> 01:12:15,080
Have you guys ever tried remote viewing?

1149
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,080
Yes.

1150
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:19,080
Yeah, Jubia's doing it right now.

1151
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:21,080
Did you succeed?

1152
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,080
Yeah, I actually can see my bedroom with my eyes closed at all times.

1153
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:25,080
I'm going to try it right now.

1154
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,080
Okay, where are you going to go?

1155
01:12:27,080 --> 01:12:29,080
Where should I go? I don't know.

1156
01:12:29,080 --> 01:12:31,080
You don't go, you see.

1157
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:33,080
Where should I see?

1158
01:12:33,080 --> 01:12:35,080
And usually you draw it

1159
01:12:35,080 --> 01:12:41,780
Well, I'm not very good at drawing Cameron. I'm my art form is my words. Okay, then describe I

1160
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:44,600
See some seriously white

1161
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,740
ground

1162
01:12:46,740 --> 01:12:52,540
And I see a bunch of black crap out there, which is on my call space

1163
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:58,720
Okay, and wait, what's that? I'm oh god. I'm seeing a pale blue dot. Oh

1164
01:12:58,720 --> 01:13:01,740
Great. It's a dot

1165
01:13:01,740 --> 01:13:07,340
That moon is very far away. I'm seeing some pale blue. I didn't say which moon

1166
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:13,060
I was on. Oh, I guess you didn't say you were on a moon at all. Now that I think

1167
01:13:13,060 --> 01:13:18,740
about it, I'm on a moon and I'm seeing a pale blue dot. Oh, but wait, what am I

1168
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:23,740
seeing on the pale blue dot? Instead of love, I'm seeing hate and I'm seeing

1169
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:30,380
racial prejudice and sexism and worse of all, misogyny and also kids being

1170
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:32,140
unfairly treated by their parents.

1171
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:38,320
And also there's five or six green monsters all around.

1172
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:44,840
And they are making something, some kind of giant weapon.

1173
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:46,680
- A weapon?

1174
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:48,500
- Yep, and also I can tell that one of them

1175
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,720
is the most popular of the six,

1176
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:52,600
because the other ones are kind of just listening

1177
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,280
to what he's saying, and also he's the tallest one.

1178
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,680
- But does he have like a special kind of hair?

1179
01:13:57,680 --> 01:13:59,140
- He has an Elvis hairdo.

1180
01:13:59,140 --> 01:14:00,140
*swoosh*

1181
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:01,140
Yeah.

1182
01:14:01,140 --> 01:14:02,140
He has an Elvis...

1183
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,140
Greasy...

1184
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,140
That style?

1185
01:14:04,140 --> 01:14:05,140
...bombhead hairdo.

1186
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,140
That slick back Elvis rock and roll style.

1187
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:08,140
That we all know and love?

1188
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:11,060
Oh my god, are the other ones bald or do they all have their own distinct hairstyles that

1189
01:14:11,060 --> 01:14:12,060
define their personality?

1190
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:13,060
Well, basically, one of them has...

1191
01:14:13,060 --> 01:14:14,060
Okay, so there's six of them.

1192
01:14:14,060 --> 01:14:15,060
One of them has an Elvis hair.

1193
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:16,060
Okay.

1194
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:17,060
One of them has very long hair.

1195
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:18,060
Uh huh.

1196
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,060
One of them has shorter...

1197
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,060
Shorter-ish hair?

1198
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:21,060
Does he have glasses?

1199
01:14:21,060 --> 01:14:22,060
One of them has a bob.

1200
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:23,060
Very...

1201
01:14:23,060 --> 01:14:24,060
Kind of cute.

1202
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,060
Okay.

1203
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,060
With a bow?

1204
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:27,060
And then three of them...

1205
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,060
Or the remaining three of them have a bob.

1206
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:30,060
Or the remaining two...

1207
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:31,060
[laughter]

1208
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:33,060
...have no hair at all.

1209
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,060
*Demonic Scream*
