00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Yeah.

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,680
It's going to be interesting to see how we keep up with Cameron.

38
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,680
I'm going to need, it's going to take me a couple weeks.

39
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,520
I just ate a big chop cheese, so I'm like halfway down to your level.

40
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,360
You're at where my old level was?

41
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Yeah.

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Wow.

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,400
Yeah, it's going to be a couple weeks before I recoup.

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,920
I'm going to need to get a lot of rest and I can't, you're not supposed to look at screens

45
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,880
when you have a concussion.

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,160
I just I just had to sit in my bedroom with all the lights off and just kind of

47
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,400
hope I don't get terrified. I'm also pretty scared of the dark is a

48
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,060
big problem for me. Why don't you just get I feel like you just got blue

49
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:36,480
blockers. I don't think it's the blue. I think it might be the blue.

50
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,400
I don't think blue is bad for you. It's blue.

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,480
mm-hmm that's because your brain is red or the blood well no it's red it's blue

52
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,560
so if you think about it it's blue until it touches oh yeah your forehead turned

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,760
red mm-hmm it did so your red don't like blue if you ever seen red versus blue oh

54
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,320
I have they versus each other yeah so you block the blue from the red I love

55
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,560
watching two things versus each other this is one of the best genres of yeah

56
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,320
- Yeah, that's why Deadliest Warrior was so great.

57
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,160
- Warrior.

58
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,000

Oh, the warriors.

61
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,300
- Yeah, Patrick is kind of a deadliest voyeur.

62
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,140
- That's true.

63
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,960
- In a lot of ways.

64
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,760
- Yeah, 'cause he looks and then he touches.

65
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,640

66
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,480

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,300

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,960
know if it was in Vegas but it's somewhere in the middle of the country

83
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:56,280
he ran a motel that he constructed specifically that so that he could just

84
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,680
watch people in their rooms he had like this is different from HH Holmes yeah

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,320
Upstairs thing where he could just look through all these like holes in the shit. Are you eating a high - I tell you the most

Fuckin amazing story of your life. You can't eat a high - that is so disrespectful you fucker

88
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:23,000
Why are you eating a high - cuz I'm hungry and I didn't eat lunch. That's not gonna hell. It's not gonna you carry

It's not gonna fucking fill you up.

91
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,640
It makes the worst sound of all time too.

92
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,240
I do have a plugged salivary gland, so this is medical.

93
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,080
This is not medical, it's annoying.

94
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,600
My doctor told me I have to eat candy.

95
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,280
You have to do it-

96
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,480
When you're at your job.

97
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,080
Yes.

98
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,720
No.

99
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,200
Yes.

100
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,880
You can't wait one hour.

101
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,760
They did not write you a prescription for a Haichu.

102
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,360
They told me that-

103
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,480
Also they said sour candy.

104
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,920
Haichu's not sour, you fucker.

105
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,600
This is kind of sour, it's acai.

106
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,440
I'm through with you. I'm done. Do you carry your backpack just so you can bring acai

107
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,320
haichu with you? No, so I could carry my microphone with me. I think it's because of the haichu.

108
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:11,640
No. You look like Green Day. Because usually you just wear that thing over your chest with your

109
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:16,920
mic, right? You are giving me Green Day vibes. Is it because of the tattoo? No. Speaking of,

110
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:23,240
we all got tattoos in North Carolina. I realized I really was paying respect to North Carolina by

111
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:29,120
getting a concussion and a tribal tattoo. It's the most OG North Carolina shit of

112
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,160
all time. Yeah, yeah. Cameron got mouser. I got mouser. We did, we did hang out.

113
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,120
In North Carolina we were hanging out with Ducker. Chilling with Ducker a bunch.

114
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
I don't know what happened, I think we might have left him there. Really? I think he

115
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,640
didn't get on the flight. He's been going through a lot. He has. Yeah. He's been figuring

116
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,720
his stuff out. I mean you know. Well like Goober saw him. Yeah, Goober saw him. Yeah, it's

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,840
pretty bad. Yeah, I heard. And you know what happened with Mommy Duck? Well, that was

118
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,160
Tom. Tom, Mommy Duck was angry. Well, it's been stressful in his house. No, not really. They don't live together anymore.

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,680
They don't? No. Well, you know, Mommy Duck's always calling him.

120
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,160
Talking about, "Oh, I'm angry on Tom. I'm angry on Tom." I feel like you don't know him that well.

121
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,080
Yeah, it doesn't sound like. I don't, honestly. I just know he's going through it right now.

122
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,680
Yeah, because the Mommy Duck situation's bad, but that's a whole other thing. I mean,

123
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,040
that's more of a like a product of like Jerry with the brain. True. There's a lot

124
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:26,240
that a lot more what is affecting you know the Tom and Mommy Duck situation,

125
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,240

165
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:08,720
steals everything when you think about it. He's a bit of a kleptomaniac in many ways. I don't like

166
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:16,080
kleptomaniac does sound sex sex. A kleptomaniac sounds like a disease. Are kleptos people who

- Well, that's how you can identify a kleptomaniac

171
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,040
versus a normal shoplifter.

172
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,880
- Fuck, I'm gonna steal that.

173
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,400

Jesus Christ.

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,080
is your mom walks in.

281
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,200
She, first of all, she didn't know you had a baby brother.

282
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,640

284
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,960
And it died?

285
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,000

286
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,520
Oh man, yeah, that's nasty.

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,360
- It is.

288
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,200
- That's nasty.

289
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,400
- Why did we say that?

290
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,240
That's terrible.

291
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,060
- I didn't even say that.

292
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,900
- We didn't say it, you said that.

293
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,920
- Why did Patrick say that?

294
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:28,400
- Why did you pretend to be Cam and throw your voice

295
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,080
and perfectly do an impression of him

296
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,920
and say some nasty shit about fucking a player?

297
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,200
- I'll do it again, you ready?

298
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,680
I'll pretend to be Cameron again.

299
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,720
(coughing)

300
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,640
- It's very offensive.

301
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,000
- Yeah, that was not cool, dude.

302
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,600
- Very fucked up.

303
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,480
- Do you wanna hear something that I think is,

304
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,920
I don't know if you guys will find this as funny.

305
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,720
I really did DTD. No, I did Tusken Raider voice. Is that what you call them?

306
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,200
What? At least I didn't say sand people. What the hell? That's what they say in

307
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,420
the movie, isn't that fucked up? Sand people? Yeah, in Star Wars, they call the

308
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,260
Tusken Raider the people who were like,

309
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:05,320
like, like that. They're like, oh, fuck the sand people.

310
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,620
I feel like, well, I feel like if in real life you called, you called like

311
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,360
somebody a Tuscan raider that would probably be worse.

312
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
Yeah.

313
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,840
Well, Tuscany is in Italy.

314
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,840
So yeah.

315
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,840
I don't know.

316
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,640
Now I'm just confused as hell.

317
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,120
This has been making me laugh a lot.

318
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,160
I've been sleepwalking recently, which I really don't like.

319
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,280
I need to find a way to stop.

320
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,320
So if anybody who listens to this knows how to stop from sleepwalking, please message

321
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,320
me.

322
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
If we have any hypnotists listening.

323
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Please.

324
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,880
block the other night and I sat up in bed and I like open the window curtain. I

325
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:46,400
was like looking out the window and Anna woke up. She was like, "Why are you

326
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,680
looking out the window?" And in my sleep I was like, "What? I can't look out the

327
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,200
window?"

328
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:58,240
Dude, I'm like that too when I sleep walk. I'm like so defensive.

329
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
It's making me laugh so much. You told me that in the morning. I was like,

330
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,480
"Oh my God, that's so mean."

331
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,300
Apparently, I turned to Jan sometime recently. She was like dead asleep and I

332
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,260
woke her up and I said, "You need to make me some food."

333
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,520
(laughter)

334
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,020
It's like fucking four in the morning,

335
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,420
I'm completely asleep.

336
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,580
You need to make me some food.

337
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,540
Yeah, and she fucking did.

338
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,900
- That's just what happens when you sleepwalk, I think,

339
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,420
is you just become really rude and mean.

340
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,340
- Yeah, yeah.

341
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,820
- Is that, yeah.

342
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,940
- I think there's something about,

343
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,620
I think it's maybe just 'cause you're tired

344
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,340
and you're half awake.

345
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,180
You know, when you're like really sleepy

346
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,620
and everything's pissing you off.

347
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,460
- Yeah.

348
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,860
'Cause that's the ultimate, you're already asleep,

349
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,020
but you're half awake.

350
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:41,020
- To me, what I think it is for me is like,

351
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,580
when somebody talks to me and I'm sleepwalking,

352
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,180
that'll like wake me up.

353
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,880
And then I'll be like, I'll wake up and I'll like realize

354
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,820
that I'm like up doing something that I,

355
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,940
like I'll be up like putting my clothes on for some reason,

356
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,020
but I'll like feel like I had a reason for doing it,

357
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,940
so I'll just get like defensive about it.

358
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,780
I'll be like.

359
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,500
- I'll wait, continue.

360
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,320
- No, no, that's--

361
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,460
- I just remembered something so funny.

362
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,860
Last night, I woke up in the middle of the night

363
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:07,700
and I like looked over at Jana and I was like,

364
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,700
what the, that's not Jana, and I thought it was you.

365
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,540
And then I was like,

366
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,420
I don't want to sleep in this bed with Cameron.

367
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,460
And I went and got on the couch.

368
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,780
And then Jana was like, why'd you like go to the couch?

369
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:20,220
I was like, oh, I thought that Cameron was in the bed.

370
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,460
(laughing)

371
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,300
- You didn't want to sleep with me?

372
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,060
- Well, you were like pushing me off the bed.

373
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:28,900
- Oh, okay.

374
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,260
- Yeah, and I was like, this sucks.

375
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:33,260
This guy's a fucking, fucking comforter hog.

376
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,300

Now I have to fart just so I can prove that it wasn't me.

388
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,060
I hate being in your zone.

389
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,540
You guys were in my zone.

390
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,380
We didn't even talk about being in North Carolina much.

391

bloodhound, he's a mudhound. Yeah, exactly dude. He was on the trail. He could have,

420
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,040
honestly, we should be canning people's farts and if they go missing, give him a

421
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,800
little sniff of it he'll find him in an incident. He'll literally tiny as shit,

425
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,080
gobble your gas. I literally blew him up like a balloon one night.

00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
They had Mini-Me.

482
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
Wait, did they actually have Chucky?

483
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,300
I don't think they had Chucky.

484
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,300
I have a...

485
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
I have a...

486
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
I have a...

487
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,300
I have a...

488
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,300
I have a...

489
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,300
I have a...

490
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,300
I have a...

491
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,300
I have a...

492
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,300
I have a...

493
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
I have a...

494
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,300
I have a...

495
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
I have a...

496
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,300
I have a...

497
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
I have a...

498
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,300
I have a...

499
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,300
I have a...

500
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,300
I have a...

501
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:31,620
fastest time as you can without touching the lasers. I just ran through all of them and

502
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,900
hit the button. And you lost big time. Yeah, my score was like two minutes. Maybe we should

503
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,060
have been blasting farts in there to reveal more lasers. Yes, that's probably what it

504
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,660
was. You know when they throw a little smoke to reveal the laser? Maybe we needed to take

505
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:52,920
a stinky cloud with us. I think all the lasers are present. I mean dude, I was like swat team

506
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,480
level smoke grenades that I was popping off through the entire week. Especially

507
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,440
Alligator Adventure dude. The alligators, they were literally smelling me when I

508
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,400
walked by and then and then flying up like goldfish and just sitting there.

509
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,640
They were just sitting there with their mouths open. They wanted to, dude, there was I

510
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,800
think it was one of the the crocodiles we saw. Yeah. That thing that thing opened

511
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,000
its mouth and I got a more like a wave of stink. Oh he bucked at you. Yeah. Yeah. He

512
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,720
was like what's up and then he burped and then I he smelled my fart he turned a

513
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,080
stone. I swear to God. Dude, that's the fucking, oh man, that was the weirdest part about fucking

514
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,760
looking at all those alligators and crocodiles and shit. They just sit there in the sun with

515
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,680
their mouths open. Yeah. Fucking. Like nobody I know. Who are you talking about? Cut to Pat

516
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:45,880
at Maria Hernandez just. That's not what I do. I'm spinning in a circle there. No, you're throwing,

517
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,320
your only thing that's moving is your left wrist as you just arch a haichu right into your mouth.

518
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,960
Don't even chew it. You just swallow it like a big pill.

519
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,640
They don't have like a... do they not have a mouth hole till they close their...

520
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,760
Yeah, that's what was tripping me up too. I didn't realize they...

521
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,760
I've never seen a crocodile in person.

522
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,800
Me neither. They don't have...

523
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,480
Y'all don't know gators like me?

524
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,040
They don't have...

525
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,320
They taste great.

526
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:09,960
They don't have throats. They do taste good.

527
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,200
How have you never seen a gator but you've eaten it?

528
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,560
What is that?

529
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:16,040
I've seen them at zoos before but never saw one in the wild.

530
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:16,440
Oh yeah.

531
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,320
I had some alligator bites one time.

532
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:21,080
Oh, really?

533
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Yeah, they were good. The tail is where it's at. The tail is, fried alligator tail is very good. Fucking strong, dude.

534
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:34,360
Delicious. Yeah, I wish we had done some other southern stuff. I might have seen, I might have seen an alligator, like a baby alligator,

535
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,980
but I don't count that. Yeah, yeah, so I said they definitely brought a baby alligator into like my school.

536
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,200
Yeah. We need, we should have tried to see some hogs. Oh, yeah.

537
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,200
Yeah. We did. What? Saw you, bitch. You kidding me? You're gonna do that to me right now?

538
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,740
Yeah, I've literally been mortally wounded

539
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:57,400
Okay, I'm bleat. I'm bleeding and you don't we see a hog. No, we didn't see a hog you fuck talking about

540
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,840
What is wrong with you?

541
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,000
Why I see a big pig

542
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,260
the mirror

543
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,560
What?

544
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:13,660
What is up with you? What is he stop doing this? Can you stop? I saw a big pig at hemp fest in 2018

545
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,260
They had a pig this much weed some guy had a pig I forget the pigs name

546
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,480
But it was some kind of weed pun. It's new piggy pig mm-hmm and that thing

547
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,380
If you snoop hoggy hog could have been it. I don't remember

548
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:34,140
There's a hemp fest in Boston this pig it would come up to you

549
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,140
And it would like basically knock you over if the guy wasn't like you you could go up to it and pet it

550
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,540
But it would like you know come up to you is very excited to see you, and then it would just like

551
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:48,480
It's trying to eat you it's a fat fucking eat you bro. Yeah, I wonder if that guy feeds his pig edibles

552
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,480
I mean if he's bringing it to him fest. He totally feeds his pig and I never see you ever see the show that show Hannibal

553
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,100
No

554
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,360
Cool stuff with pigs in that show really well pigs will eat anything right? Yeah, I'm cool. So cool

555
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:08,260
Cool stuff happens with pigs. I've seen snatch plenty of times. Yeah, me too. I'm saying I had it on DVD is

556
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,980
Why that's a lot. Oh, that's a movie. Mm-hmm

557
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,740
I'm talking about a sexy MILF snatch.

558
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,740
Yeah, I'm talking about DVD, Dick, Vagina, Dick.

559
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,740
Stacked up.

560
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,740
Yeah.

561
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,740
Stacked up like a Dr. Mario pill.

562
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
In that order.

563
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:28,740
I've had MILFs on the brain, dude.

564
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,740
That's cool.

565
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,740
I've been having a MILF fest.

566
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,740
In your mind?

567
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,740
In my mind every day I get on the carnival.

568
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,740
You are so concussed.

569
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,740
I get on the Ferris wheel and then I get off.

570
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:47,140
and then I get off. Every day on the carnival? What are you talking about?

571
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:51,780
Can I, can you guys finish the episode and I can think about a MILF?

572
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,860
No. What carnival are you going to? What if she's sucking my balls? The MILF-Fest

573
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,980
carnival. Oh. Yeah. Where they

574
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,300
deep fry my cock and balls and they feed it to themselves. What kind

575
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,980
of dreams have you been having? I don't remember what's real and what's not.

576
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:12,440
Yeah, I think Cameron was in my bed that you were in my bed last night

577
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,540
You did already tell that story. I had a feeling I did. Yeah. Yeah

578
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:26,180
He's gonna kill us yeah, how am I gonna kill you I'm killing myself your say-o on us you're gonna go Chris Benoit

579
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:33,780
I don't know who that is getting too close back up why back up? Yeah, are you afraid of me back up?

580
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,140
Well, you think I'll do something crazy cuz my brains broken. I think your brains too broken

581
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:45,180
they put a hole in my head. Who's they shelf shelf put a hole in my head when a

582
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,500
couple days ago you were there

583
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:53,600
when you were at my house a better list day. Oh, you did yeah top ten everyday

584
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,540
aspects of life that will be weird in a backwards universe.

585
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,240
Okay,

586
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,640
positron wild hug. Oh, there's our boy yeah. Imagine these things acting where

587
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,840
time runs backwards. They would certainly be bizarre. Oh, okay, all right, so the

588
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,280
saying just if you saw this in reverse, it would know it would be weird in a

589
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,600
backwards universe. Yeah, there's an important distinction there. This is not

590
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,560
it does not say on a reverse. Yeah, it's a backwards universe.

591
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,220
Are you so concussed? You don't remember what a backwards universe is. That's

592
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:31,780
where he's living right now. I am so backwards universe is a forward universe

593
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,720
him. I have I felt this and for the last four days I felt like I had a half of a

594
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,440
of a Klonopin. Yeah? Yeah. And I'm just kind of walking around like kind of

595
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,760
enjoying myself honestly. Concussion might be like I might have ascended to a

596
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,720
higher plane. I tell you that the the first week I was here I went to Blue

597
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,720
Park, fucked up a 50/50 and fell straight to the back of my head. Did anyone check

598
00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:00,000
you? No. Nice. That's badass. I just kind of went home. Did you take a couple naps?

599
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,680
Yeah. All right, you're fine. Yeah. I'm just a couple naps short of being normal again.

600
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:13,440
Yeah. Could be. Could be. Could be. Could be. Number one, pregnancy. Okay, let's

601
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,440
let's hear them out on this because it's already pretty weird. This would be a

602
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,840
tough ordeal for both child and parents. When the kid ages backwards, it shoves

603
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:26,080
itself up into the mother before the baby shrivels into nothing and nine

604
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:30,480
three months later or earlier splits into a sperm and an egg, the former of which

605
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,140
promptly shoots back up into the father. A backwards world would be odd, so you

606
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:41,080
the mom would be older than the kid. Here's another comment, though this

607
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:47,020
doth fair maketh the eyes water. It shoves itself up into the mother such

608
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:51,460
grace such style. This would be bizarre and extremely traumatic for all involved.

609
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,840
Thank goodness. This is impossible. Could you imagine just like like

610
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,000
- Anything's possible. - Mother's just running away

611
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,640
as their child is just cosmically,

612
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,440
just like leashed to their pussy trying to get back in.

613
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
Be kind of funny.

614
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,320
- You think it would be like a goo?

615
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:10,040
- No, it would be like a gravity that's pulling them.

616
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,880
- Like fate.

617
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,160
- Yeah, exactly, it'd be this invisible

618
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,800
kind of like fishing line of fate.

619
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,080
- I was thinking like the-- - As the moms just run around.

620
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,280
- You were thinking like goo. - Trying to keep--

621
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,960
- The umbilical cord shoots out like a Hellraiser chain.

622
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:22,800
(laughing)

623
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,320
To the kid. - Yeah, that's what it would be.

624
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,160
That would be pretty cool. - That would be

625
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,520
corn yeah so it would be like even if you said a biblical corn I did say corn I

626
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:40,960
found a hair on my hair he has truly descended to my level I have hit a wall

627
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,400
Wow I was in you've already you fucked up a word and said something that just

628
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,080
makes no goddamn sense I found a hair on my hair I like a mom's in China and then

629
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,380
and the kid, that's the opposite of China.

630
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,920
(laughing)

631
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,380
Don't you almost say Japan?

632
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,220
- No.

633
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,520
- You almost said Japan.

634
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,960
(laughing)

635
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,800
- It is though.

636
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,920
- Yeah, all right, the mom's in China,

637
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,500
the kid's in Japan on the other side of the world.

638
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,600
(laughing)

639
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,440
And just yeah, she's just sitting there reading a newspaper

640
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,120
and then she looks at the day and says, oh no.

641
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,960
- Oh.

642
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,880
- And then a fucking giant--

643
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,720
- A tentacle.

644
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,720
- Tentacle climbs out of her--

645
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:25,160
Yeah, but then imagine how often that would happen because it's maybe we have

646
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,440
to have like air traffic controllers. Yeah, they were trying to get the wires

647
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,360
got crossed the wrong kid went up the wrong mom. The kids would just be

648
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,680
colliding in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Just it'd be bad dude. Yeah, if

649
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,840
you I was the mom, I'd probably sit on a plate.

650
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:47,400
Think it might stop it. Maybe put a cork up there. Yeah, it's that thing's

651
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,400
beasting through a cork yeah can you made a pressure behind that a wooden cork that

652
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,360
might actually work see if you put a student I even a steel steel door of a

653
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:02,160
bank vault is not gonna hold a mother from its child this you just got snip it

654
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,440
sniff it snip it oh yeah they could whatever if the cord yeah but not

655
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,840
regrows it's like a lizard tail you're just making up rules for this wouldn't

656
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,840
it be the kid has been stoppable and it's invincible wouldn't the kid have to

657
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,280
die for this to happen? Well the kid dies when he turns into nothing in the womb.

658
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,480
Well the kid dies at the beginning of his life because it's a backwards world. He

659
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,600
undies and then he unborns. Man this is breaking my fucking head. Well here if you

660
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,760
want something else that's gonna blow your mind even more number two money.

661
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Money would be avoided like the plague in a backwards universe as when you

662
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:38,480
buy things you are in fact selling them and vice versa so throwing out your

663
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,320
money would make you richer but you'd also be unable to buy something unless

664
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,480
you sell it. God, I hate living in this backwards world. I hate. It's confusing me so badly.

665
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,480
It's like everything that I know has been flipped upside down. Backwards even. No, upside

666
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,240
down. Number three is education. When you graduate, you're basically confirming in a

667
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,160
backwards universe that you don't need your knowledge anymore and over your backwards

668
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,560
courses you lose it into thin air as your teachers teach it backwards and you'd begin

669
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,960
to lose your degrees as your exams are undone until at the end of your life or

670
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,120
after your reverse education you're no longer toilet trained horrific thought

671
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:22,000
right well that's just Jupiter true we're going to get that is Jupiter so I

672
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,360
guess the backwards world is Jupiter's had done the concussion made me I

673
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:29,800
googled the day after I literally went on my phone and googled it can a

674
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:37,480
concussion make you stupider what's wrong with that that's the right word

675
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,920
stupider is not the right word stupider no yeah it's not a real word it is

676
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,320
stupider well what else rhymes with Jupiter almost nothing yeah cupid or

677
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:51,720
something could be number one sir come pupator which is what you use on the

678
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:59,640
computer it's an app yeah it's an app where you mind poop you say mind poop

679
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:06,800
mine you have a mind poop you do I don't you have a you have a butthole IQ test

680
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,160
us against you right now. I don't want to do that again.

681
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:21,240
I was drunk as shit and I took an IQ test and got an eighty five.

682
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:27,520
I was trying to speed run it.

683
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,000
No, I watched it. It was yeah, you were giving yourself way more credit. I

684
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,760
didn't try to speed run it. I really don't remember that fast, but that was

685
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,120
because I think you kept getting distracted.

686
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,440
- Yeah. - Yeah.

687
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,320
- True. - It was so funny though.

688
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,160
- I forgot about that. - It was one of the

689
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
funniest things ever.

690
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,000
- Yeah. - Yeah.

691
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,720
- I mean, I don't doubt that my IQ is probably--

692
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,360
- I think you got past 100, brother.

693
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:52,560
- I probably shaved like 10 points off.

694
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,400
I think it's probably around 95.

695
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,880
- I think you got a 95.

696
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:56,000
- I think I'm probably at 95.

697
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,040
- Hey, that's an A.

698
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,400
- Exactly. - That's right.

699
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,440
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah.

700
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,360
- There's no way that I'm an intelligent person.

701
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,200
- You know, who knows? - There's no way.

702
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,640
'Cause you look at those pattern things

703
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,440
you're supposed to look at? It's all lines and squares.

704
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,440
It's a gobbledy-goo.

705
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
Yeah.

706
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,440
Put it in words.

707
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
Yeah.

708
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
I don't, fucking, you think I can...

709
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,440
Smart enough to read.

710
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
Yeah, I can read words.

711
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,440
Mm-hmm.

712
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,440
Maybe just turn the shapes into the words that the shapes are.

713
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
Think that might help you?

714
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
But then you're also dyslexic.

715
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
So it's just this line, line, shape. Oh, yeah, true.

716
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,440
So you'll be fucking up all that too. Maybe you are stupid.

717
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
Maybe.

718
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,440
Number four is...

719
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Oh, no, wait. Here's a comment on education. I was waiting to read this one.

720
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,440
Okay.

721
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:37,240
our education system is kind of backwards already.

722
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,720
Instead of learning stuff, we are rote memorizing.

723
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,840
- Shit.

724
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,680
- This guy should be maybe the president

725
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,040
of the Queen of England or something.

726
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:45,480
- Yeah, the president of the Queen of England.

727
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,880
- Okay, now you can do number four.

728
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,680
- Number four, I believe it says health care.

729
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,920
(laughing)

730
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,160
- You're just, no, no.

731
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,360
- Can I take a 90 second break?

732
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
- You are faking, you're completely faking.

733
00:41:58,360 --> 00:41:59,200
- No.

734
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,080
- You can't, no.

735
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,240
- Health care, I said health care.

736
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,720
- You said health care.

737
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,200
I can't be looking up words is not concussed you guys are stupid you've

738
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,040
never done that before you I've fucked up words all the time like this I thought I

739
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:21,240
did constantly I'm like known for that no Patrick is known for that I don't so

740
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,560
Patrick does you guys are supposed to make me feel better and just ignores I

741
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,680
just need a couple naps and I swear you know what no one ignores it when I do it

742
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,680
Well that's different.

743
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
It's different.

744
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,680
Oh God.

745
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,800
Alright, what does healthcare say?

746
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:42,120
This can be a minor irritation, like a doctor taking your cough pills away while your throat

747
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,120
feels like sandpaper.

748
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Cough pills?

749
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:48,720
Or it could be an amoral Armageddon, like it would be if surgeons were to implant a

750
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:54,100
pus filled appendix into you before applying anesthetic.

751
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,840
So it's just my doctor.

752
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
True.

753
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,000
Is that what your doctor does?

754
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
My doctor's a damn savage.

755
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,360
low key is how health care is in the normal universe to it's already

756
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,440
backwards. You tell you what going backwards and see if I give a fuck

757
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,000
that's right. Yeah, your number five is puberty would not like to have that

758
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,960
happen backwards.

759
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,200
That's the only thing that'd be awesome. There's one other comment that says

760
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:23,800
that would be so awkward. That would be are you kidding puberty. You read of

761
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:31,720
sexual desire that would be perfect. It'd be so cool. You lose all your fucking... my

762
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:38,680
top hair comes back, my bottom hair go away, my penis is extracted, and my balls, they

763
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:47,920
hide from me. This is like the perfect life. Plus I get really short. What? You guys wouldn't

764
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,000
like that? To go backwards puberty? No. I'd love that. I just pretend I never... I do want

765
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,320
I do want to accelerate it. I want to get my ball done. Patrick does want Caleb to

766
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:05,000
go through reverse puberty though. No, you do and then you want to control my body.

767
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:12,920
You want to put you want to put an RC receiver in my brain. You want to do being

768
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:17,880
John Malkovich with with baby Caleb. You want to you want to shrink I'm you want

769
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,480
me to shrink into a child, you to shrink into a microscopic object and then do

770
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,320
Gundam with my body. No, I don't. Do you sit and get it? And then you want to fight me and

771
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:31,480
kill me because you hate me. That's not true. And then. That's how you know this isn't true

772
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,360
at all. Maybe it's not true. Maybe it's not true. Maybe we're just making this up. Number

773
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:41,100
six is memory. Maybe it could be real. Memory. Memory. I'm very familiar. How would anyone

774
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:45,520
live with memory capacity acting back through time? I also couldn't remember what a glove

775
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,520
box was yesterday. What? But I think that's a normal thing. What are you talking about?

776
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:52,520
I forget the name of the glove box all the time.

777
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,520
I text, I was trying to text my...

778
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,520
Like were you looking at a glove box?

779
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:58,520
I was looking at it and I was like, "What is that?"

780
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,520
I couldn't remember the name.

781
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,520
You couldn't remember the name or you were like, "What is that?"

782
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,520
No, I knew what it was, I just couldn't remember the name of a glove box.

783
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,520
Why is this in my car?

784
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,520
What is that?

785
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,520
What's the one under the passenger seat?

786
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,520
The glove box.

787
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,520
That is the glove box.

788
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,520
Oh, okay, I feel way better about this.

789
00:45:16,520 --> 00:45:18,520
I thought you meant that you didn't know what it was.

790
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:22,520
car in the car. You were just like what is this? Oh yeah. Now what is this is

791
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,920
very different from what is this called? The thing I get fucked up now is

792
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,620
because all cars have like a center console or whatever the center console.

793
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,720
Yeah, the thing yeah, the console. Yeah, thing where you where you push

794
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,520
there should be a better name for center console. Yeah, because glove box

795
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:41,820
is great glove box. You can tell but now that they're throwing all these

796
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,920
center console based on based on my mom's car. They should call it the

797
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,820
sand area. It's always filled with sand in that car. That's right. Get off

798
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:51,820
beach you idiot what the hell's going on um why are you putting sand in there

799
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,640
she got like more like people would tell me like oh like this is in the center

800
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,380
console or like this is in that and I would always go digging through people's

801
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:03,820
cars a lot no I get stuff out of the car like my mom or my dad asking there's

802
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:13,820
sand in there people tell me people tell me all the time people are always

803

804
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,700
- You ever notice that people always tell you

805
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:18,540
to do the dishes?

806
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,360
- And people are telling you.

807
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,500
- People are telling you it's your bedtime.

808
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,340
- People are always like,

809
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,180
"Dinner's ready." - People are telling you

810
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:23,000
it's your bedtime.

811
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,340
- People are always like, "Dinner's ready,

812
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:25,940
"you're going upstairs, it smells horrible."

813
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,180
- I hate people.

814
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,220
I hate dinner.

815
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,060

- Oh, true.

819
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,020
- We have established that he loves all food.

820
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,860
- True, yeah.

821
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:35,680

00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:39,840
- Dine Feld.

827
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,680
- Dine Feld.

828
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,320
only took us 60 episodes huh we were doing Dinefeld in North Carolina yeah I

829
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:51,780
forget what weirs oh it was like what's it called a sandwich oh no no no no all

830
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:57,480
the sands and some people Center consoles who's that the comedian we made

831
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,440
up Oh dog dog the comedian oh I kind of don't want to tip that on yeah I think

832
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:08,840
we have big plans okay we have big plans for dog the comedian but trust you guys

833
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,280
you guys are going to love this crap. What's the deal with this guy dog the

834
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,000
comedian is he a hot dog is he a guy is he a dog? I wish it was a guy

835
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,200
so I get a hot dog with him. What's a glove box? I can't get over how funny is

836
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:27,340
it. Patrick's trying to generalize people as your mom and dad is so funny.

837
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:29,880
Well, I was going to say my sister to

838
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:39,200
people. I hate when people make me do stuff. Number seven is invention. That's

839
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,660
actually pretty funny. A world where people already have things invented and

840
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,200
then they just forget. They have to invent it not existing anymore. Yeah,

841
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,820
like lying. Yeah, it's like the invention of lying. Thomas Edison comes in and

842
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:58,460
he's like, "What if it was really dark in here?" He's just smashing light bulbs

843
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:07,820
hammer. Yeah, the guy was like really sick and be like what if that guy just

844
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:08,340
died?

845
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:12,120
What if we just let him die?

846
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,980
Oh, fuck! Who's another guy who invented something? Yeah, what are the guy has

847
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:18,220
to

848
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:22,180
or yeah, just put in a bunch of nasty shit in the middle.

849
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,420
I think like it is undrinkable. I took a shit in all the milk, whoever the

850
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:36,580
whoever invented car the car was like I wish this thing was alive. I wish this

851
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,740
was yeah. I wish there was like four or five animals that pulled me instead of

852
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:45,060
this crap. Yeah, the right brothers, the right brothers.

853
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:59,740
yeah yeah Oppenheimer he's like just chill now I am become what sound I become

854
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:10,940
party that would totally happen in backwards universe they call the pussy

855
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:18,700
hounder now I become MTV's can't but what was that God damn it MTV you tried

856
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:25,820
spring break in Cancun. Now I've become, now I'm become MTV's spring break in Cancun.

857
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:30,140
Destroyer of worlds. Destroyer of beers.

858
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:36,300
It's pretty good actually. I didn't give you a chance there, my bad.

859
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:41,180
Yeah. Now I've become, now I'm become Girls Gone Wild.

860
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:44,620
Destroyer of girls, dude. Destroyer of girls.

861
00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:46,400
Number eight, crime.

862
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,800
Criminals will put money into vaults and seal them up,

863
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,440
or might suck knives and bullets out of corpses

864
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:52,760
before they come to life.

865
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,880
Sucking a knife.

866
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:54,840
Oh, hell no.

867
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:55,600
Oh, hell no.

868
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,560
I know you ain't sucking a knife and bullet out

869
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,440
of that corpse.

870
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,520
Here's the other comment.

871
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:02,360
Ha ha ah, that's epic.

872
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,480
From Toucan.

873
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,840
Here's a good-- number nine is menstruation.

874
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,800
Ooh.

875
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,160
Positron Wildhox says, I don't know how it feels forwards,

876
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,680
but I can imagine that backwards would be a lot worse.

877
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,160
I feel like it'd be fine, right?

878
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,160
Yeah.

879
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,160
Might be.

880
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,400
Well, you would start out in pain.

881
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,120
Just be like an OxyClean commercial.

882
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,440
Yeah, it cleans up.

883
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:24,440
Yeah.

884
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:25,440
It's a cleaner upper.

885
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,440
Yeah.

886
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:30,040
Yeah, it's like when they put the bounty wipe.

887
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,040
Yeah.

888
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:32,040
What is that?

889
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,040
What?

890
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,800
That was a really scary cough.

891
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,800
I had something in my throat.

892
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:40,720
You made like deep eye contact with Patrick and were like...

893
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,720
Until now.

894
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:49,720
I don't know forgot how to cough number tens digestion. Oh, oh hell no. I think I

895
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:52,920
know where this is going. Oh, are you telling me I'm gonna up Chuck a full

896
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,120
hamburger full BTS meal. Here's the top comment. See this is why I like the world

897
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:02,520
even with its problems. Do you what would make me hate life having your poop being

898
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,560
shoved up your butt every time you try to eat something but where's the poop if

899
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,480
it's not being sucked up yet it's not in your rectum. You're still trying to eat

900
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:13,780
eat something like you're like you know you're in a backwards world, but you go

901
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:18,120
in like maybe this time I'll actually eat it. It's just poop going on my ass

902
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,280
fuck see, but I guess poop going up your ass is not as bad as poop going in your

903
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:22,920
mouth right.

904
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:29,680
I don't know that might be the because I know the greatest questions. I

905
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:36,440
well, because because a backwards universe that's poop going up your butt,

906
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:40,160
but like a topsy turvy universe could be that you're eating poop. You know

907
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,740
I much rather live backwards in topsy-turvy. Absolutely. Or like a twisted

908
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,560
universe. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Some kind of fucked up genie magic universe where

909
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:56,000
everything's wrong. That is, I definitely don't want to eat poop. Yeah, which would you rather?

910
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,840
Would you rather eat poop or have it shoved up your butt by a force? It has to be by a force.

911
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:08,480
By a reverse gravity. So, okay. It's an easy question. It's two very simple and

912
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,480
and attractive options

913
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:15,000
each as it's frozen on your mouth in the other one use the second one you put

914
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,240
okay well okay it's

915
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:19,240
we're going to run your okay well we're not considering that right now it's just

916
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,160
a would you rather those two things but

917
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:24,360
if you're getting poop that does mean the food goes up your butt

918
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,840
but this ignore that

919
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:29,040
so i think the second probably

920
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,400
it goes up your butt

921
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,480
the second one eating poop? no. well did it come out of your mouth? oh the first one eating poop

922
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:36,680
okay so pat would rather eat poop

923
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:41,700
what now the second one where the poop goes in your body and your mouth yet

924
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,020
and now you know you want one that does

925
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:48,020
you want a version where you get poop up your butt and in your mouth

926
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,500
yeah i think i didn't consider that

927
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,420
that i don't know when that's not a backwards topsy-turvy universe yeah

928
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,700
where you have to eat the poop and it goes up

929
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:02,540
well there's also a really good love it's a backwards world is in poop food

930
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,420
no i don't like to turn it

931
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,860
Oh, but in the Topsy-Turvy universe, you would like the poop because I like food.

932
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:08,360
Right.

933
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,060
So yeah, I'd rather have that.

934
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:13,300
Rather eat poop.

935
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:18,500
If I like liked, every day I was like, "Uh, if I was putting a bib on to eat poop and crack it

936
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:22,100
open like a lobster tail, that'd be sick."

937
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,380
It's got meat in the poop.

938
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:24,980
Yeah, well, it is meat.

939
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:28,740
But you'd also, I mean, a backwards universe, you'd probably like putting the poop up your butt,

940
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:29,240
right?

941
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,100
I like normal pooping and I like eating.

942
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,700
Yeah, so you probably like both of them.

943
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:37,900
I guess you're right. I mean I'm I'm big not backwards one. You have to have

944
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:42,040
backwards one you the food comes out of your mouth when you when the poop goes

945
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,600
up your but then what happens the topsy-turvy someone's universe

946
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,740
constructs the topsy-turvy universe when you eat poop does food come out of your

947
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:53,860
butt or is it just poop again because it did go through the digestive system it's

948
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,220
not like it's running backwards I think we got it I think we got a like I think

949
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:02,700
we've got a message a scientist I think you have the grass Tyson to do some kind

950
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:07,100
kind of math a radical experiment. I think in the but we're going to put it

951
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,800
will put will put comes out of your butt right food would come. We're going to

952
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,600
will dog here. This conversation will come back to this and we're talking to

953
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,460
a science. Okay, all right, we'll get a scientist on full week. So a full you

954
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:21,460
would poop a full burger. Well, no, it'd be bites of a burger and then when it

955
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:24,620
depends on it depends on which universe you're in if it's if it's backwards

956
00:54:24,620 --> 00:54:29,940
upside down topsy turvy twisted or strange. There's also the poop universe

957
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:35,940
everything is made out of poop so you don't really so it doesn't matter if it

958
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,180
goes up your butter in your mouth because it is your butt and mouth yeah exactly

959
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:43,340
it's called the poop averse they're actually doing a spider-man movie about

960
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:49,820
Venom's with Alfred oh yeah dude poop I'm so excited for poop venom to my god

961
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:55,220
PCU you want to find a venomous poop yeah I already found one is in his own

962
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:58,420
mouth no it was in your mouth why are you looking at my mouth because you're

963
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,260
were eating poop and it was disgusting. You were on the hunt for poop and you

964
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,980
don't why you watching another man's mouth. Stop mouth watching

965
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:11,080
all right now we're to the contenders. Yeah, we're to the beautiful contenders

966
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:15,060
on this lovely list. It is a lovely list isn't it well. Oh there are some there

967
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:18,620
are some another comment here. Maybe there's some people with answers.

968
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,620
There's there to really good there. Okay, you would have to sit on a toilet

969
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,980
before crap rises from the drain and into you, which would materialize into

970
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,680
pieces of poop or into pieces of food, which are fused together by your teeth

971
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:31,980
until you before you pull it up your throat and out of your mouth. I think

972
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:36,760
I'll pass and then here's the other crap rises and here's the other comment

973
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,460
from the toilet to the plate

974
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:45,960
farm to table dude from the toilet to the plate that's by to can number

975
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:46,880
eleven murder.

976
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,880
You'd bring people back to life. Can you imagine the thrillers detective who

977
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:56,840
brought him back to life. Murder victim. It was him. That sounds thrilling.

978
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:04,440
That didn't sound thrilling. It's a backwards universe. It would be thrilling to me. A chiller.

979
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,000
You know the answer at the beginning. You can just relax. It would be a relaxer of a

980
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,200
movie. Watching a movie. Number 12, yeah, watching a movie, you start at the credits.

981
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:19,960
Number 13, farts. That's similar I think to food. I think it would be burps. What? It

982
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,280
like with your no with sucking it all day like like crash he's already living in

983
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,440
the back he escaped from the backwards universe the backwards topsy-turvy

984
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,200
universe where you suck up farts with your mouth yeah set up with your butt

985
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,600
yeah he was like he was a professional cloud chewer yeah he slipped through a

986
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:43,640
rip in space-time and he ended up in my bed with my butthole in his mouth just

987
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,440
absolutely sucking up farts I'm giving him it for Christmas I literally do go

988
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,720

989
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,600
yeah and and my mom's always like what'd you get like the dogs for Christmas and

990
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,800

991
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:07,520
not safe for work absolutely yeah yeah PG-13 mm-hmm number 14 crying mm-hmm

992
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,200
yeah they should people just should stop crying that'd be a better universe

993
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:16,840
crying so annoying 15 proposing yeah the woman would do it oh my god are you

994
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:28,840
you

995
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,240
from the same universe as Crash.

996
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,680
- Yeah, she actually, and Crash, she was farting in Crash.

997
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,680
- Sometimes it feels-- - They came here together.

998
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:37,600
- Sometimes it already feels like

999
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:38,680
we're in a backwards universe

1000
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:41,080
with all these masks and vaccines.

1001
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,600
- Yep.

1002
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,680
- So true.

1003
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,560
- You can't say that on a podcast.

1004
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,960
- I have a, I am legally concussed.

1005
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:51,040
- Masks and you know what's.

1006
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,040
- You know what.

1007
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:52,960
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1008
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,360
- Yeah, you know what's.

1009
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:57,000
Number 16, death.

1010
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:58,120
Here's the top comment.

1011
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:00,120
This would be a birth.

1012
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:01,120
It's true.

1013
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,120
Okay, this is officially a birth.

1014
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:08,120
Yep, and then when you reach age 0.0000001, death.

1015
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:11,120
Why don't they just let you keep going? I don't get it.

1016
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,120
Yeah.

1017
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,120
True.

1018
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,120
So you would start out dead, then wake up somewhere just like...

1019
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:17,120
You'd be old as fuck.

1020
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,120
Here's a genius here.

00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,240
the comment from funny user is would you write with your foot or just type

1034
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,040
everything that is pretty funny it's probably right shit back it is pretty

1035
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:19,760
probably right back probably erase stuff yeah oh yeah true yeah like painting

1036
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,900
thing would be who can get rid of paint better right. So it would kind of be

1037
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,560
like it would be like garbage men and painters would switch places yeah yeah

1038
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:33,820
true garbage men might be the highest people in society. It's meant garbage

1039
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:37,380
people would hate garbage and so much in the backwards universe. They were

1040
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:41,300
everything they show up and drop the stinkiest most disgusting trash right

1041
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:45,400
and then you have to make it good yeah. Yeah, you have to use it to make your

1042
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:49,820
all your meal yeah, just a appeals, they have to show them up your butt.

1043
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:56,120
I hate this world. You have to show poop up your butt to spit out a banana into

1044
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,420
the peel and they have to bring it back to the store.

1045
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:03,740
I'm going to drop groceries off. They do give you money to do that, though.

1046
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:06,320
That's kind of worth it. That's everyone, but you also have to throw

1047
01:00:06,320 --> 01:00:11,260
the money out to become rich shit. I don't want to move out of everything

1048
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,320
Number 20, hangovers.

1049
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,540
- Well, you can reverse a hangover pretty quick.

1050
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:17,580
- Hair of the dog.

1051
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:18,420
- Mm-hmm.

1052
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,740
- Mm-hmm.

1053
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:20,580
Blogging.

1054
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:21,420
(laughing)

1055
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,460
- That would be so weird.

1056
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:23,300
- Yeah, people would read them.

1057
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,120
- Yeah, people would read them.

1058
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,180
- So strange backwards.

1059
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:27,220
Hey, hey.

1060
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:28,040
- That was insane.

1061
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:28,880
- That was insane.

1062
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:29,700
- How'd you do that?

1063
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:30,740
- Number 29, injuring yourself.

1064
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,660
You would be healed all the time, I guess.

1065
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:33,940
(laughing)

1066
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:34,760
- So true.

1067
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,540
I guess that person injures himself all the time.

1068
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,380
- Number 31.

1069
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:38,200
- That's what I'm getting at.

1070
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,300
- Number 31, we've already discussed.

1071
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:41,140
- Yeah, the final comment.

1072
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:45,740
thirty is urinating and thirty one is pooping. That's a nasty crap. All right,

1073
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:49,540
kind of I will say it feel probably pretty good to watch the water go white

1074
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:53,380
when you suck up a P. That would be pretty good. You know, it would be

1075
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,860
annoying, though, is you it would it would leave streaks of poop on the

1076
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:01,980
toilet bowl. You're right yeah yeah, it'd be sucking the poop back up. Yeah,

1077
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:05,460
you I love playing that game. Yeah, get the poop stains off the toilet bowl. My

1078
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:13,500
penis yeah ah so awesome. My penis is my tool. You kill someone with a gun not a bullet.

1079
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:21,500
