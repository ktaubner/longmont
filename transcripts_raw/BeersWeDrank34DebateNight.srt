00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,000
*sniff*

3
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,500
Oh, it's recording!

4
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,000
*sips*

5
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:02,500
*sips*

6
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:03,000
*sips*

7
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:03,500

00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,000

14
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,000
*sips*

15
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:07,500
*sips*

16
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,000

17
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,500

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,500
*sips*

26
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:13,000
*sips*

27
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,500
*sips*

28
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,000
*sips*

29
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,500
*sips*

00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,000

*sips*

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,500
*sips*

34
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,000
*sips*

35
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,500
*sips*

36
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,000
*sips*

37
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I need to talk to my DJ.

38
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What's up all my chuggers?

39
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'm trying to get that boob out.

40
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
This is a journey into...

41
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
...the internet.

42
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
...the planet, Ken.

43
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Bud Light.

44
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
...Hot Food Ribbon.

45
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Beer's We Drank, motherfucker.

46
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
With Juvio, Caleb, and Rex.

47
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Beer.

48
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Beer.

49
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Beer.

50
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Welcome back, you pieces of shit.

51
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Welcome back to Beer's We Drank, man.

52
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Everybody crack open their beers.

53
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Click.

54
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,720
There goes my delicious beer. Mine is scented with a scent, with an odor.

55
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,400
Well, I'll start because I maybe have the most fail beer of

56
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,360
any of us that we've ever had on this show. All right, let's go. Let's go. Let's go on the fail scale.

57
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,880
Let's do at least most fail beer, half fail beer, and fully not fail beer. So you go first Caleb.

58
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,440
Okay.

59
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,640
Here's my fail beer guys. This...

60
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,400
Last night I hosted Leo, my friend from the United Kingdom.

61
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,400
Shout out.

62
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:25,680
Came over to my house and me and him, we got back to my house after we had been at the bar

63
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,360
for a little bit and we had a little nightcap.

64
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,860
We had, I had two white claws sitting in my fridge.

65
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,340
We popped them open.

66
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,600
I got about two sips into mine and decided that I did not want to drink anymore and I

67
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,160
put it in the fridge and that's what I'm drinking.

68
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:49,160
I'm finishing this today, because this is the beer that I had.

69
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm drinking a beer that I've already had two sips of.

70
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
This is one of the biggest fails of my drinking career.

71
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Listen, it's completely flat and I'm going to give you a sip.

72
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,920
This is somehow worse than the Sober Gophers episode.

73
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:12,000
I almost did Sober Gophers because I didn't really want to drink anything tonight, but

74
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,840
I didn't want to go to Walgreens and they card you for non-alcoholic beer and I have a temporary

75
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,920
ID right now and I didn't want to have to explain.

76
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,960
I hate having to explain that to people because I hand them a piece of paper and they say what

77
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,120
is this?

78
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,360
And I say it's a temporary grey ID and they act like they've never seen it before.

79
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,560
Anyway, guys, I mean this is a one.

80
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,200
This is just about the worst thing you can fucking drink in your life.

81
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,680
It's the natural lime flavor.

82
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,840
It tastes like complete shit, man.

83
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,680
I have that bottle of proper 12.

84
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,800
I've been slowly, I've been ever so slowly...

85
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,920
Here's what I've been doing with that, by the way.

86
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:59,280
If I, to be economical, because I already spent money on this bottle of proper 12, but

87
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,000
I hate the taste of it so much, I will pour like a half of an ounce of proper 12 in a

88
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,320
giant glass of water so that it just tastes like water.

89
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,760
And I will have that because that's the only way that I can drink it.

90
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,520
And maybe if I finish this, maybe I'll have to show you that.

91
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:21,120
This will be the two worst drinks ever.

92
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,600
Should I put proper 12 in this right now?

93
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,600
Yeah, actually yeah.

94
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,600
It's going to get worse than what you're currently drinking.

95
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,600
Okay.

96
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,320
We're just making potions now.

97
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,680
All right, well actually that's a really good segue into my beer.

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:46,600
Since Caleb is making a mixture, I bought a pre-mixed beer that I've been informed by a

99
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,800
very close source of mine that is actually complete shit.

100
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,200
This is a soul mix with a mango juice or whatever.

101
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,480
I think it's like mango and some shit.

102
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Mango and chamoy.

103
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,480
Chamoy, yeah.

104
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,520
I was told that the-

105
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,520
Sounds good.

106
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:13,320
Wait a second. That's all in theory in practice. I was told this is a wait wait wait wait wait wait

107
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:23,580
This is amazing, yeah, this is amazing. This is good

108
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,320
Really

109
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:33,780
That is good. That is good. Good. That's like a cocktail explain. That's amazing. Explain what's going on. It tastes it

110
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,660
Hmm. What does it taste like it has some kind of mixed drink kind of stuff going on?

111
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:45,980
Yeah, I'm tasting almost like a it tastes like almost a gimlet. Have you ever had a gimlet?

112
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,500
Yeah, I got almost like some kind of whiskey gimlet, right?

113
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,700
It's good, man. This is a good drink. I'm gonna give this a

114
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,300
Fah I'm gonna give this a

115
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:03,340
Six foot two Wow. This is a point guard. This is a star an undersized but starting point guard

116
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,700
This is a 6'2", this is a 5.7 on the numerical scale.

117
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,100
This is not bad, man.

118
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,980
Yeah, the lime I thought would kind of cut the nastiness of the proper 12.

119
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,980
It really does.

120
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,980
That is amazing.

121
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:19,820
Doesn't have like a nastier aftertaste or anything?

122
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,940
No, it has not.

123
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,280
It almost tastes like neither drinks that it is made out of.

124
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,540
It is more than the sum of its parts.

125
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,540
That's awesome.

126
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,540
I'm really happy with that.

127
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,540
Wow.

128
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
Wow.

129
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,540
I'm going to drink my mango and chamoy soul beer now.

130
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,540
Okay.

131
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,540
That sounds good.

132
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,540
It's alright.

133
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,540
Okay.

134
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,180
I don't hate it.

135
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,260
It does taste like chamoy and a little bit of mango juice I guess.

136
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,780
So as advertised, it tastes like what it is on the can.

137
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:55,340
I'm going to go with a straight through the middle five.

138
00:05:55,340 --> 00:06:00,140
I don't love it, but I don't completely hate it like I was told I was going to hate it.

139
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,140
Okay.

140
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,180
if you like to have a way

141
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,180
uh... to more

142
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,280
get it for a good treat

143
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,700
i have that giant i've i've bought that giant mega chum boy

144
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,980
at the grocery store

145
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,680
why and i was a person because i put it on pineapple everyone so well

146
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,620
but i looked at the ingredients and it's just about the worst thing you put your

147
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,420
body

148
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,660
yeah pretty much

149
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,280
all its leader plastic

150
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,780
it's high fructose corn syrup in red forty that's the entire does the first

151
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:35,780
first

152
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,620
first time I've had Chamoy this year and it's in my awesome beer. I'm a fan of

153
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:50,580
Chamoy. Okay. So I am very excited for this I saw this. I have a Victory Berry

154
00:06:50,580 --> 00:07:02,460
Monkey. Oh wow. So this is still a 9.5% beer. Uh-huh. But it's it's a sour monkey

155
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,980
with a hint of berry. Let's let's.

156
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:09,420
There's also a 2.5 percent, so this is like water.

157
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:12,180
You keep coming with these weak ass beers, man.

158
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:14,020
Yeah, they get weaker.

159
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,300
That's all I get at my 7-Eleven.

160
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,860
You keep coming with these weak beers.

161
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:22,300
What are you getting?

162
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,380
What kind of things are you getting?

163
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,740
What's the flavor?

164
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,060
It's almost tasteless.

165
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,020
It's really weird.

166
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,100
Hmm. And normally the chips.

167
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,140
Normally both you and I are fans of the sour monkey line of products.

168
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,600
This is a good line of products.

169
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,260
This is a beer with a lot of flavor.

170
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,460
It doesn't taste so much like beer.

171
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,420
It tastes almost like sour candy.

172
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,780
So this is very surprising to me.

173
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:48,740
It's odd because you know you taste the sour monkey, you get that overwhelming sourness.

174
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,740
You know?

175
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,060
Could this be a byproduct of you having pretty much like stomach cancer over the past like

176
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,060
two weeks?

177
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
No.

178
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
Because I don't have tongue cancer.

179
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,060
You've been having stomach cancer?

180
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:03,060
Tell me what's been going on gastrointestinally.

181
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:10,060
Okay. Obviously I've talked about having food poisoning like last couple...

182
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,060
I just remembered exactly what happened last night.

183
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:20,060
And then last night, while we were gaming, we played two games of Valorant.

184
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:27,060
And during the first game I chugged half of a monster that was sitting on my desk for like hours.

185
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,060
And I ate an entire bag of Gardetto's.

186
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
What's Gardetto's?

187
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,060
Gardetto's are like Chex Mix with the extra kind of like flavoring to them.

188
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,060
Okay.

189
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,060
They're yummy. But it's like Chex Mix basically.

190
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,060
So like a 12 ounce bag of Chex Mix.

191
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:47,060
And uh, I did that during the first game because I hadn't eaten all day.

192
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,060
And it was by the way, the greatest I've ever seen Rex play in history.

193
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
Yeah.

194
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,060
It was amazing.

195
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Put on a clinic.

196
00:08:54,060 --> 00:09:00,060
Yeah, I really tore that one up. And honestly, I wasn't doing too bad in the second game.

197
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,060
Until...

198
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,060
He stopped moving. He was sitting in the spawn.

199
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,060
Okay, so I started to feel... you know that feeling of weakness you get when you haven't eaten?

200
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,060
And you're like, "I don't even know how I'm going to get the energy to get up and get food."

201
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:20,060
So I started to get that feeling, and there was a moment where I made a call.

202
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,740
I like lost a gunfight, but I had hit the other person out. They were low and I kind of went like

203
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,120
Cypher blow, you know like that Julio laughed at me

204
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,860
Thinking I was maybe doing a joke. This was a death rattle, right?

205
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:38,420
As I was getting closer and closer and I was like, okay, we'll just

206
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,260
Make it to the end of the game

207
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:47,580
You'll figure it out when you get there. You can make a pizza. There's a pizza in the freezer. You can make a freezer pizza

208
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,940
You'd be pretty

209
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:54,980
But then I started to just feel worse and worse and I started to go like pale white

210
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:02,360
I could feel the blood drain from my face. Yeah, I was like, oh no and I noticed I had two bags to my right

211
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,460
one was a slightly ripped empty bag of

212
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,560
Goldfish. Yeah, but you know that like silver bag they come in

213
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,300
Yes. Yeah, if you get it from like Costco and beside that was a

214
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,060
plastic bag filled with records and so my thought was take this silver bag and

215
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,180
Kind of breathe into it to like, you know, like you're on an airplane, you know and calm yourself

216
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:38,900
Sorry the bet the bag that you thought that you were about to throw up and you said I need to breathe in goldfish air

217
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:46,040
Well, it was empty. It's a goldfish sat in there for weeks and months. Yeah, that's true

218
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,000
So anyway, don't flavor blast all it had been a flavor blasted bag. It was just a regular bag

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,620
How awful that be if you put the if you put the bag up to your mouth on an airplane and you tasted nacho cheese

220
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:04,720
That is such an awful. I wasn't thinking straight. Okay, okay

221
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,300
Thing I didn't want to go that far. But as I leaned over and picked it up I immediately

222
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,920
threw up a little bit

223
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:19,920
up again and then during the third heave all the contents in my stomach came up

224
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:26,120
and it was too heavy for the goldfish bag which had been ripped so the bag ripped

225
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:34,400
in half in my hand as I was doing so I after that happened I looked at the mess

226
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:42,600
on the ground by my side and said that can wait and I pulled myself closer and I came back to the game

227
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
I played out the rest of the round.

228
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
And I'm here like...

229
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,600
There was... you were not moving at all

230
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,600
and you hadn't bought a gun.

231
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
And we were like, "Rex, you need to buy. Rex, buy, buy, buy."

232
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,600
And you said, "I'm throwing up."

233
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,600
[laughter]

234
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,600
And we immediately were like, "Okay, we lost this game. That's fine."

235
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
And so, I, you know,

236
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
tried to do something.

237
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
Nothing really happened. So I was like, "Okay."

238
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
Went to the kitchen, got

239
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
a roll of paper towels.

240
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Cleaned up the mess off the ground.

241
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,720
emptied, took the records out of the bag and used that bag to store the throw-up bag and

242
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,880
the throw-up paper towels.

243
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,080
Kind of tied it up a little bit, you know.

244
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,960
And then, I was like, "Okay, so I have my water."

245
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
I started drinking my water.

246
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,560
I was starting to feel a little bit better.

247
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,440
And the game went to overtime.

248
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
We ended up winning.

249
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,800
We did win.

250
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
We did win that game.

251
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Amazing.

252
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:38,160
We ended up winning, despite me throwing up in the middle of it.

253
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:46,000
But the issue was, as we got to overtime, the smell of the throw-up bag directly next to

254
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:53,000
me was kind of like starting to waft over, so I was like, being like, "Ugh."

255
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,960
Because you can't--because just using my nose would have been bad, and I was like, "Okay,

256
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,320
we have to finish this game, because if it goes any longer, the smell's gonna get overpowering,

257
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,960
I'm not gonna be able to focus on, you know, shooting my gun, winning the game, whatever.

258
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,460
And I said, "I'm gonna tap out."

259
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,880
And you know, went in the kitchen, got like a wet paper towel with some soap on it, and

260
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,880
wiped the floor down where I had missed, where some had spilled, and then proceeded to kind

261
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:32,240
of unload some trash and take it out to the dumpster, the garbage.

262
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
and I looked at my girlfriend and I said,

263
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,240
"I'm gonna make a frozen pizza I just threw up while gaming."

264
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,240
And she liked it. She thought this was attractive.

265
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
No, she thought...

266
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,240
And she was like, "And then say what game you were playing."

267
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,240
She gave me a hard time because she was like, "You have a weak stomach."

268
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,240
"You're always eating things and then feeling pain directly after."

269
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,240
I was like, "I don't know what you're talking about."

270
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,080
And she's like, because there's we went to a peri-peri chicken place.

271
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Mm-hmm.

272
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,080
And we had walked to the grocery store that was like, you know, a little further down and then like stopped there on the way back.

273
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,680
And it was one of those places that clearly you're not supposed to eat in.

274
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,480
But we ordered eat-in not thinking about it.

275
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,680
Then realized they wouldn't give us like a cup of water.

276
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,560
And then I would try to go back to the grocery store and the guy looked at me and was like,

277
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,740
"We're closed."

278
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,880
And so I ate an entire like chicken wrap and fries with no water.

279
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,240
And it was like really salty and it made my body like immediately need to like shit and

280
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,320
pee because I just was so dehydrated and all the water like pulled out of my cells.

281
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,400
I don't think that you have a great grasp on biology.

282
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,680
Because I don't think that you eat one salty meal without water and it makes you diarrhea

283
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,680
and piss.

284
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,680
A whole meal?

285
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,240
I mean it just triggered my need to shit.

286
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,720
I think it dries you out.

287
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,280
Yeah, it dries you out and it makes your body feel like it needs water and then because

288
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:17,400
it's not getting any water it's like trying to expel water because you're too watery.

289
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,600
What?

290
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,600
And I hadn't shit all day, because it was the first meal I'd eaten.

291
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,480
Do you have IBS?

292
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,960
Do you have the Jewish IBS?

293
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
I think at some point I've developed it, yes.

294
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,880
It's the only explanation I can think of.

295
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,400
Because I've been able to eat shit my entire life and not really have a problem, but now

296
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,400
I'm like, "Oh, he's my asshole."

297
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,640
But I think you just hit a wall.

298
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,840
I think you just hit a wall.

299
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:48,080
I used to be able to eat double cheeseburgers every day from cookout when I was in freshman

300
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,000
year of college and now I can't imagine eating. That's like a once a year type of

301
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,080
treat for me because of what it will do to my body. And I would say I'm in an

302
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:07,280
age gap relationship and the age gap I don't think that's really an important thing but we are on

303
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,680
different sides of 25 which is where your body starts to just be completely

304
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,600
dog shit at everything it used to be good at.

305
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
- So, we have basically the same--

306
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,280
- She just came out of high school last year, it's fine.

307
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,600
- Yeah, she got her GED, man.

308
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,440
- Yeah.

309
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,280
- Chill.

310
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,180
- So, we, you know, she's like,

311
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,880
"I eat the same thing as you and I feel fine."

312
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,400
And I'm like, "I could eat when I was your age, back then."

313
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,560
- Which, by the way, if you ever are talking

314
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,720
to your significant other and having to say,

315
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,560
"When I was your age,"

316
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,120
That means you're in a dope-ass relationship.

317
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,120
It means that you're having some of the greatest sex of your entire life.

318
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,120
[Laughter]

319
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,120
You're also 28 when I presume you're not supposed to be like

320
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,120
falling to pieces like you apparently are.

321
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,120
No, you do fall... 26 is where just all the things that went right for you...

322
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Yeah, I think I agree.

323
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
Yeah, it's like...

324
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:22,000
is

325
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,840
I don't even know what it is, but apparently garlic is on it, so I'm just not going to

326
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,840
even try doing it because I eat so much garlic.

327
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,840
Yeah.

328
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,080
I mean, I used to be able to eat really spicy food, and now it hurts my butthole.

329
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:38,480
I used to be able to just, you know, not really like think about what my meals were at all

330
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,360
in terms of timing and just be able to feel fine.

331
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,440
And now it's kind of clear that like, not only is the diet that I used to be like thin

332
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,160
with making me fat now, it's like, it's also making me feel horrible.

333
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:56,160
So I have to make some sort of change and I think that's just a process of hitting your

334
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,480
mid-20s and hitting that wall.

335
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,960
I um, do you have a turning point in your life where you know this is the first time that

336
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,840
everything started being so bad with my shits and my eating?

337
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,560
Well I've always had trouble with my shits, I've always had a little bit of bleeding and

338
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,720
a little bit of you know, whatever.

339
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:25,280
I would say in the last like two, three years, it's really been a downhill, like a noticeable

340
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,480
drop in quality of my stomach.

341
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
I see.

342
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
You know?

343
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Yeah.

344
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,520
There was a point where, it was during COVID, and I got blessed by Donald Trump with, you

345
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,080
know, a fat check.

346
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,080
Yes.

347
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
I remember this money.

348
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,080
Shouts out.

349
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,080
Yeah.

350
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,080
The best person in the world.

351
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,040
eating nothing but fried rice and beans and started being able to go to Trader Joe's and eat like a salad and

352
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,560
Like a lentil wrap and like that

353
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,940
Increase in the quality of food like ruined my ability to be a garbage disposal for food. Oh

354
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:07,320
Once you saw once you lived the better life. Yeah, I see you couldn't go back. You're stopping a

355
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,240
vegetarian recently as well

356
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,640
You're stomach not being accustomed to all these chemicals and meats and flavors.

357
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,840
Which I would point to as also the turning point for me when I was like 17 or 18 and

358
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,480
stopped eating or started eating meat. I would say that's also when I started

359
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:33,520
getting much worse diarrhea. But also that coincided with I was dosed with

360
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,180
capsaicin extract and I think it destroyed my stomach forever by my

361
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:44,300
cousin Nick. Yeah, I do think I kind of want to I wish there was a way to figure

362
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:49,060
out how good your gut flora is because I feel like I'm completely destroyed. My

363
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:53,900
cousin Nick three years in a row the first the my dad would make chili at our

364
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,880
family get-together and he would make a vegan chili for me and a normal one and

365
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,780
he three years in a row did different tricks to put something very spicy in my

366
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,300
chili. The first year, he put it in the entire batch and just ruined the entire batch of chili,

367
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:16,700
blended up Carolina Reaper and put it in there. The second year, he put it only in my bowl while

368
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:24,380
I was in the bathroom. And then the third year, he synthesized pure capsaicin, the chemical that

369
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:33,820
makes the food spicy, and put it into a dropper and dropped it into my chili. Like a capsaicin oil.

370
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,340
And I completely blame him for everything that's ever happened to me bad in my entire life.

371
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,340
Yeah, no, that's absolutely fair.

372
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,840
This is, it's like, it's an assassination attempt.

373
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,140
This is a poisoning.

374
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,040
This is like how the Joker attacks his targets.

375
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,340
But we were young, I was, you know, I was 17, he was 25.

376
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,540
He didn't know any better.

377
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Right, yeah, he's just a kid.

378
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Yeah, yeah, he's just a kid.

379
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,040
Um...

380
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:05,340
Yeah, I don't know. I think you guys just got poisoned by different things.

381
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:10,840
Well, food in general in America, the quality of it is very poor.

382
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,540
So when you eat a lot of American food, you become diseased.

383
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,040
A lot of sides in American food, I've noticed. I've noticed this.

384
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,340
Yeah, there's a lot of fries, a lot of things of that nature.

385
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,100
I was talking about this the other day.

386
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,640
I think home fries are stupid.

387
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,900
I think they're a complete scam.

388
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,900
I agree.

389
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,220
I'm into hash browns, man.

390
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
I like them shredded.

391
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,220
I do agree.

392
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,620
I like them like this and then like this.

393
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:40,260
And like them nice and crispy like Waffle House.

394
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:48,580
Yeah, but the problem is none of these restaurants or even the delivery apps consider that maybe

395
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,220
an ESL person who's never been to New York before ordering for the first time is going

396
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,740
to see, "Oh, home fries.

397
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,740
probably delicious potatoes.

398
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,420
You think it's fries?

399
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,820
I think it's fries in my house, in my home I guess.

400
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
It's not man.

401
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,820
And it's not.

402
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,860
Nah, just to make sure, home fries are the little like potato squares.

403
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:12,540
They're just like sauteed potatoes, like pan fried.

404
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:17,600
I don't think those are that bad that you would be like distraught if you got them.

405
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,940
But I would rather have fries or I would rather have hash browns.

406
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
I would be so sad.

407
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
I was so sad.

408
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,440
What I would have rather had actual fries or hashbrowns.

409
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,940
I'd rather have a fucking, I'd rather have a baked potato.

410
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,440
I'll say that shit.

411
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,940
I'd rather have a baked potato with sour cream and cheese

412
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,440
than a fucking home fries.

413
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,440
Wait, you don't fucking bake potatoes?

414
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,940
I love baked potatoes, but I think it's ridiculous in the context.

415
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,940
It's not ridiculous.

416
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Okay, alright, what's your tier list then?

417
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,440
In potatoes?

418
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:44,940
Yeah.

419
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
Potato food.

420
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
Potato tier list.

421
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
I mean, context matters.

422
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,940
What context? You're eating it.

423
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,940
Yeah, but what am I eating it with?

424
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:59,340
Potatoes aren't a main course. Okay, it's breakfast. It's breakfast. I'm not eating a baked potato for breakfast. Are you saying?

425
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:07,540
No, I'm not. I feel saner than I've ever felt in my life a baked potato for breakfast sounds fucking amazing

426
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:19,500
No salsa on the potato I gotta say guys the salsa really straight me over I think I'm with Kevin on this one

427
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,920
No, I know I know my audience. I know who I'm talking to right now breakfast burrito eggs

428
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:29,960
Sausage but a baked potato in that bitch the whole thing

429
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,700
That's the whole burrito. That's ridiculous. Well, you cut it

430
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:42,380
Not spouting nonsense, this is not nonsense a baked potato has a better texture than a home fry. No, not all this oily

431
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:46,860
Same

432
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:47,860
What are you talking about?

433
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,860
That is actually crazy.

434
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,780
It's a potato that's cut.

435
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,260
It's the same internal potato.

436
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
No.

437
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:01,980
You are out of your- The only different texture of potatoes is hashbrowns because they're so

438
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,900
thin that they get crisp.

439
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,580
Hashbrowns are the only good potato.

440
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,380
How about a scalloped potato?

441
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,140
Okay, maybe a scalloped potato.

442
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,140
Thank you.

443
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,140
And I could go on.

444
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,140
Tater tots.

445
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,140
Tater tots.

446
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,140
Tater tots.

447
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,140
Tater- no.

448
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,640
What?

449
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,140
Yeah.

450
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:17,640
Yeah!

451
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,140
No way.

452
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:23,140
This is like people who get up in arms about steak fries being horrible.

453
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
I love steak fries.

454
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:28,140
And yet you don't like a home fry?

455
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,140
Wait, how, how do you not?

456
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,140
A smaller steak fry?

457
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,140
Are you coming out as a homeware apologist right now? Are you, are you kidding me right now?

458
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,140
He likes home fries.

459
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,140
I like all types of potato. I don't think it's necessary to be like...

460
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,180
Okay here's a good question.

461
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,100
If you're at a diner and they have home fries or normal fries with breakfast, what are you

462
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,220
getting?

463
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,580
How do they cook their...

464
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:53,580
I would need to see...

465
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,900
You don't need to know how they cook...

466
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,460
Your favorite fries in the world.

467
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
Then the fries, yeah.

468
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,140
Okay, then it's not weird to eat a baked potato for breakfast.

469
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:08,180
Because fries are a lunch and dinner food.

470
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,980
And so is a baked potato.

471
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,820
But can it be eaten at breakfast?

472
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:14,820
Yeah man, it's all the same shit to me.

473
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:19,240
I think the separation between a home fry and a regular fry is way too indistinct to

474
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,000
make it so clear cut.

475
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,280
Because a good home fry is crisp in the same way a fry is.

476
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,240
I think it's crinkle cut my friend, because I think it's very very clear.

477
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,960
I think I'm seeing defined edges here between a home fry and a normal fry.

478
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,860
And if we're willing to go from home fry to normal fry, let's go opposite, backwards evolutionarily,

479
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,020
and let's have a baked potato for breakfast.

480
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,860
That is a caveman's way of eating a potato.

481
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
What?

482
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,660
Oh, caveman, guess what caveman haven't invented yet?

483
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,660
Fire.

484
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
Guess how you bake a potato?

485
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
In an oven.

486
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:56,660
Yep.

487
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
No, caveman did literally invent fire.

488
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
You're done.

489
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,660
You are done.

490
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,660
You are done.

491
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,660
That's what was in the cave.

492
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,660
That's the whole point of the cave.

493
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,660
No, the cave was to draw.

494
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
What is the whole point of the cave?

495
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:20,140
was

496
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,820
come on the show is a strong because you're starting

497
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,260
uh... i said get astronomy

498
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:29,140
but nice try but are in the up

499
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,720
speaking of other you know i got a bit of a doubt

500
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,380
debate today yet again

501
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,380
it comes back

502
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,560

00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:59,900
as

507
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:07,980
shown

508
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:14,980
on

509
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,940
Okay, let me say that.

510
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:27,640
I think it's not fair to compare the two because, uh, rice is a blank canvas for

511
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,140
sauce.

512
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:34,060
Whereas a potato is a canvas for more sweet kind of thicker sauces or butter.

513
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,980
You can't really put the same butter rice.

514
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,340
That's true.

515
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,900
Tree can, and it's great, but you can also put even more sauce on it than that.

516
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,580
You can't put soy sauce on a potato.

517
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,420
Watch me.

518
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,220
Watch me.

519
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:53,180
You can, but I think the rice is more versatile.

520
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:55,020
You can add more things to the rice.

521
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:02,960
It's a much wider canvas to have flavor profiles expressed with than a potato.

522
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Potatoes very narrow.

523
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,660
The potatoes get turned into chips, which are delicious.

524
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:07,660
My point.

525
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,660
I like chips.

526
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,660
I do like chips.

527
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:13,860
I have two bags of chips that I've been eating three chips from each bag every single day.

528
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,300
Three jalapeno, three salt and vinegar.

529
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:23,300
there

530
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Salt and vinegar and jalapeno and I got him for my wife

531
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,140
She doesn't she ate two of them and then now I've been eating

532
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,300
About three or four of each every single day. It's fucked up

533
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,700
The potato chips are the only ones that get like a name like that, you know Howell's

534
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,820
victor's

535
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:46,180
They're always getting some kind of name like that for their branding. Mmm

536
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,140
So you're saying no, I really don't know what you're saying. Yeah, I'm saying

537
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,140
You're saying that they have brands of potato chips unlike everything else?

538
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,140
Well the brands are a lot more like, think about like popcorn, or...

539
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,140
Orville Redenbacher.

540
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,140
Right. That's like a full name.

541
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,140
Smart pop.

542
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:07,140
Right, you see what I'm saying? These are all like 1950s ass names.

543
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,140
A fucking potato chip gets an 1800s name.

544
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:14,140
Like a doctor made it. Those are Hal's potato chips.

545
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:17,140
Orville Redenbacher is the most doctor name I've ever heard!

546
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
There's some Lay's potatoes.

547
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,140
That's a space-age man-scientist.

548
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Lay? You think Lay is a...

549
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:25,140
Sun Chips.

550
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
This is not a good point.

551
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Doritos. This is stupid. This is really stupid.

552
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
You are not cooking. This is not...

553
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
Doritos are not potato chips. What the fuck are you talking about?

554
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
Yes, they are.

555
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
They are corn, my friend.

556
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,140
They are corn chips.

557
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,140
Yeah, what are you smoking?

558
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,140
This is the stupidest thing anyone's said on this podcast.

559
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,140
He thinks Doritos are also made up of...

560
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,140
Sun Chips are also made up of...

561
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,140
chips are multi-grain.

562
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,140
Yeah.

563
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,140
They're chips.

564
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:52,460
Do you not know what the fuck a potato chip is?

565
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,460
He's never had a potato.

566
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,460
He was talking all this shit about...

567
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:57,460
No you haven't!

568
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,460
I can smell it.

569
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,740
You know what I don't understand?

570
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,580
What the hell is a potato bun?

571
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
That is bread.

572
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:07,580
I think they use potato like in the dough.

573
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,180
Just a little bit?

574
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
Yeah.

575
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,180
To flavor it.

576
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,180
Which potato is known for its very strong flavor.

577
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:18,900
Yeah, potatoes really knock you out with the flavor.

578
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,220
The potato flavor, oh my god, it's so good.

579
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,100
Yeah, that's why you can't really tell the difference between a potato bun and a regular

580
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,100
bun.

581
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,780
I guess you're right.

582
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,780
Yeah.

583
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:31,020
Well, here's what's going on in my life.

584
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,440
I'm growing my hair out.

585
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,440
I can see that.

586
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,440
I can see that.

587
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,440
It's dark.

588
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,060
Yup, and my wife has bleached her eyebrows, guys.

589
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,300
That's over for you.

590
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,300
It's over.

591
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:46,780
I started growing my hair out, and then one week later she bleaches her eyebrows.

592
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,380
We're having an ugly contest.

593
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,660
We're seeing who can get more ugly.

594
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,620
That's a week's worth of growth on the hair?

595
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,260
Yeah, just about, from plumb bald to this.

596
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,700
Can you give us the full walk around?

597
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:04,940
Yeah, I want to show some of my barber.

598
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,220
It's coming in thick in the back.

599
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,220
In the hat parts.

600
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
Yeah.

601
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,220
I think if you wore a really...

602
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,220
Like one of those hats that the brim is like on your eyebrows.

603
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,220
Yeah, yeah.

604
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,220
You'd be pulling the... thinking you have hair.

605
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,220
A cowboy hat type of guy?

606
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,220
A cowboy hat type of guy?

607
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,220
I have a cowboy hat that I thought was made of snakeskin,

608
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,220
but then I brought it back to my wife and I was like,

609
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,220
"Check out this cool snakeskin hat."

610
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:38,220
She's like, "This is made of, like, straw paper."

611
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:45,220
I'm so easily fooled. Somebody took a straw hat and spray painted parts of it black.

612
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,220
And I was like, "This is a snakeskin hat and I'm getting a deal buying this for $40."

613
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,220
Did they sell it to you as that? Or did you just assume?

614
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,220
It was just at an antique store. I just assumed based on how it looked.

615
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,220
Okay, so no one scammed you.

616
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,220
Nobody scammed me.

617
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:00,220
You scammed yourself.

618
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,220
Whoever made the hat scammed the future people.

619
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,220
No, you skipped yourself.

620
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,220
Go on, Rex.

621
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:14,220
I saw a haircut and hairline that reminded me a lot of Caleb.

622
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
On a young man on a TV show.

623
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,220
22 years old.

624
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,220
And he had like a swoopy kind of hair.

625
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,220
But it swooped really far back from like here.

626
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,220
On the sides to give the impression that he had a hairline.

627
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,220
This is called a comb over.

628
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,220
It was a comb-over, but it wasn't, you know, I mean, yeah, it's a comb-over.

629
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:43,220
But it was on like a young, hip guy, so it didn't come across in that like wispy, shitty way.

630
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,220
So it was kind of cool.

631
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:53,220
It was cool, but you could tell it was on a game show, and over time he got more sweaty, and you could start to see where the airline started.

632
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,220
It's all a facade.

633
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:00,820
Right, and it started to show through at the end, and I think that's why he lost the game show,

634
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,220
was because he was 22 in that ball.

635
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:07,380
Have you seen these things, they call them hair systems, they're wigs?

636
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:07,620
Yeah.

637
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:12,100
That's a funny name for a wig.

638
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:12,420
Well, it's a system.

639
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,700
Because only a man would be like, "I'm employing a hair system."

640
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:21,460
It's a system. I'm deploying a system on top of my scalp that resembles hair.

641
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:22,740
Women wear a wig.

642
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,980
No, I think they also do hair systems.

643
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,420
for women. I think they're two different things.

644
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:32,260
That's what's in hair systems. Women couldn't possibly understand the system.

645
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:37,060
Exactly. They're only oppressed by systems. I just can't. I think the hair

646
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:42,660
system thing, can you imagine? I think the thing about being bald is, it's not about

647
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:47,860
if you look bald, it's about whether people know that you are bald or not. Yes.

648
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,860
That is the real shame of being bald.

649
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Yeah.

650
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,860
So if I wore a hair system,

651
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,860
the people in my life would still know I was bald.

652
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,860
When I get home, I would still hang up my hair.

653
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,860
Right.

654
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
You know?

655
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
I guess, you know, being...

656
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,860
I think...

657
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,860
We love you despite the fact that you are bald.

658
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,860
I think...

659
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:08,860
I know it's hard for you.

660
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
No, this is...

661
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
It's not hard at all.

662
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
This is completely wrong.

663
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:12,860
A stranger though...

664
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,860
By the way.

665
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,860
Needs to know that you have hair.

666
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,900
The hair system is like a half a step into like a transplant

667
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:24,100
because it gets like put in by a professional and it just stays on your head.

668
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,860
You have to like take it off. It's not like a wig. You like put on and take off.

669
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,940
Really? I thought you just clip it in.

670
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:32,260
Why do you know so much about this? You're going bald?

671
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,260
You have one in right now, don't you, you bastard?

672
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:35,380
He's looking it up.

673
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,340
I know about it because of another podcast

674
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:44,500
where they gave a guy a hair system, a friend of ours.

675
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,780
Is this a podcast?

676
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,780
No, it's a podcast that Kael has been on.

677
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:50,180
The Yard?

678
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:50,900
Yeah.

679
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,740
They gave Slime a hair system? Really?

680
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,460
Yeah, pretty much.

681
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,220
Did he look amazing?

682
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:59,620
He did. He called himself Patrick Star or some shit.

683
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:03,780
And he looked great, but he hated it.

684
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,100
He hated it? Does it itch?

685
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,660
I don't know. I don't know what it was.

686
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,420
It seems like it might itch.

687
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,260
I'll message him about it later today. I'm sure he'll love my questions.

688
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:19,440
Think ball people love talking about their baldness and their head. That's why you never bring it up

689
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,100
Yeah, it is. Basically all we have

690
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,180
All you have at some point. Whoa, you took the label off

691
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:31,940
I did it got very wet and came right off and the broom. I'm checking out the brew masters approval

692
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,260
by Bill and Ron

693
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,780
Which are very brew master names. That's that's two guys. Not one guy billing bill. Um

694
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,020
Bill and Ron it's ill and Ron. Yeah

695
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,660
These are the brew masters guys

696
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,100
Here's what I've had enough of

697
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,820
Ampersand

698
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,980
restaurants

699
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,140
hmm

700
00:35:56,140 --> 00:36:03,940
I'm done with the ampersands y'all if you're if you think your restaurant is not good enough to have just

701
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,220
One word as the name then don't open a fucking restaurant

702
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,040
I'm done with this shit. I get cattle and cork bread and butter

703
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:23,540
Food and drinks. This is fucking bullshit. This is not what we should be calling our restaurants restaurants should be called

704
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,620
Derek

705
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,660
Bud Rucker's

706
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:31,740
Chili's

707
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,740
right, this

708
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,660
and King burger

709
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,900
Exact chili and s

710
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:43,400
What the hell that makes no sense man, but in Rutgers

711
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,980
and

712
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,580
Huddles tea. Thank God and it's Friday

713
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:59,700
Bullshit man and fillet Panda and Express we could go on forever win and DS pop and ice

714
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:04,540
Pop and eyes. This is complete bullshit man. I'm done with this

715
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:09,080
Kentucky fried and chicken we're not doing any more of these

716
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,000
We've done

717
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Up in a way sure. Okay. No, we're done though. We're completely done. I don't want to do this anymore

718
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,220
I really don't I think I agree barrel

719
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:31,640
Dom and Eno where would it would go to Dom and Eno's pizza?

720
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,640
This is, I'm shit out of fucking...

721
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,640
Papay Jones, and your mic broke by the way.

722
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,640
My, the thing came out!

723
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
That's crazy.

724
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,640
That's how bad I was getting.

725
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,640
Papay Jones.

726
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,640
You know the, the, I think it's a Chris Rock joke, it's like, "Guns should be cheap, but bullets should cost a thousand dollars."

727
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,140
Yeah.

728
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:55,640
"Eonsigned letters should be cheap, but the ampersand should cost a million dollars."

729
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,320
The ampersand, it should be more expensive

730
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,280
to file for a business license.

731
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,120
- Yeah.

732
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,640
- If you have an ampersand in the name.

733
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,480
- Yeah.

734
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,300
- I'm done with the ampersand.

735
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,200
Go on the New York list of doing business as names.

736
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,200
Go to the database, sort by all the symbols,

737
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,560
instead of like the ones before the alphabet.

738
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,680
And you're just gonna be completely,

739
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,760
you won't be able to read that much.

740
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:28,920
take you years to read all these fucking names dude. What would you call a brand new restaurant?

741
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,980
Like a restaurant type name? That's not a guy's name. I would probably do something amazing

742
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:37,400
and have just like a square or a triangle as the name for my restaurant. Yeah like it's

743
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,520
a witch house album. Triangle? Yes. Not triangle. Let's go to triangle for a slice? No people

744
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:49,120
wouldn't even say that. They would make, people would say let's go to that pizza place. Yeah

745
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,840
I would not open a pizza place.

746
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,840
Wait, hang on.

747
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,840
What is it called?

748
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,840
I don't remember what it is.

749
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,800
It doesn't have a name actually, but it has a triangle on the front of it.

750
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,440
Yeah, let me put it on Google Maps.

751
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,000
What is it called again?

752
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Circle triangle.

753
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Oh, circle triangle.

754
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,680
If you think that my high-end restaurant- Circle and triangle would be actually a really

755
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,160
good name for a pizza place.

756
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
I've decided.

757
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,160
With an ampersand?

758
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,160
No!

759
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Yeah, with an ampersand.

760
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
No!

761
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,160
No ampersands!

762
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:22,480
dark emoji circle and a kind of triangle with a really dark side for the crust.

763
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,920
Oh yeah, just three letters on the side out front.

764
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,920
Wayyyy that's clean as fuck.

765
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,480
That would be really good I think.

766
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,800
No no no.

767
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,000
I actually completely disagree with you now.

768
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,520
I don't like this, these angs.

769
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,920
I like this restaurant.

770
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,840
It sounds hip, it sounds brand new, it sounds Gen Z like me.

771
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:57,920
the

772
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:12,880
are

773
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,880
That is the cut, you're literally the cutoff.

774
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,880
That is the cutoff.

775
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,880
And guess who got cut off, bitch? Your ass.

776
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,880
Your old ass.

777
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,880
Oh my god, you're so old.

778
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,880
What's up?

779
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
It's fine to admit, you're old.

780
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,880
I don't care about that.

781
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,880
You need to get really into it.

782
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,880
See, me personally, I think the stuff that you like is basically cringe.

783
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
What do I like?

784
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:36,880
Just all that older stuff.

785
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
You watched Lost when it came out.

786
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Every single episode you were up watching Lost.

787
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,800
episode you were up watching Lost at 24.

788
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,000
-Kale meanwhile has watched every single episode

789
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,200
of Skibbity Toilet.

790
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,480
-I've seen every Skibbity Toilet.

791
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,200
I've seen every Eddie Burback video.

792
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,400
This is the kind of thing that I'm into because of my nature.

793
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,640
-We used to watch Z-Nanners and Hutch.

794
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,200
-Dude, I don't know who the hell that is, man.

795
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,120
Shut the fuck up.

796
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:08,640
I like Ninja and Applesauce, OK?

797
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,520
Those are the only two things in this world that I like.

798
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:13,720
You're talking like a three year old that doesn't know what plurals are.

799
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,120
Which one?

800
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,520
Both.

801
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,820
No, I like ninja and applesauce is what a three year old would say.

802
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,020
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

803
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:27,720
I'm so young.

804
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,720
I like ninja and I like applesauce.

805
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,020
Yeah, that's what I do every day.

806
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,120
Ninja and applesauce.

807
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,520
My brand new restaurant.

808
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:37,020
Slam C, new restaurant.

809
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,620
It's a dessert place.

810
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:45,660
for the sir we got apples okay well okay so tell me how how you're gonna serve

811
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:54,260
ninja you could probably do a hot a high concept version of applesauce something

812
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,740
something very nice this is really simple this is just one of those like

813
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:03,620
type mr. Beast burger type beat when we're just signing a image rights thing

814
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:09,260
with ninja and it's not technically his but it's got his name on it so you you

815
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,260
You see it on Uber Eats like, "Oh, Ninja and applesauce. Let me get a gallon of applesauce."

816
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,260
"Searching applesauce on Uber Eats."

817
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:27,260
You open up your friend's Uber Eats on his phone and you're like, "Oh, there's some tacos or something."

818
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:32,260
All the searches are different spellings of applesauce with the space in a different place.

819
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:36,260
Apple and sauce.

820
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:38,260
Ninja, one of those.

821
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,260
Ninja, apple, space, sauce.

822
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,260
Apple sauce, one word.

823
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,260
Oh man.

824
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,260
You know, here's

825
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:48,260
a food that I wish I had

826
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,260
more access to.

827
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:52,260
Poutine.

828
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,260
I like poutine, guys.

829
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,260
I had poutine.

830
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,260
It's based on fries.

831
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,260
It is based on fries.

832
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
That's true. I'm not

833
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,260
laughing about this. This is a fact.

834
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,860
The team is based on Fries?

835
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:14,460
The Fries are based on Fries?

836
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,180
I guess you're, I mean, I have a really hard time disagreeing with that.

837
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:25,980
But it does not sound so right.

838
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,260
Inspired by Fries.

839
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:30,260
It's based on fries.

840
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,260
It's based on fries.

841
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,260
I didn't say anything wrong.

842
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,260
Your brain is a perfect ball.

843
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Why can't you see?

844
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
Um.

845
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:48,260
When I lived in Boston, there was a poutine place.

846
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:50,260
It was called Sauce.

847
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:52,260
And here's another thing I don't like, by the way.

848
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,260
And this place is the only thing that had an exception.

849
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,260
But any other restaurant like this,

850
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:00,020
All my sober gophers, you have a green light. Go ahead, spray it up.

851
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,620
Completely destroy every window.

852
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:02,340
Okay.

853
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,620
I don't like when they misspell the names of words.

854
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,380
Or the words in the name.

855
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,180
Yeah.

856
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,300
This place was called Sauce. S-A-U-S.

857
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,900
That's horrible.

858
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,100
What the hell's that, man?

859
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,600
Yeah.

860
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,660
What the fuck is that?

861
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,020
Bitch don't grill my cheese.

862
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,460
Bitch don't grill my--

863
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:21,960
What is that?

864
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,340
I think it's a ghost kitchen.

865
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:25,540
Oh, I would love to go there.

866
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,460
there's a you have a ghost kitchen near you called bitch don't grill my cheese

867
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:36,140
famous yeah I've never heard of this yeah look at my cheese did I give you it what

868
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:39,500
do they sell grilled cheese that's the worst yeah I've ever said they're set

869
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:45,180
bitch don't grill my cheese but they sell grilled cheese yes after the

870
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:51,060
Kendrick Kendrick Lamar song I know I know every rational I immediately got a

871
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,060
My eye blockers stopped me from going to this website so I'm not gonna go on that website.

872
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:57,060
That was nice of them.

873
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,060
Yeah.

874
00:44:58,060 --> 00:45:05,060
But I also don't like when they take the vowels out of the name, out of the words in the name.

875
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,060
That's a thing they did for Gen C.

876
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,060
Chicken C-H-K-N?

877
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:11,060
Yep.

878
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:13,060
I don't wanna eat that.

879
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:19,060
How about a really disgusting name like Eggslut?

880
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,060
Oh, Eggslut, I don't like the dirty names.

881
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:25,060
I agree, I don't like the name of Eggslut.

882
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:29,060
Motherfucking burger. I'm not gonna order the motherfucking burger.

883
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:35,060
I might order an MF burger, but I will not ever say, "Let me get the fucking turd burger."

884
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,060
I don't think that's what they call it.

885
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:39,060
Or whatever they call it.

886
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,060
Can I get the poop burger, please?

887
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,060
Yeah. Can I please have the diarrhea pizza?

888
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,060
I don't, that doesn't sound appetizing to me, man.

889
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,060
Okay, so what would you call your restaurant then?

890
00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:53,060
I'm telling you, my restaurant would be called something so elegant

891
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,060
It would probably be called like...

892
00:45:55,060 --> 00:45:57,060
Lily Flower

893
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,060
Aww, that's horrible

894
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:01,060
How's that horrible?

895
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:04,060
It'd be upscale French food

896
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,060
Lily Flower

897
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,060
Is that a French flower?

898
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,060
I don't know

899
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,060
Food is French, asshat

900
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,680
hat that name is it fucking French it's new American how about that it's new

901
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,220
American what a bag and get I'm not calling it bag and get I might go all

902
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:33,200
right fine let me give you another restaurant name barrel barrel barrel

903
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,260
burger well hold on barrel and barrel burger totally different yeah no that

904
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:42,620
Since Barrel doesn't tell you anything about what they're doing.

905
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:45,620
A Barrel burger is a very specific thing.

906
00:46:45,620 --> 00:46:48,500
The name should not be two ingredients.

907
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:49,500
That should not be.

908
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,060
A Barrel is not an ingredient in food.

909
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,020
In the Barrel Burger it could be.

910
00:46:54,020 --> 00:47:00,060
We use Kentucky Bourbon Barrel-aged mustard on the burger.

911
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:03,020
Fuck you man.

912
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:06,460
I'm coming up with, I'm the one coming up with, you come up with a restaurant name.

913
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:16,460
and a whole menu bitch barrel aged mustard you never heard of that it's

914
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:25,660
it's aged in you the Jack Daniels barrels it's mustard it's cask mates mustard

915
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,940
I don't think I would go to Barrel Burger honestly.

916
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:34,940
I don't think I would go to Barrel Burger honestly.

917
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:38,940
I would go to...

918
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:42,940
I would call it The Office.

919
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:46,940
And our signature meal would be called the Jim and Pam.

920
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,940
Yeah, that wouldn't fly.

921
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,940
You would not.

922
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:00,340
You would, it would have to be a fully licensed, you would spend a million dollars before you even started

923
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:07,820
Build out on the restaurant. That's not true. It's definitely true. Okay, I got a name. I got it

924
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:12,460
Normal barrel burger is a great idea. Normal burger is a little bit too tongue-in-cheek

925
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:19,700
I would say it needs to be earnest there needs to be earnest earnesty to the name. Yeah, it needs to be called something like I

926
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:24,360
Don't know why it's all flowers coming something like sunflower. Yeah, you know

927
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:25,360
I don't know.

928
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,360
These are vegan restaurants.

929
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:29,360
I don't know, it's just a good name to me.

930
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,360
What about like Chester's Grill?

931
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:34,360
A name is also good.

932
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,360
Yeah.

933
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,360
A name is good to me.

934
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,360
Sunflower I think is a better name.

935
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,360
Caleb's is good.

936
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,360
Caleb's?

937
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,360
Caleb is not a good name.

938
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,360
Caleb's?

939
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,360
It needs to be like a one, no.

940
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:45,360
It needs to be a one syllable name.

941
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,360
Joe, Franz, Ruth's.

942
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,360
These are the restaurants that I like.

943
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,360
Yeah.

944
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:55,920
Well, uh, looking around at things at my desk.

945
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:56,920
The Rockies.

946
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:59,040
Rockies is good?

947
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,040
Yep.

948
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,340
Rockies is good.

949
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:05,000
That would be a burger and bowling place.

950
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Yeah.

951
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah.

952
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,800
Looking at my desk, maybe...

953
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,800
Eyeballs.

954
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:15,800
Fake eyeballs.

955
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,040
A bottle cap.

956
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,520
Uh, uh...

957
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,520
Cans.

958
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,520
The cans.

959
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,520
the cans

960
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,440
The Cans! That's a great name, that's what I mean.

961
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,440
The Cans is a great name.

962
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,820
The Cans is a bar, you know.

963
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:29,820
Is it?

964
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,820
Yeah.

965
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,560
Hmm. I guess you're right.

966
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,200
Yeah, do you want to swing by The Cans for a drink?

967
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,520
Can we look at a restaurant bar?

968
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:41,840
The Con, though. C-A-N-N-E-S, like the film festival.

969
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:42,840
Mmm.

970
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,840
Mmm. Now you're thinking.

971
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,840
I'm talking about a place.

972
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:48,520
Yeah, so, a lot of things are places.

973
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:49,520
Okay.

974
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,480
There's a place in Bushwick called Wild and Catman Do.

975
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,000
That's a good name for a restaurant.

976
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
While in Kathmandu.

977
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,800
Because what would you do while you were in Kathmandu?

978
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:00,860
You would eat.

979
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:01,860
You would eat and you would enjoy.

980
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:04,200
I don't know where that is.

981
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,200
It's in Nepal.

982
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,240
Okay, well, why don't we use something more pedestrian?

983
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,480
Why don't we do Manhattan Burger?

984
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,040
Manhattan is a great name.

985
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,040
The bottle opener.

986
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,040
Again, this is a bar.

987
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,040
Yeah, that is a bar.

988
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:25,480
If you, any of us three, the stuff in our rooms would probably be bar names more than anything.

989
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:28,520
What in Rome, when it's a Chinese place?

990
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,520
Mirror?

991
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,600
That makes sense.

992
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,280
Mirror would be a good name for a restaurant.

993
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:35,280
This is what I'm saying, man.

994
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,280
It needs to evoke monitors.

995
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,840
It needs to evoke monitors.

996
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,840
Just monitors?

997
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:39,840
RTX 2070 Super?

998
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,080
Oh, Computer is a great name for a restaurant.

999
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,080
That's not true.

1000
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,080
Computer?

1001
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:52,080
the

1002
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,080
This is the new style of food.

1003
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,080
It's New American that you order on like a McDonald's kiosk.

1004
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,080
No, it doesn't need to have anything...

1005
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,080
It doesn't need to be computer themed, Rex.

1006
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,080
You're getting caught up in the name, man.

1007
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,080
It just needs to be simple, elegant,

1008
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:06,080
to the point. Not really to the point,

1009
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,080
because again, there's no computers.

1010
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:10,080
But it needs to be...

1011
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,080
Kitchen.

1012
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:14,080
Kitchen is good.

1013
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,080
And what kind of New American food are we going to be serving at kitchen?

1014
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,080
Barrel-aged mustard and ketchup.

1015
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,080
On top of a barrel fry.

1016
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,980
barrel fry.

1017
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:29,620
And if you like the salad at a normal restaurant, wait till you try our barrel salad, which has

1018
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:32,380
a barrel olive oil.

1019
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:36,340
They put everything in a--it's in a--it's mixed in a barrel.

1020
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:42,300
They bring out a big barrel of oil, and they dunk the fries in it, or the salad, and the

1021
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,300
fries.

1022
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:44,300
It's the same barrel.

1023
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,420
It would be awesome to cook fries in a barrel.

1024
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:48,460
I agree.

1025
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,120
i think that we uh...

1026
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:53,360
that the really big issue with some someone didn't know that the just drops

1027
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,360
the barrel

1028
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:58,740
and also spoke to the rest of the are they sharing a hot barrel are you

1029
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,980
going to be in pain

1030
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:01,280
there was a

1031
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,540

1032
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,580

1033
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,460

1034
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,820

1035
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:10,300

1036
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,440

but it is called

1042
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:30,220
something like scientific sips or some shit like that

1043
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:34,940
and everything that they they serve they make it in big beakers

1044

1056
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:59,860
the drink and he couldn't be reasoned with he lit it on fire that sounds

1057
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:05,220
awesome so it was terrible then I drank it and it was really hot how are you

1058
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:10,460
supposed to drink that with your lips in your throat yeah well it's on fire that

1059
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,460
That seems dangerous.

1060
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,700
You're supposed to blow the fire out.

1061
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,860
Which I wish somebody had told me that.

1062
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:17,860
And then you're supposed to drink it.

1063
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:18,860
Are you?

1064
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,860
No, you're not supposed to drink flaming alcohol.

1065
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:25,940
Well what's it gonna do?

1066
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:26,940
You put it in your mouth.

1067
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,860
It's gonna dribble down your face.

1068
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:30,860
You never seen that video?

1069
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:37,140
That guy drinking the flaming drink and it catches his whole face on fire?

1070
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:38,780
Wouldn't happen to me.

1071
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:39,780
Maybe not to you.

1072
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:43,860
personally I'm a spiller. My grandma used to say I had no lower lip.

1073
00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:49,900
You have the least to lose in a fire. I have the least what? To lose?

1074
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,180
Yeah, you have the least to lose in an alcohol drink.

1075
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:58,340
Okay, say what you're about to say in a way that can never be construed as anti-bald.

1076
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:08,060
Go ahead, I double dare you. You don't have excess hair that could be

1077
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:23,060
the

1078
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:26,660
That's your neck. You just have a really tall neck.

1079
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,660
That's my neck?

1080
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:29,660
Where do you think your head starts?

1081
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:31,060
You're just saying nonsense now.

1082
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,060
Where does your head start?

1083
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,060
Where does your head start?

1084
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:36,660
Your neck ends where your hair begins. That is the end of your neck.

1085
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,060
That's not true. Because then there wouldn't be neck beards.

1086
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,060
I don't have neck hair.

1087
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:44,060
I have no neck hair.

1088
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,060
I think you do.

1089
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,060
I don't. I really don't.

1090
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:51,060
Look up. Look up right now. He doesn't.

1091
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,060
I mean he shaved it.

1092
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:55,060
No.

1093
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,060
No, I don't have to do that.

1094
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:59,060
I have been thinking recently

1095
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:05,060
it would be very nice to get a laser surgery to take off all of the hair on my entire head except my eyebrows.

1096
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,060
Including my facial hair.

1097
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,060
It would make my life so much easier.

1098
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:11,060
I think that would burn a lot.

1099
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,060
They'd knock you out for it.

1100
00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:15,060
They would knock me out for it.

1101
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,060
I think it hurts after.

1102
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:19,060
Still.

1103
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:24,060
Well you know what's probably even cheaper than that? Spilling flaming alcohol on yourself.

1104
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:29,060
That is true, burning away all my head. But then you have that awful burn skin.

1105
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:34,060
We do have to get you a flaming drink and see you drink it.

1106
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:36,060
I'm not gonna do well with it man.

1107
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,060
Well not you, him. Because he's claiming that he's the king of drinking on fire.

1108
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,060
He's thrown down the gauntlet. He's thrown down the gauntlet.

1109
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,060
I have done this.

1110
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:44,060
Yes he does.

1111
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,060
What?

1112
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,060
I like cold drinks.

1113
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:47,060
You like what?

1114
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:47,860
You like what?

1115
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:49,060
I like cold drinks.

1116
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,060
Well you need to break out now.

1117
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,460
You know what I hate, man?

1118
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:54,460
I hate a hot toddy.

1119
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:57,460
That is a disgusting drink for sick people.

1120
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,460
It is. You're supposed to drink it when you're sick.

1121
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:01,460
That's the whole point.

1122
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:04,060
There's no way that whiskey can be good for you when you're sick.

1123
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,060
It is!

1124
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,860
This is not true.

1125
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:07,860
No, but it is.

1126
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,660
How is it good?

1127
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,260
Because it...

1128
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,660
Because it makes you feel good?

1129
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:12,860
It always does that.

1130
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,660
Well it feels like rubbing alcohol when you drink it.

1131
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,380
So it's like, you know, it numbs your throat.

1132
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:19,380
What?

1133
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,380
What kind of whiskey are you drinking?

1134
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:24,380
All whiskey.

1135
00:57:24,380 --> 00:57:25,980
It feels like rubbing alcohol.

1136
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,980
What are you talking about?

1137
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:33,580
Did you know, I found this out recently, you know that, that, uh, coproceptic or whatever

1138
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:37,620
that spray that you spray to numb your throat, the throat numbing stuff?

1139
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,500
You know you're not supposed to drink that?

1140
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,500
Yeah.

1141
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,140
You're supposed to spit it out.

1142
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,140
Yeah.

1143
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,500
It's fine.

1144
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:49,300
I was taking it to the dome, man. I was doing 40 sprays in a row and drinking it.

1145
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,300
Yeah, it's just alcohol. It's bad for you.

1146
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,500
It tasted amazing. Why do they make it taste good if you're supposed to spit that shit out?

1147
00:57:55,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Because otherwise you'd be fucking spraying nasty chemicals in your mouth and you'd be like "pit, pit, pit."

1148
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:05,000
Yeah, that should make you spit it out. It should have the Nintendo Switch cartridge taste.

1149
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,000
Mmm.

1150
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,500
Have you ever put one of those in your mouth?

1151
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,500
No.

1152
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:09,500
Me neither.

1153
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,500
I'd like to see you do- really?

1154
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,500
Yeah.

1155
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:13,500
I'd like to see you guys do that. Because that is a true-

1156
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:20,500
the

1157
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:27,500
like

1158
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:34,500
the

1159
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:37,400
and on the switch i'm not aware

1160
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,380
well next time you come to my house i want you to taste every game i have

1161
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:45,500
and let me tell you what i've tasted them and india two k sixteen is the worst

1162
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,220
tasting game

1163
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:48,540
on planet earth

1164
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,980
really that's right

1165
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:54,100
it's really bad dude it's racist that they made that game taste worse i agree

1166
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,140
why did they take a so bad

1167
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:02,220
Make the baby games taste bad. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. They should make like Mario and Luigi and Mario Kart taste the worst

1168
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:04,420
It should make Paw Patrol taste bad

1169
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:10,620
Yeah, that way of the adult game should taste good. Honestly. Yeah

1170
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:14,860
Like which one it should taste like sour like these are

1171
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:23,720
Persona 5 they these games should taste like sour candy. You just couldn't let it go right before the hour you had to say it

1172
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:27,420
He did we we did a whole episode without a persona man

1173
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,880
It's the only other game that I have that is not a baby game

1174
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:36,000
The other games I have are fucking Mario maker and crash bandicoot someone in the comments said that we should have a an episode

1175
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,940
Where it's the persona hour just so you can get it out of yourself of your system

1176
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:45,420
Well, we have to wait here my you don't want to hear my theories man. My theories would blow your mind

1177
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,880
What possible theory could you have? Let's let's say

1178
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:53,340
I'll say it dude. Here's my theory. Okay, and

1179
00:59:53,340 --> 01:00:12,860
and

1180
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:14,860
It's made by atlas, it's the same game.

1181
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:21,260
People already stole my fucking idea, they got a hold of my notebook somehow, and they

1182
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:22,260
stole my idea.

1183
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,260
But whatever.

1184
01:00:23,260 --> 01:00:25,860
It's a PS3 game made by atlas.

1185
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:29,740
I don't care who made it man.

1186
01:00:29,740 --> 01:00:31,740
Atlas makes Persona, you're stupid.

1187
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,420
I'm supposed to know that?

1188
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:37,420
I thought Marvel made Persona.

1189
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,420
That would be awesome.

1190
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,420
Or DC.

1191
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:46,420
DC yeah, dude, like you you, you know rip off your persona and your Deadpool underneath. I'll say it's badass

1192
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,660
that they

1193
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:52,800
Did the that they named the main character Joker?

1194
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:57,020
Yeah in that game. That's impressive. Yes. That's really impressive. I

1195
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:59,700
Cuz it was your wild

1196
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:03,420
Wow, I didn't even put that together. Yeah

1197
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:06,700
What did you think that they call him Joker?

1198
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:13,480
Because it was a cool name and I had it and I imagine there was some meeting somewhere where they were like

1199
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:19,540
Yeah, we we really want to call him Joker. They were like we there's already a very famous

1200
01:01:19,540 --> 01:01:22,720
Joker is more famous than this Joker would ever be I don't think

1201
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:31,940
Also, you don't think Joker was famous in 2010, I don't think Joker was famous in 2010 in Japan

1202
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:34,860
Joker has been famous since

1203
01:01:35,260 --> 01:01:42,260
and

1204
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:49,260
and

1205
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:56,260
as

1206
01:01:56,260 --> 01:02:04,660
uh...

1207
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:14,860
uh...

1208
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:18,580
This is a podcast.

1209
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,420
- Yeah.

1210
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,740
- You are stifling conversation.

1211
01:02:20,740 --> 01:02:22,100
- I want to lie.

1212
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:23,380
I want to lie.

1213
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:25,580
- I need to fill people's heads with nonsense.

1214
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:28,740
- I think when the hour's up, I get to have fun

1215
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,700
and prove a fact wrong.

1216
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,660
- All right, well, yeah, we can stop

1217
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,020
so you can go Google, man.

1218
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,020
- I don't wanna Google anymore.

1219
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:36,860
I actually don't wanna Google anymore.

1220
01:02:36,860 --> 01:02:38,180
- No, no, no, no, no, go ahead.

1221
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:39,020
Go Google.

1222
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:40,940
I have to go take a shit.

1223
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:42,060
- Yeah, I have to leave.

1224
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,140
- No, you can Google.

1225
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:44,380
Rex is on a time crunch.

1226
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:45,860
So now this is your Google time.

1227
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:49,540
You know what? I have a great idea. Why don't you do right now a Googling stream.

1228
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:50,740
See how far that gets you.

1229
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:52,100

01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:56,340
Just Google things for four hours.

1233
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,220
Alright, well...

1234
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,340
Okay, and I heard his feelings.
