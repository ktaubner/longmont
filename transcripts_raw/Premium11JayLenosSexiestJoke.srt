9
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,400
Gay guy.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Gay.

11
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,700

Mm-hmm.

14
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,200
It's like Power Man.

15
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,100
When the Grinch steals.

16
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,400
Let's do all of our songs.

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,240
Okay, let's do a songs episode.

18
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:37,160
When the Grinch steals and the Grinch eats all our presents and all our roast

19
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:38,160
beast.

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
Okay.

21
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,360
And he's so mean and he's so green.

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,720
Why is the Grinch so mean?

23
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,760
That's a good song.

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,760
So there's one.

25
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,760
Thanks.

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,760
All right, next song.

27
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,640
Pat, you do one now.

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,160
Okay, hold on.

29
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:06,160
on

30
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:08,160
You guys know I didn't have a song prepared for this episode.

31
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:08,660
No!

32
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,660
I didn't either.

33
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,160
Oh my god.

34
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,660
I knew.

35
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,160
I knew.

36
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Oh my god.

37
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,160
I didn't have a song prepared.

38
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,160
Sorry that we got to write ours.

39
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,660
Get off your phone.

40
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,160
You're gonna have to, uh.

41
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Oh, he's looking up a song.

42
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,660
He's just googling song right now.

43
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,660
Alright, Caleb, you do another one while we wait.

44
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:28,160
I chimed in. Haven't you people ever heard of the twillage?

45
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,160
I was really hoping to scare you, not to hurt your feelings, but I'm only trying to get you.

46
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,160
Is this Rap God?

47
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:42,160
(music)

48
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,160
Yep.

49
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,160
Oh, okay.

50
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,160
That was good, dude.

51
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,160
(music)

52
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,160
One of my fondest high school memories was...

53
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,160
That's so funny that's what Eminem turned into.

54
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,160
Yeah, and just a cyborg. I love him.

55
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,160
(laughter)

56
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:03,960
I went to this party one time, and it was like in high school, and it was kind of right when

57
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,400
that song had come out.

58
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,560
And there was a, they had like a bonfire outside, and everyone was just sitting around smoking

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,240
weed and being on their phones.

60
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,840
And then one kid was like, "Do you guys want to see something fucking sick?"

61
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,760
And everyone was like, "Yeah."

62
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,560
And then he just played Rap God and rapped the whole thing for everybody.

63
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,880
But nobody was paying attention except me.

64
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,840
So it was just this one guy at a big fire just rapping to me, Rap God.

65
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,040
And afterwards he was like, "So like what'd you think?"

66
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,360
And I was like, "That was some of the fastest rapping I've ever heard in real life."

67
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,240
There's a kid at my high school who used to do shit like that.

68
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,080
And he worked with my friend Kayla.

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,160
What, your friend Caleb?

70
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Yeah.

71
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
That's me.

72
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Girl Caleb.

73
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
I've never had a job.

74
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,520
and Dom was going to like pick her up from work or something she was like hey

75
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,720
Derek can you rap fast for us and then he just did it in the middle of his shift

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,720
like good like consciousness because he was sure that it's not just

77
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,960
rather on just miss oh okay that's why I said consciousness there's a

78
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,600
consciousness but he would do like the conclusion that I came to is that we

79
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,320
need a solution for it.

80
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,920
- Ah, sounds like it's you, like Hamilton rapping.

81
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:29,240
- There's a guy, I don't remember,

82
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,080
he was in my high school, I don't even remember who it was,

83
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,440
but he was a rapper. - It was you.

84
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:35,680
- And he went on a Facebook live

85
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,840
and of him freestyling at a party.

86
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,800
And like it was so funny,

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,500
'cause it's just him in a corner like freestyling,

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:46,560
and it's everybody just like looking at him really annoyed,

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,240
like nobody is paying attention.

90
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
I was like what is this guy doing?

91
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,240
And his friend is filming him.

92
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,240
Like on Facebook live.

93
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
You gotta lay down some rhymes.

94
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,240
So these...

95
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
Everyone at the party will break dance.

96
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,240
I knew this kid in high school who

97
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,240
he was such a big Kid Cudi fan

98
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,240
that he decided to

99
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
become a rapper and changed his

100
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
decided his rap name

101
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
would be, his name was Dylan

102
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
and he decided his rap name would be

103
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,240
Dylan Mess Cudi.

104
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,560
Which is just Kid Cudi's last name.

105
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,560
That's pretty sick.

106
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,040
It's like he's marrying him.

107
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,760
I never heard his music.

108
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,200
I'm guessing it sounded like Kid Cudi.

109
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:33,840
Yeah, that's a safe bet.

110
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,480
That's what Kid Cudi sounds like to me.

111
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,000
What have you guys been up to?

112
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Not much.

113
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yeah, not too much.

114
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,680
I watched Transformers today.

115
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
That's cool.

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,680
Which one?

117
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,680
The first one.

118
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,080
It's really good. It's really... It is good. It's super good. It's so much... it holds up really well.

119
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,320
I mean it still looks good too. It like looks really cool. The CGI is... Me and Janna were talking about how

120
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,920
they have such a... those movies have such a specific like visual style. Yeah, everything's like blue and orange.

121
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,320
Yeah, and everything that came out for like five years after that, every action movie, just looks

122
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,440
like transformers but without Megatron Optimo yeah yeah

123
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:23,080
yeah good Megatroid Megatron the Mega charred Mega Charizard yeah don't say

124
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,840
that they got Mega Charizard in there oh my god they accidentally unlocked

125
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:36,480
Giga Grinch oh no no power of the cube oh god the Grinch has entered Dynamax mode

126
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,480
No, we cannot let that happen.

127
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,980
Grinch X. Shut the whole thing down.

128
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,980
That sucks.

129
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,120
They should make Grinch X like Jason X and he's in space.

130
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,080
Grinch X like Malcolm X. Grinch level X like Darkrai.

131
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,080
Grinch X like Malcolm X. Fighting for green people.

132
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,200
Muslim Grinch.

133
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Trying to think.

134
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,200
Muslim Grinch?

135
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Yeah.

136
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,040
What do you think about that?

137
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,800
That's why he hates Christmas.

138
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:20,520
No cat in the hat never called me no Grinch.

139
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,360
No thing never called me no Grinch.

140
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,600
It was only Booz.

141
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,600
It was always Booz.

142
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,840
No, because the Hoos did call him a Grinch.

143
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,640
The Hoos do call him Grinch.

144
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
Yeah.

145
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,000
It was just never a thing one or two.

146
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yeah.

147
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,400
No, no thing one never called me no Grinch.

148
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,960
No Horton.

149
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,120
Horton was a serious Grinch about abortion.

150
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,380
That's what that movie was about.

151
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,880
That's why he's an elephant.

152
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,760
That's why everybody here in North Carolina loves Horton Hears a Who because they think

153
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,760
it's about it.

154
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,040
They think it's about the GOP elephant.

155
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,040
Yeah.

156
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:08,880
and he's protecting him the the who's from the Democratic kangaroo yeah which

157
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,560
which is which is the Democrats can't yeah the Grinch the Grinch is a great

158
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,160
kangaroo the world's smartest kangaroo that's why he can carry all those

159
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:29,440
presents he has a pouch the Grinch is somebody dr. who or mr. Seuss he decided

160
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,360
he was sitting around one day smoking ganja drawing pictures of Japanese people

161
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,960
and he was like what if a kangaroo learned how to steal presents I'm gonna

162
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,320
draw the Grinch yeah

163
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:56,640
down one day in 1942 and he said yeah today's the day I draw the Grinch. He had it circled on his calendar for three years.

164
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Since the beginning of the war. He locks all the doors. I knew this was the day I unleashed the ultimate evil onto earth.

165
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Draw Grinch. Yeah that's why Hitler killed himself with that cyanide pill.

166
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,640
Yeah, because he knew the Grinch was coming.

167
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,640
He knew the Grinch was on the way.

168
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,640
The United States has the Grinch.

169
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,640
We have caught and compromised to a permanent end.

170
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
The Grinch.

171
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,640
The bastard.

172
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,640
The Grinch.

173
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
The bastard Grinch.

174
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
The green bastard.

175
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Yeah.

176
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:37,640
It is, uh, have you guys seen all the Dr. Seuss Japanese drawings?

177
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Yeah.

178
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,920
It's pretty crazy. It's funny he like peppers it into his normal stuff too.

179
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,960
Like I was I found this book in a Dr. Seuss book one time and it's like a

180
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:52,100
bunch of like questions. It's like kind of like... Oh I actually the other day

181
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,580
found this video that you sent me on my phone. Yeah and it's like it's like

182
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,840
stuff that's like how old do you have to be to drive? How old do you have to be to

183
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,320
vote? How old and it's like how old you have to be to like cook your own meal?

184
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,560
And the last one says how old do you have to be to be a Japanese? And then you go to the back and

185
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,160
and there's like an answer key and the answer says the Japanese are Japanese

186
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
from the day they are born.

187
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,060
That's true.

188
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,160
That is yeah, I mean that is not wrong.

00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,960
Is unfalsified with truth and yet

257
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,800
like it's like head like a hole but it's green like a Grinch and then he says

258
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,840
I'd rather die than give you my gifts

259
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,640

260
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,940

261
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,580

00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:46,680
Grinch like a hole! Grinch like a hole!

263
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,860
I'm green, ba ba da, I'm the Grinch

264
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,820
Bob I'm the Grinch I am green on the Grinch

265
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,220
it's good now listen up here's a story about a little green

266
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:03,580
Grinch named the Green Grinch and all day and all night he's in his cave hanging

267
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,780
out with his dog

268
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,140
he's Grinch inside and out Grinch

269
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,620
I love that song

270
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,180
I'm the Blue Grinch not no

271
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:19,580
no we're not talking about the Blue Grinch right now

272
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,300
Imagine what about a red white and blue Grinch?

273
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,800
Uh-huh.

274
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,800
I salute you my Grinch.

275
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,320
I salute you till the day I die my blue green red white and blue Grinch.

276
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,640
He's still green somewhere.

277
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,140
Yeah.

278
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,140
He's green where it counts.

279
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
[Laughter]

280
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,400
Once you go green you never don't go Grinch.

281
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,400
[Laughter]

282
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
[Laughter]

283
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:44,900
Oh.

284
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,820
Woo.

285
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,820
The Grinch is real.

286
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,040
[Burps]

287
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
I ate a bunch of quinoa and beans.

288
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,120
I also ate quinoa today, but no beans.

289
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Yeah.

290
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
Yeah.

291
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,680
I ate quinoa, beans, and corn, and now my throat is like, feels like I drank a gallon

292
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,680
of milk.

293
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,960
It's very thick.

294
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,120
When I'm home, I just don't know what to do with myself when I'm like staying with my

295
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,720
parents because I don't have a job.

296
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,040
I was offered a job at Waffle House while I'm here.

297
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Okay.

298
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,160
it. Just not even to get the money, I just want the recipes.

299
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:23,960
Yeah.

300
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,200
You know, I want the waffle recipe.

301
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,040
Well, you got to get a griddle in your house.

302
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,680
I'd also like to, you don't got to get a griddle.

303
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,160
You got to get a whole griddle.

304
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,320
You got to get a whole ass griddle.

305
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,040
Have either of you ever eaten at Waffle House?

306
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,320
No.

307
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,000
I have.

308
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,880
You have?

309
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,360
Yeah.

310
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,400
I've eaten at Waffle House.

311
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:45,160
I ate at Waffle House. When we were, when me and Gus were like

312
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:51,320
driving we were on tour we did a show we ate Waffle House did a show in Atlanta

313
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,240
and then like drove through the night to North Carolina and ate Waffle House

314
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,200
again six hours later I've had most of the things on the menu at Waffle House

315
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:08,520
I recommend the pork chops to anybody who's listening the chops are underrated

316
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,600
yeah I went to when I was like six years old my parent we were staying at like

317
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,720
this motel in the Cape and we went to this restaurant that my parents went to

318
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,520
after their honeymoon because they were like oh this would be fun and then like

319
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,320
we were it was called the Pancake Man and it was called the Pancake Man I

320
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,160
don't know if it's still operating in the in the Cape. What part of the

321
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,680
Cape? I don't know I was six might be in Hyannis or something. Right sure you were.

322
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,520
- Hyena's.

323
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,360
- Hyenas.

324
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,360
- Hyenas, but so we ate there and we didn't like it

325
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,960
and then my uncle Kevin told us to write letters to them

326
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,060
to tell them how dissatisfied we were

327
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,080
and we all wrote a letter to the Pancake Man

328
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,840
and we just kept trying to like see how many swear words

329
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,880
we could get away with so it's just a bunch of six year old

330
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,700
like me, my brother, my sister and my younger brother

331
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,860
being like, "Dear Pancake Man, your food was damn crap."

332
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,120
(laughing)

333
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:20,420
- I didn't know how to use curse words

334
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,500
until I was probably like 19.

335
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,480
- Yeah.

336
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,320
- Honestly.

337
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,540
I remember I discovered them,

338
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,200
not discovered, I unlocked them when I was in fifth grade

339
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,060
'cause I stopped believing in God

340
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,260
and I was like, "Finally, I can say, 'fuck'."

341
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:41,500
And then I guess I used bad words too much

342
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,260
because one time I was hanging out with my brother

343
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,540
and his friends, they were all older than me,

344
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,840
and I guess I was cursing a bunch,

345
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,780
and Josh, he like pulled me aside and he was like,

346
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:53,580
"Hey man, you're using way too many curse words."

347
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,580
(laughing)

348
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,180
But he was like 17.

349
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,340
And he was like, "You're too young

350
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,620
"to be using so many curse words."

351
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,700
And--

352
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,960
- Badass.

353
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,800
- Yeah, and I was like,

354
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,340
you should be in jail.

355
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,460
(laughing)

356
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,300
- Yeah.

357
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,120
- That's what I, that was my retort.

358
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,240
I was very, it was a smart ass.

359
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,680
- I remember a really distinct memory of like

360
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,840
figuring out that I could say crap

361
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,160
and not get in trouble in like fourth grade.

362
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,760
And just saying it constantly.

363
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,600
- Do you, did anyone--

364
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,560
- Saying like what the crap, saying that.

365
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,460
- Did you get, did any of you guys get in trouble

366
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:31,560
for saying jerk?

367
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,440
'Cause for some reason in my third grade class

368
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:41,840
It was like a rule that jerk was just as bad as saying like shit.

369
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:44,400
No, no yeah.

370
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,520
It wasn't like a rule that the teacher made, it was a rule that like the students made.

371
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,520
They agreed on?

372
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Yeah.

373
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,800
They had a council.

374
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,200
You could say like idiot and stuff but apparently jerk was a swear.

375
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,960
So I think I, oh yeah I was singing the Larry is a Jerk song from the Andy Milonakis show

376
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,160
and somebody told on me

377
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,540
and I was like there's no one in the class named Larry

378
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,120
I uh... I never the only time I got in trouble for saying anything in school

379
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,680
was in fifth grade

380
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:19,780
I made a rape joke and got suspended

381
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,300
yeah? What was the joke?

382
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,780
the joke was

383
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,040
hey uh... hey Nick

384
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,000
uh... David's sister

385
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,400
No, I was like, "Hey Nick, David's sister raped you in the ass."

386
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,800
And my teacher was like, "You have to leave school."

387
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:43,000
And I did. And my mom was so mad.

388
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,800
Yeah.

389
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,200
Yeah, she was like, "He's just 10 years old.

390
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,200
He should be able to make as many rape jokes as he wants."

391
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,800
She really argued hard for it.

392
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,200
Damn.

393
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,880
but I was like, the thing is suspension is such a,

394
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,240
such a fucking pimp thing to, like punishment.

395
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,520
'Cause you just, like I just hung out.

396
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,220
- Right, you just hang out, you don't fucking do anything.

397
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,800
- And it was like, you know, it was fifth grade,

398
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,140
so I didn't have like a, I didn't have like a,

399
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,880
like work I had to catch up on,

400
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,080
like in high school or whatever.

401
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,480
Like I didn't have like extra work

402
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,060
just because I was suspended.

403
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,380
Like I just got four days off school.

404
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,300
- Yeah. - Yeah.

405
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,700
I got in trouble, we used to, you know the penis game, we used to play it but we would

406
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,020
play it with uh, oh no you know what it was, it was the penis game but it was a Tourette's

407
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,020
guy quote.

408
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:42,220
It was that one where he like hits his head or something and goes "Butt fuck!"

409
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:47,260
And we would just scream "Butt fuck" in the hallway and I said it too loud behind the

410
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,380
guidance counselor and I turned and I ran away into the bathroom and she followed me

411
00:19:52,380 --> 00:20:04,660
in I was like you can't be in here. You thought you had entered the men's embassy and that it was technically you were in men's jurisdiction.

412
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,460
Exactly I was like you got to get a boy teacher to get me out and then she took

413
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,100
me to the principal's office and then oh so I got a demerit for that but then the

414
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,820
next day I got a merit which like canceled it out. Whoa. So like I got the

415
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,100
demerit and then I got called into the office the next morning and my

416
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:31,940
principal was like going over what I did and he was like well so you said big

417
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:36,500
buttfuck in the hallway and I was like well I I didn't say big I didn't say I

418
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:41,380
didn't you added an adjective I didn't do that which does make it worse which

419
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,620
makes it worse yeah but then he was like well that's he he was like that's

420
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,780
semantics but anyway I'm you're not in here for that I'm just mentioning that

421
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:54,420
because you did something good at the same time and he was just he was just

422
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,980
too confused as to like how to go about my punishment because I was the good

423
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:02,900
thing was that you defended the men's bathroom

424
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,380
thing is you you made it all the way to the bathroom yeah PPP in your pants so I

425
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,780
was supposed to get like a lunch detention or something like that or like

426
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,620
a detention and I didn't because I got the merit.

427
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,420
- Nice, dude.

428
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,500
- So, ultimo pimp move.

429
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,700
- Yeah, if you do one bad thing,

430
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,540
you just cancel it back out.

431
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,220
- I can be your angel and your devil.

432
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,140
- That's level four pimp shit.

433
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,260
- Level four pimp shit.

434
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,300
- Yeah, the thing is, you could get away

435
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,440
with anything in school, and I'm telling you, anything.

436
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,280
- If you don't get caught.

437
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,420
- If you give the teacher an apple.

438
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,580
- Mm.

439
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,420
- Mm.

440
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,380
- But if the apple has a worm in it.

441
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,500
no then that's bad but you can get away with that if you give them a real apple

442
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,020
right so you say to alex

443
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,060

450
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,940
doesn't work on any other teacher

451
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:09,700
I had a science teacher named Mr. Davis,

452
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,700
who he kind of like, he kind of gave me the cold shoulder

453
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,020
after middle school when I saw him

454
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,120
at a gas station one time.

455
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,740
And it's like maybe the most my feelings

456
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,300
have ever been hurt.

457
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,300
- Yeah.

458
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,000
- Yeah, he was buying a lottery ticket

459
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,820
and I was like, "Hey, remember you used to teach me

460
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,660
"in sixth grade?"

461
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,740
And he was like, "Oh yeah, cool man."

462
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:33,020
And I was like, "Oh yeah, I'm just like an adult now.

463
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,540
"Like I'm not, you're not in charge of me anymore."

464
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,840
Like I don't have any, I don't, we're not,

465
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,180
you probably don't even remember me,

466
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:43,140
you fucking bald piece of shit.

467
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:43,980
- Yeah.

468
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,780
- We had this science teacher in,

469
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,900
I think I've talked about it,

470
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,720
but my science teacher in seventh grade, Mr. Tiela,

471
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,940
he was like from Italy, like,

472
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:57,720
his first language was Italian,

473
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,780
and for some reason,

474
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,820
everybody just accused him of being a pervert.

475
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,460
And then like, one day these kids went through his desk

476
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,960
and then like accused him of having boner pills in his desk.

477
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,200
(laughing)

478
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,740
There weren't boner pills in his desk,

479
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,140
but they just got in trouble for going through his shit.

480
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,500
- You had an actual teacher sex scandal though, right?

481
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,260
- Oh yeah, yeah I did.

482
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:30,300
We had our seventh grade--

483
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,140
- You had sex with the old janitor?

484
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,500
- I had sex with the old janitor.

485
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:41,060
I was good friends with one of the janitors in high school. Yeah, good janitor should have to dress like Frenchman

486
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:45,800
His old sticky man

Bending over to pick up banana peels. Hey you kids better calm down. No running in the hall

489
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,780
The floor is wet!

00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:04,460

that I get all for myself and that my mom can't buy from me

570
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,380
no matter how much she tries.

571
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,480
- I want a big candy.

572
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,520
- That's what my mom used to do.

573
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,820
She used to buy my Halloween candy from me

574
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,960
for like $5 when I was a kid.

575
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,800
- That's not bad.

576
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,720
- So that I wouldn't eat all the candy.

577
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,160
- Yeah, that's a good trick to play on a kid.

578
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,000
- Yeah.

579
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,160
- It was a trick and now I realize that

580
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,840
'cause it was easily $200 worth of candy in that bag.

581
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,200
- It's insane how much candy you got for free as a kid.

582
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,800
- Candy prices are skyrocketing this year.

583
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,200
- It's crazy that as an adult,

584
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,020
you have to almost always pay for your own candy.

585
00:29:59,020 --> 00:29:59,860
- Yeah.

586
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:00,700
- Yeah.

587
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,520
- If I was a hot kid, I would not have that.

588
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,160
- If I was a hot little kid, I would.

589
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,680
- I'd get unlimited candy.

590
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,520
- Yeah.

591
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,640
- That's serious kid privilege.

592
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,040
You walk around free candy all day long.

593
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:10,880

599
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:11,700
what's the best candy what's the best candy what's the best candy think a very

600
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:17,020
underrated candy actually know what no maybe it's cuz it was expired but I

601
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,900
think my opinion on ABBA's ABBA changed in LA yeah you don't like it anymore

602
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,100
- Yeah, I don't know, I don't think I can eat Abba's Abba

603
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,940
anymore, I think it's--

604
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,780
- I've never had Abba's Abba.

605
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,600
- It was like two years expired.

606
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,600
- It definitely has to do with the fact that it was expired.

607
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:30,440
- Yeah.

608
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,440
- Yeah, it was bad.

609
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,280
- Yeah.

610
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,660
- Similar kind of candy is a Cow Tail.

611
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,560
- Uh-huh.

612
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,400
- You ever had a Cow Tail?

613
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,160
- Cow Tails are pretty good, it's just--

614
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,000
- I like a Cow Tail.

615
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,040
- It hurts my teeth when I eat it.

616
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,080
- It's so sugary.

617
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,920
- Yeah.

618
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,800
- But it's like, I think it's like 15 cents, which--

619
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,640
- Oh yeah.

620
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,760
- For me, that's like a buy low, sell high candy.

621
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,560
You know what I mean?

622
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:58,400
get a lot of mileage out of 15 cents of candy. I love peanut M&M's. I feel like

623
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,640
all the people say it's the lame candy but I think it's a cool one.

624
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:10,060
It's the best candy. I think it's one of the best. It's not the best. I think the

625
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:16,520
best might be the Snickers bar. I think Snickers is like a good candy but I

626
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,520
don't think it's the best candy. It's got everything that I want in a bar. Same with

627
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:25,440
Take five you ever had. Oh, no take five is the best candy bar. I like

628
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,680
Enjoy, I love

629
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:34,600
Enjoy, you don't like almond. Joy. Oh, that makes sense. It's good. He doesn't have a culture culture

630
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,120
You're not you're not tropical like me and and camera. No, I like tropical food

631
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,880
I don't like almond joy. I don't like almond joy cuz it's just coconut. Maybe if it was like a man

632
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,880
There's an almond in there - you fucking idiot

633
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:50,420
Around it you're so stupid dude. I bet you like mountains

634
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:56,120
Mounds yeah, I like mounds - what's wrong with that start chocolate actually no I think I like mounds

635
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,200
I think I don't like almond joy, but I like mounds

636
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,200
I'd have to it the only difference is that almond joys milk chocolate with an almond belly button yeah and

637
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,960
Coconut yeah, I don't know. I think it's just a coconut and almond thing. I like mounds though mounds is fine

638
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,920
Have you guys ever had one almond in in almond joy? Yeah? I know, but it like creeps up on you

639
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:22,640
Have you ever had a taste-o-ball? No. It's really good. Oh I love a spazzo center.

640
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:30,840
Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Have you ever had a Clark? A Clark is one of my favorite candy. A nice hot

641
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,520
Clark. No, a Clark bar? It's like a... Yeah, a Clark bar. It's like a... it's like a

642
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:41,080
Butterfinger but a lot crispier. Have you guys ever had a candy belt? A Mallow Cup?

643
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:44,800
Oh, I do like Milo cup. It's just good one time

644
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:50,440
I got I had a like a flannel shirt that I got from Goodwill baby room and I took it home and there was a

645
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,960
half-eaten nerds rope in it and

646
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:01,440
And then my little brother was like walking here he walked into my room and I was like hey do you want this

647
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,320
Bowl

648
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,840
Yeah, sure and that stupid bitch

649
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,180
- Did you tell him?

650
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:15,060
- Yeah, after, and he was like, "Tasted normal."

651
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,720
(laughing)

652
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,560
- Nice.

653
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,400
- It's good though.

654
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,220
- Yeah.

655
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,720
Nerds Rope was really good.

656
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,820
- Nerds Rope was really good.

657
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,460
The problem with Nerds Rope is you open it

658
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:26,220
and you forget that it's one inch tall.

659
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,060
- Yeah.

660
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:27,880
- It's so small.

661
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,100
- No, I like that it's small.

662
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,900
'Cause I mean, there is the big Nerds Rope.

663
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,580
I think, there's a lot of candy I can't eat anymore

664
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,060
because I ate so much of it in a mass quantity.

665
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,220
- That you have diabetes now.

666
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,800

Yeah, they changed the makeup of it. Yeah, it looks it changes DNA

They changed the percentages and kind of equalized everything up to the finger. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's more finger now

689
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,300
It is way more fingery than butter. Yeah

690
00:35:52,300 --> 00:36:01,020
I just like when they just put all of the ingredients in the name. Mm-hmm butter and fingers ever had a zero bar

691
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,340
I love a zero bar because there's nothing in it. Yeah

692
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,060
It's it's fucked up

693
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,300
It is it's a it's genuinely it's one of the most fucked up candy bars. I think what do you find?

694
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,260
So fucked up about a zero white chocolate. Yeah new get

695
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:23,920
Yeah, it's good. It's I like zero bars, but it's like every time I like when I'm halfway through it

696
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,380
I'm like, oh, yeah, this is too many thick things. I have a stomach

697
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:34,140
Busted shit. I don't know why I like I like what's on the inside of the zero bar. That's why I get it

698
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:39,040
So if there's a zero bar that personality like yeah, there's a zero dark 30 bar

699
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:48,580
That'd be pretty good there is yeah, it's only 30 calories and it's dark chocolate and it has zero calories

700
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:53,060
There's a zero bar has zero calories. That's why it's called. That's why you eat it. Yeah

701
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:57,620
Yeah, it also has a zero bar. Yeah, it's called zero because it has zero

702
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:58,620
zero authority.

703
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:02,420
It's because I've eaten it zero times.

704
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Yeah.

705
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,620
Yeah, for me it's a 10 bar.

706
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,420
Yeah, it changes.

707
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
Yeah.

708
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
Based on-

709
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:10,420
And a 300 grand bar.

710
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,700
Let me tell you what, buddy.

711
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,700
That shit's expensive.

712
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,500
I've had way too many of those.

713
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,500
Yeah.

714
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:19,580
Yeah, I've had 300 grand of those.

715
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Yeah.

716
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,580
Yeah, no.

717
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,580
I'm serious.

718
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,380
It's just called a zero bar just because.

719
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,380
I have zero respect for that.

720
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,380
Mm-hmm.

721
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,380
Bar.

722
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:35,820
I- Oh, it was called the Double Zero Bar and was renamed Zero in 1934.

723
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
Damn, they downsized it.

724
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,580
So the name Double Zero was implied to suggest that the bar was cool, as in low temperature.

725
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:43,580
Oh.

726
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,300
What's happening, forum?

727
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,300
And we're- Sorry.

728
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:47,300
We're back.

729
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
We got Grinched.

730
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,420
We are back on this show.

731
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,740
We got Grinched.

732
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,740
We got Grinched.

733
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,780
We got Grinched.

734
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,780
We got Grinched.

735
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,780
And we got Grinched.

736
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,780
No, we've been grinched.

737
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,780
I'm gonna grinch you if you don't shut the fuck up, you son of a bitch.

738
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:02,780
Okay.

739
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:05,280
Hey dude, Patrick's sister grinched you.

740
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
No!

741
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
No!

742
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
I grinched her!

743
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Don't.

744
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,780
I grinched Caleb and then Caleb grinched Patrick and then Patrick died.

745
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
Oh!

746
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:17,780
And then Patrick just died and made that noise.

747
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:20,780
Oh no, you're killing the Grinch!

748
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:25,280
Oh, you killed the Grinch, he stole my penis, you cannot take the penis from the Grinch!

749
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,640
That's Mama Grinch.

750
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,860
Oh my son.

751
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,420
Grinch, how come you never come see your mama no more?

752
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:32,640
You never come see your mama, Mr. Grinch.

753
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,640
Oh, come here.

754
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,640
Mom, I'm stealing presents.

755
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,640
It's just Giancarlo the bullfrog.

756
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,140
What?

757
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,940
It's just the bullfrog.

758
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,940
This is Giancarlo.

759
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
Giancarlo the bullfrog.

760
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
Oh no, you have stolen my penis.

761
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
The Grinch.

762
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
The Grinch.

763
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
The Grinch strikes again.

764
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
Help, police.

765
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:51,940
The Grinch has stolen my penis.

766
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,940
Sorry, the Grinch steals presents, not penis.

767
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,940
My penis is a present every morning.

768
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,440
Oh yeah?

769
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,860
Oh my god.

770
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,700
It's just a present to have a penis on my body.

771
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,340
And it has not, and no, it has not fallen off.

772
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,260
Oh lord.

773
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:07,980
Wild shit.

774
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,020
Me and my bros were recreating the Lonely Island video,

775
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,660
Dick in the Box, and the Grinch stole our penises.

776
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:13,980
Okay.

777
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:17,340
This is seriously gonna suck getting these back.

778
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,740
Yeah.

779
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,460
Yeah, they take away the box and their penis is gone.

780
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,660
The penis is gone like...

781
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:32,580
like there's just a it's a good YouTube search like a Ken doll what steals penis

782
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:38,740
no just like a good YouTube search would be like fucking dick in the box remake

783
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:48,180
yeah I found a really good Lonely Island parody of a parody the other day and it

784
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:54,740
was like a wedding video and it's a guy and he's like oh yeah get the dance floor

785
00:39:54,740 --> 00:40:02,740
ready it's about to go down put on your dancing shoes we're so in love

786
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:10,060

787
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:20,460
without asking. What the fuck? Yeah and he claims he's never seen I'm on a boat.

788
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,180
I don't know what you're talking about. I'm just making a song. I wrote. I thought you wanted a song

789
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:30,940
about your magical day. Yeah. T-Pain is in the song. Yeah it's the real T-Pain.

790
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:39,900
This was not in the budget. Well the bill's here so T-Pain's asking for sixty thousand dollars.

791
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:45,780
And he's gonna get his money. And he's gonna get his fucking money. Didn't he win the Masked Singer?

792
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:49,220
What? Did he? I think so.

793
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:53,700
I just all I know about the Masked Singer. That's kind of fucked up to put a singer in the Masked Singer.

794
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,420
Yeah, well aren't they all singers? No, it's like actors and stuff. That's like putting

795
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:01,240
Johnny Knoxville in The Ringer. Yeah.

796
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:09,080
The Masked Ringer. The Masked Ringer. I watched, I re-watched that the other day. I re-watched half of it the other day.

797
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,220
Yeah, and stop cuz you were laughing too fucking hard. No, it's like

798
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:17,800
there if there's just parts of it that are like

799
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,680
- it like they're trying to be trying to like get sentimental shit like they're trying to yeah

800
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:29,220
That Johnny Knoxville is a good guy and then the whole time it's like he's rigging. Yeah

801
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,540
Yeah, no Johnny Knoxville

802
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:36,020
There are scenes in that movie when Johnny Knoxville is like talking to some of the mentally disabled people and he'll be like, you know

803
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,500
What I'm starting to think you retard should have rights

804
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:52,180
Wow these guys are just like me I think you guys might be conscious what were

805
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:56,580
we talking about before that? Candy!

806
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:04,540
No I thought I was still quoting the ringer. What's the big the ringer quote

807
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:10,100
everyone's still everyone's still the oh my lanta you are my woman and there's

808
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:16,580
kids who just used to say that in school and it's like the I got a whole class of

809
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:27,340
kids used to just say that in school it's pretty good yeah I loved that movie

810
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:31,020
when I was a kid oh yeah I watched that movie so many times because Johnny

811
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,020
Johnny Knoxville was my favorite actor.

812
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,020
Oh, me too.

813
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,100
And I don't think I'd ever met somebody who was mentally disabled.

814
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,980
I think I was just like, "Yeah, this is just like, might as well be the Muppets."

815
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,980
Jesus.

816
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:51,420
I was nine!

817
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:55,180
You hadn't met a mentally disabled person at the age of nine?

818
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,420
No, this was way before I met you.

819
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,420
Whoa.

820
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420

We should do a watch along.

00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,600
We should just do a watch along while I'm here.

844
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,480
- The watch along, not while you're there, no.

845

- It wouldn't be impossible.

848
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:25,880
- It would be really difficult.

i have a t_v_ i have right now only is a sony and it's from

858
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,100

859
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:58,940
and it's uh... it's like eighty pounds

860
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,460
but it's like a it's like one of the like first

861
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,140
it's like from

862
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:06,260
dom's parents like all that is in their basement

863
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,740
uh... we've had this t_v_ for two years and it's like

864
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,460
shitting out on us

865
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,180
and everyone to eighty pounds eighty-pound t_v_

866
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,080
so stevie should not be that heavy

867
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,320
i got a t_v_ issue and i don't know if you think about how heavy it's whole t_v_

868
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,180
would be a movie theater

869
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:30,220
it's just a screen it would be that it's off thousand pound screen no how do you

870
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:32,240
think they get the lights inside of it

871
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,840
they make the room dark

872
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,460
yeah they just make the room dark

873
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:42,860
so there's no lights there are no says no t_v_ is a movie is dark so they may

874
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:48,560
have a lot of the right spots you can't watch t_v_ at the movies idiot

875
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,060
i guess that's true

876
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,300
they should have an option to the

877
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:57,360
didn't they didn't they uh... premiere the final episode of lost in i'm x

878
00:45:57,360 --> 00:46:00,440

881
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:13,140

paying to watch football

883
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,840

00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,680
- Hey, it's me, Ernest.

936
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:53,140
- Do you know Jim Varney might've fucked Freddie Mercury?

937
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,980

938
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:55,820

939
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,780

00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:05,940

946
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:06,780

*laughter*

950
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:18,740
Like yeah, the thing is about Freddie Mercury, he was fucked in the ass tons of times, but only one of them really counted.

951
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,740
Only one of them where he got totally fucked.

00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:22,740
Yeah, one of them he was fucked twice.

953

Was he the 27 Club?

957
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,740
Was he a 27 Club member? No.

958
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,740
He was like 50 years old when he died.

959
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,740
He was like 300 I think.

960
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:39,380
He had sex with way more than 27 guys.

961
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:41,860
(laughing)

962
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,700

963
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:44,460

00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,460

979
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:22,380
rocket man who carried transitions from users who doesn't seem to have a good

980
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:23,300
and the only

981
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,980
than the and it is not a picture of the elton john they were so that

982
00:49:26,980 --> 00:49:31,380
the ugliest man alive they were doing they were so fucking generous with how

983
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:35,940
much hair they gave elton john in that movie it's insane i want to see what he's looking like

984
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:42,260
nowadays he's yeah it's uh i thought like patrick he he looks like an auntie he looks like patrick

985
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:46,980
with glasses no he looks like an auntie he looks like auntie patrick with glasses i was thinking

986
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:53,380
about someone who called who's called aunt's female uncles oh but the funny the funniest part about the

987
00:49:53,380 --> 00:50:00,180
end of rocket man is the fucking uh it's like oh elton john has battled and like battled all of his

988
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:08,740
addictions except shopping and I mean I'm looking at him right now I have a

989
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,500
picture pulled up he literally looks exactly like gay Patton Oswalt yeah yeah

990
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:20,900
he does that's a good comparison. If Patton Oswalt killed his husband this is what he would look like.

991
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:28,180
His husband? Yeah. Yeah that's but yeah like just imagine watching Taron Egerton

992
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:32,980
for a whole movie and then they switch to this yeah they just so they put a

993
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:37,780
picture of that thing that's like a like a Goddard fade in they did that they do

994
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:45,300
like a face match fade in and then it looks like an animal I think I don't

995
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,460
know if Oh God he was fucking they did that with Goddard at the end and it's

996
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:55,740
like the Sun is being played by like some like fucking jacked Italian kid and

997
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:57,820
and then you see John Gotti Jr.

998
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,260
and what he actually looked like.

999
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:01,980
And he just looks like he's made out of sausage.

1000
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:03,060
- I wanna see.

1001
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,380
- Yeah, more like--

1002
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,140
- We should do a watch along of Gotti

1003
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:09,980
'cause that movie is fucking nuts.

1004
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,180
- All right, I think it's on Amazon Prime.

1005
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,580
- John Gotti Jr., he looks like a personal strainer.

1006
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:16,900
- A personal strainer?

1007
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,480
- A personal stranger.

1008
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,540
- My personal strainer.

1009
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:21,820
- He looks like a personal strainer.

1010
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:23,660
I mean, he looks like a scientist

1011
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,580
that would go on the Joe Rogan experience.

1012
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,380
Yeah, but the actor that they got to play him looks nothing fucking like him at all.

1013
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,880
Let's see what he looks like.

1014
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:35,080
Oh, here's a picture of him with John Travolta.

1015
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:36,080
Yeah.

1016
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:41,060
I bet they're boyfriends, and they like it.

1017
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,940
They probably like being boyfriends.

1018
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:45,660
Unlike me, I hate having my boyfriends.

1019
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:46,660
Who do they get to play?

1020
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,260
I like Scientology that hates it when people have boyfriends.

1021
00:51:50,260 --> 00:51:51,260
Is Scientology anti-gay?

1022
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:54,260
Well, they're anti-gay for the like...

1023
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:55,260
What the fuck?

1024
00:51:55,260 --> 00:52:01,580
They're anti-gay for their biggest two members, which is Tom Cruise and John Travolta.

1025
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:02,580
Have you read any of the...

1026
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,220
And those guys are gay for guys.

1027
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:10,940
Have you read any of the conspiracies that Scientology killed John Travolta's autistic

1028
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:12,620
son because he was autistic?

Yeah, they're fucked up.

1031
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,620
That's cool.

1032
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:18,300
Because they don't believe in mental health or like...

1033
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:19,780
Yeah, they don't believe in mental illness.

1034
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:20,780
Yeah, they don't believe in mental illness at all.

1035
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:21,780
There's a dog barking.

1036
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,620
Yeah, they're barking because I'm speaking too much truth about Scientology.

1037
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:27,620
I'm taking them down.

1038
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,780

Do you think Bugs Bunny could be admitted to Scientology?

00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,080
Is he famous enough?

1138
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,600
No, I think Elmer Fudd is the only Scientologist.

1139
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,640
But Bugs Bunny could be a Scientologist if he wanted to.

1140
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,480
He's one of the most famous figures in the world.

1141
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,400
- It's true, yeah.

1142
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,240
- And they would let him in with open arms.

1143
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:06,720
- He's one of the targets for Iran to strike at the US.

1144
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,540
Yeah, they're gonna blow up Bugs Bunny's little hole.

1145
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,000
- I know that they won't, I know he'll,

1146
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,840
hey, he has some tricks up his sleeve.

1147
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:16,960
- They're gonna throw a flashbang down into his hole.

1148
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,600
- Can you imagine the Scientology?

1149
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,400

1150
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:25,320
- It's rabbit season, bitch.

1151
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,560
They're gonna pour hot lava into his hole.

1152
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:35,960
They're gonna pour molten steel into his hole and then take it out like a sculpture.

1153
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:36,960
Yeah.

1154
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,960
And it'll be his hive.

1155
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,840
Yeah, they're gonna melt clear plastic in so you can see him.

1156
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:47,440
Can you imagine how mad the Scientology people must have been in their meeting with John

1157
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,440
Travolta after his role in Hairspray?

1158
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,440
Yeah.

1159
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:57,040
And they were like, "John, we need to explain something to you. You cannot be in movies

1160
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,040
dressed as girls."

1161
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,060
But I was having fun.

1162
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:03,060
I was having fun.

1163
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,720
I was having fun.

1164
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,880
Did you see how big my boobs were?

1165
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,040
Yes, that's the problem.

1166
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:12,400
I was married to Christopher Walken.

1167
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,400
That's what John Travolta sounds like.

1168
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
I was married to Christopher Walken.

1169
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Yeah.

1170
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,400
What are you?

1171
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,400
Grease.

1172
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,400
What?

1173
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,400
Grease, movie he was in.

1174
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,400
What?

1175
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,560
Grease, movie he was in.

1176
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,120
He's in the country of grease.

1177
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,120
Grease.

1178
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,120
Getting sucked off.

1179
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,120
No, he wasn't.

1180
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,120
Yeah, he was.

1181
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:29,680
He was getting sucked off by his personal trainer.

1182
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,240
Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

1183
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,560
His personal brainer.

1184
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,560
Yeah.

1185
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:40,200
John Travolta got a personal brainer.

1186
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:44,680
Didn't he have a sex scandal where someone was massaging him or something?

1187
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,680
Yeah, yeah.

1188
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:47,400
He was reaching for their penis.

1189
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,160
Oh, that's cool.

1190
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,800
Sorry, I thought it was a bottle of lotion.

1191

1192
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:53,800
*laughter*

1193
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,300
He's trying to...

1194
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:57,400
Matter just made a fist when he said "reaching for his penis"

1195
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:58,840
Just clenching...

1196
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,840
*laughter*

1197
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,040
Clenching a penis...

1198
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,540
Yeah...

1199
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:04,180
And your fist squishing it like Play-Doh.

1200
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,820

1207
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:14,820
I haven't done anything like that.

1208
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:16,820
Give me your penis!

1209
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,220
I need to do something about this dog so I think I need to know.

1210
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,020
I am junching.

1211
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:22,500
All right well we're pretty we're like at an hour.

1212
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,740
We got 16 minutes to go.

1213
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,140
No we don't we have 40 seconds.

1214
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:27,460
Okay.

1215
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:29,540
16 minutes.

1216
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,540
We got 16 minutes till we hit an hour.

1217
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:33,620
Oh no.

1218
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,540
Just talk for 30 seconds.

1219
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:37,140
Okay the dog's watching tv.

1220
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,820
Guys this is getting worse every second.

1221
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:42,580
Oh my god wait guys he just purchased HBO.

1222
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:43,780
What?

1223
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,580
Shit.

1224
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:45,460
I don't believe you.

1225
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:48,940
I believe me, dude. I'm looking at him.

1226
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,240
I don't believe you.

1227
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,540
I can't show you because I nailed my webcam down.

1228
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:56,140
You nailed your webcam down?

1229
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,340
Why don't you just bring the dog over here?

1230
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,340
Because then you wouldn't see him watching TV.

1231
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:02,940
Or he could watch it from over there.

1232
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:06,340
You are so stupid, man. I'm smarter than you.

1233
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,540
I don't think so.

1234
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:11,640
Every single situation, I'm smarter than you. I'm outwitting you.

1235
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,640
But sorry, I have to go.

1236
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:18,840
Alright, bye. Thanks to y'all. Thank you to all the supporters.

1237
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:24,840
Thank you to all, and to all, a good night.
