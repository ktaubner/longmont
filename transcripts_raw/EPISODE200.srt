episode we've ever done all my god don't say that

9
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,320
Okay, this is the worst episode right now.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,960
This may be our fifth time trying to record this.

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,560
Yep, and it's complete shit already.

12
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
It's already shit.

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,000
It's absolute dog shit.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Guys, we-

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Wait, that's-

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Absolute dog shit.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
That's something.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Keep going.

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's something right there, yeah.

20
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Keep going.

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I, this is how I talk.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,240
I say absolute dog shit.

23
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,240
That's really good.

24
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,240
That could be something.

25
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,360
I got diagnosed with cancer.

26
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:56,400
I got fucking cancer.

27
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,900
I have cancer. Yeah, that's like a good bit.

28
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,900
Cancer? You really have cancer?

29
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,900
Yeah, oh yes. Bowel cancer.

30
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,900
Bowel cancer?

31
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,900
It's funny because they sound like the same bowl.

32
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Bowl, yeah.

33
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,900
What is that? Australian? Those guys are upside-

34
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,900
They got everything upside down.

35
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,900
I don't think that was an Australian accent.

36
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,900
That was closer to a Russian, Turkish kind of...

37
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:21,900
Alright.

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,900
This is the 200th episode. We're really excited to be a part of this.

39
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:35,700
this it's great I'm here with you I know absolutely it's nice there were some

40
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,260
there were some hiccups you know as people may remember last week our

41
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,540
corporate sponsors stepped in and kind of did some stuff to our morning

42
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:49,140
that we were all fuckers listen and I'm completely into the Bible so I saw that

43
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,740
it was Adam and Eve they made us do a bunch of disgusting porn content I had

44
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,620
single thing what kind of this what kind of God made any money from a theist

45
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:03,940
they leftist Democrat would make an a sex store yeah and call it Adam and Eve

46
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:08,460
after the two most biblical fucking people of all that is so sexually wrong

47
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:14,020
it's actually completely just off the rails yeah you know yeah I mean nowadays

48
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:18,180
a store like Adam and Eve they'd they'd probably want to call it Adam and Steve

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,160
Steve or even Madame and Steve, a completely different couple who are

50
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,220
Satanists. Exactly, yeah, a kind of a Wario style reverse world of Adam and

51
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,900
Eve, Madame and Steve. It should be really scary, because Madame is the most

52
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,600
common name for a woman in France. Yeah, it's about as common as Adam is for

53
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,740
men, is Madame. Well, Adam in Turkish means guy.

54
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,700
I think Adam just means guy in every language. Yeah, it does. Yeah. No, like

55
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,040
the direct translation, it's probably like a nom or something, but

56
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,980
word Adam is just isn't that the same in like Hebrew - I think he was a man what

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,020
the word is man well they got French guys named gee you know there's guys have

58
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:01,220
you ever met a guy named guy yeah it's like what's going on no gee you know

59
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:08,380
there's some guys who are guys yeah I know but gee gee Liz you just want to

60
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,940

61
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,860

62
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,780
for no it's not we've had this conversation wait a minute yeah roll the

63
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,060
clip

64
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,540
because we've had this actual conversation we've had that same conversation mean

65
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,860
most extreme that's what you thought that's what it was

66
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:43,940
nope all right find what it look fine what it says we don't I don't think we

67
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,940
I don't think we have that close.

68
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:47,940
I can't believe that.

69
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,940
I can't believe we've had the same fucking conversation.

70
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,940
I mean, I corrected myself once and then never corrected it again.

71
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,940
Wow.

72
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,940
It probably stands for competition that last one.

73
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,940
Yeah, yeah. It's probably like...

74
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:03,940
Most extreme one.

75
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:11,940
The premise of the show is on Spike TV and the premise of the show is that it was like a Japanese game show or something that they overdubbed.

76
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,940
Yeah, no, I know the show.

77
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,940
Yeah.

78
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,940
Yeah.

79
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,940
Yeah.

80
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,940
You knew it!

81
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:17,940
I had stopped calling that.

82
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,100
Well, you said, you said, "From Most Extreme Chinese," and I know the show you're talking

83
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:26,420
about, but why the fuck would I... that's not the name.

84
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,420
Why the fuck would I...

85
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,020
What was it called?

86
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,020
Most Extreme...

87
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,420
I think it was like M3C or something.

88
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,620
Why have we... we've had this exact conversation.

89
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,760
Most Extreme Chinese.

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,860
Look it up.

91
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,460
Don't look up Most Extreme Chinese, though.

92
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,660
No, I'm going to look up most extreme Chinese. I'm curious. Nobody's gonna know

93
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,560
what most extreme elimination.

94
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:54,160
My yeah, because I remember my brother's friend told me it was most extreme.

95
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,360
I was your brother's friend. Yeah, it wasn't just you being a racist child

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,960
racist child at 24. He's a racist child.

97
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,660
Oh my God. Holy if you go.

98
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,260
I googled most extreme Chinese. The show comes really. Yeah.

99
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,420
the top result in a common room most extreme elimination challenge. Oh wow

100
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,340
yeah but listen we're 200 episodes in uh-huh we don't have the same

101
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:26,020
conversation. We don't like to rehash stuff. Yeah we don't like looking back

102
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:30,720
right we want to look forward. Yeah, how are you guys gonna... I guess today we

103
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,780
don't. I guess we're kind of looking back a little bit today though. Yeah yeah I

104
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:38,220
guess we are kind of gonna. I guess we're doing exactly that. Do a journey through the

105
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:42,300
history of the podcast. Maybe a little bit of a... You have your favorite moments, we

106
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,900
have our favorite moments. They're completely different. You guys have

107
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,580
horrible taste. You have terrible taste. Oh yeah, all these clips you guys are making,

108
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,940
not even the choice cuts. First of all, where are the animatics?

109
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,860
So let me show you, let's show you how it's actually done. Where are the animatics? Where are the animaniacs?

110
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,100
Where are the cool clips where like I'm saying something awesome? Exactly, yeah.

111
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:04,700
Where is like, "Patrick says coolest skateboard trick name." Where are the clips where

112
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,660
one of us is actually right about something? Yeah. And it just,

113
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,260
We're just a correct fact.

114
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,060
Or like three guys act like friends.

115
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,260
And what about our singing compilation?

116
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,060
Where is that?

117
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,460
Where's the singing compilation?

118
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,160
We sing so much.

119
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,460
I know, we sing all the time, you know?

120
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,660
Just amazing clips.

121
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,660
I mean, let's do some--

122
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,160
Where's the video of every time we say the word swag?

123
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,860
Yep.

124
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,860
I would like to see that.

125
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,660
That'd be awesome.

126
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,160
But let's go ahead and let's--

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,460
we're basically doing a clip show today.

128
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,460
We are going to do a clip show.

129
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,360
These are the actual good clips.

130
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,860
Yeah.

131
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,860
A little reminiscing.

132
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,960
The ones that we remember.

133
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,920
But guys, do you remember when Patrick showed up in a dress?

134
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,400
This is just something I'm wearing now.

135
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Why are you wearing that?

136
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,120
What are you doing?

137
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,800
It's like a young thug thing.

138
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Why is it?

139
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
It's not a young thug dress.

140
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
It's pink.

141
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,480
It also doesn't even cover your penis and your balls.

142
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
It was a blue dress.

143
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,480
It was a blue dress and it was a boy's shoe.

144
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,080
That was a masculine dress.

145
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Let's be real.

146
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,080
Yeah, because it was blue.

147
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
That was a dress.

148
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,560
You know what a real, you want to talk about a masculine dress, Lady Gaga meat dress.

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
Oh my God.

150
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,560
Now that's a good story.

151
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,800
First of all, why did you come in in that?

152
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,360
I don't know. I don't have the money to buy all that meat.

153
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,360
Where'd you get this?

154
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,360
Why would I fucking...

155
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,160
Okay. I saw this at the store.

156
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,160
Which store?

157
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,960
Uh, the L Train Vintage.

158
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,080
You bought that at L Train... you bought that at a vintage store?

159
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,080
Yes.

160
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,080
What are the brown stains...

161
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,080
It was only...

162
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,960
Pat, what are the brown stains on the back of it?

163
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,120
It was only six dollars.

164
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,180
Pat, I'm 90% sure that's a pillowcase.

165
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:34,640
And it was only six dollars and I turned it into a dress. Why is this...

166
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,720
It's a pillowcase with poop stains on the back of it.

167
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,800
As if someone was already wearing it like a dress, and then they pooped into it.

168
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
And you bought that.

169
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
It's like somebody was- And came to work in it.

170
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,400
But it's only six dollars.

171
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,080
It's fucking- Oh my god, it smells like complete fucking shit.

172
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,240
You just shifted your leg and the smell of shit just wafted over here.

173
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
Wait, that's not from the dress, it came from your legs.

174
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,160
Did you shit your own dress?

175
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,220
It's running down your leg onto the floor.

176
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,440
It's running- I think- No, no, this is part of the dress.

177
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,480
- That's not part - It's covering your entire body.

178
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,320
- Yeah.

179
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,360
- That's kind of impressive actually.

180
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,400
Who designed that?

181
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,720
- Jeffrey Tambor.

182
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,120
- See like moments like that, like that was,

183
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,280
I mean that was as fun as a moment can possibly be.

184
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,040
- Yeah, that was in the dark 31 or whatever.

185
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,880
- Yeah.

186
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,880
- I mean and that's one that you guys have never heard.

187
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,640
- The thing about that one too is you know,

188
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,760
I know a lot of people, they say we're too harsh on Pat,

189
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,360
we're too mean to him, and that one,

190
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,920
you know you can kind of hear it in that.

191
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,840
We're being a little mean.

192
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:40,000
There have been times when we when you know Pat was was um was kind of the shining star and really stood out

193
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,760
Do you guys remember when when Patrick won an award?

194
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:50,040
Fuck you, man. Fuckin idiot. Fuck you. And anybody but you deserve that shit. You are such a fucking idiot, man.

195
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,720

196
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,220
There's brown shit dripping down your award.

197
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,440

205
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:47,760

206
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
I mean you can actually 21 it's pretty easy

207
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,760
I got kovat pretty much every time that there was a Santa Con

208
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,540
I mean Santa comes fucking crazy you guys bringing up Santa Conor but just

209
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,780
reminded me of something that we did on the show before the episode where we met

210
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:07,440
Santa oh my god

211
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,680
Santa Santa do the head spin do a head spin

212
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,680
Yeah! He's doing the head spin!

213
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Woah, woah, woah

214
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,680
Santa you sound exactly like talking Ben

215
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
Yes

216
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,680
I wish Caleb would get out of the bathroom to see this

217
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,680
Oh my god, well Caleb was not, was Caleb naughty or nice this year?

218
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,680
Guys I'm coming back from the bathroom

219
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,680
You better hurry up Caleb, Santa's right here

220
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,680
No

221
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,520
Oh my god Santa just where the fuck is Santa you went up the chimney. Yeah, okay

222
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,280
This is officially the day I stopped believing in Santa Claus

223
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,040
Yeah, that's the day say Caleb stopped believing in Santa. I don't really like relitigating stuff like that

224
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,920
Yeah, I like that was honestly one of the worst days my fucking life

225
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,760
Yeah, you did we were crying a lot yep, and there was white hairs all over the floor

226
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,300
You try to get the hairs DNA tested to prove to us that that wasn't a real Santa

227
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:09,740
But I tried to get 100% completely Santa yeah every time that you would send the hairs to 23andme

228
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,880
They would send you back just a candy cane. I tried fucking that's like

229
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,920
Didn't work

230
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,540
Yeah, yeah, it's a promotion 23andme has though if you get one of Santa's beard hairs

231
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,600
You can send to them for it is it's so embarrassing when people wear a black shirt on on Christmas morning

232
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,640
You can see the Santa hair all over it. Absolutely a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, he got on your lap while you were asleep

233
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,760
asleep. He doesn't have some foresight where white can you imagine being

234
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,040
allergic to Santa hair how fucking brutal that must be or the I mean I

235
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,960
don't dander as much where I hear the hairless Santa's actually really yeah,

236
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,920
they have a lot of dander speaking of dander yeah remember that episode with

237
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,720

265
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,600

That also he's also your nephews, your stepson and nephew, so

267
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,900

Yeah, that had a crazy ending.

286
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,860
that was one of the craziest days of that was I didn't realize that you could

287
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:26,760
just tell cops. I don't I don't know if you like that you yeah and they're like

288
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,020

292
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,500
parents. I was coming up with that name. Yeah, yeah, it's impossible to come up

293
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,600
up with that on a spot yeah. Do you guys remember that episode we recorded

294
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,320
underwater

295
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,320
actually talk pretty normal underwater

296
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:05,620
pretty good thing to have is a good skill set. I can talk underwater. I

297
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,020
think I might have been part atlantean another life.

298
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:15,720

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:36,880
first question I asked me I was allergic to milk all right um do you what do you

335
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,880

338
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:59,360
scooby-doo moment unmasking that scuba scuba do my God ever yeah let's do a

339
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,360
a dweiber a dweiber yeah yeah

340
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,360
taxi dweiber. What ever happened to the Jeff Dander guy?

341
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,360
I think he was a, I think if I remember correctly he was a pedophile

342
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,360
Jeff Dander was a convicted pedophile. I think, well I think they were trying to convict him

343
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,360
that's why the cops kept shooting him. Yeah and we unwittingly were kind of harboring him

344
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,360
and that's why we had to do that episode from jail.

345
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Alright guys so you all gotta walk up to the biggest

346
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,360
guy in the entire jail and you gotta punch him directly in the face.

347
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,160
on the face camera come here I heard you're supposed to go to the come here

348
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:37,680
camera clear what dude I'm following the rules for orange or black out fuck

349
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,880
well I'm just trying to follow the rules I got you both myself I thought I was

350
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,960
the biggest guy you know you're not the biggest guy okay I'm the biggest guy oh

351
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,960
fuck guys why are we hitting each other the biggest guy is clearly the Hulk all

352
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,960
right we got to find the Hulk the green Hulk he's literally right across the

353
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,680
hall okay we're Patrick go punch the Hulk right now that's what you're supposed

354
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:04,560
to do in prison you're supposed to find the greenest Hulk and punch them and

355
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:09,120
he's dead remember the craziest part about that clip is that you killed the

356
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,880
Hulk with a single punch yeah that was crazy I've never seen hit him right on

357
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,080
the button you ever seen that documentary that I was in jail for a

358
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:23,080
reason I heard the the Hulk was in jail for a bad reason - yeah yeah I'm guessing

359
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,560
I was in jail because I have a very hard punch.

360
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
I think the Hulk was in jail for that.

361
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,840
I can punch pretty much anybody and they'll die immediately.

362
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,680
Did you ever see that video where the Hulk he fucks Black Widow?

363
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,680
Roll the clip.

364
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,260
(upbeat music)

365
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,980
(grunting)

366
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,320
(screaming)

367
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,260
- Gamma wave!

368
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,620
(grunting)

369
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
Gamma crush!

370
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,700
Smash you!

371
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,640
- Yeah, and then she died from that, actually.

372
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,700
- She dies from his big hole penis?

373
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,540
- It's gamma radiation.

374
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,460
- Okay, does the Hulk have a normal dick?

375
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,060
- Why, what is, why does he need--

376
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,400
- Does his dick grow with him,

377
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,780
or does his dick stay the same?

378
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,320
ears get bigger also why is he's here's what if his penis does grow what's the

379
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,700
reason here's what here's what I'll say I think that his penis stays small

380
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,740
because otherwise they would not put that much effort into finding completely

381
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,500
indestructible shorts that's true if he had a big giant penis he would be

382
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,620
flaunting let it fly but also yeah probably not these rescuing kids and

383
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,860
stuff that's a good point that's why the Hulk was in jail the Hulk's a bad guy

384
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,780
right am I stupid the Hulk is a green guy he's a green Lee big bad league guy

385
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,780
yeah bad to be green you guys remember that episode we did when we all turned

386
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:49,540
green I feel very bad oh my god we're all seriously green I'm trying to speak

387
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,660
like an alien green I just it just doesn't feel you don't look very good

388
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:01,380
green well that's not an alien - yep we earned yep we ate green berries yes we

389
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,380
Green

390
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,780
Green berries

391
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:08,180
Audience

392
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,460
They don't need to know it's an audio. I'm completely green from all the green berries. I feel too green

393
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,100
I'm not liking the amount of green. Okay. Let's all eat white berries

394
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:25,740
Yeah, and then we discovered that white berries turn you white yeah, yeah, yeah, I just ate a blackberry

395
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,980
Okay, that's a normal berry. It doesn't do anything to you.

396
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,980
Yeah, it didn't do anything to me.

397
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,980
I was just hungry.

398
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,980
What's your favorite berry?

399
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,980
Strawberry for me.

400
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,980
Really? Strawberry number one.

401
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,980
I've never even seen a boysenberry.

402
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,980
I've only seen the boysenberry syrup at IHOP.

403
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,980
Yeah, that's good.

404
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,980
It's the only time I've ever had a boysenberry.

405
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,980
I think the boysenberries and blackberries

406
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,980
may be the same.

407
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,980
That's not true.

408
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Boysenberry is like a crossbreed, I think.

409
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,100
think of really different berries. I think I could be thinking of a

410
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,980
different berry. Actually, I'm looking up boys and berry boys and it's a cross

411
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,800
between a blackberry and a dewberry and a loganberry. Oh, is it actually

412
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:15,200
red? Yeah, red boys and berry. Yeah, it's like a boys and colors just like

413
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,420
our it just looks like a blackberry. Yeah, it's like a mixture. Oh, but it

414
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,800
was named after rudolph boysen. What's a mixture a mixture of berry

415
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,980
it raspberry and blackberry you just said oh wow okay so the blackberry dewberry

416
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,780
and what's a dewberry so the okay part of a boysenberry dewberry so the route

417
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:39,940
Rudolph boysen obtained the dewberry loganberry parent from the farm of farm

418
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:45,140
of John Loving parent and then George Darrow of the USDA began tracking down

419
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,940
reports of a large reddish purple berry reports on poison spawn it to track down

420
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,980
reports of a berry yeah like Bigfoot and then Darrow enlisted the help of

421
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:01,440
just an example any guy coming back speaking of Walter not very Walter not

422
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,940
Walter not owner of knots berry farm swallowing of which remember that

423
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,820
episode when we went to knots berry farm

424
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:17,660
okay the line is not that fun guys but it's not as bad as I was making it out

425
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,020
to be either. Yeah, I don't know any of these rides names. Me neither. I've never

426
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:28,020
been. This is my first time here. What it's a there's I see roller coasters.

427
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:34,380
Yes, you do see roller coasters. I see do I see characters? Yes, you see walk around

428
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:40,100
peanuts characters. Charlie Brown. Okay. I wonder why it's called Knot's Berry Farm.

429
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:46,140
I wonder what who this Knot guy is. One day I hope to find out. Me too. But yeah

430
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,800
That was such a fun trip. We did that, we did Disney, we did Universal, all in like

431
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:56,700
kind of one fell swoop, you know. Yeah. We need to go on more trips. Oh my God.

432
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,660
Do you remember that trip we went on to... No. Yeah, me neither. To which, to where?

433
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:07,180
Come on. The moon. I don't remember that. I don't think we went to the moon. Yeah, I

434
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,540
don't think we did either. But we did go to medieval ages Europe. That was a medieval

435
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:16,340
times in a time machine. No, no, you're thinking of a different time.

436
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,740
You were confused then too. I do remember that. Remember when Patrick was

437
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,140
confused? Yeah. Is this medieval times the restaurant? It is. No,

438
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,940
it's medieval times the times. Listen, we need to go find, I think,

439
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,340
a witch. Is that what we try to find? All I know, all I remember

440
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:37,240
is that we got in this time machine, we got out, and a guy

441
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,540
with a funny haircut ran away with it. I'm kind of liking being

442
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:45,340
peasant though. Yeah the smell here is really nice. Right? Patrick... I could punch

443
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:50,340
anybody here and I won't get in trouble. I don't think that's true. I think that's even less

444
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,780
true than where we... Well you're onto something. And I won't get in trouble.

445
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,780
Let's think about what we remember about medieval times. I think you're supposed

446
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:02,540
to go up to the biggest guy in medieval times and punch him right in the face.

447
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,260
Yeah I heard that that's something that you can do. Patrick go punch that horse.

448
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:16,500
okay I don't think I don't think that helped anything yeah I don't think that

449
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,140
my news that's okay yeah that's fine kick my tooth there's no dentist in this

450
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,800
time we'll go to a with a fat lip to listen to me it sounds weird I can

451
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,780
completely hear the fat lip oh yeah Jesus Christ I I just had an idea

452
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,780
time travel, fat lip, let's write a hit song.

453
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:38,780
Somebody give me a lute.

454
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,780
Wait, I think I just had an incredible idea for a song guys.

455
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:46,780
Let's travel forward, oh I don't know, maybe

456
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:50,780
600 years, write a song, give it to

457
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,780
some weird looking guys, and then maybe we'll become

458
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:58,780
famous. Yeah, but that didn't work at all it turns out.

459
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,040
know it turns out they are no why we would thought it would work to give it

460
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:05,660
to other the other guys got famous and they already wrote this song before us

461
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:09,020
yeah because like that's who we got it from yeah you know like it was just

462
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,460
pretty stupid it will and it didn't make any time travels very confusing the

463
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,180
fact that we got the way that we got back from time travel it's just too

464
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,780
boring to even get into yeah right it's just a lot of yeah science remember how

465
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,540
boring it was

466
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,780
oh my god

467
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,460
shut up i'm just trying okay the red wire connects to the red wire

468
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
Yeah, my lips just got even bigger from the swelling.

469
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,660
The green wire connects to the green wire.

470
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,660
Hmm, what do I know about science?

471
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
The blue wire connects to the light blue wire.

472
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,660
Does anybody know anything about ice packs for my lip?

473
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,660
They haven't invented ice yet, you fucking idiot.

474
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,660
The yellow wire connects to the yellow wire.

475
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,660
Okay, now I have to type in the code.

476
00:26:45,660 --> 00:27:11,660
One, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one,

477
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,660
one,

478
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:13,660
two,

479
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,660
one,

480
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,660
one,

481
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,660
one,

482
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:25,260
but yeah that was the wrong code. It turns out yeah, yeah, work it on to

483
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:29,140
three. Yeah, the easiest code ever yeah anyway. That was boring. It was really

484
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:32,700
boring, probably one of the most boring things that we ever did on on the show.

485
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:38,380
Yeah, are people going to be mad that we're doing a clip show people do tend

486
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,940
a bitch about clip shows, but I think it's I mean I think I feel like you know people

487
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,620
they post their own clips like we said they suck ass they're horrible yeah. We need to

488
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,300
set things straight you know yeah people these clips people are posting are not funny, but

489
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,900
we've had some serious funny moments that people don't even don't even care about and

490
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,220
it's like it's like to these people these moments never even happened. I know it's as

491

496
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,060
How many dogs like this?

497
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:20,060
No!

498
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,060
That's awesome!

499
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,060
He's kind of got a third gangsta thing to him.

500
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:26,060
That's so awesome.

501
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:28,060
He's holding an acorn sideways.

00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
Where my motherfucking nuts at?

503
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,060
A hat backwards?

504
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,060
Maybe not a hat because he's a squirrel.

505
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,060
They don't make a squirrel hat that small.

506
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:38,060
Oh my god his tree is in the...

507
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,060
His tree is backwards.

508
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,060
His tree has a...

509
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,400
Yo Stevie, Stevie!

510
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,280
His tree's a low-riding tree.

511
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:46,280
No!

512
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,980
That's funny as fuck, man.

513
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,980
That's like a bush.

514
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
He lives in a bush!

515
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Yeah!

516
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,180
Oh my god, that's so fucking good.

517
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Dude!

518
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,740
Oh my god, and he has tattoos all over his body.

519
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,220
Yeah, Stevie the Squirrel, that's gotta be one of our best.

520
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,500
Like, it's just like character shit.

521
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,820
I just like doing character shit like that.

522
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
No, I mean, I-

523
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,300
I'm like, completely like Paul F. Tompkins, Lorne Lapkus style.

524
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:11,820
One of my favorite clips that I feel like I haven't seen anybody post, one of the bits

525
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:15,740
that we did is was a McDonald's in the morning. I'm just going to roll that

526
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,100
really quick. Just roll it. You know when you like go to McDonald's, it's like

527
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,820
it's too early for this shit. Yeah. Oh my God. What I have to get up. What is it a

528
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,140
McGriddle? Yeah, I want to I want to make burger man, bro. They stop serving

529
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:32,140
breakfast at like not until like noon or some shit. Yeah, it's like oh my God. I

530
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:36,140
don't want this breakfast. I fucking hate eggs. First of all, that's nasty.

531
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,340
That's that's chicken poop, bro. I don't want that bullshit. It's like oh my God.

532
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:42,620
I wish I was at home asleep instead of a McDonald's at the morning. That's right.

533
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,380
Just let me sleep in. It's too damn early for this shit, bro. Are you really a

534
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,060
McDonald's? Are you really doing this this early? Why do I have to be in here?

535
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:54,280
Okay? Yep. My life is seriously fucking shit. I love McDonald's. I don't know

536
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:57,260
why everybody's making fun of it. Not at breakfast, though, because breakfast is

537
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,460
like, bro, where are the fries? It's like, yeah, I don't want a pancake. It's

538
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,060
true. Yeah, every time that I get breakfast, I do want some damn fries.

539
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:12,740
Yeah, I'm like it's too early for this shit. Ronald bro. I call you every day. It's too fucking early. Okay. Yeah

540
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:22,140
McDonald's early I'm like the early the early bird gets the crap meal. That's right. The early bird gets the fucking stupid McGriddles. Yeah

541
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,180
early for that

542
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,560
So that like coffee bro, I'm not trying to be awake

543
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,740
Early to be awake. I want to be eating a burger in my sleep.

544
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,580
Exactly. I can't eat a burger in my sleep, bro. I want to be awake on the later part of the day,

545
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,420
and it's too early. If I'm awake early, I'll have to go to sleep late.

546
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:48,340
Makes no fucking sense, McDonald's. I can't believe I decided to go

547
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:55,220
McDonald's in the morning. And also, a lot of your fucking employees are actually fucking stupid,

548
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:59,460
especially the early shift. Yeah, it's like early bird gets the worm. No,

549
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,260
More like the early bird gets shit. Yeah, it's like I said that

550
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:11,420
Completely said that sorry I was in line at McDonald's right McDonald's right now is in line. Yeah, and it's basically fucking

551
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:18,240
You get here and in the morning in the early and all of the the entire staff is completely asleep

552
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,060
It's like what did I walk into a hotel the other because I'm you guys that's the only place that someone should be sleeping

553
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,660
Oh wait, so they're basically fucking they it's called the graveyard shift that goes into the early morning

554
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,900
I wish that the people who worked it were in a graveyard. I wish they were fucking dead.

555
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:32,860
Absolutely.

556
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,860
Anyway, McDonald's, you funky AF.

557
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:41,500
But do you guys remember that Halloween episode when we all showed up in the same costume by accident?

558
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,940
Oh, I remember.

559
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,500
Fuck me.

560
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,700
Why certainly.

561
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,580
Why I oughta.

562
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,220
Why certainly.

563
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,540
Why certainly.

564
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:57,420
I told you guys I was gonna do this. I told you guys I was gonna wear this.

565
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,400
Three stooges, but I thought that it was pretty obvious who was who

566
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:07,080
How is it obvious? I'm listen if anybody's curly it's gonna be me

567
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:21,020
Oh my god, I'm sorry

568
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:31,040
Took so long to put on this fucking bald cap. Yeah, me too. Telling me I shaved my entire head. Yeah me too

569
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,100
That was like the worst Halloween we ever fucking had yeah

570
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:39,400
No, it's gonna get the same the next year. We did the same thing again the next year

571
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,400
Yeah, I think we have a clip of that as well

572
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,880
All right, three shamps. I don't even know what he sounds like

573
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:53,480
Bet that neither of you guys would do champ. What the fuck does he sound I was just why don't we just why don't we just

574
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
Coordinate why do we all just we?

575
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:03,440
Be a Halloween's always been a contentious time for us. I feel we do I mean we did again the next year

576
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I remember the same thing

577
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,740
Okay, so three spongebobs

578
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:15,480

00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,460
Okay, fine fine, then I'll be spongebob when he pretends to be Squidward that one day hi guys

580
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,840
It's me. It's doesn't feel right. You can't have two spongebobs and one Squidward

581
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:34,980
We just heard fucking we just don't do Halloween well, yeah Halloween is never really great not good for us no yeah

582
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,800
You know it was a Thanksgiving though. Thanks giving that we're no Thanksgiving episode remember when we all had dinner together

583
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:47,340
Mm-hmm, and we were eating guys, but there was that one Thanksgiving. Let's just roll the clip

584
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,340
- Bless us, oh Lord, for these thy gifts.

585
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,940
- Guys, are you fucking serious?

586
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:52,980
- I'm doing grace!

587
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,540
I am doing grace!

588
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,860
- I said I was gonna dress up like a turkey.

589
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:00,580
All three of us dressed up like a turkey?

590
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,140
Yeah, I know what a turkey sounds like.

591
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,260
- I was breaking the turkey character for a second.

592
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,580
I was doing grace.

593
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,980
How are we gonna eat?

594
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,860
- I thought I was being so stupid

595
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,860
by dressing up like a turkey on Thanksgiving,

596
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,500
and both of you also dressed up like turkeys.

597
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,820
- Couple, couple, couple.

598
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,660
And he won't even stop doing the gobbling, he hasn't said fucking anything.

599
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,860
That might be an actual turkey, actually.

600
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,260
My whole family's in the other room right now.

601
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:27,780
They made us go into the other room because we were all yelling too much.

602
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:31,060
Because we were all fighting about this turkey bullshit.

603
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
Cameron won't even break the character.

604
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,140
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

605
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,220
That's not Cameron.

606
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,520
Wait.

607
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,700
That's a real turkey.

608
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,520
Real-

609
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,700
Well, no, Cameron's always been like two feet tall.

610
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,200
No.

611
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,060
I don't know who Cameron is.

612
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,060
Oh my god, wait, check the oven!

613
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:51,200

615
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,880

616
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,160

618
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,360

for like a couple weeks to me i was good 'cause i call it the beast you guys

620
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,880

621
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,300
when my skin was like it was all roasted crackly all you guys eat my skin you

622
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,080
and you said it's even better than chicken or turkey skin. It was really

623
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,140
really good yeah. We should do that again, so and then it grew back. It did

624
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,300
all the skin grew back. That's when we learned that you had a lizard ability.

625
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:28,620
Yeah, if something gets cut off of you that puppies growing right back.

626
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:33,600
Remember when we found out we all had super powers of different kinds

627
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:43,060
oh man, I just did. I'm not feeling so good bro. I got bit by by some kind of

628
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:50,680
like glowing green dog yesterday and now I'm not feeling so good. I have

629
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:56,940
superpowers mind control sex and now it's even better actually today, because

630
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,200
I want to have sex with Cameron Cameron come over here.

631
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,500
Oh, no, that dog's coming out of me. Oh, no, your penis wait, it's growing

632
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,800
back. Yeah, it sure is my superpower

633
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,480
being an uncle.

634
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,200
Shut up dude, that's not a superpower.

635
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Okay, then I...

636
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,040
Mind control, kill yourself!

637
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
Just joking.

638
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,240
Mind control, just kidding.

639
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,240
Mind control, just kidding.

640
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,240
Mind control, just kidding!

641
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,920
And I was left in a completely catatonic state.

642
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,300
He was in a coma.

643
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:32,240
Some people think you still are completely catatonic in a way.

644
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
In what way?

645
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,800
They think that these words that come out of your mouth are kind of the death rattle.

646
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Yeah?

647
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
Yeah.

648
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,800
I think I've been dying for...

649
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,040
Like maybe you've just been already kind of just...

650
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,040
You're pretty...

651
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
Like 99% close to death.

652
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:49,120
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense because I got all these IV tubes hooked up to me all the time. Yeah

653
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,480
Yeah, remember when we got poison ivy

654
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,280
I

655
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:04,260
Can't even see my eyes are so puffy ever doing urban exploration again guys. Why is it just on my wiener?

656
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,740
Ow fuck cuz you didn't come on the on the trip remember

657
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,420
Why is my wiener red and itchy? I think I got your poison ivy. You and Patrick hung out after we got back

658
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,920
How am I so bloated?

659
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,400
I'm so bloated from all the poison ivy

660
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:25,160
Spreading all the pus is spreading to my eyes.

661
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,560
I can't see a fucking thing

662
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I can't see anything

663
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,440
There's too much. I don't even know I'm so allergic to poison ivy

664
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,680
It sucks.

665
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,300
It sucks so much.

666
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,260
I hate Poison Ivy.

667
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,140
I hate it so much.

668
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,220
Yeah, that was awful.

669
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,300
That was terrible.

670
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,720
I didn't have Poison Ivy, I actually just had a stomach cramp.

671
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:55,480
Yeah, I remember that.

672
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,140
Yeah, that clip is good, but...

673
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,980
I don't know.

674
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:02,520
I feel like everybody forgets the episode that we got a soundboard.

675
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,020
The soundboard episode was fire.

676
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,560
Let's play a clip from that right now.

677
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,100
And then I said to that bitch, "Bitch, get a new house."

678
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,100
Yeah, that's right. I like the soundboard.

679
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,100
Soundboard's working.

680
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
You guys like the soundboard?

681
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Yeah, I really like it. It's cool.

682
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,100
Do you have any other sounds on there?

683
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:20,100
One second, let me see.

684
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,100
Okay, so there's that.

685
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:22,100
It's the same one.

686
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,100
It's the same one as before.

687
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,100
I feel like I gotta say another bro moment.

688
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
Yeah, I know, because now it's just...

689
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Alright, stop clicking.

690
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,100
And that's when I told him, "Get the fuck out of Chi-Rac. That's my neighborhood."

691
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,300
Yeah, sorry, I'm like so distracted, he keeps playing the same sound effect.

692
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
What's going on Cam?

693
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
What are you doing?

694
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,300
I'm trying to figure out if there's another sound here.

695
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Wait.

696
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,900
Did you only put bro sound 2 on there?

697
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:48,700
I don't know what's happening, I'm trying to play, hold on, wait.

698
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,500
Guys something's going on with the sound.

699
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,180
Yeah, clearly something's going on.

700
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,060
Now we have to come up with like a million more bro moments.

701
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,500
Can you guys just, yeah, just hold on, I'm just trying to figure it out, just keep talking.

702
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,820
And then I said, I said fuck you.

703
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,680
And then I said pay for popcorn not at my movie theater

704
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:09,760
Okay, it doesn't make any sense. No. It's not like even live up to and then I ordered a sandwich

705
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,820
And I said and no mustard or mayo dude. Can you turn that shit off?

706
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:19,820
We just do a normal I'm trying to turn it around where it's like it's guiding us into bad conversation

707
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,380
It's fucking shit. Do I say some breast?

708
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:30,340

711
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:46,940
No, and then and then I said chef Gordon Ramsay is the best food. I've ever had chef Gordon Ramsay

712
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:52,580
And then and I said it's not called Frankenstein. It's called Frankenstein's a monster

713
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:55,020
Okay, bro

714
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,460
Now I'm doing it, bruh.

715
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,260
Fuck, now I'm saying just "bruh", dude.

716
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,260
It doesn't make any sense.

717
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,760
It's too much bruh stuff!

718
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,160
It won't stop!

719
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,560
And then I said, "I can't even swim!"

720
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,060
Oh wait, that's one...

721
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
That's a new sound!

722
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:13,560
I don't know what's going on, guys.

723
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,560
It's a new sound!

724
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,060
Alright, I can't do this shit anymore.

725
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,060
I'm leaving.

726
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,060
I'm fucking leaving.

727
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,060
I'm done.

728
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,060
I'm done.

729
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,060
I'm done.

730
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:50,100
[Bruh moment]

731
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:55,020
just become a bro moment. Yeah, talk about a bro moment. I know, I felt so bad. That

732
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,380
soundboard cost so much money and it broke the first time I tried to use it.

733
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:02,900
That's, I mean, that's what you get for buying a used soundboard. I guess so, yeah. It was already

734
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,100
pre-programmed to do that. Yeah, it was probably, I think it got hacked.

735
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,340
Yeah, it must have. It's probably that link I clicked on on Instagram. Yeah, those hackers are

736
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:15,540
really, really good at getting into our shit. Remember that episode when they

737
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:19,260
They tried to make an episode as us, but it wasn't us.

738
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,260
It was actually them.

739
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,260
Oh, the hacked episode.

740
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,260
Yeah.

741
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,460
It was actually the hackers who hacked the show to be them, but it was a different thing.

742
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:28,060
I remember they were hacking us to impersonate us.

743
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,460
I do remember that episode.

744
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:31,940
There was a crazy- there was a crazy-ass clip from that one.

745
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
There was.

746
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,940
Let's play it.

747
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
Let's play it right now.

748
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,940
I'm Patrick.

749
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,940

751
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
I'm Cameron.

752
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:39,940
I'm Patrick.

753
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:40,940
And I'm Cameron.

754
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
I'm Cameron.

755
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
No, I'm Caleb.

756
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,940
No, wait.

757
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
You guys are-

I'll just, maybe we'll do no password.

765
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,160
Oh, okay.

766
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,760
- Maybe, oh.

767
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,980
- I'm Patrick.

768
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,720
- Wait, is somebody in the office?

769
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,560
What the fuck?

770
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,400
- Oh, no.

771
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,260
- Oh, God, we have to get out of here.

772
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,780
- Guys, let's open up the door.

773
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,140
- It's my favorite funny comedians that I hacked

774
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,760
because I love them so much.

775
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,660
- Are you mad at us?

776
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:38,340
- Yeah, I don't know what you're doing.

777
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,120
- What is your name?

778
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,960
- My name?

779
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,900
- I'm Patrick.

780
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:42,740
- I'm Pablo.

781
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,180
- You're Patrick?

782
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:48,820
I'm Pablo. I'm Consuela from Family Guy and I'm cleaning the office. I'm Pablo and I've

783
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,460
hacked the whole show.

784
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,420
Great, a fucking hacker hacked us, awesome.

785
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,820
Yep, do you like that?

786
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:57,340
No.

787
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,300
Okay, I'm sorry.

788
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:00,900
I won't do it again.

789
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:04,300
So now remembering, now that we listen to that, I'm remembering that's probably one of the

790
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:08,340
worst clips of all time. Yeah, that was the worst. It seems like every clip that we've shown.

791
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,300
I don't know why we released that.

792
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,300
That was like a, there was like a police investigation and stuff.

793
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,300
Yeah, yeah.

794
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,220
That was like, we should not have put that out.

795
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:23,940
It seems like every clip that we've shown so far has just been...

796
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:24,940
Funny as fuck, yeah.

797
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:25,940
Funny as hell.

798
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,100
But why are we doing these like kind of, like let's not sway into these kind of banal moments

799
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,700
like three hackers hacking us that didn't really make any sense.

800
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:36,620
What about like, do you guys remember the time when I was like in this whole battle

801
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:40,660
with Batman and I was like walking down the street like shooting at the ground

802
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,820
and saying hit me I do remember that let's play that clip yeah

803
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,080
(gunshots)

804
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:16,680
Holy shit dude I used to be a fucking badass.

805
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:19,020
That was a sick ass clip.

806
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,640
I'm gonna stop taking my medication again.

807
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,680
That shit is holding me back.

808
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,100
We need to get back to the golden age.

809
00:44:24,100 --> 00:44:24,800
Back when it was like that.

810
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,640
That was what like episode like 60 right?

811
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,140
Yeah episode 60 the one where I came in

812
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,100
and I gave you guys incentives to sell more.

813
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,280
Oh yeah.

814
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,480
I do remember that.

815
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,320
Let's play it.

816
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:41,620
Did they get the picture?

817
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,660
You laughing now?

818
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:50,660
You got leads. Mitch and Murray paid good money. Get their names to sell them.

819
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:55,660
You can't close the leads you're given. You can't close shit. You are shit!

820
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:58,660
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it, 'cause you are going out!

821
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,660
- The leads are weak. - The leads are weak.

822
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:05,660
Fucking leads are weak. You are weak.

823
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:08,660
- I've been in this business 15 years. - What's your name?

824
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,660
Fuck you! That's my name! You know why, mister?

825
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:25,220
you drove a Hyundai to get here tonight, I drove an $80,000 BMW. That's my name. And

826
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:31,140
your name is your wanting. And you can't play in the man's game, you can't close them, and

827
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:38,020
go home and tell your wife your troubles. Because only one thing counts in this life.

828
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:44,860
them to sign on the line which is dotted. You hear me you fucking faggots?

829
00:45:44,860 --> 00:46:04,980
A B C. A always B B C closing. Always be closing. Always be closing. A I D A.

830
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,980
A.I.D.A. Attention, Interest, Decision, Action.

831
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:10,980
Attention. Do I have your attention?

832
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,980
Interest. Are you interested? I know you are, 'cause it's fuck or walk.

833
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,980
You close or you hit the bricks.

834
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:21,980
Decision. Have you made your decision for Christ?

835
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,980
And action.

836
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,980
A.I.D.A. Get out there. You got the prospects coming in.

837
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:30,980
You think they came in to get out of the rain?

838
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:33,980
A guy don't walk on the lot lest he wants to buy.

839
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:40,980
out there waiting to give you their money. Are you gonna take it? Are you man enough

840
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,980
to take it?

841
00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:50,980
I'll tell you what man, you sure have a fucking way with words.

842
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:51,980
Okay.

843
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,780
Yeah, that was, that I, I did, before that I didn't really want to do the podcast anymore.

844
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:01,420
I was feeling, I was feeling bad, I was feeling down and then I just like, something clicked

845
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:07,420
inside me. That's right. And I think I, did I kill somebody or? I think you killed somebody.

846
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:11,420
Did anybody get killing somebody in that? No, I think you did kill somebody. Or I think

847
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:16,300
I maybe killed myself. It's been a long time since I've listened to that, I listened to

848
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,540
that episode one time in a class in college and I don't remember what happened in that

849
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:25,580
episode. That makes sense. Do you guys remember when Cameron, when we got, he was on Conan,

850
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,020
that was fucking huge. Oh yeah. He was on Conan but then he pranked Conan by playing the Mac

851
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,380
Yeah, show the clip. Oh my god.

852
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,580
That was just funny as fuck.

853
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,580
But this is between Kencroft and Gladys,

854
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,900
and this is from our podcast.

855
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,300
Or our audible podcast.

856
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,740
Oh, for Christ's sake.

857
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,740
Harry!

858
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,740
Why?

859
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:50,780
Why?

860
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,980
You can't do this on a pod-

861
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,820
There he goes.

862
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,100
Wheelchair.

863
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,300
You can't do that on a podcast.

864
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,140
That's why I didn't see it coming.

865
00:47:59,140 --> 00:47:59,980
- Right.

866
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,340
- You can't do that on a podcast.

867
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,900
It's a visual joke.

868
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,740
- I know.

869
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:06,060
- I swear to God, how could I?

870
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:06,900
Well, that was.

871
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:08,260
(laughing)

872
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,340
- No, it's never.

873
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,940
- It's an audio medium.

874
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:12,500
- I know, would it work that way?

875
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:13,340
(laughing)

876
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:14,180
- I don't know.

877
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,260
- Was there any truth to anything you said in the setup?

878
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:18,100
- No.

879
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,900
- What great times we've had on this show.

880
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:21,180
- Just good memories, bro.

881
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:23,580
Just straight up good memories, you know?

882
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,900
We've been through it all.

883
00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:26,860
- Do you guys remember when I was Buzz Lightyear

884
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,860
talking to my friend Woody. I completely remember. Play the clip.

885
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:40,500
You are a toy! You weren't the real Buzz Lightyear, you're an action figure! You are a child's

886
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,180
play thing! You are a sad, strange little man.

887
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:51,700
Do you guys remember when we did that, when we opened up that restaurant? Then Gordon

888
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,980
Ramsey came in. Oh yeah, Gordon Ramsey came in. Yeah, I do

889
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:56,420
I think we got a clip from that.

890
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:01,540
You do the cheese in the middle, you seal the beef, and then you do the cheese on the top.

891
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:03,460
That's what the ultimate cheeseburger is.

892
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:08,900
Do you guys remember when that fucking speech impediment hunter was trying to find me in

893
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,900
the woods?

894
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:11,660
Oh my god, I do remember that.

895
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:12,660
Shit was annoying.

896
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,660
Play the clip!

897
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:18,940
Kill the wabbit, kill the wabbit, kill the wabbit!

898
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,940
Oh that reminded me of another- do you guys remember that awesome ass fight scene from

899
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:23,940
John Wick?

900
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:26,180
(gunshots)

901
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,900
- That one's awesome.

902
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,380
- Yeah, that's one of the best ones.

903
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:34,580
- That shit was badass, bro.

904
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:35,940
- Yeah, it was fucking fire.

905
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:37,540
I was like jacking off in the theater.

906
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,340
- Do you guys remember that song that was like,

907
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:41,820
♪ I'm blue, da ba dee da ba da ♪

908
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,660

00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:43,500
- Roll to play it.

910
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:47,220
♪ I have a girlfriend and she is so blue ♪

911
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:48,700
- See, that's gotta be one of my favorite moments

912
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:49,540
from the podcast.

913
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:50,360

I guess that's probably- we rolled a lot of clips today.

966
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,480
Oh, but the one final clip.

967
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:08,480
Okay, yeah, before we hit the final clip though, I mean, yeah, just don't- don't- don't rush it here.
