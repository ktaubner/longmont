00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,000
happened recently I think belongs to Caleb okay right I got a hand tat last

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Yeah, yeah. Last time I thought I went to my brother's house and I was like, all right,

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,680
we're gonna chill gonna play pool and that'll be it. And then I and I was on like a ton of Dayquil.

24
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,160
And then I started drinking which you're not supposed to do with Dayquil. It's very bad for

25
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:15,160
you. And it can compound the effect that alcohol has on you. And cut to like six in the morning,

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,080
I'm getting a hand tattoo of just a dot.

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,000
And also another guy, one of his roommates,

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,840
was doing a tattoo of the word Satan on my leg.

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,220
And then my brother, I was really fucked up.

30
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:34,840
I kept as I was sitting there, I kept showing everybody my dick.

31
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,480
And there was like a bunch of people there who I didn't know at all.

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,020
There's like this guy's girlfriend was there and she's like,

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,360
it's like his new girlfriend.

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,160
And I was just showing everybody my dick.

35
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,720
Which they later, they told me today, they were like, I had three of them tell me,

36
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,040
"Caleb, you have an incredibly pink penis."

37
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,840
They were like, "Your penis was shockingly pink."

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,920
And so I guess I have like a, I guess I have like a clit, like just a little pink bulb.

39
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,520
And another, another, a different crazy MF White Boy moment.

40
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,760
Uh, you took Neil's phone at the TAM and then you took a photo of your, of your pinky.

41
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,940
I did.

42
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm realizing I'm like, I'm in, I'm like a drunk, uh, when I get drunk,

43
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,000
I just show my dick to people, which is not good to admit.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,880
Not good.

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:32,380
No.

46
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,960
It's behind a paywall.

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,840
And it's true.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,220
Yeah.

49
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,440
I did for like a minute make that Neal's Tinder picture.

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,640
That's so funny.

51
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,880
And then I found out today Jana is like doing like,

52
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,280
she's like is developing like some older photos and one of them is just like,

53
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,960
has my wiener in it.

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,320
And she might like take it to like one of her like critiques and just,

55
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:05,560
I'll just have like 15 photo students just like, like critiquing my penis.

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:13,400
So I'm looking forward to that, but they changed the S into a flower.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,280
So it's not Satan anymore, it's a flower.

58
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Yeah, which is the opposite of Satan.

59
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,560
I was kind of bummed that I didn't get-- Satan would have been a funny--

60
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,560
Satan would have been sick, dude.

61
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,560
--a funny sticking poke to get.

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Yeah, that would have been fun.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,440
And then I did a bone on him, but it looks like a wrench.

64
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,040
It's like the worst bone of all time.

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,080
It's like a bone that doesn't exist.

66
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,440
Damn, the worst bone of all time?

67
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,620
That's you having sex.

68
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,320
That's my tiny pink penis that everybody saw.

69
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,400
Yeah.

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:49,440
But apparently the girl today, her boyfriend, asked her, "Hey, sorry you had to see that

71
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,080
guy's penis."

72
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,440
And she was like, "Oh, he had a very small penis."

73
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,960
She was like, "I didn't see much of his small penis."

74
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,960
It's pretty cool, man.

75
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:01,960
Hell yeah, brother.

76
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,960
Yeah dude it was one for the ages, one for the history books.

77
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,800

94
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,120
I've been taking a lot of self-control, so I'll go back to shutting the fuck up.

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
It's gonna sound awful.

111

It's gonna sound normal.

112
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
It's gonna sound terrible.

113
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,120
But people paid for this.

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,120
Yeah, so you shouldn't palm the microphone.

116
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,120
They want to hear the raw shit.

117
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,240
This is like the Peel Sessions.

118
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,240
This is real rap.

119
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,240
This is Eminem's smile right now.

120
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
This is probably Peel Sessions.

121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
It's true.

122
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
I hope I didn't leave it on the cam.

123
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,240
I just ate fucking so many tortilla chips.

00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,480
It's okay.

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,480
This is gonna be great.

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Oh, I laughed at a car horn today.

I woke up at eight o'clock 'cause I had work.

163
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,940
Nice.

164
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:34,220
And then, I got up too early.

165
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,660
I don't need to get up that early,

166
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,580
but I keep getting up that early.

167
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,420
Yeah.

168
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,460
And I went to bed at like three.

169
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,980
But I--

170
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,480
Awesome.

171
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,760
Just like there was a car--

172
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,440
somebody honked at somebody on my way to work.

173
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,920
And the sound of the horn was so funny to me

174
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,800
that I stopped and started laughing.

175
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,840
And I just looked like a fucking psycho.

176
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,400
No, no, it was just a normal horn.

177
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,520
It was just like a, "Ha."

178
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,280
That's not normal.

179
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,160
That's a funny horn.

180
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:04,960
That's a pretty funny horn.

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,640
That sounds like Peter Griffin laughing.

182
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,140
Yeah.

183
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,000
[LAUGHTER]

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,500
Ha.

185
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,480
[LAUGHTER]

186
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,400
Today I watched The Equalizer.

187
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,200
What's that noise?

188
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,040
What noise?

189
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Ah, nevermind, it's probably something only I hear.

190
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,880
I hear something.

191
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,040
Kill, kill.

192
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,280
(laughing)

193
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,600
I watched The Equalizer today.

194
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,760
Great, great movie. What's that?

195
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,680
Is that a movie about a guy

196
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,240
who fucking does math or something?

197
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,760
Kind of. Sounds lame as shit, dude.

198
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,280
He's a guy who he uses math to kill white people.

199
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,200
Okay.

200
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,200
Which is kind of my perfect movie.

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,800
It's Denzel Washington and he's in Boston.

202
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
It's a Boston movie.

203
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Yeah, hell yeah.

204
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,360
Where does it take place?

205
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,520
He has like OCD or some shit and he loves to move things on tables and make sure that there's

206
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,680
two of things and he's very particular about shit and he works at Home Depot.

207
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:04,160
And then like 35 minutes into the movie, yeah Boston's famous Home Depot.

208
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,160
And he works-

209
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,960
The one in Somerville next to the Circuit City.

210
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,080
I think it's actually South.

211
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,580
I think he lives in Dorchester.

212
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,580
Oh, OK.

213
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,080
Have you have you heard of Southie?

214
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Yeah, yeah.

215
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,280
It's a great, great movie title.

216
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,780
Southie, the most dangerous neighborhood in America.

217
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,180
Uh-huh.

218
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:24,180
Tom O'Shea's told you about it for sure.

219
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,680
Yeah.

220
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,280
Yeah, of course.

221
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,680
He's a he loves any Boston movie.

222
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,580
Yeah.

223
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,580
He was like, he was screaming his fucking head.

224
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,580
There was a Celtics game on.

225
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,280
Nice.

226
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,780
He was the only person in the bar paying attention.

227
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,040
And he was just screaming like, "Let's go, baby! Let's go!"

228
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,120
Yeah, Tom's not doing great.

229
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,040
Famously not doing awesome right now.

230
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,200
So let's make fun of him on the podcast.

231
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,680
He'll never hear it. He won't.

232
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
I will never. I will never make fun of Tom.

233
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,360
He's too pussy to throw down five dollars.

234
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,400
Me too. I love him too much.

235
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,720
Yeah.

236
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,240
But in the movie, he starts, he's so good at math.

237
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,720
You assume he's good at math because he is neat.

238
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:12,220
and then he, which I don't know why that makes sense to me, but then somebody tries to have

239
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:16,840
sex with a kid or something or no, he tries to, no.

240
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,020
He tries to have sex with a kid.

241
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,240
So, Chloe Moretz is like a teen prostitute who gets beat up and then he's like, I want

242
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
to buy her.

243
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,240
When did this movie come out?

244
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
2014.

245
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Oh, okay.

246
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,560
But he goes up to the Russian guy and he's like, I want to buy that little girl and,

247
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,040
because I want to protect her or whatever.

248
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,680
And the Russian guy's like, I don't care.

249
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,600
You can't have her, buddy.

250
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,880
and then he kills, he kills in like the coolest way.

251
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,400
And he times everything.

252
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,680
Before he kills people, he's like,

253
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,400
bet myself this is gonna take 15 seconds.

254
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,240
- Yeah.

255
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,080
- It's like, and then, yeah, and then he does it.

256
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,560
- And it's like, it took 15 seconds.

257
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,480
- Yeah, but I, or he doesn't time it.

258
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,520
He forgets to time it. - He counts out loud.

259
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,440
- Well, he does, he goes like, one 1,000, two 1,000.

260
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,320
And he's like fucking putting, grabbing people's dicks

261
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,560
and putting them in their mouths.

262
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,720
And he's just like, three 1,000, four 1,000,

263
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,800
it's really cool.

264
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,640
- Yeah.

265
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,840
you would be if you were a killer. No. Yeah. No. That's probably true. I can't count to

266
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,000
ten. Drew, I can't count past nine. Well, that's why you'd be so good. Cause you'd

267
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,720
be killing. Everything takes nine seconds. The nine second killer. One, two, three, four,

268
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,000
five, five, five, five, five. I guess it took five seconds. Wow, dude. I'm the king of killing.

269
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Dude, I'm the best murderer ever

270
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,880
Shit today. I was laughing really hard

271
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,840
imagining

272
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,120
Going like being at it. I was at a deli and I my brother ordered something with

273
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,640
Or something with no onions and they just loaded it up with onions

274
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,280
and I thought about

275
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Going up to the counter and being like listen, buddy. I like a good prank as much as the next guy

276
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,600
But this makes no sense. Listen. Yes. Was it funny? Of course it was funny. Yes. I'm fucking dying laughing

277
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,800
But I did pay for no onions

278
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:11,500
Seriously not cool. That happened at work today. I went I was running food and uh, yeah a woman asked specifically for no avocado

279
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,680
And you pranked her with avocado? No, no somebody at the counter gave her double avocado in her order

280
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,480
So she just had like two like piles of avocado on her salad and she was like I'm saying it is a good

281
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,160
It's a good prank and it's like it has plausible deniability to when you're like, oh you said no

282
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,400
I thought you said please give me extra. Yeah

283
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:39,360
You might press the mo avocado

284
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,640
Shit yeah, yeah. Yeah, let me sorry. Let me delete that off the order. I have to press the she it but

285
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,900
(laughing)

286
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,320
- Mo'avocado subtract she.

287
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,240
(laughing)

288
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,100
How's working at a restaurant, you loving it?

289
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,280
- No.

290
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,620
I literally, you know who came in today?

291
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,560
- Yo mama.

292
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,040
- No, what?

293
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,320
- Yo mama came in.

294
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,720
- No.

295
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,080
John Mugar, the producer of Awesome Show

296
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:12,360
and like Tom Goes to the Mayor and stuff.

297
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,200
- Oh. - Damn.

298
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,080
- And I was just like-- - Did you get his number?

299
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:15,920
- What?

300
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,940
- You get his number?

301
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,940
No, because I didn't take his order.

302
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,380
I like saw him and I was like,

303
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,940
"Damn, I should time this just right so I take his order so it can be like,

304
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,260
'Oh, you're John Mugar, can I have an internship?'"

305
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,940
And then, uh, someone else took his order.

306
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
That would've worked.

307
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,740
Yeah.

308
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,740
What?

309
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,740
That would've worked.

310
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,740
That would've worked, yeah.

311
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:38,420
Did you see how good I made you salad?

312
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,820
Look at how good I put this order in.

313
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,140
Now imagine that every day.

314
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,540
Just fucking up every part of the order.

315
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,340
By the way, Tom Goes to the Mayor was great.

316
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,140
And I just like, type in poop.

317
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,640
Yeah.

318
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,820
[LAUGHTER]

319
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,940
But then I just started--

320
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,380
You ordered the poop salad, right?

321
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:01,660
Oh, I did an intern's prank.

322
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,420
Yeah, sorry.

323
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:03,980
Sorry, I was--

324
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:06,500
You have to give me the internship if you laugh.

325
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,020
That's a little taste of what it's

326
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,820
going to be like when I'm around the office.

327
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:12,540
I'm a bit of an office clown.

328
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,100
You ordered the poop salad, right?

329
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,100
One poop salad!

330
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,100
One poop salad, hold the capers.

331
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,100
Yeah. Mo poop.

332
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,100
Oh, I hit the mo poop button.

333
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,100
Shit.

334
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
I hit the mo poop button.

335
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Every order you put in, you have to hit no poop.

336
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,100
Everything comes with poop default.

337
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:39,100
Oh, fuck, I'm so sorry. I forgot to press hold the poop.

338
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:41,100
To be fair, you did not ask for no poop.

339
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
You didn't ask, I'm sorry.

340
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,340
(laughing)

341
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:50,020
I keep thinking, 'cause it's like a vegan restaurant,

342
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,320
I keep thinking of like, oh, it would be funny

343
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,940
if I wrote on the modification button extra chicken

344
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:59,580
or something just so the chefs will like me.

345
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,420
And then-- The chefs will go crazy.

346
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,500
And then it never happens.

347
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,340
Yeah?

348
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,160
Yeah, 'cause I'm like, oh--

349
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,000
Do the people working--

350
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,540
They're literally all mad at me

351
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,060
because I fucked up so many things today.

352
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,940
Well, the chefs are notorious grumps.

353
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,780
Yeah.

354
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,620
Yeah.

355
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,180
I have one of the chef, like the head chef or whatever,

356
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,120
he keeps doing that, like,

357
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,780
oh, you have like blood on your shirt

358
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,600
and then flicking my nose.

359
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,240
I love that prank.

360
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,080
It's good.

361
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,300
He's trying to be your uncle.

362
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,140
Yeah.

363
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,980
Yeah.

364
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,060
I'm kinda like the uncle at the restaurant.

365
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,860
Yeah.

366
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,740
He's a real uncle figure to me.

367
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,580
Yeah.

368
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,540
Yeah, growing up I didn't have an uncle, so.

369
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,380
Yeah.

370
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,380
You know, I was raised by my mother and father.

371
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,220
Yeah.

372
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,060
I didn't even--

373
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,100
I didn't even have an uncle to--

374
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,340
Didn't even have an uncle to horse around with.

375
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,100
Yeah, I didn't have an uncle to show me nasty websites.

376
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:55,940
Yeah.

377
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,100
So now my boss does it.

378
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,260
(laughing)

379
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,100
Hey, come in here.

380
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,260
Don't tell your parents about this.

381
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,620
(laughing)

382
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,700
I'm 23 years old.

383
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,020
(laughing)

384
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,780
But you got parents, don't you?

385
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,020
And they would not like to hear about this.

386
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,540
Hey, your dad would never show you that.

387
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:22,780
Yeah, they're watching like King Kong.

388
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,780
This shit is scary.

389
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,780
It's King Kong.

390
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:31,420
They just zooms in on the, he pauses it and just zooms in on King Kong's like crotch.

391
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,420
Now check that out.

392
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,660
How's that gonna fit in that little woman?

393
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,780
He is entirely smooth there.

394
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:42,700
time you hear someone say I have a gorilla dick yeah think about that think about

395
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,460
this King Kong would have a giant floppy penis huh yeah but it would be small for

396
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,460
even though monkeys gorillas have the smallest dick size proportional to body

397
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,180
size mm-hmm really yeah it's true yeah give them a really small that's

398
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,300
reassuring yeah I mean it's the stereotype of like they're compensating

399
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:10,100
for something. The thing is you like yeah you're compensating for your tiny dick by being a gorilla.

400
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:15,460
I feel like in this in the grand scheme of things though I'd much rather be like an unkillable

401
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,900
gorilla than have a big dick. I mean did you see King Kong though? They killed him he was

402
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,460
like the biggest one. Damn. It's true he's the biggest ape. That is bullshit how did they kill

403
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:31,300
him? Gorillas have thick skulls. It was a plane. Oh okay. They flew a plane into him. Yeah but like

404
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
They flew a plane into the tower.

405
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
'Twas beauty that killed the beast.

406
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,300
Yeah.

407
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
Yeah, a beautiful plane.

408
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,300
The most beautiful plane you'll ever fucking see.

409
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,300
God, it was gorgeous.

410
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,300
A really hot plane.

411
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,300
Yeah, it's so good.

412
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,300
I really like that, the, uh, Peter Jackson King Kong.

413
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,300
Really?

414
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,300
I like it a lot, yeah.

415
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,300
Did you ever play the video game?

416
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,300
To me, Jack Black is so charmingly funny, you know?

417
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,300
And I loved all those parody songs in the middle.

418
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Yeah, all the things where he went like,

419
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,540
(imitating King Kong)

420
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:10,720
- That's me playing bass with King Kong.

421
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,660
- That's how they killed him.

422
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,500
- Yeah.

423
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,320
- Yeah.

424
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,300
- They showed him Les Claypool when he lost his mind.

425
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,380
- Yeah.

426
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,540
- His head blew up.

427
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,380
- Yeah.

428
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,300
They showed him Wynonna's big brown beaver

429
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,980
and his head fucking exploded.

430
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,460
- His monkey brain can't handle rock and roll.

431
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,420
- Yeah.

432
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,860
- And that's the truth.

433
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,640
You can't handle new metal.

434
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,740
He wasn't built for it, you know.

435
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,460
It's so funny that Les Claypool just became a steampunk guy.

436
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,460
Did he?

437
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,460
That's awesome.

438
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,820
Yeah, he plays like Dobros and stuff.

439
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,940
Like a Dobro bass.

440
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,940
That's sick.

441
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:53,340
Yeah, it looks really cool, but he just looks like the fucking worst.

442
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:56,100
Yeah, he's not looking good.

443
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,500
How's Tom Morello doing?

444
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,780
Tom Morello looks the same, pretty much, just like older.

445
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:01,620
But less playable.

446
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,380
- What's his profits of rage now, right?

447
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,860
- He has that weird super group.

448
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,100
- Yeah, it's like,

449
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:12,460
isn't it Rage Against the Machine and Cypress Hill?

450
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,020
- I think it's just Tom Morello.

451
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,020
I don't think it's a super group with just Tom Morello.

452
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,740
- So it's just Tom Morello.

453
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,780
- No, no, I mean, I don't think all of Rage Against,

454
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,620
I don't think like Zack De La Roca's in it, I'm pretty sure.

455
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,980
- Yeah, yeah, Zack De La Roca's not in it.

456
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
Yeah.

457
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,460
Hold on, this is what Les Claypool looks like now.

458
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:33,180
All right, let's...

459
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,180
That's me.

460
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
That's me in camera.

461
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
Damn, that's sick.

462
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,180
Wow, that's great, dude.

463
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,660
Dude, he looks fucking awesome, dude.

464
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,540
He just looks like a coffee shop writer.

465
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,540
Yeah, pretty much.

466
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,260
He looks like a pedophile to me.

467
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,660
Yeah, a coffee shop writer.

468
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,660
Yeah, yes, you're right.

469
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
Yeah.

470
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,660
It's the same.

471
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,660
What are you writing?

472
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,660
I'm writing Lolita 2.

473
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:56,380
Fucking Brooklyn hipsters appropriated their look from pedophiles.

474
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:04,700
Yeah, yeah, I hate Brooklyn hipsters. I freaking hate I freaking hate when I go

475
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:08,260
into a coffee shop. Yeah and there's always hipsters everywhere. Can I just get a

476
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:14,860
freaking cup of coffee? Yeah. And they're like, "uh sorry we only have uh venti

477
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:23,180

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,420
okay you want a black coffee you say black lives matter I don't give it to

483
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,920
And you can't put your name in as MAGA

484
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,220
or else we're gonna write Chelsea Manning on it.

485
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,460
(laughing)

486
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,100
Yeah, here's your two dads latte, buddy.

487
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,460
That's all you're getting, it's the best you're getting

488
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,420
out of us. It's so cool

489
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,220
Dennis Leary was able to coast on that until like 2012.

490
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,140
What, oh, just hating-- Just doing that.

491
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,300
Hating gay people.

492
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:13,340
Yeah, just being like, oh, coffee's gay now.

493
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,220
Yeah.

494
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,580
I wasn't expecting coffee to be gay.

495
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,180
Yeah, I thought everything else would be gay,

496
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,340
but coffee was our last respite.

497
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,820
(laughing)

498
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,340
The straight man's last hope.

499
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,180
Coffee.

500
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,980
- Oh yeah, that's so funny, like coffee.

501
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,620
- It's funny to make coffee into a tough guy thing.

502
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,460
- Yeah.

503
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,300
- Of like, yeah, I'd wake up,

504
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
I have my fucking cup of black coffee.

505
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,120
- Yeah.

506
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,700
- Everybody drinks that shitty drink.

507
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,100
- Yeah, I have to drink this drink

508
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,900
or else I get a splitting headache.

509
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,740
- Yeah, I'm pretty tough.

510
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:40,940
- Or else I get a seizure.

511
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,780
- Sometimes I--

512
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,620
(laughing)

513
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,100
- I see it's in my bathroom.

514
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,740
(laughing)

515
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,740
I get a frickin seizure.

516
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,620
And I fall into the toilet.

517
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:55,380
I hit my head on the tub and I wake up thinking I'm another person.

518
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:02,620
And then I go to work and they ask me to say "Hey John" and I'm like "Who the fuck is that?"

519
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,620
I'm Magga.

520
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,580
I'm John, cause the frickin Starbucks guy can't get my name correct.

521
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,540
He fucked up my name again.

522
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,140
I'm pretty sure that's how Johnny Sun came up with his book.

523
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,140
He dictated it all to the Starbucks barista and they wrote it all out.

524
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,140
He hit his head on the tub so many times that he just wrote the fucking book.

525
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,140
He developed a brain disease that like...

526
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,140
That makes you write stupid poetry?

527
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,140
Yeah, it's like, uh, the sky is actually the ocean of the clouds.

528
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,140
Yeah, the clowns.

529
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,140
Yeah, clowns.

530
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,140
I fucking, oh dude if I ever see him in real life.

531
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,140
Whoever, who cares.

532
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,140
Fuckin' on, dude.

533
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,140
I told you guys he came into my work, right?

534
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:51,140
right? Yeah. Yeah, he called nutritional yeast "nooch." That's awesome. Yeah, real cool guy

535
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:57,900
move. Yeah. Yeah, great job Johnny's son. He was asking for pussy in his smoothie. Yeah.

536
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,900
Can you put some frickin' pussy in there? Can you put a little nooch in that thing,

537
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:06,820
if you know what I mean? Yeah. You're like, "Alright, let me get some nooch juice." Yeah,

538
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,620
I'm here to, listen buddy, I'm here to pick up some nooch. And you're like, "You want

539
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:18,780
smoothie with the flakes in it? Okay. No. No. I'm Johnny Sun. I'm here to get 15 year old pussy.

540
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:23,060
No, I'm here to go to the back of the restaurant, if you know what I mean.

541
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:28,140
Oh, I need to actually talk to my manager first. Yeah, you work at Comet Pizza or

542
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:33,180
Comet Ping Pong. Mm-hmm. Comet Pizza. I mean, Comet Ping Pong and Pizza. They sell pizza.

543
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:39,620
That's the name of the pizza place in Toy Story. Fuck. That would actually,

544
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:42,940
Actually, that'd be a funny shirt idea.

545
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,420
Is the Pizza Planet logo, but it says Comet Ping Pong?

546
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,920
That's a good idea.

547
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,960
Why don't you write that down?

548
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,800
Yeah, mock that up.

549
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,620
Yeah, write that down.

550
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,300
Bleep, we're gonna bleep this part

551
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,280
so that nobody steals our idea.

552
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,660
No, I'm not.

553
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,940
I'm not gonna do that. We're bleeping it.

554
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,060
We're gonna bleep it. Do you want me to?

555
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,540
I'll write down the time if you want me to.

556
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,020
No. All right.

557
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,680
Unless somebody listening wants to make the shirt

558
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,640
and then pay us for the rights.

559
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,480
- Yeah.

560
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,320
- And we get--

561
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,480
- Okay, we'll start the bidding at $100 trillion.

562
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,760
- And it's a 70/30 split.

563
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,200
And it starts at $1 trillion.

564
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,080
- We get 70 and we get 30.

565
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:20,920
Fuck you.

566
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,200
(laughing)

567
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,480
Yeah, you bitch.

568
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,200
- That would be cool.

569
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
- We should come up with some shirts.

570
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,080
- Yeah.

571
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,140
- We could come up with some shirts.

572
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:34,480
How about, all right, what about Patrick?

573
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,640
- I already like this.

574
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,680
head on a steak and it says... I don't think I like it anymore. But it's like a it's like a

575
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,000
steak like a piece of beef yeah and it says I'm gonna eat this later cuz I'm a

576
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,320
fan. Okay now I like it. Now that's a good shirt. Now I like it. That's a pretty good

577
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:58,200
shirt. Yeah. What about like Hillary Clinton eating... eating pussy. Yeah eating

578
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:06,040
eating Princess Leia's pussy. Yeah that'd be kind of good. Hillary Clinton as Yoda would be good.

579
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,680
Just make her green and put her face on him.

580
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,680
Yeah.

581
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Yeah.

582
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:20,680
And the caption would say "Hillary Yoda" like it's supposed to be a pun.

583
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,680
Does not even try.

584
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,680
That's good.

585
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,240
We should fuck the podcast, let's just do shirts now.

586
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,520
Yeah, we'll just do shirts till the end until one of them blows up on like some meme page

587
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,100
or whatever and then we only sell that and then that shirt gets stolen and then we never

588
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,780
or make another profit.

589
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,980
- Look, we should sell just a shirt

590
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,340
that is your Yoda tweet,

591
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,780
and we should sell it for like $500.

592
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,620
- Yeah, that'd be pretty funny.

593
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,500
- And we'd only make one of them.

594
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,100
- Fuck Jerry would buy it, dude.

595
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:47,940
- Yeah, they would buy it.

596
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,820
And they'd say, "This is our shirt.

597
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,660
"You guys like that?

598
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,940
"Did you guys like that?"

599
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,540
I got 'em for, 'cause they take things, I don't know.

600
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,360
- Yeah.

601
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,460
Nice, man.

602
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,600
- Yeah, thanks, man.

603
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,020
Was that somebody talking in the other room?

604
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,740
That just echoed so much on my end.

605
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,740
That was so weird.

606
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,740
Cool, man.

607
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
Great.

608
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,820
That was our first Patreon gift.

609
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,140
It sounded like the Smash Brothers announcer.

610
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
Yeah, it was the Smash Brothers announcer.

611
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:24,940
He's actually standing outside my room right now announcing this podcast.

612
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,940
Luigi!

613
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:26,940
Yeah, he's...

614
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,940
Yeah, yeah.

615
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,940
Patrick!

616
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,140
Patrick is gay!

617
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:36,900
not what he says. When you pick, when you go, he's going putting down like the the like

618
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:48,200
little coin thing on all the it's like "Caleb! Cameron! GAY!" I made a I made a

619
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,940
sound clip in high school I gotta find it because it says I don't know if it

620
00:28:53,940 --> 00:29:00,860
sounds enough like Mario vs. Isis but it's a it's Smash Brothers on Gamecube

621
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,860
and it's saying Mario vs. Isis.

622
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,360
Nice.

623
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:04,860
Yeah.

624
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,360
It's cool.

625
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
I can imagine that.

626
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,360
Who would win?

627
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Mario vs. Isis?

628
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,860
Yeah.

629
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:10,360
Uh...

630
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,860
They have to behead him twice.

631
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,360
Well yeah.

632
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,860
Because he only loses the mushroom the first time.

633
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
What if Isis gets the fire flower?

634
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Then what?

635
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,860
Damn, Isis wit the fire flower?

636
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,360
That's a scary thought.

637
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:22,860
Ah, shit.

638
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,360
Shit, Isis got da fire flower.

639
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,860
Fuck.

640
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
It's over.

641
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
Wrap it up boys, they won.

642
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:47,080
damn what's the metal Isis oh god dude that sucks so bad that would suck shit

643
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:55,860
ice has got the blue shell Isis is um are they still even around

644
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,860
Isis? No, they all went home.

645
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,860
Yeah, they quit. They're hanging out, yeah.

646
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,860
They're retired. I haven't heard much from them.

647
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,860
It's just not worth it anymore. Yeah.

648
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
I feel like I could talk them out of it.

649
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,860
What, you could talk Isis out of doing Isis shit?

650
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,860
Yeah. I don't think so.

651
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:13,860
I feel like I could just be like,

652
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,860
like we could just get you,

653
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,860
like, this divergent, like,

654
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,860
Just you, just like, on Skype with Isis,

655
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,860
and you're like,

656
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,860
"Look, we're gonna get ya."

657
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,860
We're gonna get you.

658
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,860
[laughter]

659
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,860
I hope you know, we could kill you so easy.

660
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
I don't know why we don't.

661
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,860
I'm gonna get you.

662
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,860
We have computers that we only make those computers to kill you and your friends.

663
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,860
[laughter]

664
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,860
That's how serious it is.

665
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,860
We have a big computer in the sky.

666
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,860
We have a big gun that we wrote ISIS on the bullet and we're gonna shoot it in the air and it's gonna kill all of you.

667
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,860
It's gonna ricochet around and kill everyone of you.

668
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,860
It's an actual special...

669
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:56,900
them that and they'd believe it because every day just like they'll just be like walking down the

670
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:03,220
street and somebody their friend will explode and just like an American flag will pop out of the

671
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:08,100
top of his head and I'll be like oh that's magic how do they do that I feel like we could tell

672
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:13,460
them that we have any weapon and they'd be like yeah it's probably not probably not worth it.

673
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:20,340
It'd be funny if you told them. I'll tell them. That's what this that's what this agreement was

674
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,020
that you have to tell them. Yeah, I can tell them. I just feel like I could convince them.

675
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,300
I need to learn the language. Is ISIS on Duolingo? Yeah.

676
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,140
Yeah. I think it's like Esperanto.

677
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,220
Speak Esperanto. They all speak Esperanto, yeah.

678
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:42,980
It'd be funny if ISIS broke up like a band and they're like, "We've been doing ISIS for 20

679
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,820
years and we've had some great times, but we feel like we've reached the height of it and we want to

680
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:52,280
quit war ahead like we're gonna do one final tour and then yeah hang on we're

681
00:31:52,280 --> 00:32:01,220
not telling you where yeah look yeah yeah yeah we'll tweet out the location

682
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:09,020
and stay away from that location yeah Isis was a project that I started with

683
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:15,660
my friends in high school it actually started in a garage never started in a

684
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:20,320
garage in Orange, New Jersey. Look. And look where we are now, you know. Fucking

685
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,980
incredible, dude. Only 1,000 people bought a copy of Al-Qaeda, but

686
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,660
those 1,000 people went and started their own terrorist organizations of their own.

687
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:37,860
Remember, you guys remember when Osama died and Fox News tried to call him

688
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:45,180
"Oo-sama" with a "U"? What's up with that? Yeah, serious what's up with that moment.

689
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:49,180
Yeah, seriously, look at my face. I'm doing Kenan Thompson face, because what's up with that?

690
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,180
Well, stop doing Kenan Thompson face right now!

691
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,180
[Laughter]

692
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,180
Please stop!

693
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,180
Take it off!

694
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,180
[Laughter]

695
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:03,180
Dude, SNL sucks.

696
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:05,180
[Laughter]

697
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,180
SNL's so trash now, dude.

698
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:09,180
Dude, SNL sucks.

699
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,180
I'm in that writing for TV class. I keep having to watch SNL clips.

700
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,680
Dude, wow. That's my own personal hell.

701
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:22,180
Hell is actually watching the Hillary Clinton "Hallelujah" clip on a loop.

702
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,180
That's the only good thing they've ever done.

703
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,180
That's their last good sketch.

704
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:30,180
So funny as fuck, dude. I busted a damn gut watching that.

705
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,180
I laughed so hard.

706
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,180
Yeah. It would have been funny if it was Chris Farley doing it. That's true.

707
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:44,580
If they didn't have... if right after... yeah, if a fat Chris Farley had shittily sung "Hallelujah"

708
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:47,700
as Hillary Clinton, that shit would be so...

709
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:51,860
That would have been really good. Now that I'm thinking about it, that would have been great.

710
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,940
So they got Chris Farley's bloated corpse and they...

711
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,180
Yeah.

712
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,420
Yeah.

713
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,620
They prop it up.

714
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,940
Yeah, and they work it like a puppet.

715
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,100
Yeah.

716
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,140
They make him sing "Hallelujah".

717
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:06,180
They kept Chris Farley's corpse intact like they did with Lenin in Russia.

718
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:09,140
Yeah, they just shove a fucking Beats pill down his throat.

719
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,780
Pipe hallelujah.

720
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:21,220
Adam Sandler's singing voice coming out of the Beats pill in his body.

721
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:29,060
I was at a pool hall the other day and they played Adam's song by Blink-182.

722
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:35,760
And it's just like a bar. They played Adam's Song by Blink-182 and then the Hanukkah Song by Adam Sandler back-to-back.

723
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,300
It's so fucking weird. It's the weirdest...

724
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,820
Nobody was like adding songs on the jukebox. That's just what the soundtrack of the place was.

725
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,240
Pretty good. Fucking bizarre. They were getting it in early.

726
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,220
Yeah, it was like 11 o'clock. Like people were... people were gonna soon leave to have sex.

727
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,520
And they were playing the Hanukkah song. That might be like a good like get the fuck out of here tactic. Oh

728
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,720
Yeah, yeah, I guess so

729
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,380
That's actually I mean if any song to play that's probably the song

730
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:16,320
Now dude, I would stay for even longer. Yes, I would be like I want to hear Hanukkah song part one two and three

731
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,680
And the fourth one he's gonna put out. Yeah, how many parts of the Hanukkah song are there?

732
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,840
How many days of Hanukkah are there? There's eight. One. Crazy nights.

733
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,720
Yeah, there's no days. It's just eight crazy crazy nights.

734
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,300
Yeah, so that's how many parts there are. Oh, there is a part four.

735
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,960
I think eight crazy nights was maybe the first time in my life I was like aware of Judaism.

736
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,760
Yeah, no, honestly me too. I don't think I knew what that was until I saw that movie. You didn't know what Judaism was?

737
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,120
Yeah, I was young and there's no Jewish people in North Carolina.

738
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,120
Yeah.

739
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:52,280
It's very, very uncommon.

740
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:57,400
Adam Sandler released a Hanukkah song in 2015.

741
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,360
Oh shit.

742
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:04,240
Play that joint.

743
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:12,120
So the first two people that Adam Sandler mentions in Hanukkah Song Part 4 are Jesus

744
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:15,400
and then Olaf from Frozen.

745
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
Nice. Both killed by Jews.

746
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
But he mentions Josh Gad.

747
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,400
Nice.

748
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,400
Ron?

749
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
I'm dropping Jesus in the Hanukkah song. That's a bold move.

750
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Yeah.

751
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
It's an extremely bold move.

752
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Queen Elsa from Frozen.

753
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
She's Jewish?

754
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Yeah. Oh, this is pretty funny.

755
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,400
He mentioned Jared Fogle and said,

756
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,400
"God damn it, a Jew."

757
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,400
I like that.

758
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,440
yeah yeah that's nice yet when I say that exact thing on stage people get pissed

759
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,160
off I'm talking about Jared vocal okay it's no it's fine

760
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:03,080
he's weird wait he was he was fucking out of his mind weird he was weird Jared

761
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,720
was weird fuck dude come on you're telling me you're on his side now all

762
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:14,360
that guy was utterly bizarre he's a serious weirdo he was like something out of a Tim

763
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:23,760
Burton movie yeah yeah he's the mayor he's the mayor from Nightmare Before Christmas

764
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,760
He turns around to his child fucking face.

765
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,760
He flips his head.

766
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:38,760
That's good.

767
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,760
I want to smoke a cigarette.

768
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
Yeah? Really?

769
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,760
Yeah. Probably after this.

770
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
Nice baby.

771
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
Is that cool?

772
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,760
Yeah. I mean not in here, but yeah.

773
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
No, I would never imagine.

774
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,440
I mean just the way you asked is that cool made me worried about that.

775
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,440
I was like what?

776
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,440
I'm going to smoke a cigarette in your room.

777
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Yeah, what?

778
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Why else would you ask if it was okay?

779
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,800
I don't remember the last time I smoked a cigarette inside.

780
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
That's such a foreign thought.

781
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,080
Uh, yeah, I don't know that I ever have.

782
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:12,080
I remember we used to go to Golden Corral after like church on Sundays and they had

783
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,080
a smoking section.

784
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,080
Yeah, maybe.

785
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,160
And it re- and like the doors were broken.

786
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Yeah.

787
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:20,440
On the smoking section so the whole place was just a smoking section then.

788
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,440
That's awesome, dude.

789
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,320
would piss off my mom but I kind of like the smell cuz I was kind of a weird kid.

790
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,540
Yeah you'd kind of run and go into the section and go... I ran towards it. Yeah. Are y'all smoking pot in

791
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:35,880
here or what? I'm six years old and I want to smoke some pot. Come on pass it to the

792
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:45,320
left player. That's what I did at the Golden Corral. All the fat people smoking cigarettes. I'm

793
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,840
reading I'm still reading the Wikipedia section. Here's yeah here's a list for

794
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,760
the show list of the list of Jewish people mentioned in the Adam Sandler

795
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:04,440
Hanukkah songs. It says okay so the list has it's this is this is the this is the

796
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:11,320
run it goes Jack Black whose dad converted his mom was Jewish. But you're doing a list on a no list episode.

797
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:16,240
This is podcast without lists. Oh all right well anyway he says he says

798
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
I cannot say anything that's even close.

799
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Deuce Bigelow is Jewish?

800
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,240
Deuce Bigelow is Jewish and then it says "See note below"

801
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
That's such an odd

802
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Wikipedia list.

803
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
And then there's like a whole fucking like this big fucking paragraph

804
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,240
The size you held up

805
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
with your fingers is very small

806
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,240
when you said this big.

807
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
Well it's big on a computer screen.

808
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
That's one Caleb penis.

809
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
One Caleb penis big.

810
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
One tiny red penis.

811
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
I have like a perfect plaster cast of Caleb's penis

812
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,880
to measure things because I know it's exactly one millimeter long.

813
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:47,380
Yeah.

814
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,280
It's true man, I have a small little red penis.

815
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,360
And you said it was pink. You're a liar.

816
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,440
Fact check.

817
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,520
They caught me. I have a huge black.

818
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,640
Yeah, Caleb, Caleb, you just heard three Pinocchios.

Shit dude, you guys fucking caught me in a big lie. Damn.

820
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,800
All right, fine, I don't have a little penis.

821
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,600

854
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,100
He's not a pedophile

855
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:21,580
He's not so he's an inappropriate shoulder toucher

856
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:28,580
No, I think he didn't care. He's fine. That's still weird. Yeah, I mean, yeah

857
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:32,420
I mean like I look at that guy. It's weird a girl shoulders and I'll be like

858
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:37,280
like no it's weird I mean as I just don't you don't know a little girl and you're

859
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:42,540
an old-ass man like you just can't like it like I know maybe it's not like it's

860
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,440
nice he's definitely not like a pedophile or whatever but it's like you can't just

861
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,780
go around doing that like yeah I have at least a little self-awareness you know

862
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:51,940
what I'm doing that's very common actually and yeah he's actually more

863
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,860
cultured than us yeah I mean so I feel like I'm gonna take your upside on this

864
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:02,100
like when it's Italian people on the cheeks I kiss my dad on the mouth until

865
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:14,480
like yesterday like 11 yeah till yesterday yeah till 11 p.m. so one hour

866
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:22,700
ago that's why you were late too busy smooching my dad

867
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:29,220
Every day 10 to 11, that's dad time.

868
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:34,220
Yeah, but you're out in LA now, you can't kiss your dad at home.

869
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,220
He's got long lips.

870
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,220
Your dad takes a flight every day at 6 a.m.

871
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,220
Then he lands and then you kiss him until 11 p.m.

872
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:46,220
Then he does, he starts to cycle over.

873
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,220
Yeah, and then he flies back and touches down and gets ready for the flight.

874
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,220
Unpacks everything, packs it back up.

875
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:55,220
Yeah

876
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:03,220
Yeah, yeah, he's just goes through the revolving door walks back in is like yep

877
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:08,600
She's back again. What's your is a suitcase full of a pelican case full of Burt's bees?

878
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:15,880
Didn't expect to see you so soon. He's like, yep. I'm going to kiss my son

879
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:21,040
You should expect me. I do this every day. You fucking airhead, bitch

880
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,040
Can I have a kiss? No! Save them! I've saved them from so many!

881
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:32,040
Yeah, we do one long hour-long kiss. Yeah.

882
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:36,040
Until our lips kind of fuse together because of our saliva. Yeah.

883
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,040
And then we have to peel each other off with a spackling knife. Yeah.

884
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,040
And then he leaves. Play catch. Uh, that's not normal.

885
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,040
Let's get closer and closer. I'm just gonna say it. That's not normal.

886
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,040
No, it's normal. That's not normal. You guys aren't from the South, man.

887
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,280
Is Caleb's dad Tom Brady or something?

888
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:51,280
Yeah, my dad's Tom Brady.

889
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,280
Hey!

890
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,280

891
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,280
New England.

00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:01,560
dude.

898
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,560
You're the fucking worst guy in the world.

899
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
Stop kissing your son.

900
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
Caleb hates his dad.

901
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
Have you...

902
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
Tom Brady's not my dad, okay?

903
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,040
Have you seen the Tom Brady store on Boylston?

904
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,440
Yeah, man, I opened it.

905
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:13,440
That's where T.L. works.

906
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,440
Yeah, I do work there.

907
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,440
I'm the manager.

908
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,040
You kiss the fathers.

909
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,160
I kiss everybody who comes in, that's why I got the job.

910
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,160
Oh, okay.

911
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,160
I said, "Can I kiss everybody?"

912
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
It's like a Walmart door greeter.

913
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Yeah.

914
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,160
Well, hello there.

915
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,160
Open mouth kiss.

916
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
Well, hello there.

917
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,080
Va va voom.

918
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Just to my son who walks in.

919
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,080
Whoa.

920
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:42,360
Where do you think you're taking that thing?

921
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
What's the Tom Brady store?

922
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,360
What do they sell Tom Brady merch?

923
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,680
It's called the TB12 store and it sells like diet supplements and like

924
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,480
Nice workout equipment and shit. Nice, dude. He's one of the most famous

925
00:45:53,480 --> 00:46:02,000
Work at gym rats of all time. Yeah, this guy's just the dumbest Midwestern guy. I like him

926
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,800
It's got a trillion dollars got some fucking tall woman. They married. Yeah best friends with the president

927
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,440
The reason why he kisses his son is because it reminds him of his beautiful wife. His wife is so beautiful

928
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,800
Yeah, it's like he's like create when mommy's away

929
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,380
Daddy's got to get a little action

930
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:23,080
Come on. Come here, baby

931
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:30,940
And that's just for the patreon listeners, yeah, yeah, that's right we can say anything here

932
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,680
My mom will never listen to this. That's true. Yeah, she doesn't know what this is

933
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:39,120
Hey mom if you're listening I

937
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,880
How long should the patreon episodes be

938
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:06,080
Left seeing you we didn't specify it. I think it'd be kind of yeah to do less in our yeah, great. Yeah

939
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,920
- Yeah.

940
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:10,480
- And yeah, I don't know what day these will come out

941
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,760

942
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,520
- Today, this one will come out tonight, right?

943
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,360
- Yeah. - Yeah.

944
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,000
- I'll edit it when we're done.

945
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,080
I also watched that movie "Crawl" today.

946
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,120
- What's that about? - Dude, I liked that movie

947
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:21,400
a lot, I did not, I thought it was terrible.

948
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,400
- You thought it was terrible?

949
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,220
- You told me, there were certain things I liked.

950
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:26,060
I liked that it--

951
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:27,760
- Is that the alligator movie?

952
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,600
- Yeah. - Yeah.

953
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,400
- I liked that it was like, they weren't in the house.

954
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,640
I liked like the crawl space stuff, that was cool.

955
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,600
- Yeah.

956
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,160
and I liked the end, kinda.

957
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,100
But the alligators just like,

958
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:40,320
I thought were poorly done, generally.

959
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,160
They were really slow.

960
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,760
- I love the way their eyes looked.

961
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,960
- The eyes were, yeah, I guess.

962
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,000
- They shined.

963
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
- That was incredible to you.

964
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,840
- Pretty cool.

965
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,160
I was like, this reminds me of my favorite movie,

966
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,000
The Shining.

967
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,120
- This reminds me of Diamonds, which I love to look at.

968
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,040
This reminds me of shiny, shiny little marbles.

969
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,640
- Yeah, this reminds me of the top

970
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,320
of Caleb's shiny bald head.

971
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,160
- I actually have hair.

972
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,560
I actually have tons of hair.

973
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:02,980
Sure.

974
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:03,840
I do.

975
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,340
Sure.

976
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:04,840
Okay.

977
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,340
I do.

978
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:05,840
Okay, dude.

979
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Alright, tons of hair and a tiny, tiny pink penis.

980
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:08,340
Sure thing.

981
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:11,140
Yeah, this reminds me of Caleb's shiny pink penis.

982
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:11,640
Yeah.

983
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,140
Yeah.

984
00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,140
Don't fucking do that in front of the mic.

985
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:15,140
What are you doing?

986
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:15,640
What?

987
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:16,640
No, it's smart.

988
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:17,140
What?

989
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,140
It's so loud.

990
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,140
I'm not doing anything.

991
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:20,140
Stop beatboxing.

992
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,140
Yeah.

993
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:25,140
It's really, it sounds really good, yeah, but stop beatboxing, please.

994
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,140
Please.

995
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:32,140
But I, I, I liked the part where the guy's leg or arm got bitten off.

996
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:43,140
Yeah, um, spoiler alert for Crawl. Wait, thanks. I'm gonna, the end originally, what they're gonna do for the end is they get on the helicopter and an alligator just jumps up and eats them.

997
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:54,140
Like at the last second. I always liked that more. That would be way better. No horror movie should have like a good ending. Yeah. No, I disagree with that, but. I don't. I agree with what I just said.

998
00:48:54,140 --> 00:49:02,140
Yeah, because Cameron likes horror movies like, he thinks the freaking Wiggles are scary.

999
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,140
Yeah, no, you like Hotel Transylvania.

1000
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:05,140
Yeah.

1001
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,140
That shit is terrifying.

1002
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,140
That's your favorite scary movie.

1003
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,140
What are you talking, a hotel where Dracula lives?

1004
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:10,140
Wow, that is pretty scary.

1005
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,140
He's not even staying there temporarily, he literally owns that place.

1006
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,140
And he rents it out to all his scary friends?

1007
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:19,140
And you're telling me you would stay in a hotel called Hotel Transylvania?

1008
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:20,140
No way.

1009
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:21,140
And there are three of them?

1010
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,140
No.

1011
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:23,140
Three scary hotels.

1012
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:27,700
I think I know one hotel that's not gonna get a good review.

1013
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,940
Yeah, which one?

1014
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:32,140
Trip Advisor, three stars.

1015
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,140
Great, great.

1016
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:34,140
Transylvania.

1017
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,780
I was expecting two stars because Dracula sucked my blood and killed me.

1018
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,740
Two stars, Dracula killed my whole family.

1019
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:49,300
One of those stars, amazing, amazing, and I cannot stress this enough, Jacuzzi and workout

1020
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:50,300
room.

1021
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,300
Yeah.

1022
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,300
It's rare for them to have free weights, but Dracula don't care.

1023
00:49:54,300 --> 00:50:00,300
He, honestly, he's made all that money. He's honestly a really down-to-earth guy.

1024
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,300
Honestly, after he killed my family and I was just kind of talking to him as a small business owner to a small business owner,

1025
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,300
we kind of have a similar idea of how you should run a business.

1026
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,300
We kind of clicked.

1027
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,300
And so in that way, I'm gonna give him two stars.

1028
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,300
Because that bitch earned that shit.

1029
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:18,300
Also, the Continental Breakfast was fire.

1030
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,300
Yeah.

1031
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:20,300
On another level.

1032
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,860
yeah didn't touch the blood

1033
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:23,740
yeah

1034
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:26,840
yet but they had the waffle iron

1035
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,760
uh... okay but hormones of happy endings i mean like every slasher

00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,260

1037
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,520

1041
00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:51,620
yeah i mean like you know it's a twisted ending it's fucked up

1042
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:54,180

00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:57,060
what i don't even remember it oh they kill him in the bathtub

1044
00:50:57,060 --> 00:50:58,560
in the pool

1045
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:03,120
is that what happens? there's a lot of good horror movies with happy endings

1046
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,140
uh...

1047
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,200
yeah yeah just saying you're dumb

1048
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:08,060

00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:12,320
uh... you're stupid friday the thirteenth not happy yeah ugly ugly kid

1050
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,600
Yeah, but it's a dream sequence.

1051
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Yeah, that kid has to live the rest of his life as Ollie.

1052
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:15,600
It's literally a dream sequence.

1053
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,120
You finally get the second one as a fucking dream sequence.

1054
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,120
I disagree.

1055
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:19,120
Idiot.

1056
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,120
Fucking stupid asshole.

1057
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:25,520
So you think it's an unhappy ending until you have to wait to see the second movie,

1058
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,480
then it's an unhappy ending.

1059
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:28,520
No.

1060
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,360
It's also happy because Jason's cute.

1061
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,360
You do get to see...

1062
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:33,360
No.

1063
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,200
You are happy because they've been talking about this guy the whole fucking movie, and

1064
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,200
now you finally get to see him.

1065
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:38,200
Yeah, finally get to meet him.

1066
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,200
That is true.

1067
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,200
Yeah.

1068
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,200
Yeah.

1069
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,200
Alright, you know I've turned around.

1070
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:46,400
- Yeah, I'm with you. - Good to see an ugly kid.

1071
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,600
- Mm-hmm. - At the end of a movie,

1072
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,280
that's sort of the happiest.

1073
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,120
- Yeah. - I'll be,

1074
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,200
"The kid isn't dead after all, he didn't drown."

1075
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,960
(both laughing)

1076
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,520
- Oh, he's still alive. - Yeah.

1077
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,440
(Josh laughing)

1078
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,560
- Was it-- - "Jason, I thought

1079
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,840
you drowned," you're looking at the screen.

1080
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,120
(both laughing)

1081
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,080
- Was it, it's Freddy versus Jason, right?

1082
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,320
Where he like, they go inside of his dreams.

1083
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,860
- Jason's dreams, yeah, and he's just like,

1084
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:14,900
"Mommy! Mommy!" and he's just, there's water and he's really afraid of water.

1085
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,300
They, uh, they, yeah, they made him a bitch in that movie, dude.

1086
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,300
Yeah.

1087
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:21,700
They, they bitched him up.

1088
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:24,620
They did the same thing with Alien vs. Predator, man.

1089
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,460
Yeah, they did that in, uh...

1090
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,860
They ate the alien big juicy tits.

1091
00:52:28,860 --> 00:52:29,860
Yeah.

1092
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,860
Yeah, and made her cry.

1093
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,860
Yeah, she cried.

1094
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:33,860
Yeah.

1095
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:38,860
She was like, "Can you help me open this pickle jar, Predator?"

1096
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:40,860
You stupid bitch.

1097
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,860
Yeah.

1098
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:43,860
And he's like, that's one of my favorite characters.

1099
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,860
And he just turned into a...

1100
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:49,860
It is so funny when people get really mad that like their favorite characters get like,

1101
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:50,860
like defanged or whatever.

1102
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,860
Like, it's just, it's such a like...

1103
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:53,860
Dracula defanged.

1104
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:54,860
Yeah, baby.

1105
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:55,860
That's just a guy.

1106
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:56,860
It's just so funny.

1107
00:52:56,860 --> 00:52:57,860
Like, it's just so funny to care that much.

1108
00:52:57,860 --> 00:52:58,860
That's just a sex pest.

1109
00:52:58,860 --> 00:52:59,860
That's just an old guy.

1110
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,860
That's an old guy who looks at you funny.

1111
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,860
It's an extremely old guy.

1112
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,860
It's an extremely old guy who loves sex.

1113
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,860
It's weird.

1114
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:07,860
Yeah.

1115
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:14,580
He sleeps in a coffin. He's just kind of weird now. Ever since Dracula got his teeth taken

1116
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:21,860
out, he's just like, just not the same. He's just kind of a weird guy. He honestly got weirder.

1117
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:31,780
Yeah. Yeah. He's like a eunuch. Like he just, he doesn't, he's personality changes. Very

1118
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:37,220
like calm all the time. Yeah, beautiful singing voice. Yeah, very high pitched. "I want to

1119
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:39,220
"I'm gonna suck your blood!"

1120
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:41,220
Alvin and the Chipmunks voice.

1121
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:43,220
That's how Alvin and the Chipmunks sound like, you know?

1122
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:45,220
The voice actors, they all...

1123
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:47,220
They were all...

1124
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:49,220
They were required to cut off their balls.

1125
00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:51,220
Actually, everyone involved in the movie, David Cross, had to get castrated.

1126
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,220
David Cross did, Jason Lee...

1127
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,220
Yeah.

1128
00:53:55,220 --> 00:53:57,220
He had to cut off his balls to join Scientology, though.

1129
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:59,220
Jason Lee.

1130
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,220
Is Jason Lee a Scientologist?

1131
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,220
He was. He went clear in 2017, I think.

1132
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:05,220
He was. He went clear in 2017, I think.

1133
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:10,760
I think and then he said I'm out yeah you said he yeah that's what going clear is

1134
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:17,380
in Scientology going clear is when you're removed of all your thetans yeah yeah so

1135
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:22,560
but he's so he's but you still are a sign no wait no never mind wait then why is

1136
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:26,720
it called going clear with the Leah Remini that's just the name of the

1137
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:50,360
documentary shit yeah now go still stuck in that I thought I just quit one last

1138
00:54:50,360 --> 00:55:01,640
job John Travolta we need you to go to one last massage parlor John Travolta. Come on dude I can't

1139
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:12,120
they're taking Pelham one two three. Aren't you the bad guy in that movie? Not anymore. No we're

1140
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:19,440
remaking it so I'm the good guy. Yeah he has a he has an Occupy Wall Street motive now. Yeah. He's

1141
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,000
He's like Bane from Dark Knight Rises now.

1142
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:30,460
If I was a really rich celebrity, I would pay to make reshoots of all my favorite movies

1143
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,460
where I'm the hero.

1144
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:32,460
Yeah.

1145
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,460
That's a good idea.

1146
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:34,460
Yeah.

1147
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,460
I would do like Back to the Future.

1148
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:36,460
Yeah.

1149
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,460
You know?

1150
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:38,460
And I would do like Toy Story.

1151
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,460
And I'd just be like a...

1152
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:40,460
A toy.

1153
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,460
You're the toy.

1154
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,460
No, you get to be Andy.

1155
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:43,460
And you get to play with all the toys.

1156
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,460
I get to be...

1157
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,740
Because they sort of have different...

1158
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,500
know between Woody and Buzz and then now the new I didn't see the new one but I

1159
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:55,940
think isn't Bo Peep the hero? Bo Burnham yeah. Bo Burnham's the hero.

1160
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,260
I would just have them edit me into that role in every single one. Yeah you know that

1161
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:05,340
video of like like this dad who's a genius with CGI like made it put his

1162
00:56:05,340 --> 00:56:09,940
little kid in all these like adventure situations that kid must like I don't

1163
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,780
know I feel like that that kids gonna grow up fucked up. It's gonna have like a

1164
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,920
- Something about that. - A sense of reality.

1165
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:16,420
- Something about your dad,

1166
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:20,740
like using after effects to make it look like

1167
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:22,280
you're jumping over a volcano.

1168
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:25,220
I just feel like you can't turn into a normal guy

1169
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,200
after that, you know what I mean?

1170
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,660
- That's true. - I don't know what it is.

1171
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:29,620
It'd be funny if-- - I think it's like

1172
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:32,340
the same thing as most child actors though.

1173
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,460
- Yeah, yeah, it's the same as being a child actor.

1174
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:37,180
It's the same way they're hooked up.

1175
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,460
- 'Cause it's like they're put on a pedestal.

1176
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,300
If your dad tells you you can jump over a volcano,

1177
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,300
You're gonna grow up believing it.

1178
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,300
And you're gonna try it.

1179
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,300
And you're gonna try it for sure.

1180
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,300
It'd be funny if like, uh...

1181
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,300
You just can't take him to Hawaii.

1182
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:54,300
You can do whatever you want.

1183
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,300
Yeah, my fucking kid thinks he can jump over a volcano.

1184
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,300
Maui trip's fucking ruined.

1185
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,300
Fucking cancelled.

1186
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,300
The big island's not for us.

1187
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,300
I wanted to learn how to surf.

1188
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,300
Before I turned 49.

1189
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:09,300
Yeah.

1190
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,300
I was gonna put myself in with Moana.

1291
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:07,340
to read the dot Patrick file. Go into file explorer and delete system 32. Uh-oh.

1292
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:12,820
Yeah, I'm serious. That'll free up enough space. Yeah, it frees up enough space because the dot

1293
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:19,980
Patrick file it's a million gigabytes it's a million pure Patrick. They've

1294
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:25,360
uploaded me to the computer. It's his entire genome and also his

1295
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,360
consciousness yeah we're speaking to him right now and you had no idea that's how

1296
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,680
