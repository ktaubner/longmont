(upbeat music)

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,720
- Yo.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,540
- Okay.

15
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,960
- Beer we're drinking.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,600
- Well, mine doesn't have a, hold on, let me.

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,500
- That was kind of like a, like a really not audible.

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,000
- Oh, that was a good snap from Rex.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,080
I feel like Rex usually has a weak one.

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:57,080
- Yeah, this is a 805 Cerveza, just a regular big beer.

21
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,880
- I love 805.

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,720
What's that five?

00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,480
What's it from?

24
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,040
Just like a California, like shitty beer, but it's good.

25
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,840
Local beers.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,320
It's like a local version of Mondelo.

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,840
Yeah, it's good.

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
What do you got Caleb?

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:20,640
I have the last little sips of Lolelo Sangria imported from Spain.

30
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,360
I had this, oh, there's actually even a little bit more in this bottle.

31
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,200
I got this yesterday cause I wanted Sangria really badly.

32
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,300
And put some pineapple in there.

And before the comments start rolling in.

34
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,600
- How that's not a beer?

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,480
- Well, that but also that I don't have any ice in it.

36
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:41,600
You're supposed to have ice in it.

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,440
- Yeah.

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,400
- Maybe I'm not some ice magnate.

39
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,120
I don't just have ice on me all the time.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,800
- When I think of your apartment,

41
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:56,000
I don't think that you have ever had ice in that apartment.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,160
- I've had ice.

43
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,000
- I don't think--

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,080
- Is it because it looks like a apartment from before

45
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,480
they knew how to freeze ice?

46
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,320
- Yes.

47
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,660
- No, I have ice sometimes, but I ran out.

48
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,360
- It looks like you have to go down to the deli

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,800
and bring a giant ice cube to keep your food cold.

50
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
- You said "frude."

51
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,040
- No, I didn't.

52
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,880
- You said "frude."

53
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,700
- "Frude."

54
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,540
- You did say "frude."

55
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,360
- "Frude."

56
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,200
- You said "frude."

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,040
- You could also just buy a little--

58
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,080
- Oh, it has food and a fridge.

59
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,400
- You could just buy a little tray

60
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
and to just make ice at home, like every person in the world.

61
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,920
- Oh, I have a tray, don't worry, I have a tray.

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,520
I just don't use it, 'cause I don't use ice at all.

63
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,920
- You don't have a fridge.

64
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,240
- I do have a fridge.

65
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,080
- You don't.

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,600
- He makes those cubic whiskey stones

67
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,400
that you put in the freezer.

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,660
- Oh, I would love to have those, or like the balls.

69
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,480
I want the balls really bad.

70
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,320
- You want the balls.

71
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,400
- You want the balls.

73
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,940
- I want the balls, the ice balls really badly.

74
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,320
The balls, shut up man.

75
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,600
Whatever, I'm basically what a European is.

76
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,040
I got a local beer, like we said,

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,080
me and Rex are, this is called--

78
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,440
Oh, I forgot, was it?

79
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,840
Well, okay, so I just--

80
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,160
It's a local person only. I had two drinks

81
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,760
in my fridge. Local person only.

82
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,920
Okay, well, I'm Spanish.

83
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,600
I had two beers, or I had two drinks in my fridge,

84
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,560
and I didn't wanna go buy more, so.

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,720
Okay.

86
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,680
I'll be honest, I didn't-- I forgot completely.

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,800
So you don't support local businesses,

88
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,920
is what you're saying?

89
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,120
I also can't go outside, dude.

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,780
- Oh, that's true. - I came up with this today.

91
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,260
- There's COVID outside.

92
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,260
- Came up with this today.

93
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,220
New York City, the city that never breathes.

94
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,540
Wow. - It's pretty good.

95
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,920
- Yeah, well done. - Does that hit you

96
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,620
like a ton of bricks or what?

97
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,740
- Except they do breathe most days.

98
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,580
- You're breathing right now?

99
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,220
- Well, we had two days where you couldn't,

100
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,940
it wasn't as good to breathe air.

101
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,140
(laughing)

102
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,500
So for those two days,

103
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,820
that could have been a good T-shirt to wear.

104
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,260
- And how did that affect you personally,

105
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,140
your personal life. But before we go into that,

106
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,420
this is an additional Mexican beer. It's called Allende.

107
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,580
It's a golden ale and it's okay.

108
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,820
What's the closest beer that we would know that you would compare it to?

109
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:16,020
Um, probably like a, like a, like a, uh, like a beer.

110
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,340
You are worthless. Like a Bud Light?

111
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,320
No, it's more than a butt light.

112
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,100
It's like two butt lights.

113
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,500
It's heavier than a butt light.

114
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,500
Yeah.

115
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,020
But not quite a butt, a normal butt.

116
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,700
Like a butt strong, I would say.

117
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,360
Okay.

118
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:31,860
All right.

119
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,620
Like a butt heavy.

120
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,020
Yeah.

121
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,540
Butt heavy.

122
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,340
Butt wiser.

123
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,020
Right.

124
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:35,540
Red can.

125
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,080
Yeah.

126
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,980
Well, that sounds pretty good.

127
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,660
How, how has the PR affected your, your, your daily life, Caleb?

128
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,700
How are you?

129
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,460
How are you doing?

130
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,740
Well, well, let's see.

131
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,740
I edited a video of all my different kills from Valorant.

132
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,940
- Yeah, you committed a sexual assault on me.

133
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,020
- No, I didn't. - Essentially.

134
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,420
- He did deep fake Juvio. - Nobody will ever see it,

135
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,340
but I did use a deep fake to clone Juvio's voice.

136
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,260
I used the AI technology to make Juvio,

137
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,100
a fake Juvio voice.

138
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,260
And now I have, if anybody wants to make Juvio

139
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,060
say something, let me know and I'll send you the audio file.

140
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,100
What else did I do?

141
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,620
Today I ate-- - You had him say

142
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,180
some pretty terrible stuff, I'll be honest.

143
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,980
- I did, it's really bad.

144
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,820
- It's really bad.

145
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:23,500
- I did a, my diet today was I had four

146
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,660
frozen White Castle sliders.

147
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,140
- Yum. - Okay.

148
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,780
- And three pieces of pizza.

149
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,620
- That's nice.

150
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,800
- So you're health maxing.

151
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,940
- Yeah, I just don't feel very good today.

152
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,260
- Yeah, okay.

153
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,100
- Yeah.

154
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,740
- But yeah, that's it, Fred, what have you guys been up to?

155
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,900
- Oh, I've been just going outside and breathing the air.

156
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,140
Mostly.

157
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:45,580
- Cool, man.

158
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:48,900
Really fucking cool to bring that up in front of me.

159
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,380
Do you realize where I live right now?

160
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,940
- You know what I've been doing?

161
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,380
I take a little piece of fruit,

162
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,980
and I go to my balcony, and I sit,

163
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,740
and I just look at the horizon,

164
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,380
and look way, way out there in the horizon

165
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,180
where the sky looks normal, and I breathe.

166
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,000
- You eat the fruit, and you get a power like Mario,

167
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,940
Mario Sunshine, like Yoshi.

168
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,900
You are my Yoshi.

169
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,740
- I'm not Yoshi.

170
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:17,820
- You are my Yoshi.

171
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,940
I'm Mario and you're my Yoshi.

172
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,140
- Yeah, I'm gonna want Mario respects Yoshi.

173
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,620
- I respect you. - In a lot of ways.

174
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,900
- I respect any animal.

175
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,740
- But he also rode on his back

176
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:29,060
and you threw him away at every possible opportunity.

177
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,740
- You don't ride me at all.

178
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,500
- Oh, I could.

179
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,500
- I have never been ridden by you.

180
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:35,340
Okay, that's--

181
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,180
- I could ride on you.

182
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,500
- He's never ridden me, that's not true.

183
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,820
- You are my Yoshi.

184
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,340
- Yeah, your tongue is huge.

185
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,700
- He's Yoshi, right?

186
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,540
- Yeah, absolutely.

187
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,000
- No, it's my normal tongue.

188
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,840
No, it's gargantuan.

189
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,280
- Oh wow, that's actually way bigger

190
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,520
than I thought it was gonna be.

191
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,080
- Okay, show me your tongue.

192
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,680
That's not your whole tongue.

193
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,580
- My whole tongue?

194
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,200
I'll push it really far out.

195
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,280
I don't have a very big tongue.

196
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,420
We should start a Kiss cover band,

197
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,040
but we just dress up like Kiss

198
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,680
and we play like Juice WRLD songs.

199
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,840
- Yeah.

200
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,760
- Or Nirvana or something.

201
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,600
- They don't have very good songs, do they?

202
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,080
- KISS, no, they have terrible songs.

203
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,900
They're a really bad band.

204
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,840
- Yeah, let's not do that.

205
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Let's do another band.

206
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,200
Let's do Slipknot.

207
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,400
- I love how there's like a really great

208
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,700
anti-Semitic story about KISS.

209
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,120
- And what is it?

210
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,280
Are they all Jewish?

211
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,440
I know Gene Simmons is.

212
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,920
- Gene Simmons is.

213
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,000
It's a story about him meeting Haim Saban.

214
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,760
Uh, because you know who Heim Saban is?

215
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,760
I do not.

216
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,320
He's the guy that brought like power rangers to the United States.

217
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,200
Uh, and brought like X man.

218
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:51,920
Yeah.

219
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,400
He's like a billionaire from like cartoons.

220
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,440
And, uh, he wanted to make like kiss me to the X-Men.

221
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,920
Yeah.

222
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,320
Yeah.

223
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,560
You want to make that?

224
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:10,040
And, uh, like Heim Saban turns to his like Jewish lawyer and, uh, with the

225
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,860
Gene Simmons in the room and says in like Hebrew,

226
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,460
it's like, all right, now here's where we like rape him.

227
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:18,160
And Gene Simmons replies in like Hebrew.

228
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,320
He's like, you know, I can you know, Jewish, right?

229
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,220
I can speak this.

230
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,420
I would say that's even anti-Semitic.

231
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,360
Well, I think it's a Semitic.

232
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,360
It just gets passed around on like, you know, those kind of forums.

233
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,720
It's like an anecdote that gets passed.

234
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,260
Oh, I see.

235
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,320
But it is an anecdote.

236
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,060
I have an anecdote for you.

237
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:41,800
- That kind of thing.

238
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,640
- Yeah.

239
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,520
- Just a quick anti-Semitic anecdote.

240
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,080
- Yeah.

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,920
- Well, that's--

242
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,740
- I don't fuck with that.

243
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,740
- I would say if Gene Simmons was a polyglot

244
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,580
who was not Jewish but knew Hebrew for some reason,

245
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,060
then maybe the story in its retelling,

246
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,900
depending on who's telling it,

247
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,940
might be a little bit anti-Semitic.

248
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,460
- Well, if you also,

249
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,460
well, he also would have to have gone,

250
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,780
I hate the Jews and I love Hitler,

251
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,780
and maybe then I would consider anti-Semitic.

252
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,420
- Yeah, and then, "Bah!"

253
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,860
- Yeah, "Ah, I love Hitler, ah!"

254
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,700
If he did that, I would be like--

255
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:18,280
- Yeah, if he said, "I love Hitler,"

256
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,020
at the end of the story, it might be--

257
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,920
(Rex laughs)

258
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,460
Then I could guess, I could see it.

259
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,220
And even then, I mean, context matters.

260
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,100
- Yeah, true. - But, yeah, I don't know.

261
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,060
That's not the, what's the most anti-Semitic story

262
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,860
you've ever been a party to, Rex?

263
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,500
I mean, honestly, not that much.

264
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,740
Every time you go to New York, can we do this?

265
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:46,420
Yeah, I would say time Julio just sends me.

266
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:46,940
Everything.

267
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,300
Yeah. Julio just sends me.

268
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:52,980
It's funny because, you know, yeah, I'm like so nice and like generous.

269
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,940
And Julio will send me like tick tocks of people throwing change on the ground and

270
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,740
picking up.

271
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,980
They'll be like, this is you.

272
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,100
- Whoa.

273
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,260
- That's not true.

274
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,260
- Well, you have to think,

275
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:10,100
you're probably the only Jewish person

276
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,540
he's ever known in his entire life.

277
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,980
- That is true.

278
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,500
- I don't think that's true,

279
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,860
but I think you're the only person that I like

280
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,740
that I think is Jewish.

281
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,580
- Whoa.

282
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,700
- So you just assume the people you don't like are Jewish?

283
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,940
Is that annoying?

284
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:29,820
- Wow, he did say that I think is Jewish.

285
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,860
- I didn't say that.

286
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,700
- You did.

287
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,300
That's exactly what she said.

288
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
Let's guys, let's move on.

289
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,500
OK, I've done the high holidays.

290
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,300
I've done Passover.

291
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
I know I know all about it.

292
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,200
Did I've been to temple?

293
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,000
I've seen this one.

294
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,900
Yeah, the shofar.

295
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,100
I love that shit.

296
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,500
What's that?

297
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,200
It is fun.

298
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,600
The shofar is a big Ram's horn that they blow into during their

299
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,700
like church.

300
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,100
Yeah, there's a really no why the holiday.

301
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,740
So like a blow the ram's horn.

302
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,540
There's a specific way you have to blow it.

303
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,240
So how it's like starts.

304
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,240
And there's no designated service.

305
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
You just do it randomly.

306
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,840
Be like, oh, OK.

307
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,940
What I saw, they just did it randomly.

308
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,540
Yeah. OK.

309
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,400
I don't remember.

310
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,340
You have to be like a designated blower.

311
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,840
Yeah. Well, it's pretty tough to blow.

312
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:26,700
Maybe for a fucking Jew.

313
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,300
What did you go to temple for?

314
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,040
What were you doing?

315
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,080
-He's dating a girl, dude. -Yeah, I dated a chosen one

316
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,240
for some time.

317
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,240
Not Rakana, I wasn't doing Rakana.

318
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,240
[LAUGHTER]

319
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,240
I wasn't there trying to spot a weakness.

320
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,680
[LAUGHTER]

321
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,280
He was drawing a layout of the temple.

322
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,320
Yeah.

323
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,760
I was drawing a layout.

324
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,360
I was drawing a foul during a layout

325
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,960
because we play basketball outside.

326
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,320
They do always have a basketball court outside the temple.

327
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,700
Dude, it's so much fun playing with like old Jewish guys.

328
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,800
They take it very seriously.

329
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,200
They have the their their old Jewish guys are so far from athletic,

330
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,200
but they are nice at basketball.

331
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,900
Yeah, they are fucking nice.

332
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,900
They're the epitome of like the white guy who just drains his free throws.

333
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,800
Outside shots, mid range jumpers.

334
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,600
They're all five foot six, but somehow getting way above me.

335
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,560
Yeah, I can't do anything about it.

336
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,060
Yep.

337
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:30,120
When are we going to start our own basketball team?

338
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,520
I've been wanting to play basketball so bad recently.

339
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
Oh.

340
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,360
Is it because of the NBA Finals?

341
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
Yes, it is.

342
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
Just watching them on the TV.

343
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,280
I've been watching them and I've been taking Phil to the park and walking by all these

344
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:43,880
kids playing basketball and I just love how mean they are.

345
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,040
It's like, I like any sport or game, that's why I like video games too, I like being mean

346
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,760
to my closest friends.

347
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,760
Yeah.

348
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,960
It's like in kind of a fun way.

349
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,560
We have a new game that Julio and I have been playing.

350
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,560
What have you been playing?

351
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
It's called Friends vs. Friends.

352
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,560
It's either a 1v1 or 2v2.

353
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,640
And yeah, we're so mean to each other.

354
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,640
What is it?

355
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
Just an FPS deck builder.

356
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,640
It's an FPS card game.

357
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,640
Oh, I think I've seen this.

358
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,640
Yeah, it's fun.

359
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:21,080
We are very rude to each other and we call each other bad words.

360
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,960
One of us always cries about the netcode every single night.

361
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,380
Because we play on Julio's servers.

362
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,720
We keep playing on East and he keeps crying about it.

363
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,340
I'm not East.

364
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,640
Why would you play on East? Play on West.

365
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,260
Because it's the best server according to the game.

366
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,760
That's bullshit.

367
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,220
Unless you hop in on Friends vs. Friends, I don't want to hear it from you.

368
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,600
No ice having a...

369
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Hop in right now!

370
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,140
Right fucking now, let's go!

371
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,640
No.

372
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,720
- That's not the podcast, I'll play this shit right fucking now.

373
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,740
Two versus one, you two versus me.

374
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,420
- Okay, you have to buy it.

375
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,100
Yeah, it's six dollars. - I'm out.

376
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,940
I am out.

377
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,620
I never wanna play this game.

378
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,300
This game is terrible.

379
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,820
- Let him go.

380
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,820
It's a good game.

381
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,900
It is fun.

382
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,720
- I need a new game.

383
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,420
I've been thinking about, I saw a video

384
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,640
where some people played Battleship

385
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,700
against each other online,

386
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,740
and I got really into the thought of playing Battleship.

387
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,660
- That's crazy.

388
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
That's a really boring game.

389
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,660
We can play that on your iPhone, right?

390
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Shut up.

391
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,660
I want to play it on my computer.

392
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
And I want to

393
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
I thought about maybe

394
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,660
I wanted to, before I made my gaming

395
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
montage, I wanted to maybe get

396
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
a bunch of clips of me playing like Tetris

397
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,660
and maybe like me solving a crossword

398
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,660
and stuff and putting those as highlights

399
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
in there. Maybe I'll do that for the next one.

400
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,660
I don't think there's a single crossword you could solve

401
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,660
by yourself.

402
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,500
- You really think that?

403
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,860
You really think that I don't have

404
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,980
a six day streak on my crossword right now

405
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,140
and I'm not a New York Times crossword subscriber?

406
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,940
Are you a fucking moron?

407
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,360
Are you a lepton?

408
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,820
Just to showcase how ginormous my vocabulary is?

409
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:04,460
- I don't think you're using that word right.

410
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,260
- Funny enough, the first person I started

411
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,020
all this discussion, I think Rex is a bad friend.

412
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:15,580
- I would cook Rex in any time crossword.

413
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,660
- Any crossword. - I'm grease.

414
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,920
- Any cross, yes, you are a grease ball.

415
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,480
Any crossword.

416
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,300
Any crossword, I will cook you in.

417
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,400
Time it any day of the week, let's go.

418
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,680
- All right, we'll do a Monday.

419
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,460
- I'll put $100 on it.

420
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,060
- Show me. - You'll do a Monday, you pussy?

421
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,860
- Well, I'm trying to go down for you, I assume.

422
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,940
- Oh, let's do Thursday.

423
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,260
Thursday's the hardest one.

424
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,140
- I'm pretty sure Friday, Sunday's the hardest one.

425
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,540
- Sunday is the biggest one, not the hardest one.

426
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,960
- Oh God, you're so stupid.

427
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,840
You don't even know what you're talking about.

428
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,500
You're going to get destroyed.

429
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,060
- I could destroy you in any game.

430
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,980
Jeopardy, I could wipe the floor with you.

431
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,860
- You just don't even know what you're talking about.

432
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,500
No, you're just an idiot, dude.

433
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,460
You've never beaten me in a single game.

434
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,460
- Okay, okay, here we go.

435
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,300
- That is true.

436
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:12,060
- Okay, guys, let's, we can solve this very easily.

437
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,720
We will hold a show match of, what,

438
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,800
like three to five different games.

439
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,640
- Okay.

440
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:22,440
- And we'll decide the winner and who's the best at games,

441
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,520
whoever reaches it on these games.

442
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,600
We'll do crosswords, we'll do Jeopardy, I guess.

443
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,440
I don't know.

444
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,480
- How do you do Jeopardy?

445
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,320
How are we gonna do Jeopardy?

446
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,140
- I don't know.

447
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,980
He said Jeopardy.

448
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,120
I don't know why he said Jeopardy.

449
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,000
- That's just watching Jeopardy

450
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,120
and yelling out the answer.

451
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,960
(laughing)

452
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,200
- There's no winning that.

453
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,120
You can't win that.

454
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,120
I want to see you bleed.

455
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
No, we could do that.

456
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,120
We could definitely do that.

457
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,120
Just pick a random episode of Japanese.

458
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
I will destroy you.

459
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,120
You don't know what you've just gotten yourself into.

460
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
I would put you back in third grade like Billy Madison, dude.

461
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,120
You wish I was in third grade.

462
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
Yeah, because you need to repeat it.

463
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
No, because you're a pedophile.

464
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,120
If I was in third grade, you would literally...

465
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
I would be fingered.

466
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,120
You'd be fingering my nose.

467
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,120
You'd be fingering my eyeballs.

468
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,120
You'd be fingering my scabs.

469
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,120
You'd be so disgusting with my little body.

470
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,120
That is true.

471
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,120
I would just pick you up like a basketball.

472
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,120
I'd palm your head.

473
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,120
You couldn't palm a fucking ping pong ball.

474
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,120
I'll beat you in any sport.

475
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:29,120
I'll beat you in any test of

476
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,120
mental anything.

477
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Acuity, fortitude, knowledge.

478
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
You're done.

479
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,840
- Now this is now a lifelong crusade.

480
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,100
The fact that you insulted me with your crossword gambit.

481
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,120
This is a lifelong crusade.

482
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,200
- I like how your vocabulary has just completely changed.

483
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,840
(laughing)

484
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,480
- Can I ask you a question?

485
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,360
Are you still like a New York Times games subscriber?

486
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,200
Okay.

487
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,020
- You play the pussy ones.

488
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,620
You play wordle, you play the bee one.

489
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,000
What's that called?

490
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,840
- Bee word?

491
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,800
- Spelling bee, you play spelling bee.

492
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,960
- I did play that once or twice.

493
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,800
God you're gay. It's included in the subscription. I don't know what you want

494
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:18,280
He only plays it cuz it's included in a $5 subscription

495
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:24,880
What the fuck is wrong with you? Did you watch the army hammer documentary cuz you have a Netflix subscription?

496
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:30,880
No, but you know, but now that you know about it, you're going to I mean I might as well

497
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,220
Yeah, you're done you pay for Netflix. No, I'm actually I do. Yeah, I

498
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:39,820
Think that Netflix change finally hit us

499
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:46,460
They're kicking us out. Mmm. I think what is it start because you share your parents or something?

500
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,940
Yeah, my my uncles

501
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:49,920
looks

502
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,540
Mmm, and they're finally kicking us out and you know

503
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:58,820
That I all gotta say is Netflix. I'm doing that the thing that Kayla's interacts right now, but to you directly

504
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,760
OK. So I'm challenging the entirety of Netflix on a crossword

505
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,380
and basketball, one v one in Jeopardy games

506
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,820
so I can have a free a free password.

507
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,700
You won't get a free password out of Netflix?

508
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,520
Probably not. No.

509
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,820
Yeah. I'm not going to pretend like I'm would win in any test of athletics against you.

510
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,400
I have a job that destroys my body, whereas you

511
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
podcast for a living.

512
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
So, you know, there's just no conversation.

513
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,500
You say that because you work on an Oriel rig.

514
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,500
You sit and-

515
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Oriel rig?

516
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,300
I work at a computer for 80 hours.

517
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
It's worse.

518
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,000
You spend most of your day on Discord calls with this guy.

519
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's your job.

520
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
That is not true.

521
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
That's your fucking job.

522
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That is not true.

523
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,300
How does that destroy your buddy?

524
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,800
Get a standing desk.

525
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:46,800
I have a standing desk.

526
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
That's your fault.

527
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,500
You're sitting down at it!

528
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,000
Wait, so-

529
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's a podcast.

530
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Make it send.

531
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,500
[laughter]

532
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,300
I know for a fact you've never stood at this desk.

533
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,700
Wait, it disconnected!

534
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,700
*laughter*

535
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,700
*laughter*

536
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
It disconnected!

537
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
*laughter*

538
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
*laughter*

539
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,700
*laughter*

540
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
*laughter*

541
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,700
Oh my god!

542
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,700
Oh, how did I know that was gonna happen?

543
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Why were you so stupid?

544
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Oh, hello. Hello, hello.

545
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,540
- Hello.

546
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:28,100
- Yeah, I think in a game of wits, I think I'm beating you.

547
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,420
Based on what we just saw,

548
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,420
I think you've just disqualified yourself.

549
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,220
- I don't think he can hear us.

550
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:36,620
- He can't. - Can he hear us?

551
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,860
Can he hear us?

552
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,620
- I see you pretending.

553
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,620
- Oh my God.

554
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,840
- Actually, you there?

555
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,140
- Rex?

556
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,300
- I have something to say.

557
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:59,300
Wait, this is how he looks at his computer when he doesn't think anyone's watching.

558
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:05,300
He strokes his chin!

559
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,300
He strokes his chin!

560
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:15,300
For all the audio listeners, Rex completely, he went to do his stand-up desk and he's gone

561
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,300
again.

562
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,300
He hit the thing.

563
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,300
He hit his stand-up desk.

564
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:24,300
It went up and it disconnected him and now he's back and he can hear us.

565
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
Now he's quizzically looking.

566
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:32,300
We just got Rex, we recorded a lot of you looking at, this is your problem solving face, you do this go.

567
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Oh, what the?

568
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
Oh, what?

569
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Oh my god.

570
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,300
That is the funniest thing I have ever seen.

571
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,300
Oh god.

572
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
But it's been that Rex is having a problem.

573
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
Uh oh.

574
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,300
I can hear him.

575
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:56,300
Uh, okay.

576
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Stop moving the desk.

577
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Oh my god.

578
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
Alright Rex, why don't you explain what just occurred.

579
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,300
So the standing desk went up

580
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
and it unplugged my router.

581
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
Yeah.

582
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
Which by the way is proof that you've never

583
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:17,300
That's not true. I do it all the time.

584
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:21,300
Why would the router cable not reach if you do it all the time?

585
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
No, the plug is just against the wall.

586
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,300
So I just...

587
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,300
I completely believe you.

588
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,300
It's fine. It's still unplugged because it just is now on Wi-Fi.

589
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,300
It just took a second to switch over.

590
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,300
No, I really do believe you.

591
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:36,300
I don't know why you wouldn't.

592
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Yeah, you're right. It'd be absurd for me to not believe that.

593
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,940
Listen, you can believe it if you want to. I'm telling you.

594
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:52,980
I do. I do believe you. I do. Everything about the room that I see behind this man tells me,

595
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,260
this guy has a standing desk that he uses all day every day. Well, actually,

596
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:02,220
the fact that you have so many supplements makes me think that you are doing some work

597
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,060
to counteract the toll that this job takes on your body.

598
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,020
Yeah.

599
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,860
- Yeah.

600
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,700
- I'll try.

601
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,260
- Sometimes I do want Rex to just go around his room

602
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:14,060
and just explain what everything on the floor

603
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,860
and on the walls is, just a little room tour.

604
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,220
- I don't think there's anything to explain.

605
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,380
It's just either clothes or trash or books.

606
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,740
- We need a tactical nuke in this room.

607
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,060
- It's fun. - Yeah.

608
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:28,260
- When you move, are you gonna get rid

609
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,740
of everything you own?

610
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,300
- No, but I will hide it better.

611
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,700
- I don't think that's true.

612
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,980
You're not going to pare down a little bit?

613
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,900
I mean, I might,

614
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,940
but probably just do it there and just throw it on the street

615
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,820
out the window. Like it's,

616
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:52,260
how have you felt about all of these New Yorkers complaining about the air

617
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:57,140
quality? Meanwhile, it's basically what the air quality is every day in LA.

618
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:01,380
I, you know, New Yorkers love to complain.

619
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,360
There's just something genetic about it

620
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,960
that makes them want to complain.

621
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,140
I think that's what it is.

622
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,380
- Something that unites them.

623
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:14,180
- I love the concept of like,

624
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,060
people are like, "Oh, it's like smoking a cigarette

625
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,180
"without any of the nicotine."

626
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,780
And it's like, well, I vape 24/7,

627
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,020
so my lungs are already acclimated

628
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,820
to whatever it's gonna throw at me.

629
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,340
- All it's done the last couple days

630
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,300
has made me smoke more cigarettes,

631
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,860
'cause I'm like, well, I might, I mean, I'm already--

632
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,900
- Might as well.

633
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,380
- Yeah, I might as well.

634
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,820
- Do you have an air purifier?

635
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,020
- No, somebody offered to bring me one the other day

636
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,420
'cause they had a spare.

637
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,940
And I was like, it's probably just gonna be

638
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,220
like one more day of this, I don't care.

639
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,420
- Yeah.

640
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,220
- I think they said it was gonna land

641
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,580
that's until tonight now.

642
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,140
- I think they said till Saturday.

643
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:52,980
- Whoa.

644
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:55,700
- That's crazy.

645
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,980
Is the sky still completely yellow?

646
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,660
- No, that was like three hours yesterday.

647
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,820
- Oh, that's boring then.

648
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,340
- People are just big babies, man.

649
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,500
- I thought you were living in Breaking Bad for like a week.

650
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,340
- I think-- - See, that's what I mean.

651
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,020
- The picture of the Diablo poster is so funny.

652
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,940
- That is a funny photo.

653
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,820
- No.

654
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,820
- Which photo?

655
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,660
- There's a picture of the Diablo poster,

656
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,820
or Diablo screen ad in Times Square.

657
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:23,300
And it said, "Welcome to Hell, New York,"

658
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,140
and everything was orange around it.

659
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,340
Which by the way, hell is not orange, it is red.

660
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,780
- Right, like fire. - True.

661
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,100
- So nice try.

662
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,260
- Yeah.

663
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,660
Diablo, one of those games that,

664
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,540
I've been talking about Rex.

665
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,460
- Yeah. - I'm like,

666
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,960
we should maybe play it, but I'm also like,

667
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,380
I think if I make anyone play it with me,

668
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,900
they'll just hold it against me,

669
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,380
that they had to buy it and play it,

670
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,060
and no one liked it.

671
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:53,020
- I remember when I first got,

672
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:59,420
When I first built a computer, when I was 16 or 17, Diablo III had just come out.

673
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:03,180
And I bought it, and I was very excited to play it.

674
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:08,320
And I had a photo on my Instagram for a long time when I was in high school

675
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,280
that was just a picture of the Diablo III box that I just bought.

676
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,480
And it was like, "Can't wait to crack this bad boy open."

677
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,020
And then I played it and I just had no... It sucked.

678
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:20,020
It's not my kind of game at all.

679
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,760
Yeah, so what like did you know anything about the game?

680
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,260
It's like did you see Diablo?

681
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,660
You like damn the demon pretty much?

682
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,460
Yeah, yeah, I was like the demon is cool.

683
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,860
The cover is cool.

684
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,960
Yeah, people like these games.

685
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,860
That's good enough for me.

686
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:37,820
I had an idea for an invention,

687
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,700
which is you telling me this reminded me of this.

688
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:45,200
It's a it's a novelty beer cozy.

689
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,660
And when you take a sip, it's like a Billy the Big Mouse.

690
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,960
Big Mouth Bass type beer cozy.

691
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,360
So you take a sip and it's like,

692
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,260
"Hey, nice chug."

693
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,160
- Oh, that's good. - Or like, "Nice sip."

694
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,560
"Hey, good sip, bro."

695
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,360
- I could see that never getting old.

696
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:06,360
- Yeah. (laughs)

697
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,660
Yeah, I think if you could sell it for like $10,

698
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,160
it'd be a perfect novelty gift.

699
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,260
- Yeah, it'd be great. - Yeah, it's just like

700
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,060
one of those gifts that people just hate to receive.

701
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:17,160
- You had a little lip slip there,

702
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,980
And you said, "Billy the big mouse is a better idea."

703
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,720
A mouse on a wall, or a rat even,

704
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,120
that you have mounted like a fish sideways,

705
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,160
and it cocks its head out and--

706
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,280
- It's like, "Can I have a piece of cheese?"

707
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:35,360
- Sings, yeah.

708
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,860
- What do you think of this?

709
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,720
(laughing)

710
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,740
- It doesn't sing songs at all.

711
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:46,360
- Billy Bass would be better

712
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:50,120
If it looked you, it also had some kind of eye tracking technology

713
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,720
and once every couple of days, it just looked you right in the eyes

714
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,360
and asked if it could have a worm, it'd be much better.

715
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,860
Can I have a worm?

716
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,600
Hey, man, it's really hot up here.

717
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,200
Can you take me down?

718
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,940
I don't really like it on this wall.

719
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,280
It's not a good place for a pet mounted to the wall.

720
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:10,880
Do you guys think it is it is gauche to have an animal?

721
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,940
Mounted to the wall?

722
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,820
Yeah. Yes.

723
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,580
I don't like that.

724
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,080
- I don't know what gauche means.

725
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:20,380
- Is it too much?

726
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,300
- It depends on what kind of guy you are.

727
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,880
I think if you are like--

728
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,260
- I've never seen one of those and been like,

729
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,260
oh, that's something that's cool.

730
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,100
- I think if you live like--

731
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,940
- It's not cool, but I understand it

732
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,560
if you actually like hunted it or something.

733
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,240
- Even then.

734
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,820
I think that's the only way that people do it, really.

735
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,120
- I think if you live in a cabin or in a mansion,

736
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,860
You need to have something that's mounted on the wall or as a rug.

737
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,660
But if you don't, then it's illegal for you to do it.

738
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,060
The rug is definitely gauche. Get a real rug.

739
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,260
Yeah, they're not good rugs, man.

740
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,060
Yeah.

741
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,060
Yeah, but it's a thing that you killed.

742
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,160
Well, it could be something else, like a chicken.

743
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,460
Chicken rug?

744
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,760
You want a chicken rug?

745
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,160
You walk in as a golden retriever.

746
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,400
All the taxes of the rug are just chicken feet.

747
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
It's murder.

748
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,360
Yeah, what do you want to say?

749
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,100
Like it's a taxidermy for like your old pets.

750
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,960
You just make them into rugs.

751
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,640
And it's like they're just laying down sleeping.

752
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,380
That's my new idea.

753
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,580
That's my new invention.

754
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,980
This is the invention episode.

755
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:33,780
It's been able to clone like a piece of chicken.

756
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,080
Like a particularly good,

757
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,220
a particularly good chicken wing.

758
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:43,400
No, I've had this thought about food before.

759
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,480
You're not wrong, which is not,

760
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,720
not not exactly the cloning idea,

761
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,080
not that exactly, but the idea that...

762
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,480
How can you tell if it's good?

763
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,320
You ate it already.

764
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,120
That's what I'm saying.

765
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:55,720
That's what I'm saying.

766
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,840
I'm gonna clone it.

767
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,280
You take one bite and then you decide,

768
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,240
oh, I want more of this chicken wing.

769
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,560
And then you put that in some kind of

770
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,440
microwave style Spy Kids device

771
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:09,040
that spits out 500 more of whatever you put into it.

772
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,980
But I think about this all the time.

773
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,840
You ever have like a fruit, like a mango, a watermelon,

774
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,880
one of those like 50/50 fruits where it's not always as good

775
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,580
as you remember it being, but every once in a while you get one that is so, so good.

776
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:26,380
And you take a bite and you think this might be the best of this fruit

777
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:29,380
of like the entire year.

778
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,640
This might be I might have just gotten the fruit of the year.

779
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,380
If not the fruit of the year, it's in the top 1%.

780
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,380
Be able to clone that.

781
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:42,380
Yeah, and then that's all we should be eating, because sometimes you'll eat a mango and it is so bad.

782
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,380
And it's like five million pieces of floss

783
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,380
that are mango flavored, all wrapped around the ball.

784
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,380
I think we may have had an apple of the year.

785
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,380
There's an apple I still remember that I had at my mom's

786
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,380
house in probably 2013.

787
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:08,400
crisp apple and it was so, so good. I just mowed the lawn, I came in, I ate an apple

788
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,900
and it was so damn good.

789
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:18,100
Yeah, I had a really good apple, I think, it must have been around a month ago and it was

790
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:23,980
like really sweet, it was really juicy. I bought one of those apples and I had one yesterday

791
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:28,260
and it was okay, but it wasn't as juicy or sweet as the one I had.

792
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,500
They really stick with you.

793
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Yeah, a good piece of fruit will you'll remember that.

794
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:36,200
No doubt I want to I want to pink lady apple.

795
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,300
They're amazing pink lady honey crisp.

796
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,800
Yep.

797
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,900
There's another one.

798
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:46,600
I don't know but you know, it is a bad apple that people think

799
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,100
is good.

800
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,000
Fuji.

801
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,800
Yes, that is a bad apple buddy.

802
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,300
That is a mealy disgusting Apple that it tastes like a wild

803
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:56,600
Apple.

804
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,900
You ever had a wild Apple?

805
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,900
No.

806
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,380
Just the one like right off a tree somewhere?

807
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:05,380
Oh no, no, can't say I have.

808
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,060
It's disgusting. It's like apple sauce.

809
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:12,900
I went to the supermarket yesterday and I think the pink ones was whatever you said,

810
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:19,180
the pink something. I buy those but it is, I don't understand what the name

811
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:23,020
of the conditions are. Like I don't know what is the difference between apples at all.

812
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,860
Just a genomic sequence.

813
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,160
Yeah, it's like different species of apples.

814
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,860
Yeah.

815
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,160
Okay.

816
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,660
Yeah, I don't I don't fuck with that.

817
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,860
I don't fuck with different.

818
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,060
I fuck with it's like, you know, like some species are worse than

819
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,260
others.

820
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Obviously this call proves that you know, so actually our games

821
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,660
will prove that I don't think you and I are particularly different

822
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,060
species.

823
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:54,060
You think that Juvio is a different species?

824
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,860
Yeah, I told them both of you.

825
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,060
I think you have like Bigfoot maybe.

826
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,360
That's not true.

827
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,060
Some kind of Sasquatch animal.

828
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:06,060
He is 900% Neanderthal DNA.

829
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,960
No, he's not a Neanderthal.

830
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,660
He is not.

831
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,260
He's pretty tall.

832
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,960
He might be a raccoon.

833
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,360
Kind of beady little eyes.

834
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,860
Yeah, you're getting dangerously close to being racist there.

835
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,060
What?

836
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:25,140
(laughs)

837
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,980
- Resembles a raccoon a little bit.

838
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,660
- Listen, I just said dangerously close,

839
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,560
not that you were over the line in any way.

840
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,180
- But I was in danger, you're saying?

841
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,660
- Yeah.

842
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,100
- What animal do you think me and Rex are, Jibia?

843
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:46,380
- You are a turtle.

844
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,540
- Okay, Master of Disguise reference much?

845
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,480
I don't know what that is.

846
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,880
Well, you just wrote the whole movie yourself, so don't worry.

847
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,920
Rex is five.

848
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:04,220
Oh, I don't know what that is.

849
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,580
So mouse.

850
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,980
He goes West.

851
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,280
You're you're kind of like a like a like a mouse.

852
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,380
You nibble.

853
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,880
You're a nibbler.

854
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,640
What are you talking about?

855
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,680
You know, you think you're eating with me?

856
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,420
Yeah, I don't nibble. You nibble.

857
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,820
No, I eat voraciously.

858
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,820
No, you nibble and you store.

859
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:29,060
Wait, no, you're a squirrel.

860
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,360
You're a chipmunk.

861
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,560
You nibble and you store food for the winter.

862
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,760
All right, I'll buy that.

863
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,520
He's a chipmunk.

864
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,700
I do store food for later.

865
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,900
Then Jubilee, the wild fox, the raccoon eats my trash.

866
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:44,020
He is a chipmunk.

867
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,460
He's got that high ass voice.

868
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,660
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas.

869
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,560
That's you.

870
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,380
Yeah.

871
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,080
Wrecked the chipmunk.

872
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,980
Yeah.

873
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:57,680
What do you think Caleb is as an animal?

874
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,000
This beer is almost gone.

875
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,420
This was an okay beer.

876
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,480
First beer that I don't completely hate.

877
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,720
Nice.

878
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,560
20 episodes in.

879
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,380
Sort of primate.

880
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,320
Closest one to a human, I'll take that.

881
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,240
Yeah, but just a little bit off.

882
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,080
What's the biggest animal?

883
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,400
I'm the most human of the three.

884
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,800
What are the most pink animal?

885
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,080
That's not an important question to answer.

886
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,080
Baboon with an ass.

887
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,080
The baboon with the reddish ass.

888
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,080
Baboon with the ass.

889
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,080
What's the most pink animal in the world?

890
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,080
Um...

891
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,080
Some kind of like a muskrat.

892
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
Axolotl.

893
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,080
You're an axolotl.

894
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,080
I'm not an axolotl, because those can also be like blue.

895
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,080
No, if anything, I'm like a mole rat or something like that.

896
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,080
Okay, you can be that.

897
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
Like a naked cat.

898
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:49,080
Yeah, exactly. Something with like a pink bad skin.

899
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:52,080
I don't think you're a naked cat. You're very sociable.

900
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
You're very outgoing.

901
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
That is not true.

902
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,080
Some stereotype about those cats.

903
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,080
That is completely true.

904
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,080
I spend nine days of ten in my apartment.

905
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Hmm. I don't know.

906
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,080
I don't know. I've seen you interact with the outside world.

907
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:14,080
Don't tell people this shit, dude. I'm honestly fucking shy as fuck.

908
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,280
He's not shy.

909
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,580
I really am.

910
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,980
He's outgoing and sociable.

911
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,980
Yeah.

912
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,780
No, I have shyness.

913
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:23,280
Any command groups?

914
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,780
No, I'm really shy.

915
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,280
Someone showed that this one time that we're outside,

916
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,180
you demanded that the entire group stuck together around you

917
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,180
as the leader.

918
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,680
That's not true.

919
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,880
Is that true?

920
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,380
That's true.

921
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:37,880
Yeah.

922
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,380
I stuck an entire group of people around me?

923
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:41,180
Yeah.

924
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,480
I don't remember that.

925
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Where were we?

926
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:52,440
I do remember him convincing a group of people to betray a person who wasn't there and eat

927
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,280
a delicious meal without him.

928
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,520
I did not do this.

929
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
You're making this up in your head.

930
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,760
You have this idea of me.

931
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,400
That's not who I am.

932
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
That is not who I am whatsoever.

933
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
I know who you are.

934
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
You're a complete betrayer.

935
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,640
That is not me at all.

936
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,600
You've been ice cold to me ever since.

937
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:13,600
I mean, it's going to take a while for me to forgive such an egregious betrayal.

938
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,520
I don't want your forgiveness.

939
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:18,200
Cause I didn't do it in the first place.

940
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,880
It wasn't me, man.

941
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,720
It was a group effort.

942
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,360
See, here's what happens when you're the leader or at least when people

943
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,760
perceive you to be the leader, everything gets pinned on you.

944
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,120
You take, you fall on the sword.

945
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,360
No matter what I am responsible for the sins of all.

946
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,520
How does that, who was driving the car?

947
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,560
(clears throat)

948
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:41,400
- Who, that is,

949
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,080
how is that my fault?

950
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,480
That I'm the only one who can drive?

951
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,320
- Wait, you know what?

952
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,160
I know how to drive.

953
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,920
- You can't drive, your license is upside down.

954
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,760
- That's not true.

955
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,800
- People, if you got pulled over, you'd go straight to jail.

956
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,200
You drive on the other side of the road,

957
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,520
you have the steering wheel in the middle of the car,

958
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,120
like a cartoon, like a Richard Scarry cartoon.

959
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,080
- That's not how it is down here.

960
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,240
- I think it is.

961
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,400
- That's not how it is.

962
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,520
- I believe that. - Wait, you know what?

963
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,680
I think that's, you're right, that is completely,

964
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,740
I'm sorry, that's not fair to you.

965
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:16,640
Let's just spin it on the person who put the address,

966
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,880
no, let's spin it on the person who put the address

967
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,960
in the Google Maps and led us that way.

968
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,800
- You say that like I knew the address.

969
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,560
I looked it up, on a lark, I looked up Fogotachow,

970
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,940
I thought, oh, that's-- - On a lark?

971
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,440
- On a lark. - Oh, on a lark.

972
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,880
- I said, that's funny.

973
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,040
That'd be funny if we went-- - Oh, how whimsical it is

974
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,540
to betray my friend.

975
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,540
It wasn't even good.

976
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
It was really good.

977
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,540
You're fucking lying.

978
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,540
I didn't even like it.

979
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,540
Look at me in the eyes. Tell me that.

980
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,540
Look at me.

981
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,540
It wasn't that good.

982
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,540
(laughter)

983
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:53,540
You're new to eating meat.

984
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,540
It would upset your stomach.

985
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,540
If you ate all that meat, it would upset your stomach.

986
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,540
There's no way you could handle a pho go to chow.

987
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,540
I could handle it.

988
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,540
No, no, no. It would have made you sick.

989
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,220
doubled over in front of the toilet spewing your guts out because I thought

990
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,020
and I was enjoyed every second gracious actually I I'm not I was not even

991
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,140
gracious we as a unit me Julio and Cameron were being gracious by not

992
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:21,940
inviting you which we all consciously chose to do I found a funny

993
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,940
responsibility of this crime okay then I do too

994
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:31,740
fuck you you can't do that I bow out of any responsibility that's what you say I

995
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,740
I forgo the community.

996
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,740
I decided to not be responsible for this heinous murder.

997
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,740
I am not, yeah, I was not part of that.

998
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,740
You were completely part of it.

999
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:43,740
I was a victim. I will say it.

1000
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:48,740
Victims do not, victims do not, you do not shovel,

1001
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:53,740
victims do not shovel garlic ribeye down their gullet.

1002
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,740
No victim on earth has ever done that.

1003
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,740
That is not the meal of a victim.

1004
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,740
You caught me today.

1005
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,740
I cloned him?

1006
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,740
Oh, and he's deflecting because he knows.

1007
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,740
He knows that he ate every single bite of that steak.

1008
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,740
And with every bite he's like, "Man, this is so good that Rex would enjoy this."

1009
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,740
Rex would really have an amazing time eating this steak.

1010
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,740
I would have.

1011
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
I'm just making a case.

1012
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,740
He's the one who said, "I'm talking to Rex. He just woke up."

1013
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,740
He probably doesn't want to come.

1014
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,740
I am. No, that's not what I said.

1015
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,580
- That's not what I said, that's not what I said.

1016
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:29,420
- He probably just doesn't wanna come,

1017
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,240
let's not even check.

1018
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,080
- That's not what I said.

1019
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,380
- Let's be so careless and thoughtless

1020
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:35,100
that we don't even check.

1021
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,380
- Listen, I'm just making the case

1022
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,700
that Caleb has a history of being a betrayer.

1023
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:42,140
A leader and a betrayer.

1024
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,260
- Because I cloned you, because I cloned your voice?

1025
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,100
- Behind my back.

1026
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,920
- I own your voice.

1027
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,100
- It would have been nice for you to have cloned a steak

1028
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,500
for me and brought it home.

1029
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,380
- Buddy, you should have seen me begging

1030
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:56,460
with these fucking Brazilians.

1031
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,300
Begging.

1032
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:02,300
I said let me bet like Tony the brain no you guys don't do take out I know you

1033
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,740
don't do any kind of leftovers I know it's against some kind of Brazilian rule

1034
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:14,940
you know but please please just this one time I know a very very sick boy yeah

1035
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,940
who needs this steak he's never I needed it or it's true you were also said what

1036
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:23,180
was wrong with you that day no I don't know I think that Airbnb was making me

1037
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:29,220
sick he was sick to eat you heard it here I mean he's too sick he was too ill to

1038
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,340
probably would have healed me it probably would have made me completely probably

1039
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,900
would have made it a thousand times worse it was a six hundred thousand

1040
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,460
milligrams will never fucking know I'm right cuz you're not getting invited

1041
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:45,820
next time cuz you've been such a baby you will be a you will be a sad lonely

1042
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:50,820
man who walks into fogey to chow and says table for one please I want an all you

1043
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:53,940
can eat meat buffet for one single person.

1044
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:56,140
- The full experience, the full singular experience.

1045
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,620
- Yes, they'll say, "Do you just want drinks?"

1046
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,600
Or you wanna say to the bar, you'll say,

1047
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,900
"No, no, no, thank you, give me a big booth

1048
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,020
"and I'll just eat all by myself."

1049
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,940
- Yep.

1050
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:05,140
- That is what you will do.

1051
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,580
- And I'll take pictures and I'll send it to you.

1052
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,700
- And I'll go, "Oh man, oh wait,

1053
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,300
"I've already eaten this shit before, who gives a fuck?"

1054
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:14,340
- I think I've just come up with a fresh resolution

1055
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,000
for this entire episode.

1056
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,840
- What?

1057
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,700
- Once Rex moves to New York,

1058
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,580
we're gonna hold a show match

1059
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,200
where both of you go one-to-one on crosswords, basketball,

1060
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,620
and other games,

1061
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,900
and the winner gets to go to Photoshop by themselves.

1062
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,160
(laughing)

1063
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,980
- I don't know, this kind of sounds good.

1064
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,420
- Yeah, doesn't that sound good?

1065
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,260
- I'm down.

1066
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:42,260
We need to come up with a list of games that are

1067
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,860
somewhat neutral between the two of us.

1068
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:47,700
- Rex threw down the gauntlet,

1069
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,380
So I think he should decide half the games

1070
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:53,140
or three of the games.

1071
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,980
- Well, I would think that half of the games

1072
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:57,820
would be decided by him and half would be decided by me.

1073
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:58,660
- Yeah.

1074
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:02,220
- What three games do you think you could beat Kelvin?

1075
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:08,340
- I think, I mean, and this is no,

1076
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,860
I don't mean anything against you by this.

1077
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:13,740
I think any intellectual game I would win.

1078
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,820
- What do you think is an intellectual game?

1079
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,820
What do you think of as an intellectual, Ken?

1080
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:20,820
Anything that's not hyper-specific

1081
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,820
like trivia

1082
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,820
like basketball trivia, I would just do it.

1083
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,820
Rock, paper, scissors?

1084
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:28,820
Do you think that's intellectual?

1085
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,820
I wouldn't say so.

1086
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,820
Tic-Tac-Toe?

1087
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,820
I wouldn't say so.

1088
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,820
No. I would Tic-Tac-Toe.

1089
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,820
There is, you know, there is

1090
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,820
an art of war to, you know,

1091
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,820
rock, paper, scissors.

1092
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,820
Alright, so I'm gonna look.

1093
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,820
Wait, what's the art of war?

1094
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,820
Well, you need to name specific games. You can't just broadly say you're so stupid that I'll beat you at anything intellectual.

1095
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:52,820
Yeah, yeah, name three games.

1096
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:54,820
The question was name specific games.

1097
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:58,820
I do think I would win at a crossword puzzle.

1098
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,820
You don't do them. That's just absurd. I've seen you do crosswords with Juvio. You're terrible at them.

1099
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:06,820
That's not true.

1100
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:10,820
Yeah, you're shit. I'll pull up the VOD right now. You're a complete ass. I would smoke you.

1101
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:14,020
I mean if you want to choose it, if you want to choose that as one of your games, just

1102
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,780
know that you're destroying yourself, you're destroying any chance you have.

1103
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,380
I don't know.

1104
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:22,900
I only thought of the crossword puzzle, that was the only one I hadn't moaned.

1105
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:29,940
Well you threw down the gauntlet for the entire range of games.

1106
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,940
You said intellectual games.

1107
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,220
Name another intellectual game.

1108
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,220
I don't know.

1109
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,140
I don't know, I don't know.

1110
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,260
Why are you so tough?

1111
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,260
Do I have to... Do you think I came here with a list of games?

1112
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:44,260
I can't even think of it.

1113
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,260
This is a very funny thing to be so confident about.

1114
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,260
Just name two other games.

1115
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,260
I don't know. Clue?

1116
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,260
You're a fucking retard.

1117
00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:02,260
It's so funny. You might be the stupidest person I know.

1118
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,260
This is the funniest possible angle I can take.

1119
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,800
Choose games that you know you could beat me at League of Legends. There's plenty of games. You could beat me at what's that fun?

1120
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,800
You know you don't play that game

1121
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,300
You don't play crosswords

1122
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:20,120
Yeah, dude. How was the last time you did a crossword?

1123
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,620
Month and a half ago. Yeah, you don't play crosswords

1124
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,820
No

1125
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:33,540
You're getting cooked on crosswords. Do you have any of the gauntlet is canceled? Yeah, this is just it's absurd

1126
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:36,700
He has one single game.

1127
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:38,700
Wait a minute, Fulgurado.

1128
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:42,200
You don't have a single challenge.

1129
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,700
You have one challenge.

1130
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,700
What's a game you think you can beat me at?

1131
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,200
That's not a shooting game.

1132
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,200
Crosswords.

1133
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:52,200
Besides crosswords.

1134
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,200
Name another game.

1135
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,200
(laughter)

1136
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:58,200
(laughter)

1137
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,200
(laughter)

1138
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,200
Name a single game.

1139
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:04,200
(laughter)

1140
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:14,960
Gabe Gauntlet let's do it. It's hard. Games on the brain. Well I'm not the one who said

1141
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,560
the challenge so it shouldn't be on me. I mean I didn't walk into this thinking I was

1142
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:25,360
going to challenge you to anything. Well you issued the challenge. That's true. Intellectual

1143
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:32,720
games. I think general trivia. We might be even match but I mean any man is going to

1144
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,100
say that they're going to beat somebody else in trivia so I have to say that I would beat

1145
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,100
you.

1146
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,620
That's why I was saying Jeopardy if we could figure out a way to.

1147
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,620
Let's just do a straight up IQ test.

1148
00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:49,300
Okay, I've just done a search for intellectual games and the first nine results are chess.

1149
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,420
Chess, you can play chess.

1150
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,180
Rex is bad at chess, you can see his face.

1151
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,180
Yeah I'm not good at chess.

1152
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:01,380
That's the most intellectual game, I can't believe you can think of it.

1153
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,980
- I don't know what Elevate is.

1154
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,180
Sudoku, Crossword, Mahjong.

1155
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:09,580
- I've never played Mahjong.

1156
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,980
- I'm Mahjong.

1157
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:12,540
- I wouldn't win at Mahjong.

1158
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,380
- Probably.

1159
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,420
- Well, that's more of a spiritual connection kind of thing.

1160
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:16,980
And also you know how to play the game.

1161
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:19,140
- Yeah, I play Mahjong almost every night.

1162
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:21,220
- What?

1163
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:22,060
Is that true?

1164
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:22,900
- Yeah.

1165
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,740
- That's crazy.

1166
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,140
- I play online with Chinese people on an app on my phone.

1167
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:31,220
- Do you do well?

1168
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,220
I'm okay. On one of my old accounts I was like...

1169
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,220
Celestial. Which was a writing.

1170
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:42,220
That means nothing to me. I don't know what celestial is.

1171
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:45,220
That's gotta be good. That's gotta be pretty high.

1172
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,220
Okay.

1173
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:51,220
What other intellectual games could we play?

1174
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:54,220
Tetris is the last one.

1175
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,220
Oh, I'm a beast at Tetris.

1176
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:59,220
Wait, the one that we could do so easily is Connect 4.

1177
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:04,220
- That is, I think, more of a battle of who is the stupidest

1178
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,580
more so than who's the smartest.

1179
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:10,020
One time I played Connect Four with Patrick at a bar

1180
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,220
and I think I beat him 25 times in a row.

1181
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,480
(laughing)

1182
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,480
- That is by definition an intellectual game.

1183
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:19,320
- Yeah.

1184
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,340
It would be funny to just take an IQ test.

1185
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,980
- Take a straight up.

1186
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,460
(laughing)

1187
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,460
One time me and Cameron in college,

1188
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,420
we took an IQ test.

1189
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:32,420
We literally did that.

1190
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:35,540
We took an online IQ test at the exact same time

1191
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:37,100
and we got our results

1192
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,340
and he got one point higher than me on the thing.

1193
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:41,700
And what was the result?

1194
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,740
I don't know.

1195
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,180
It brought up in the 300s, 400s.

1196
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,860
I would, I could see that.

1197
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:51,900
I could see him being one point smarter than you.

1198
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:53,580
Yeah, it really was such a,

1199
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:56,180
it confirmed basically every suspicion I ever had

1200
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:00,680
about the difference between our levels of intelligence,

1201
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,080
which is that he is one point higher than me.

1202
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:03,920
- Yeah.

1203
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,080
Yeah. - Yeah.

1204
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,840
- I think I took an IQ test like three months ago

1205
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:11,120
and my IQ dropped like 20 points.

1206
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:14,500
So you might, there might be a chance there.

1207
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,480
- Did you, but isn't IQ,

1208
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,040
don't you need like to go take an IQ test?

1209
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,080
You have to have like a proctor there

1210
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:21,920
and it's like this administered thing.

1211
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,560
- Yeah, but there's so many online ones that you can take.

1212
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,480
Mine went from like 139 to like 120.

1213
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:28,480
I was like, oh, right.

1214
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,960
I've just become massively stupider in the last few years.

1215
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:34,960
- I also think definitely since the time

1216
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,680
that me and Cameron took those IQ tests,

1217
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:39,760
I've definitely become a lot stupider.

1218
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,600
See, that's a perfect example.

1219
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,680
I feel like I used to have some kind of pride

1220
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,360
in being a somewhat smart person.

1221
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,080
And not even to say I was smart,

1222
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,080
but I thought I was smart,

1223
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:54,080
and it was something that I thought was a virtue.

1224
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:55,080
Yeah.

1225
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,920
And now I don't hold that at all.

1226
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,920
Like I really just, I'm way too stupid.

1227
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,960
Well, I think that when you're like in school, you think you're smart because you're like,

1228
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,800
you know, at least you're like taking shit in.

1229
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,800
You're forced to learn all the time, yeah.

1230
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:06,800
Yeah.

1231
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,320
But now that you're a grown up, what are you doing?

1232
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,680
You're sitting in your apartment eating pizza all day.

1233
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:17,480
Well not all day, I ate pizza for 20 minutes and then I ate the sliders for another 10

1234
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,360
probably, if that, honestly, I shoveled them down.

1235
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,360
Yeah.

1236
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:22,420
- I'd like a big glass of milk too

1237
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,920
if you wanna know everything I ate.

1238
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,000
(laughing)

1239
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,280
- Just eating like a 15 year old.

1240
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:29,480
- Eating worse than a 15 year old.

1241
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:34,440
Eating like a last meal type of day.

1242
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:35,280
- Yeah.

1243
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,600
- Like just weirdly specific,

1244
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,360
kind of pregnancy craving type of day.

1245
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,200
- Right.

1246
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,400
- Yeah, you're like if a nine year old

1247
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,840
was left with some devices.

1248
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,420
- I like to think that my perfect life is,

1249
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:49,600
have you ever seen the movie Blank Check?

1250
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,760
- Yeah.

1251
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:59,840
It's about an 11-year-old boy who basically gets unlimited money and he does a go-kart

1252
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:06,000
racing track in his backyard of the mansion that he buys and he has a friend that he hangs

1253
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,160
out with all the time who's bigger than him. Remind you of anybody?

1254
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,600
Yep. It does.

1255
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,680
It does.

1256
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:17,440
I think that kid's the smartest kid of all time. He bought real estate.

1257
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,240
Yeah.

1258
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:18,960
That's so smart.

1259
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,160
It is kind of impressive, yeah.

1260
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:26,360
He bought like a disgusting giant mansion, but probably if I had a hoe too.

1261
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,260
Did he have a hoe?

1262
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:32,560
Yeah, there's a old there's a grown woman that was with him.

1263
00:51:32,560 --> 00:51:33,960
Gold digger.

1264
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,960
Yeah, you got to look out for those men.

1265
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,560
You do once you get that blank check.

1266
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,360
It's all over.

1267
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:46,560
Now, did you guys hear the play on the plot?

1268
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,880
- The plot, the parts I remember--

1269
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:49,720
- He gets hit by a car, right?

1270
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,200
- He gets hit by the car, he's riding his bike,

1271
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,520
and then the guy writes a check to pay for his bike

1272
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:58,160
to basically be like, "No trouble, don't sue me, whatever.

1273
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:03,160
"Here's a check, put whatever amount the bike cost."

1274
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,600
And just cash the check.

1275
00:52:06,600 --> 00:52:09,240
And then I don't even know if they show him

1276
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,520
writing how much he cashes it for.

1277
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,600
But also the check, what I've always thought about

1278
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,800
that movie is if you're the kid, you have to strike this balance between as much money

1279
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:26,640
as you can, but then also you have to think, this guy doesn't have, like I don't know how

1280
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,160
much money this guy has, he drives a nice car.

1281
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:33,800
Yeah, only a kid would think that he has $20 million in a bank account.

1282
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:34,840
Yeah, exactly.

1283
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:40,920
And then also, I think the rest of the movie is the guy being like, "Where'd my money go?"

1284
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,440
As if it's some kind of, like it's just for, because the kid got clipped on his bike, doesn't

1285
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:48,040
go to the hospital, no major injuries.

1286
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,440
You just like broke his bike.

1287
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,080
The kid gets a still $20 million from some guy.

1288
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:56,420
No past movie.

1289
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,680
It is good.

1290
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,020
So like a stupid movie to me,

1291
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,020
they don't make movies like that anymore.

1292
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,760
They really don't.

1293
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,060
You couldn't make a movie like that.

1294
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,800
Every movie and every game that comes out now is bad.

1295
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,760
Yeah.

1296
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,500
And I've been I've been thinking about this because I think

1297
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,940
Unfortunately, at the end of the year,

1298
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,560
the Zelda game is gonna be crowned

1299
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,940
as the game of the year,

1300
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:23,100
but it's so boring and bad.

1301
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,520
- Yeah, it doesn't look very interesting.

1302
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:26,860
I'm not very interested in that game.

1303
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:29,220
- No, it's really bad for eight hours,

1304
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:32,140
and then you finally get to just explore the world,

1305
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,500
and it's fun for a little bit,

1306
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,460
but then you're like, okay, well, this is just boring again.

1307
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,580
I got like, I don't wanna do this shit

1308
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,760
for like a billion hours.

1309
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,600
- Yeah.

1310
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:42,940
- Meanwhile, I'm getting attacked by a bunch of videos

1311
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,620
so that people just have like the most overpowered shit

1312
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:47,180
of all time.

1313
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,700
And there's just no games.

1314
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,220
There's no games at all.

1315
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:51,360
That's my conclusion.

1316
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:56,740
- There's Diablo, man, and there's Crosswords, man.

1317
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:01,740
- Diablo seems pretty easy and boring.

1318
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:05,540
- Crosswords have actually gotten worse, I think.

1319
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,060
The last, in the last month,

1320
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,300
probably 10 of the Crosswords I've done

1321
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:16,300
have been, one of the words in the crossword have been ass.

1322
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:19,540
And you can tell that they think they're so cute

1323
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,900
because they're like, we put ass

1324
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,140
in the New York Times crossword.

1325
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:26,460
And it's just, I'm over it, dude.

1326
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,500
- That is really pathetic to me.

1327
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,180
- They need to let Cameron design crosswords.

1328
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:31,180
He'd be really good at it.

1329
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,860
- I think, yeah, I think when we start

1330
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,260
our own independent media business,

1331
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,900
I think crossword publishing and editing

1332
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:44,940
should be one of our markets that we attack. I think you should do paparazzo.

1333
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,820
Me? You should become a paparazzo.

1334
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:53,380
How am I – okay, like go out there and take pictures of people. I don't take a lot of pictures.

1335
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:58,240
No, but I just think that you'd be a funny kind of paparazzi person.

1336
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,860
Yeah. Maybe.

1337
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:04,460
You should be trying to get upskirts of people and then when they yell at you,

1338
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,620
you say, "Sorry, I thought you were famous."

1339
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,340
I thought you were famous.

1340
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:09,340
Sorry, I thought you were a famous celebrity.

1341
00:55:09,340 --> 00:55:13,340
I don't think they let you do that.

1342
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:17,340
Have you seen those, like the phones in Japan,

1343
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,340
where you can't take a picture without it making the shutter noise? They should give those

1344
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,340
to Jubio.

1345
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,340
I agree. He does take creep shots.

1346
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,340
He always does that. He always does that.

1347
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,340
Every time he goes to New York City,

1348
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,340
he comes back

1349
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,340
and he posts a photo dump somewhere

1350
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:35,340
and I see photos of myself that I never OK'd.

1351
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,940
that I never okayed.

1352
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,420
- Yep, I never presented.

1353
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,140
- You want me to send you,

1354
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:40,980
you want to okay--

1355
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,220
- At least Photoshop some hair on my fucking head

1356
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,340
if you're gonna post these photos online.

1357
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,860
- Here, I haven't really thought about,

1358
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:49,680
I always do a photo dump after a trip,

1359
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,500
and I haven't really thought about what I would,

1360
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:52,940
if I was gonna do one,

1361
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:54,260
but I wanna do one,

1362
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,020
and the one picture that I'm gonna put of Kelvin

1363
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,500
is the one where you're like standing in front of your dog

1364
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,460
that's just shitting on the floor.

1365
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,700
(laughing)

1366
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:03,760
- Not the floor, the street.

1367
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:07,380
(laughing)

1368
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,940
- Have you seen that photo? - No, bro.

1369
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,240
- That's my memory of you.

1370
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:19,060
- I mean, to be fair, that is, you know,

1371
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:20,740
a huge chunk of my life.

1372
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:24,300
Is standing there watching an animal

1373
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,560
that should be wild, just shit.

1374
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,460
- It is funny how big he is

1375
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,720
and how small your apartment is.

1376
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:34,380
- Yeah, we thought about moving, but it's too expensive.

1377
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,780
So we're just going to torture him.

1378
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,340
Yeah, you should be reported as one of those people who put a fish in a tank

1379
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,220
that's too small for them.

1380
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:45,180
Well, sometimes there's this dog that we see at the dog park every once in a while

1381
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:47,940
that probably weighs 110 pounds.

1382
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,500
And it's like, I don't even know what breed it is,

1383
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:55,060
but there is no living situation in New York City

1384
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,380
in which that is not animal cruelty.

1385
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,540
Yeah, it was like huge dogs.

1386
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:03,060
It's like the size of a person.

1387
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:09,140
It's the size of, yeah, I mean, I mean, it's it's the weight of a person, but it's the size of two people. It's huge.

1388
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:09,860
Okay.

1389
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,100
It's a huge fucking dog.

1390
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,540
Yeah. Yeah, those that

1391
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,180
You should be able to keep those in the city.

1392
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:22,380
Get the, well, well, well, Juvio's sexism jumps right out.

1393
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:24,660
I didn't know what she was.

1394
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:27,540
It's a girl owner.

1395
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,340
Okay.

1396
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:28,740
Well, I didn't know that.

1397
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:29,900
It is a girl owner.

1398
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,660
Of course you didn't know that, but you assumed.

1399
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,900
And you know what happens when you assume?

1400
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,900
I wasn't assuming.

1401
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,900
You were. You did assume. You said he should be sent to prison or whatever. You said he.

1402
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,900
Guys, there's too much divide in this episode.

1403
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,900
We need to come together and say one thing that we love about each other right now.

1404
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,900
Okay.

1405
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:54,900
And go.

1406
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,900
Caleb.

1407
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:56,900
Oh, I'm starting?

1408
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,900
Yeah.

1409
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:01,900
I have to think about it so I need to go all the way around.

1410
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,900
I'll start, I'll start. Caleb,

1411
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:09,900
I love how bald you are. And I love that you wear

1412
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:13,900
a different hat every time to cover it up.

1413
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,900
I thought we were going to go deep, I thought we were going to dig deep.

1414
00:58:17,900 --> 00:58:21,900
Here, I'll go next, I'll go next, I'll go next. Rex,

1415
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:25,900
I love all the quality time that we spend together almost every night.

1416
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:31,600
You're one of the people that I talk to the most and you know just one of my

1417
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:37,860
closest friends and Caleb I really love how you gave me a job.

1418
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:53,860
Getting short shrift here this is not right. Rex you make me laugh more than

1419
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:56,260
than anybody in the world.

1420
00:58:56,260 --> 00:59:00,820
You're you have the sweetest smile, the sweetest laugh of anybody.

1421
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:01,740
I love that.

1422
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,780
You're always willing to talk about anything.

1423
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,620
You're a very open person and you're very empathetic person.

1424
00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:10,380
I love that about you.

1425
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:16,180
Jubiel, my little cuddle bear.

1426
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:19,780
I love feeling you.

1427
00:59:19,780 --> 00:59:21,300
I love being embraced by you.

1428
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,180
When I touch you, it's like almost magical to me.

1429
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:31,620
The quality time that we've been able to spend with each other is,

1430
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:34,700
is something I would trade for the world. Okay.

1431
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:38,380
I consider you part of my family and you're one of my best friends in this

1432
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:42,380
entire universe, in the universe. And, um,

1433
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:45,820
your top five dead or alive, man.

1434
00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:49,060
And I'd kill,

1435
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:55,300
I'd kill hundreds and thousands of people for you.

1436
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,300
And I need you in my life.

1437
00:59:58,300 --> 00:59:59,260
I need you.

1438
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,100
- And I'm also not a Joshi.

1439
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:00,940
- I need you.

1440
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:01,760
I need you badly.

1441
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,520
- I'm also not your Joshi.

1442
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,680
- And you're not my Joshi.

1443
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:08,560
You're not Joshi.

1444
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:09,400
- That's true.

1445
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,980
- You're not Joshi.

1446
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,220
You're nothing like that.

1447
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:13,340
- Okay, I'm from a different country.

1448
01:00:13,340 --> 01:00:14,260
Very funny.

1449
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:15,860
The racism jumped out at the end.

1450
01:00:15,860 --> 01:00:18,020
- You said Joshi.

1451
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:28,520
You said that. He did say Joshi. So I don't know if you're talking about Yoshi or if you have some fucked up stupid Mexican character called-

1452
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,520
There's a bread mascot named Joshi. Called Joshi? How's that racist?

1453
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:39,520
Some kind of football fucking mascot named Joshi? I don't know anything. Fuck you!

1454
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,020
I'm saying all these nice things about you. Go fucking kill yourself. Fuck you.

1455
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,260
(laughing)

1456
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,300
- Anything to add?

1457
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:51,400
- You look like Bimbo.

1458
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:55,540
- Who's Bimbo? - The bread, the bread mascot.

1459
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:58,980
- The bread, no that's, no, you're dumb.

1460
01:00:58,980 --> 01:01:00,580
I don't look like that.

1461
01:01:00,580 --> 01:01:02,660
- You do with the yellow shirt,

1462
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:05,620
you do look like the bumblebee from the Simpsons today.

1463
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:09,060
- Okay, so you're both wearing

1464
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:12,340
a white R.A.M. Brothers t-shirts.

1465
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:13,700
You're both the white brothers today.

1466
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,660
okay I don't think anyone should be throwing arian around with that mustache

1467
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:23,140
yeah you do a full Hitler mustache your body naturally produces a Hitler

1468
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:30,260
mustache. How does that feel? It only comes in in the Hitler area. That's not true. What is it?

1469
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:40,180
Look at that hand! That's not true! Watch the hand big fella what the fuck was that man?

1470
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:46,020
man. Okay. We need to make sure he never plays basketball. A picture of him

1471
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:51,800
trying to block a shot would be detrimental. No. He's just... He's posted

1472
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:58,180
up, just trying to block like this. Way too low. I'm trying to cover his eyes.

1473
01:01:58,180 --> 01:02:04,080
Okay. That's not funny. That's not funny. Alright. Well, I think we ended

1474
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:06,080
Pass me the ball guys.

1475
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,080
(laughter)

1476
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,080
He's doing it all the time.

1477
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:12,080
Trying to call a time out like that.

1478
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,080
Okay, okay.

1479
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:16,080
That's enough.

1480
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,080
And goodbye.
