00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:32,960

22
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,720
Nah.

23
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:36,540
'Cause if it is then I would be like,

24
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,600

00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,200
Oh, that's good.

26
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,960
But I have to know the number to say that.

27
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,600

- Episode number one.

48
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Yeah, that's what the Episoda is.

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Yeah, and we gotta get the sips in the...

50
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,880

00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,880

52
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Number 1-888-377-3773, drpepper.com.

53
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,880
Why don't you do me a favor and open up that,

54
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,880
and then we'll record the sound of it opening.

55
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,880
I don't think that they have that much of a hiss.

56
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,880
I think you'd be pretty surprised. It's not like a can tab poppin'.

57
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Yeah.

58
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
And you know what? Let's get into our first topic.

59
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
Yeah.

60
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Is Diet Dr. Pepper, does it taste better in a bottle or a can?

61
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,440
can I'm gonna say every soda for the most part tastes better in a can yep I was

62
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,200
gonna say that too yeah yeah but I said it first so I think it's best in your

63
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,680
imagination it tastes best in your mouth yeah it tastes in imagination I mean you

64
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,360
can't really replicate what it really tastes like uh-huh

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,080
so it's always gonna taste a little better cuz you're a dream like flavor

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,280
the ranking to me is an interesting discussion can and then and then glass

67
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,440
bottle mm-hmm and then plastic bottle and then cup and then probably like dog

68
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,020
poop bag would it be under that a chilled chilled glass a heart yeah or a hard

69
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:36,440
plastic cup from a restaurant one of the red ones oh pretty good when we went to

70
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,320
cookout in the south little ice pellets in the styrofoam cup never really had

71
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,160
that before that I think well you the best way to have a soda you've never

72
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,960
had the ice pellets they don't do that up north I don't think that's us Yankees

73
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Is that true?

74
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,960
No, not really.

75
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,960
Unless you go to Sonic.

76
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Really?

77
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Unless you go to Sonic.

78
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,960
You guys call that Sonic ice?

79
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,360
We got that everywhere down there.

80
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,360
Yeah.

81
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,360
Sometimes you go to a restaurant and they have the ice machine makes that ice.

82
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,360
Wow.

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,360
That's cool.

84
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,960
And that would be perfect if they had Diet Dr. Pepper in the machines.

85
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,120
I wonder why that would be a southern thing.

86
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
We drink more soda.

87
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,120
I don't know.

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
Soda capital of the world.

89
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,160
Maybe it's warmer so they need different types of ice.

90
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,600
It is warmer so you need ice with more surface area.

91
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Yeah.

92
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
Yeah.

93
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Maybe that's it.

94
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
It's like putting a whiskey cube.

95
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,840
And maybe like that I was colder up north so the ice is harder to break

96
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:29,320
Yeah, well you do in the summer though in the summer I said I said no about the summer

97
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,520
Pretty good in a glass cup

98
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,400
In a glass cup ice in a glass cup in a frosty mug

99
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,120
Okay, diet filled with diet. Dr. Pepper diet. Dr.

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,520
Filled yeah all the way to the top where do you even find that much fucking diet doctor?

101
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,620
Trust me. I'm just I buy it just merits you buy the pallets Oh pellets or pallet

102
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,440
I buy pellets of sugar syrup and you build it and then I put it in my own. Holy fuck soda

103
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,840
I have a soda machine at home. You ever do a soda stream

104
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,820
Yeah, I want to hear before I drink my I had a

105
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:13,240
My roommate had a soda stream and then it broke. Yeah, but uh, they should call it a soda scream

106
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,640
'Cause it's the loudest fucking noise you'll ever hear in your life.

107
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,940
And it's shaped like a penguin.

108
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,340
Yeah. A penguin.

109
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:18,940
Uh-huh.

110
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,440
Yeah.

111
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,240
A penguin?

112
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,740
Yeah.

113
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,740
And they're from Israel.

114
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,240
Yeah.

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:22,740
Shout out.

116
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,940
I think my...

117
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,440
I think...

118
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,740
My grandpa had either one of those or an off-brand one of those, I feel like.

119
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,740
Let's stay on topic.

120
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,940
A soda stream?

121
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,440
Yeah, let's not get into grandpas.

122
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:32,940
Let's talk about soda.

123
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,940
Oh, I'm talking about soda stream. That's exactly what we're talking about.

124
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,240
But you mentioned "grandpa."

125
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:36,740
Yeah.

126
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:40,440
Well, my grandpa who likes soda can't be mentioned?

127
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,240
Okay, that's better.

128
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,800
- He has a soda stream, what the fuck are you talking about?

129
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,480
- Yeah, but he also has other stuff.

130
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,320
- Like what?

131
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,140
- Like what?

132
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,440
- He probably has trauma.

133
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,280
- He doesn't.

134
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,280
- He probably has drama with your grandma.

135
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,400
- Nope, not true.

136
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,560
- Your grandpapa doesn't have drama with your grandmama?

137
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
- Nope, just soda.

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
- Baby grandma?

139
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
- Nope.

140
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,920
- Okay, you're getting off topic.

141
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,760
- Yeah, he's attacking me right now.

142
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,240
- Okay, you need to stay off the topic.

143
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,760
- He's attacking my family history.

144
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,360
- Okay, let's get back to the Dr. Pepper episode.

145
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,220
The pepper-sode.

146
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,060
- Pepper soda.

147
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,880
- Diet pepper soda.

148
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,000
Diet Dr. Pepper Soda. So here's my thing man, I honestly wish that Pibb was

149
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,320
making a new appearance but the Pibb whole family, the Pibb family has

150
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:28,840
not hopped on the zero calorie train. Pibb is a deliberate knockoff I was

151
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:37,040
reading the other day. Really? Yeah. And in what terms? It used to, the

152
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:47,820
The Coca-Cola Corporation was jealous, genuinely very jealous of the sales that Dr. Pepper

153
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,820
was having in the 70s.

154
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,360
Well, what a lot of people don't realize is that Dr. Pepper is not Coke or Pepsi.

155
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,520
It's Dr. Pepper Snapple.

156
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,080
And they own Sunkist.

157
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,040
But they're not part of the big two, they're disruptors.

158
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,560
is why the big coke corporation wants to go in. This small family brand

159
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,760
yeah of educated people. Pepper family. Pepper family we all know pepper.

160
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:18,240
yeah and they're like it's like you know you got Mozilla Firefox Google Chrome

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,200
this is Opera. A browser that's good enough to be on the Wii.

162
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,600
It's DuckDuckGo. If it's good enough for fucking Joe Rogan it's good enough for

163
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,080
me. Let's stay on topic with Soda.

164
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,720
place yeah Joe Rogan yeah yeah I was gonna get into it

165
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,680
soda just so again just soda again I will have another soda again yeah that

166
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,160
could have been drinking there we go see I'm looking here on pibb thug.com yeah

167
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,640
and that could be any one of us yeah if things had gone mr. pibb was born in the

168
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:55,380
summer of 72 after the cola coca-cola company had the intention of creating a

169
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,720
drink that would rival the growing success of dr. what I don't I wish it

170
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,440
wouldn't say mr. PIB was born because I really did think like oh it's named

171
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,360
named after a real guy when you said that yeah well it used to be called Pepo

172
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:13,320
no you Pepo line to me it was under the name of Pepo Pepo yeah do we can we see

173
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,640
a logo on that it was called Pepo and then coke settled on the name mr. PIB

174
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:23,480
for important brand identification purposes so there's no I can't find it

176
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,840
Pepper type soda. Yeah. Oh so they really were ripping off Dr. Pepper at this time. Yeah.

177
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:39,200
See that is why Dr. Pepper especially. The can is great. That can is crazy.

178
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:44,280
It was really good. Let's stay on topic. Sorry not the can, the soda. The inside.

179
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,920
Yeah I think that Pepo would have been a better name for Mr. Pip. Here's a bottle

00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:53,800
of peppo they're having an auction for a bottle of peppo really how much let's

185
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,560
look Pat we're talking about the soda we're not talking about me come you say

186
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,560
We're not, you shouldn't be touching the computer, there's a soda discussion.

187
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Close the window, it says Me-Com.

188
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,560
We're not talking about windows, we're talking about soda.

189
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,560
So let's discuss this Pepo, that's right here on the screen.

190
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
Yeah, I'm saying Pepo on Me-Com.

191
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,560
You better not be fucking bringing up windows unless you're looking through the god damn window of a candy and sodas fountain for trying to look at a soda, you bastard.

192
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
That's right.

193
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,560
I don't think that I, I don't think that I went off topic.

194
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Drop your fucking...

195
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Now you're discussing topics, let's talk about soda.

196
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,560
Drop the fucking topic talk, and talk sock.

197
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,560
Can you just, just like, knock it off, I have something to say.

198
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,020
I think it's too early.

199
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,020
Say it.

200
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,020
You said you have something to say, say it.

201
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,120
You better fucking start talking, buster, or I'll fucking eat your soda.

202
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
You're going to eat my soda.

203
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,720
I'll de-eat it in one bite.

204
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,960
Someone just was in the hallway, slammed a door, and went "mm-mm" really loudly to the

205
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,200
point where we heard it 30 feet away.

206
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,200
We all were distracted.

207
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,200
Pretty crazy.

208
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,140
My favorite type of soda is baking soda.

209
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
Just kidding.

210
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,140
Psych.

211
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,140
That was almost a fucking off-topic moment.

212
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,980
- That was almost a soda joke.

213
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:21,660
- But because it was a joke, I think we have to allow it.

214
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,500
And that, it did make me laugh.

215
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,300
- And baking soda is like a powder.

216
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,240
You know what else is a powder?

217
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,560
Pepper, Dr. Pepper, which is a liquid, which is soda.

218
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,880
- Pepper is a powder.

219
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,020
- And then Dr., I was just kind of free associating it

220
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,900
back into Dr. Pepper.

221
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,080
- So, I wonder, see, Dr. Pepper is famous for

222
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,580
having 23 flavors inside of one box, and also--

223
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,340
- Let's say human beings have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

224
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,180
- Oh my God.

225
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,380
- Oh, so I think that's probably the reason.

226
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,220
- Yeah.

227
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,040
- Wow, that's why it's so popular.

228
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,640
- That must be, and that, you know what?

229
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,220
Your kind of like logical thinking does make it make sense.

230
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,140
- Make it make sense.

231
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,180
- See, 'cause I always wondered what the 23 was.

232
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,420
- Yeah, I'm always like 23 flavors make it make sense.

233
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,260
- See, see.

234
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,620
- 23 and me, that's gotta be about Dr. Pepper.

235
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,940
- And I used to, 23, I think it's 23 ingredients.

236
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,420
- The me must be Dr. Pepper.

237
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,260
- Yeah.

238
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:14,080
- Fuck me.

239
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,920
23 ingredients in Dr. Pepper and there's 23 ingredients that make up the human soul.

240
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,520
Do we want to go through the ingredients of Dr. Pepper?

241
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,520
They won't tell you.

242
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,520
Oh, flavors.

243
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, there's 23 flavors of the human soul.

244
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's true.

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,360
That's true also.

246
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,440
There's flavors of soul.

247
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Let's see here.

248
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
What do we got?

249
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,920
Well, let's look at it on CVS.

250
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,320
Let's look at the original recipe's ingredients.

251
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,320
Okay.

252
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,320
Let's see if we can find this.

253
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
Let's do, okay, this is the history corner.

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,120
How does that stack up to KFC's recipe number?

255
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,200
Uh, eleven.

256
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,160
Eleven herbs and spices. More than fucking double the fucking flavors in pepper.

257
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:55,400
I'm not sure if I can find the... Yeah, it's secret, that's what I'm saying. The original recipe.

258
00:10:55,400 --> 00:11:00,680
Heritage Dr. Pepper. Let's see what Wikipedia has to say about this.

259
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,600
Good luck.

260
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,640
Yeah, good... Alright, I'll say this much while you search this page.

261
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,320
Heritage Dr. Pepper, or Dr. Pepper Heritage,

262
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,680
became available around november two thousand nine in various outlets around

263
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,200
the united states as its name implies it is a re-release of sorts of doctor

264
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,480
pepper's original formula which uses sugar instead of high fructose corn

265
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,440
syrup which doctor pepper and other brands of soft drinks are to use around

266
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,040
the early nineteen seventies

267
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,320
the formulas of heritage doctor pepper in dublin doctor pepper are assumed to be

268
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,920
one in the same but heritage doctor pepper is a larger scale national

269
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,280
release aimed at capturing the same marketing essence as the pepsi and

270
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,080
mountain dew throwbacks

271
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,320
Speaking of Mountain Dew throwback, what a great soda.

272
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,120
- I don't think I've ever had a Mountain Dew.

273
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
- Mountain Dew throwback?

274
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,480
- I've never thrown back any Mountain Dew.

275
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,360
- You've really never had a Mountain Dew?

276
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
- I've had a Baja Blast, actually, at our taco place.

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,080
- I know you've had Baja Blast.

278
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,920
- I've never had a normal Mountain Dew.

279
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,600
- And I know that I may or may not have given you

280
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,040
a sip of a Mountain Dew back in the day.

281
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,280
- I don't think that's true.

282
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,000
I don't, what do you mean back in the day?

283
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,120
- Back in the olden days.

284
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
- The olden days, like the 1800s, 1700s?

285
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,520
No, like back way back. Before then, like in the 1000s? Just a little bit back, a little bit.

286
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:15,960
So 80s, 90s. A little bit further. The 2000s when we were just young children? Did you see, there's a new

287
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,720
there's a new Dr. Pepper flavor, and I haven't been able to find it

288
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,120
anywhere in diet yet. All right. But Dr. Pepper Dark Berry. Dark Berry.

289
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,240
Dark Berry, and it's a promotional item for Jurassic World Dominion, and in the

290
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,480
commercials is one of my favorite singers Barry Manilow. What? Wait, Barry

291
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,920
Manilow's in the Dark Barry? He's in the Dark Barry commercials. Wait, is it Dark Barry or Dark Barry?

292
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,640
Is it Dark Barry Manilow? Is he evil? And you're gonna love this commercial. Okay. If this is

293
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,160
confusing you right now, this is gonna make, this is gonna make you smile. Does he act

294
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,520
darkly mean or anything like that? He wears a blue berry suit. So that's not

295
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,880
that dark of a blary. No. A blue berry style, berry colored suit. A styled blue...

296
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,800
violent Beauregard from Willy Wonka. He looks like Barry Manilow. I have violent

297
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,920
disregard for Barry Manilow. I would kill him. And that is an insane

298
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,160
thing to say. Violent disregard. And you're going off topic. I'm fucking sorry.

299
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,800
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm gonna sip. I've actually been smelling. You have to just take a

300
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:23,880
sip. Yeah. Hey take a sip if you get off topic. It's a little drinking game we've been doing here on the Dr. Pepper episode.

301
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,880
Check out this little paragraph. I think I remember hearing about this at one point.

302
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,720
Oh, I remember tasting it and it was good.

303
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,840
I'll tell you this much, it came out when I was 10 years old.

304
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Yeah, me too.

305
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,840
That can't be a coincidence.

306
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,080
10 years old in 2011.

307
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I don't remember.

308
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,520
I was only a little bit older than that.

309
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,480
I just assumed that because we were the same age that you were right.

310
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,960
Hey, he just went with it too.

311
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,720
But I agreed with you.

312
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,520
Well it says here, for anyone who doesn't know, any less educated Dr. Pepper fans, Dr.

313
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:59,920
Pepper 10, a low-calorie version introduced in 2011, promoted as having as 10 calories

314
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,520
per serving. A little whoopsie on Wikipedia here, a bit of a typo.

315
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,520
Wikipedia, you can't trust a single word you read on those damn websites.

316
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,000
Definitely not. Dr. Pepper 10 was marketed primarily towards men, with the product's

317
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,240
branding featuring a masculine appearance and gunmetal colors, and promotional campaigns

318
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:17,720
featuring the slogan "It's not for women," which gained some controversy for its promotional

319
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,720
sexism.

320
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,960
Yeah, I remember that, and I remember that if you got it in the cans, if you got Dr. Pepper

321
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,960
pretend in a can it was silver but sometimes they would put football pigskin on the roof

322
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
of the boat.

323
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,020
Oh yeah, and couldn't you fuck the bottle?

324
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,320
You couldn't fuck the bottle but it was big enough to hollow out and put a pocket pussy

325
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
in it.

326
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Yeah and you could hide it.

327
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
You could say no honey it's just for men.

328
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
You're getting off topic.

329
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,000
I'll take a sip buddy, don't force my hand.

330
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,200
Well yeah, this is the history corner, I have some interesting history right here I found

331
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,000
if anyone wants to read this little fun tidbit here.

332
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I would love to.

333
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I would love to read this.

334
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,660
Dr. Pepper was a frequent player in the 1990s antitrust history of the United States.

335
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,760
As part of these activities, economists and the courts have weighed in on the opinion

336
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,080
that Dr. Pepper is a pepper-flavored drink and not a cola.

337
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:12,120
In 1995, the FTC blocked a merger between the Coca-Cola company and Dr. Pepper on the

338
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,480
grounds that it included concerns of a monopoly of the pepper-flavored category of soft drinks.

339
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Wait!

340
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,460
- They tried to put Dr. Pepper in the Coca-Cola family?

341
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,480
- They did, and then the FTC blocked it

342
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,980
and said you can't have a monopoly on pepper drinks.

343
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,020
- Which is good.

344
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:28,860
- Yeah, you have to have--

345
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,960
- The FTC won't let them be or let pepper drinks

346
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,860
drink them from me.

347
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,680
- See, I thought you were off topic.

348
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,920
I thought you were just singing,

349
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,440
but you turned it around into a song about soda.

350
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,020
- Yeah, and I'll take a celebratory sip of my soda.

351
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,260
- I think you earned a sip.

352
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,520
Thank God for the FTC blocking that merger.

353
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
And thank God for the FTC.

354
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,320
Just in general.

355
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,120
In general, but that's off topic.

356
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,520
You know how when you fart in a bath--

357
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,320
and I promise this is soda related--

358
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,020
you know how--

359
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,720
[LAUGHTER]

360
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,620
You know when you fart in a bathtub,

361
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,320
the fart smells different?

362
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,820
Yeah.

363
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,520
Or in the shower, it smells different.

364
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,320
Let me tell you right now, this better be about soda.

365
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,320
I promise it will be about soda.

366
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,520
The difference between a normal fart and a fart

367
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:22,880
that is done in the shower or a bathtub is the same smell or a taste

368
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,160
difference between a Coca-Cola and a Dr. Pepper. It's just got a little bit of a

369
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,680
different kind of-- it's like it was made in a different world. I'm glad you were

370
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,040
able to swing this back to soda. Yeah, it hit the soda, all the soda

371
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,680
marks, you know, and it's barely even about-- the farts were just an allegory,

372
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,520
you know, in the way the Bible, but these are just, I mean, what a soda.

373
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
I'm seeing here too.

374
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
Usually, you go on.

375
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,520
Sorry.

376
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:51,440
I was just going to say, usually, when I think about soda, I keep the farts away.

377
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,440
That's right.

378
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Get the fart away from my cup.

379
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,080
I feel the same way.

380
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,880
In that one moment, you got what I'm saying.

381
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,440
Mix my soda with some fart.

382
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Just spray it.

383
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,160
Spray some fart all over my soda.

384
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,960
Apparently, nobody knows for certain why it's called Dr. Pepper, and there are multiple

385
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
theories.

386
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
How did I know?

387
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:16,320
several different people whose names were Dr. Pepper that could have possibly

388
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,260
inspired the name. Really? Can you list maybe one or two? Yeah, so there's an actual

389
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:27,120
doctor, one Charles T. Pepper of Rural Retreat, Virginia, or a Dr. William

390
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,040
Alexander Reed Pepper of Christiansburg. Those are two possibilities for who Dr. Pepper could have been named after.

391
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:38,360
I think we should take all the Christian and put them in a burg. Yeah, an iceberg.

392
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:46,000
yeah all the curse and then very off-topic sorry do you know do you do you

393
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,800
think before you speak have you ever heard of the Holocaust I haven't and

394
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,000
don't even bring that up because I walk topic yeah we're not gonna we're not

395
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,200
gonna talk about that today never heard of that well but I don't care what that

396
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,120
is because your mind is on soda because I'm fucking being off topic as shit

397
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,520
these days and so I'm just gonna drink my soda very silently and quietly and

398
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,800
Patrick you can just handle all this dr. pepper stuff that we've been talking

399
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,960
about in regards to who created it as with coca-cola the formula for dr. pepper

400
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:25,880
is a trade secret and allegedly the recipe is kept as two halves and safe

401
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,160
deposit boxes in two separate Dallas Bank Wow they are serious about soda how do

402
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,120
How do you have 23?

403
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,160
How do you split the remainder in half and so you only get half the word?

404
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,640
Yeah, it's a recipe so I mean the recipe is not just one word.

405
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,200
What I'm saying is...

406
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,040
Maybe they cut the piece of paper down the middle.

407
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,800
Yeah, I think that's likely what it is.

408
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,840
So that's what makes it so hard.

409
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:55,200
I think each piece of paper is probably cut in half and each different half is kept and

410
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,600
they're all mixed up too probably.

411
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,360
That would be my theory.

412
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
What if you get in there?

413
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Excuse me, something's...

414
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
God, fuck, what's happening?

415
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
I don't know why this could be happening to me.

416
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:11,360
But...

417
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,360
It seems like there's no reason why.

418
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,360
There's no reason why.

419
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,360
Now, I do wanna...

420
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I'm sorry, that was off topic. I'll take another sip.

421
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,360
I feel like we can dive into history a little deeper here,

422
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,360
kind of a Dr. Pepper conspiracy corner.

423
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,360
The Dr. Pepper formula is kept in Dallas.

424
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
Do you think we...

425
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,360
Do we think this could have anything to do with the assassination of President John F. Kennedy?

426
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,860
He got too close.

427
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,860
He...

428
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,060
It doesn't say exactly which buildings the formulas were kept in.

429
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,560
Because those were in between two banks, right?

430
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,160
Probably.

431
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,060
It could have been that it was kept in the book depository.

432
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,760
True.

433
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,460
You know, what's one kind of book?

434
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,260
A cookbook or a recipe book or a soda book?

435
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,360
Oh my fucking God.

436
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,960
And that guy, that...

437
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,760
What's his name? Harry Joe Oswald.

438
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,960
He...

439
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
or whatever his name was.

440
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,680
He loved soda.

441
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,520
- Yeah.

442
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,020
- And he talked about it all the time.

443
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,640
- Yeah, there's a lot of diets.

444
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,680
- Harvey Oswald.

445
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,520
- Yeah.

446
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,340
- Coca-Cola.

447
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,200
- Lee, holy that soda's fucking good.

448
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,440
- Harvey Oswald.

449
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,760
- I swalled a god that's good.

450
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,240
- Swalled, I swalled, I swalled the soda.

451
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
- I swalled the whole bottle.

452
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,400
Holy, I swalled the whole bottle.

453
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,200
I get Harvey C. because I'm so...

454
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
I get Harvey Lee!

455
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,200
I get Harvey Lee in front of me.

456
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,200
I get Harvey Lee what's in front of me because I swapped the whole bottle of soda.

457
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,000
Yeah so he had to have been a soda guy.

458
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Yeah.

459
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Yeah.

460
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,800
Ah you're a soda man Lee.

461
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,600
I remember that was in the movie.

462
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
JFK.

463
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Yes.

464
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
MLK.

465
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Dr. MLK.

466
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Doctor...

467
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,600
Holy shit.

468
00:20:51,600 --> 00:21:07,300
holy shit and he was like pepper the original formula was formulated by

469
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,300
Brooklyn born pharmacist Charles Alderton and Morrison's old corner drugstore in

470
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:17,140
Waco Texas interesting so it was it's all a Texas affair and it's all but tied in

471
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,020
the guy who made it from Brooklyn all right so shout out to Brooklyn yeah all

472
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,660
All right, before we go any further, Brooklyn, stand up.

473
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,160
Yep.

474
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,540
I'd like to see you stand up.

475
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,040
Stand up.

476
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,700
There's a lot of-- and you know what?

477
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
Yep, and I'll stand up.

478
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,260
I'll stand up.

479
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
Yep, for Brooklyn.

480
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,760
Yep.

481
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,580
For Brooklyn.

482
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,340
This one's for Brooklyn.

483
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,860
To Brooklyn.

484
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,380
To Brooklyn.

485
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,620
Yep, cheers on that.

486
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,820
But basically, I mean, it's all happening in Texas.

487
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,300
And this is around also the time that acid

488
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,780
and different psychotronic substances--

489
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,280
Hold on.

490
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,420
Now, can you go back to that last page?

491
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,740
Yeah, but I just look at this--

492
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:48,580
Dr. Pepper, capital of the world.

493
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,080
Oh my god.

494
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,860
That's one of the headings on Wikipedia.

495
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,500
The company sells more Dr. Pepper in the Roanoke Valley area of Virginia than any other metropolitan

496
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,000
area east of the Mississippi River.

497
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
And we went there, right?

498
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm pretty sure we did on our way over.

499
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,020
We went to the Roanoke, that's where Richmond is?

500
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,220
I think so, something like that.

501
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,220
And you know what?

502
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,900
It's fucking sad that we didn't know this beforehand going there, because if I had known

503
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
that it was the Dr. Pepper Capital-

504
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,380
And we were in Dallas too.

505
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,300
We had gone to all of the Dr. Pepper spots.

506
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
And I don't think-

507
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,300
We took a Dr. Pepper adventure-

508
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,140
That's the sad thing about the South is there's this whole hidden history they don't teach

509
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
you about the South.

522
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,940
But this isn't soda, so never mind. I thought it was maybe a soda.

523
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,380
I'm sorry for getting off topic. Oh, it's no worries.

524
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,140
It wasn't your fault. You thought you were on topic. Yeah, I thought I was talking.

525
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,260
Wait, what is this Dr. Pepper?

526
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,300
Free Dr. Pepper for everyone in America.

527
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:37,540
Wait, okay. On March 26, 2008, various media outlets reported that Dr. Pepper would

528
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,340
offer a free can of Dr. Pepper to everyone in America,

529
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,420
excluding former Guns N' Roses guitarist Buckethead and Slash,

530
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,140
if the band released the long-awaited Chinese Democracy in 2008.

531
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:56,020
Later in the day, lead vocalist Axl Rose replied to Dr. Pepper on Guns N' Roses official website

532
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,860
and spoke of his surprise of Dr. Pepper's support.

533
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:02,980
Rose said he would share his Dr. Pepper with Buckethead as some of Buckethead's performances

534
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,900
are on Chinese Democracy.

535
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:08,700
After it was announced that the album would be released in 2008, Dr. Pepper stated that

536
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,460
it would uphold the pledge.

537
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,460
Wow!

538
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,460
That's crazy.

539
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:17,140
Wait, and then Dr. Pepper failed to distribute the coupons for the free drinks and they tried

540
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:22,220
not get into that. They tried to sue wait Guns N' Roses tried to sue Dr. Pepper?

541
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:28,140
What the? There's an unmitigated disaster which defrauded consumers and in the

542
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,620
eyes of vocal fans ruined Chinese democracy's release. Wow.

543
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:38,340
Holy shit. Yeah I think that's what ruined the release of Chinese democracy.

544
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:43,980
Yeah there's also a Dr. Pepper Museum in Waco, Texas. Holy fucking shit. The museum

545
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,340
founder Wilton Lanning died in January 2018. Well I think we think there's an

546
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,200
opening yeah there is for the for founder I mean we could get hired as

547
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,020
founder. We need like a founding document to go into this. Yeah we could pull that off

548
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,300
though yeah I think maybe even Patrick might have a founding document. Is there anything

549
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:05,180
that could be like maybe the first entry to the museum's catalog? Yeah and you

550
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:10,140
know what it is a list. Oh my fucking god. Wow let's hear it. You know a little bit of a

551
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,700
throwback to our old show. Yeah I remember that. Yeah. Yeah the show that we don't do

552
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,780
anymore. Yeah now we do Dr. Pepper. The Dr. Pepper show. Yeah. This is a list of why

553
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,380
Diet Dr. Pepper makes me smile. Okay and what would be the first entry?

554
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:33,920
Well the first entry, I mean isn't it obvious? Well it's yeah it is. Yep it's

555
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,780
obvious. Yeah so we tend to skip it. Number one is the flavor. Oh man. You get me in a room with a

556
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:43,700
a bunch of cans of Diet Dr. Pepper, only I'm leaving.

557
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,540
- Yep.

558
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,240
But where are you going?

559
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,620
- It's just gonna be me leaving,

560
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,580
and maybe some empty cans.

561
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,780
- You got me in a room with a bunch of cans of Dr. Pepper

562
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,500
and my ex-wife, only I'm leaving.

563
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,860
- Yep.

564
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,820
'Cause she's gonna be staying in there drinking those.

565
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,980
- A bunch of cans of Diet Dr. Pepper and a bag of--

566
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,380
- And a big bag of laundry.

567
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,620
- Yep.

568
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:12,340
See, I don't know exactly what the flavor of Diet Dr. Pepper is.

569
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:19,340
All I know is that when it hits my lips, I want-- I wish it was a beautiful man or woman to kiss it.

570
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,340
'Cause you don't know the gender of Dr. Pepper either.

571
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,340
Right, doctor is-- kiss what? Your lips?

572
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,340
I wish it was-- if I wish the soda, I wish it was a liquid man or woman that I could kiss.

573
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,340
[laughter]

574
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,340
And they're made entirely out of Diet Dr. Pepper.

575
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,340
Okay, that makes it a little more--

576
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,420
so when they and they walk her and if it's cold out it's not a good day for

577
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:46,380
them because they get frozen because they get frozen and if it's hot maybe they

578
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,780
turn into a puddle right if it's hot they or if it's a normal okay they could

579
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:55,340
stay normal if it's hot all right well I didn't realize you were so fucking

580
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:59,020
romantic mm-hmm wow that's crazy yeah and you know what

581
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:02,900
let's say that died dr. pepper is an aphrodisiac I think it is an effort is

582
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,340
that is that on there cuz you should add that if it's not and you know what I

583
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,340
I just added it to the end, so we'll get back to it.

584
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:13,340
Alright, we'll table that. We'll get back to that.

585
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,340
And listen, when it comes to Dr. Pepper, I throw DZ at my tongue.

586
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,340
Yep.

587
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
I throw DZ at my tongue.

588
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,340
I throw DZ back at my tongue.

589
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,340
I throw DZ at my tongue.

590
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,340
Mm-hmm.

591
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,340
And I suck it down.

592
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,340
And I fuckin' slurp.

593
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,340
I slurp that Diet Dr. Pepper down like it's a--

594
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,340
You know what? Let's get to the aphrodisiac part now.

595
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,340
I slurp it down like it's an oyster.

596
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:39,340
And you know what? Raw oyster, all you need, hot sauce and a lemon.

597
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:41,340
You're putting that on pussy?

598
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
Sorry, I got off topic.

599
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,340
Let's get back on topic.

600
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,340
Real quick, can we test the aphrodisiac-ical qualities?

601
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,340
We're gonna get back to the aphrodisiac.

602
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
Here's my perfect meal.

603
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:54,340
If I'm fucking drinking this, do you guys wanna suck my... I mean I don't have underwear on, you already sucked my dick.

604
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I think you would wanna suck our dick if you drank that.

605
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:58,340
God, I want to suck your mouth.

606
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Here is the perfect meal.

607
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,340
Hit me.

608
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:07,340
36 raw oysters.

609
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,340
Okay.

610
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,340
One glass of Diet Dr Pepper

611
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,340
and a salad for the lady.

612
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,340
How about you switch those numbers and maybe...

613
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,340
And she'll have a salad, the perfect meal.

614
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:19,340
Lobster, steak,

615
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,340
14 glasses of Dr Pepper,

616
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,340
and she'll have a crouton.

617
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,340
She'll have one single crouton.

618
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,340
That's a perfect meal.

619
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,340
And a candle between us, which if she gets hungry

620
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,340
she'll start eating like she usually does.

621
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,340
so she probably won't be able to.

622
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,340
I will eat dessert.

623
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,340
If it's a Yankee or if it's a vanilla bean, I could be liable to eat that can.

624
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,340
I'm going at it, yeah.

625
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:41,340
And I like spicy food, so I'll eat the hot part of the candle.

626
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,340
Yeah, that's fine by me.

627
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,340
Number two, the color of the soda.

628
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
The color of the soda.

629
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,340
The color.

630
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,340
This brown fruity drink.

Reminds me of a brown picture.

634
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,340
A brownie that's filled with peppers and fruits.

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:44,560
Exactly, I'll tell you what a couple of my friends and we're gonna film it you try you try you try something

672
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:48,780
You're gonna burn him you try to do oceans 11. You're not gonna be getting lotions in heaven

673
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:55,200
No, yep, you're going straight to hell and you're gonna not get that bath and body works cherry blossom or the

674
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,460
And and you know what you're not no lip lotion none of that dr. Pepper flavored

675
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:07,260
Yeah, you're gonna go you're gonna go lip tattoo. That's a slut. Yeah, that's right, and you're going on the outside and gauges

676
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:14,080
Yep, and you're yeah, and we're gonna pierce your nose. Yeah, right you have one of those little rings and there's a cheek gauge

677
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,740
Yeah, yeah that you're gonna get and we're gonna and we're gonna split your tongue split your tongue like a snake

678
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:28,440
Do you think if you split your tongue you could taste when you soda or dr. Pepper twice

679
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,220
There's only one way to find out yeah

680
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,460
Split the tongue completely down the middle one part

681
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,060
One cup one part diet you could probably create new flavors that way yeah, you could stick

682
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,460
You could stick one half of your tongue into dr. Pepper, and then the other half into whatever flavor thing you want

683
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,580
I like cherry or vanilla or dark berry actually yeah, or even one that doesn't ignore ice cream ice cream

684
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,580
I don't make you can make a

685
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,740
You can make a separate

686
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,380
Root or dr. Pepper float in your mouth

687
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,140
I'm no friend of evolution, but if I were that might be the next step in it

688
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,320
It is having two tongues because the more I think about that your soda

689
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,180
Enjoyability factor is gonna go up

690
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:18,100
Multifold yeah, I was worried you were about to get off topic. No. I'm talking sodas. Okay good

691
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:25,060
Number number four the ingredients kind of in in line with this

692
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:30,900
Secret recipe, but these ingredients even on their own even if they're not in a dr.

693
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:37,420
Pepper are they stand out stand stand alone star of every single thing that there is each ingredient stands alone

694
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,620
But together they stand strong. I wish you carbonated water. Yeah

695
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,360
Caramel color that's got to be my favorite color caramel color is good

696
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:54,240
Aspartame aspartame mm-hmm love it love it can't get enough whenever that's in a meal. I know it's the star of the show basically

697
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,960
Dr. Pepper is a meal. And I asked for it but you know a lot of people say oh

698
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,920
aspartame is bad for you it causes cancer these are the same people are saying

699
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,760
this about MSG and that's fucking racist. Yeah. Right aspartame is not

700
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,900
dangerous it's okay it's actually a nootropic in high amounts and it can

701
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,200
actually make your right leg fucking go completely numb for like two months

702
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,200
straight. And did you know it's actually named after Spartan? Yeah exactly.

703
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,040
Uh-huh. This is Spartan! The main guy from that from the movie. The main guy from that it's

704
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,700
named after yeah because of how strong he is and if you don't like aspartame I'm

705
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,300
kicking you in that pit playboy mm-hmm do you like ask your team there's the

706
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:34,600
door yeah they're not staying at my barbecue get the fuck guess what's on

707
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,440
all the ribs the answer doctor diet dr. pepper with extra aspartame extra yeah

708
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,560
because sprinkle yeah I like my fucking ribs sweet like candy asshole yeah I put

709
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:50,120
sweet and low on my diet dr. pepper ribs heard that uh-huh

710
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,000
well it's ingredients and then it's caffeine count I think it's the perfect

711
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,120
amount of caffeine for a diet soda. Right there, you know, not quite 70. 68 milligrams.

712
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,880
And 70 might be pushing it for a bottle. A Red Bull? Red Bull is gonna be 120.

713
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,880
Red Bull small can that's 80 milligrams. Yeah so this is a little less than a small Red Bull.

714
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,000
Basically it's the same amount of caffeine as a small Red Bull

715
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,320
but you get more soda. You're drinking a bottle of Coke, it's

716
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,640
46 not enough you're drinking a bottle of Pepsi is a hundred and one how much is

717
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:26,740
in a cup of coffee about a hundred about a hundred yeah so there's a little bit

718
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:33,220
less than a cup of coffee mm-hmm you know so just enough pep shit in your

719
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,320
step yeah I will also say I feel like I pretty you should pretty much never be

720
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,820
drinking something that has a hundred of something yeah I that's dangerous yeah

721
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,740
like a hundred razor sharp a hundred of anything's bad if you look at ingredients

722
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,940
on anything you see a hundred you shouldn't drink that. Turn around run the

723
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,940
other way. Yeah a hundred degrees. Turn a hundred degrees and run the other way. The next

724
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,860
one it's calorie count. Now Cameron I want you to take a look at this

725
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:02,540
label here. Sure. Okay now I want you to read the amount of calories. Well it

726
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,020
seems like they did a misprint here where because I'm not seeing a number

727
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:10,540
I'm seeing a letter and the letter is O. I want you to take a closer look at that.

728
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:17,100
Oh my god, I just realized it's a zero zero. It's a Z as people. I thought this they messed up on this bottle

729
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:22,620
But it's actually zero. Yeah, I just believe that that could be true. It's a completely guilt-free soda

730
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:28,760
You can drink it and you won't and you can drink it and look in the mirror after and not say

731
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,340
Look at you

732
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:36,340
Well, see you look at you look at you look at you

733
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,340
You piece of shit.

734
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,580
(growling)

735
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,940
(screaming)

736
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,140
You're not looking at the mirror doing that

737
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,180
after you drink it.

738
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,420
- Because it's not, there's nothing in it.

739
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:50,260
It's basically fucking nothing.

740
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:52,860
- There is no calories, it's basically like,

741
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,180
and you know what, get yourself a zero bar.

742
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,540
I think that zero bar has zero calories, I don't remember.

743
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,740
That's a candy bar, that's off topic.

744
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,580
- It has calories.

745
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,820
- It has calories, okay.

746
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:06,020
Well then don't get a zero bar.

747
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,560
Also, haven't had one of those in a while.

748
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,260
Those are pretty good.

749
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,100
- Off topic.

750
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,860
- That's off topic, and I said it fast so that--

751
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,940
- That doesn't stick.

752
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,600
- That doesn't stick.

753
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:20,900
- I just didn't mean to cry when I just started.

754
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,020
I really didn't mean to do this.

755
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:25,720
And I think it's gotta be some ingredient

756
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:28,680
that is pushing me towards this kind of emotional state.

757
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:31,300
- Zero sugar also.

758
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,420
- You just turned your mic off, I think.

759
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,900
- I did.

760
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,660
I did turn my mic off.

761
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,980
There's also zero calories.

762
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,420
- A gentleman never drinks Dr. Pepper on mic.

763
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:41,780
That's for his wife to hear.

764
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,620
- Yeah, exactly.

765
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,940
(slurping)

766
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:46,420
- Whoa, Caleb, turn your mic off before you do that.

767
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,820
- 'Cause it's an aphrodisiac.

768
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,660
- Yeah.

769
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,380
- Yeah, I'm throwing these back.

770
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:53,300
I almost feel like my memory is getting better.

771
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:56,100
And I'm remembering different things I've said.

772
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,780
Can I do a human benchmark right now?

773
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,740
Give me a test.

774
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,100
I'm one and a half bottles deep on Diet Dr.

775
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,500
- You're supposed to share that bottle.

776
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,580
- Pepper, you can have the rest.

777
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,940
I don't want this. It's scaring me. It's scaring me what I'm becoming.

778
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,260
Okay, let's do a- how many calories does it have?

779
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,700
It's gotta be fucking a hundred.

780
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,700
Okay, so you just instantly failed the benchmark. You said your memory is getting better.

781
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,060
I was just testing your memory of what-

782
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,980
No, I've never heard how many calories are in Diet Dr. Pepper.

783
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:23,300
I didn't know that.

784
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,540
Okay, well, how much sodium is in it?

785
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,780
It's gotta be fucking...

786
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,060
That one I know is zero because it doesn't taste very salty to me.

787
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,660
It's actually a hundred.

788
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:35,400
which is the one thing it's okay to have a hundred of the c_n_n_'s

789
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,500
yet i was going to be that's the next uh... well that's a lecture like that

790
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,980
so that's that's the next thing i love about it a hundred grams of sodium

791
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:46,040
it's exactly it's a little tips a hundred milligrams of sodium

792
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,380
uh... it's not a hundred and a half

793
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,980
it's not the

794
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:57,400
it's it's perfect for you because it hydrates you as you drink it

795
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,000
and it's also got caffeine in it yes

796
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,380
to make you

797
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:08,240
crazy faster yeah think better I mean I'm sure is a migraine caffeine it does I was

798
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,980
saying before I'm training that loosens your your blood vessels I want to try

799

00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:44,460
label right what do you like so you look at a dr. pepper right I'm looking at one

805

football on it. Yeah. And it's Pepper Perks. It's got Pepper Perks and it's perfect for

811
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,260
football fans. It's like when in a cartoon they run into the same versions of

812
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,140
themselves with dressed in different colors. Yeah. But and it's that's always

813

- That could be a whole new show.

818
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,780
- Guys, we need a lot of funding

819
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,340
to make our show, The Pepper Rangers.

820
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,420
- So basically we want to shift focus now.

821
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,540
We need, this is a million dollars

822
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:00,060

823
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,860
- The Pepper Rangers is gonna be

824
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:02,900
one of the most incredible things

825
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:03,820
that we've ever done. - Yeah, what's it called?

00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,540
Mighty Morphin, instead of Mighty Morphin, what is it?

827
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,980
- Soda Sip and Pepper Rangers.

828
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,180
- Soda Sip and Pepper Rangers.

829
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,740
- Holy shit. - That is so good.

830
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:12,340
- And look at how fast I came up with that.

831
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,180
- It's perfect.

832
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:14,860
- That's because you've been drinking Dr. Pepper.

833
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,700
- I've been drinking so much. - 'Cause you have fast speed.

834
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,300
- Diet Dr. Pepper.

835
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,900
Yeah. And the bottle is recyclable.

836
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,580
Yeah. That's all right.

837
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:28,980
That's all. So I'll tell you how I'll tell you how it's recyclable to you.

838
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,660
Finished drinking it. You take another bottle, fill it up with more Dr. Pepper.

839
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:36,180
And you can bring it to the Coke. And you know what?

840
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:39,100
You show the Qdoba employee, you show them.

841
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:42,940
I'm just getting a refill. And they go, well, yeah, they say it's OK.

842
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,780
If it's Dr. If you're refilling it with Dr. Pepper, you know, Dr.

843
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,660
Pepper is not in the Coke Freestyle machine.

844
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,580
You're crazy.

845
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:50,420
Is it not?

846
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,900
It is at the one at Qdoba.

847
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:54,740
Wait, that doesn't make any fucking sense.

848
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,460
They've bought out, Dr. Pepper, smart businessman,

849
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:02,540
bought out the rights to have his drink

850
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,060
in a Coke Freestyle machine.

851
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,900
Wait, that's,

852
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:11,300
he bought out his own rights to have his drink,

853
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,900
so he didn't own the rights to it,

854
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:15,580
and he bought it out so that he could have his drink

855
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:16,420
in the Coke Freestyle machine.

856
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,920
Because it used to have Pib in it.

857
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:23,480
So he's paying extra to get Dr. Pepper into the Coke Freestyle.

858
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,580
And I had one the other day.

859
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,760
I had a Diet Dr. Pepper cherry.

860
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:27,760
Wow.

861
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,680
I'd like Dr. Pepper to pop my cherry.

862
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Just fuck me.

863
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
Just, yeah.

864
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,280
Alright, you don't have to say that.

865
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:36,880
Just fucking Dr. Pepper.

866
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,960
And the last one here, it contains phenyl...

867
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
phenylketonutri- ketoneutronate.

868
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,960
Dude, you gotta stop, I'm drooling over here.

869
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:51,960
It's so fucking good.

870
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,960
It contains phenyl- oh my god.

871
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
Phenylketonurix.

872
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,960
The phenylketonurix are just fucking, oh.

873
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,960
Specifically, it has phenylalanine.

874
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,080
Fennel, fennel and lalanine.

875
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,440
It's just so good.

876
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,280
Yeah.

877
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,400
Oh, it's just good.

878
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,800
It's the best ingredient it's got.

879
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,880
It has to be.

880
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,800
That's the 24th flavor, it's honorary, it tells me.

881
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,840
I fucking love that fennel and lalanine.

882
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,200
I'm seeing, okay, can I,

883
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,440
I'm gonna read you guys something

884
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,680
that I just saw in this bottle.

885
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,520
Yeah, shoot.

886
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,640
That just seems like it's on its own here.

887
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,440
Must be 18 plus and legal US resident.

888
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,240
And there's a whole,

889
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,080
it seems like there's some kind of con.

890
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,080
I think that's in regards to the pepper perks.

891
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:37,920
Yeah.

892
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,080
No, I think it's just, I think it just is about the bottle.

893
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:42,240
You think that an 18 year old has to drink this?

894
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,960
Yeah, an illegal US resident.

895
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,200
Yeah.

896
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,020
Oh, there are Pepper Perks though.

897
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,760
I think that's separate though.

898
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,880
I would love to get Pepper Perks.

899
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,560
Well, let's try, let's, I mean, we got,

900
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,720
we got a few bottles of Dr. Pepper right here.

901
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,560
I don't see any reason why we can't.

902
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,380
Let's scan these.

903
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:00,240
What if we won a million dollars right now from Dr. Pepper?

904
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,880
Okay, the Perks fans deserve.

905
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:02,720
Oh my God.

906
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,360
Get your game face on with limited time Pepper Perks.

907
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,680
Okay, let's log in here.

908
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,520
Okay.

909
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,520
Do you guys already have a Pepper account?

910
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,020
No.

911
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,020
No, we can make one with Google.

912
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:11,520
Yeah, we'll sign up.

913
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,520
I wasn't even fucking aware.

914
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,520
Sign in with Google right there.

915
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,520
I'm not gonna sign in with Google. I'm gonna make an account here.

916
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Why not? Why not put it on the podcast email so we can all share it?

917
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:22,520
I mean, I'll still do that, but I don't want to connect it to our Google account.

918
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,520
Why not?

919
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,520
Because we'll just type all this stuff in here.

920
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,520
Why don't you like connecting it to the Google account?

921
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,520
It's a security risk, okay?

922
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,520
It's a one-click button.

923
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,520
It's a security risk. You don't know what kind of...

924
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,880
because people I mean we've been talking about the secret formula of the doctor

925
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,560
pepper the entire time you're making people are constantly trying to break

926
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:43,240
into the dr. pepper database and find the formula it's kept under lock and key

927
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:47,520

That's really good.

00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,360
That's a good one.

941
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,960

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,280
I mean we could try uploading it anyway.

977
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,280
Yeah.

978
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,280
Maybe we could scam them.

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,280
Here, somebody take a picture of this with their phone and air drop it to my laptop.

Yeah, get all three. Where's the third bottle?

985
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,280
Do you think we could fake receipts pretty easily and just like basically farm fucking points on here?

986
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:15,280

00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,960
- Holy shit, that's so beautiful.

1001
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:14,720
Holy.

1002
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:19,400
If I had to make a list of my favorite parts of Dr. Pepper,

1003
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,440
it would be one thing is I like that the bottle is shaped,

1004
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,560
not, it's a bit oblong.

1005
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,000
There's some kind of like wind, it's almost torpedo-like.

1006
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,400
- And this right here--

1007
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,240
- That's what I mean, there's like--

1008
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,160
- Perfect grip.

1009
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,600
- Yeah, exactly, it's got good grip.

1010
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,800
- Perfect grips on it.

1011
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,140
It's almost, it almost is a, can double as a football.

1012
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:40,300
- Watch this, try, try and knock that out of my hand.

1013
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,500
Okay, I said knock, not grab.

1014
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,220

1015
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,040
- I did see that.

1016
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:47,880
- You can't, I mean, it was amazing.

1017
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,500
- Try again.

1018
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,280
- Wow, I really tried that time too.

1019
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,120

1020
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,960
- And it just stayed in.

1021
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:55,200
- And it stayed complete, and it's these plastic,

1022
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,480

- So I guess we'll keep everyone updated too

1029
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,100
with what happens with this, but I think we're looking,

1030
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:12,840
I'm not sure how many points you get per thing,

1031
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,320
but I think we could be looking at getting

1032
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,620
a $10 Uber Eats gift card pretty soon.

1033
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,900
- I mean. - And we could buy,

1034
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,740
oh my God. - Wait.

1035
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,860
- Does some Dr. Pepper, Infinite Dr. Pepper Hack.

1036
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,660
- Infinite Dr. Pepper Hack because--

1037
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:24,500
- Okay, 'cause then we can get--

1038
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,580
- I think you probably get one point per bottle.

1039
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,820
(laughing)

1040
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:31,820
there is a very small reward is thirty

1041
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:36,060
thirty points here in europe so we can only return dollars we need sixty

1042
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,640
every sixty bottles is doable

1043
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,620
i'll do that in a fucking take a look at it take one down pass it around yeah

1044
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,020
was that

1045
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,740
it doesn't say how many points

1046
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,300
are are i read maybe you know maybe each bottles a hundred points and that's why

1047
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:51,380
all that hide the top rewards are out of sound makes sense because there's so

1048
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,280

1168
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,800
- Zero points earned.

1169
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,960
(yelling)

1170
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,040
- Yes!

1171
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,840
- Oh my God, let's check our points.

1172
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:09,680

1173
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:10,500
- Let's check our--

1174
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,340
- Wait, tuition.

1175
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:13,880
- We are on our way to like one of the greatest--

1176
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,840
- Wait, go to tuition.

1177
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,360
- One second, just look at this.

1178
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:18,200
Just check this out.

1179
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:21,440
This is gonna blow your mind right here, looking at this.

1180
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,640
- Holy shit, we have fucking five points.

1181
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,040
- Oh, bad image quality.

1182
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,840
(laughing)

1183
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,840
- What?

1184
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,000
- We got zero points from our receipt picture.

1185
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:30,840
- How is that possible?

1186
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,600
That was such a high quality image.

1187
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,900
Yeah, that's fucked up.

1188
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,920
That image was so good, bro.

1189
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:38,300
That's so fucked up.

1190
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,880
We just got cheated out of points.

1191
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,800
I bet each bottle is five points.

1192
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,400
Go to the tuition, how many points to go to college?

1193
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,220
Okay, let's see here.

1194
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:48,620
We're gonna be sending a letter to Dr. Pepper

1195
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,520
about that ruling.

1196
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:52,440
Or with that picture of this receipt.

1197
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,280
We're gonna be suing Dr. Pepper.

1198
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,960
That has to be a tuition giveaway.

1199
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,600
All right, so Patrick, you didn't finish college.

1200
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:57,440
No, I didn't.

1201
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,680
How to enter, make a TikTok.

1202
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,200
This is perfect for Patrick.

1203
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,240
You got this dude.

1204
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,280
- Upload a video to TikTok to help us get to know you

1205
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,180
and your biggest dreams.

1206
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:06,520
From your academic goals to professional aspirations

1207
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:07,560
to personal dreams.

1208
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,280
Be passionate, be creative, be you, but above all else,

1209
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,180
tell us how winning will help you achieve these goals

1210
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,220
and live out your dreams.

1211
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,380
All right, let's do it.

1212
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:15,680
All right, ready?

1213
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:16,840
- Are you on?

1214
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,340
- I'm just recording and I'll upload it on TikTok.

1215
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,640
- Well, are you logged into the podcast one?

1216
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,480
- No, I don't know how to do that.

1217
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,640
- Just film on the camera.

1218
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,480
- I am logged in.

1219
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,640
- Okay, you make it then.

1220
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,200
- Okay.

1221
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,000
But you can earn up to $100,000 in tuition.

1222
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,120
Well, you could go back to school

1223
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,920
and you could finish your fucking degree.

1224
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:36,760
That's true.

1225
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,680
In Dr. Pepper Sciences.

1226
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,960
I never finished my degree,

1227
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,200
and I think due to a credits mishap,

1228
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,840
I think I was technically still a sophomore.

1229
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,840
Well, then 100K should cover all that.

1230
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,620
And you could probably live on campus too with the co-eds.

1231
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:51,720
That's true.

1232
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:52,920
I do love the co-eds.

1233
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,300
Listen, who doesn't love co-eds?

1234
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,200
All right, you gotta talk into the mic.

1235
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,920
Wait, let me put a filter on.

1236
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,160
Yeah, is there one that's like maybe a graduation cap?

1237
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:05,160
Oh my god, this one's funny.

1238
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,160
Oh, that is funny.

1239
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,200
I don't think, and maybe, oh, I have a disability too.

1240
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:17,560
Okay, then, yeah, let's, I guess I have to, okay, this one, I'm in a mirror, okay.

1241
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:25,040
Let me change the, I'm gonna have to put it on like three minutes, I don't know how, there's

1242
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,040
gonna be a lot of retakes.

1243
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,040
Yeah, it's fine.

1244
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:46,040
