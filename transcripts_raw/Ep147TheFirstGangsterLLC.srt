1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Our accounts are on the list.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Recording now.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Recording live.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's not live.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's live.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
We're not live.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Live right now.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
And then we put it out and then it's to tape.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I think.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Live to tape.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Yeah.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,360
Like the Tonight Show.

15
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,860
Isn't that his show? Yeah.

16
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,200
Johnny Pemberton did a show called Live to Tape.

17
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,200
I think that's his podcast name.

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,040
Call it the Johnny Pemberton Show.

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,360
I like Live to Tape. I think that's a good name.

20
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,360
I like Johnny Pemberton.

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
No, because you couldn't...

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,660
If you read it, you'd think it's Live to Tape.

23
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,160
Yeah.

24
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,160
Maybe that's the pun.

25
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,760
What is he, a damn painter?

26
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,160
It doesn't make any sense as a pun

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,000
because Live to Tape doesn't really mean anything.

28
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,860
I don't know.

29
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:58,060
I think that he should change it to the Awesome Show.

30
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,820
I think a lot of people have fucked up their show's names so bad.

31
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,740
Yeah, we should give advice on people's podcast names because we got it down.

32
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:09,740
We have like the perfect name for a podcast, right? Let's go through them.

33
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,180
Chapo Trap House.

34
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,540
Bad name, it's vulgar.

35
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,020
Just call it, just call it Freak of the Week.

36
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,940
You know, something like that.

37
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,460
Or like the Politics Hour.

38
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,260
Yeah.

39
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,460
Or like, like Funny Politics.

40
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,820
How about the Mind Hour?

41
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,700
Yeah.

42
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,300
Well, that's, somebody else could take that.

43
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,300
Poor guys, crazy politics.

44
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:33,300
And then like, this American life.

45
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,300
I don't know how many posts there are on chat.

46
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,300
How about story time?

47
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Story time.

48
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:41,300
What about Harmontown?

49
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
That's a good name for this American life.

50
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,300
Harming Women Town is what he probably could have called it.

51
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,300
What?

52
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,300
Stan Harmon.

53
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:52,300
No, I was saying that's a better name for this American life.

54
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,300
What, Harm in Town?

55
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,300
Harm in Town.

56
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,860
I just are like harm in town maybe like like critical role. Oh

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,320

Wait, wait, don't smell me. It's about a

66
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:51,860
a really stinky cock. Yeah, what about "Fart, Fart, Don't Smell It"? Yeah, that'd be a better,

67
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:58,060
way better show. That one's good. And instead of "This American Life" it'd be "Piss All

68
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,300
on My Wife". Okay. That would work too, there's a story about that. Yeah, what about "This

69
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:07,620
American Fart" and it's about American farts, huh? What about that? These are all good.

70
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,140

80
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,220
I don't even know them well enough to make that joke.

81
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,220
Do you guys remember that Mexican restaurant that we went to last time you guys were in

82
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,220
town, or last time Cam was in town?

83
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
I think so, yeah.

84
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
Yeah, where we like met up.

85
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,220
Do you remember how the guy made fun of me for drinking a bunch of water?

86
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,220
No.

87
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,220
You don't remember that?

88
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,220
No.

89
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,220
The guy kept being like, "Oh, you drink a lot of water, huh?"

90
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,220
And then the next time that I came...

91
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,060
a Shirley Temple there and he didn't make fun of me at all. Yeah, I know, and he made fun of me for

92
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,660
getting water. But I guess I drink a lot of water. And he just kept refilling it. And then the next

93
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,940
time I went, I asked for like some more water after I drank my first glass and he said, "Uh,

94
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:48,500
I think I remember you." And I was like, "Oh yeah, I drink a lot of water." And then the next time I

95
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,740
I went in last week, I walked in and he saw me, he went,

96
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:53,660
"Water boy!"

97
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,920
(laughing)

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:02,000
I guess I'm water boy at a restaurant in Ridgewood.

99
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,100
- That's just not a--

100
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,180
- If you finish the cup of water,

101
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,740
they're the ones who are refilling it.

102
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,080
It's not like you order like 10 waters.

103
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,560
That's kind of unfair.

104
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
- That's what I'm saying.

105
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,640
Like, buddy, you must just be a very good waiter.

106
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,260
drinking this out because I'm polite you know you put it in front of me I'm gonna

107
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:25,200

108
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:31,640

109
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,940

110
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,160
every fat guy food man when he walks in the damn door every time somebody walks

111
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,160
in who ate their food the last time they went out he goes oh food guy!

112
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Food man yeah!

113
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,160
What's up food man?

114
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,160
Oh let me guess you want food you fucking asshole!

115
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
Hey it's napkin guy!

116
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,160
This guy used a napkin last time he was here.

117
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
I remember he used a bathroom twice in one fucking trip.

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Fuck that waiter.

119
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
This guy has the worst signature ever guy.

120
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Your signature sucked on the receipt last time.

121
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,400
Every time I go I feel so guilty because he's fucking shitting on me for my water intake

122
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,980
that I tip him more every time.

123
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:15,040
I think he thinks that I like being called Waterboy.

124
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,040
Yeah.

125
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:22,800
Maybe on your next, maybe sign it Waterboy so the check doesn't go through.

126
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,920
Just completely stiff him.

127
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,880
God damn, what an asshole though.

128
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,440
You should go there and just get water.

129
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,440
No food.

130
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,160
That's a good idea.

131
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,160
Waiters love it.

132
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,160
Is that even legal?

133
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,840
Waiters love it when you don't buy drinks apparently.

134
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
Can you go in there?

135
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,840
I don't think me and Patrick ever told the story of our date.

136
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Yeah.

137
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,480
Me and Patrick went on an accidental date.

138
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,040
This is like two weeks ago too.

139
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
We haven't even talked about it.

140
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
Yeah, accidental date.

141
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
It was accidental.

142
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,960
Patrick, me and Patrick were walking to find some food.

143
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,400
This is back when my leg hurt way more.

144
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,680
And yeah, he was crying and he was like, "I don't want to walk any further than this restaurant."

145
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
I wasn't crying.

146
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Come on.

147
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
I was like, "I don't know man, this looks kind of expensive."

148
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,680
And he's like, "Really?"

149
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:05,600
And I was like, "Yeah, I mean yeah, but we can go in if you don't want to walk any further."

150
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,240
we went in and it was it was like a vibes bar yeah that nobody else was in with

151
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,600
like with like Christmas lights hanging up and like flowers everywhere and stuff

152
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,760
looks like Rex has a like it was beautiful they were yeah they were like

153
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,840
if food is a sin then call this vibes just like everywhere just to like take

154
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:29,520
pictures in front of and the waitress came over and was like can we start you

155
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,520
guys off with any drinks or like no we're just getting food and then she

156
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,080
like took our order and then five minutes later she came back and was like

157
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,160
- No, it wasn't even five, dude,

158
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,080
it was like 30 minutes later.

159
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,360
Like, we hadn't even, we hadn't gotten our food yet.

160
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,640
Like, it was like a weird amount of time for her to like--

161
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,080
- Yeah, she came back and she was like,

162
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,480
I just wanted to like double check

163
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,160
that you guys really didn't want any drinks

164
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,280
'cause we've never had anybody come in and not want drinks.

165
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,120
- Yeah, that's the upsell, dude.

166
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,480
- And we were like, oh no, sorry,

167
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,520
like we didn't mean to go on a date.

168
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
We just wanna get out of here.

169
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,200
- You didn't go Shirley Temple there?

170
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,040
- No, I didn't.

171
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,440
- She would've been fine with a Shirley Temple.

172
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
I yeah I should have got something.

173
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,840
The first sign there was something wrong is that the host who like seated us was DJing

174
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,160
at the front and he was dressed like Bruno Mars.

175
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,040
I didn't even realize he was DJing.

176
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,040
What the fuck?

177
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,440
That makes so much sense that's why he was in that little fucking outfit.

178
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,440
What what?

179
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
A DJ outfit?

180
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,560
Yeah he was wearing like no he was dressed like he was dressed like 2014 Bruno Mars.

181
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,560
Yeah he had like a vest.

182
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,800
Yeah like a hat that was crooked you know.

183
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:39,160
yeah all right he was he was doing disco he was he was like a band of style there

184
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,280
was great tables there the turntables were like right next to the door I

185
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,680
didn't they had they I pointed them out to you they had a plastic cover over

186
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,080
there over the records which I can like only assume is because people who come

187
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,800
in getting seated just reach over that's what I would do dude god that's funny I

188
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:03,680
had no idea he was DJing they should do like a bini hana style or like a bocce

189
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,820
grill style thing where you well I guess it's not the same like a Korean barbecue

190
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:14,040
thing but instead of a little oven you get a turntable and you can DJ for the

191
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,640
whole table yeah that would be such a good fucking idea dude. If you replace that with

192
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,760
touch tunes and you just up the price or you replace touch tunes with that and

193
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,240
you up the price you're gonna be making so much more money yeah. Didn't your

194
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,080
brother call you Pat asking for your touch tunes password? He did. Which I

195
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,560
I think you made the joke when we were talking about it.

196
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Uh...

197
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,160
Like, it was like, I...

198
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Yeah, I definitely...

199
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,800
Oh, that's how I know that you definitely shouldn't drink anymore?

200
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Yeah.

201
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,640
At one point you drank enough that you made a TouchTunes account?

202
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Yeah.

203
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,800
It's like, fuck, this dude loves The Who so much.

204
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,200
I didn't play The Who on it.

205
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,200
You did, you fucker.

206
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:01,400
No, no, no, no, we went to that Billiards Club and I would only play Sabbath.

207
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,840
pieces cuz that yeah that's like the dumbest that's the lamest yeah I've ever

208
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,720
done well that's also I think you queued up like a bunch of like a comedy album

209
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,440
like as we left I played the kids in the hall break it up

210
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,240
that's stupidest oh fuck I hate myself so much money on that I know the DJ hit or

211
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,160
hit the hit the the no it was like the only songs and Jim Gaffigan starts

212
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,800
playing. The only song I played off the Kids in the Hall soundtrack was the I'm

213
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,140
Gay one. Nice. Yeah. Funny move. Funny move by me. It's like me and my brother used to go to this

214
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:46,000
trucker bar. Oh great. I love reliving that. Nice dude. I love thinking about that. You're in a

215
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,600
better place now you know. That's true. Your permanently disabled leg. Yeah. That's better.

216
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,380
That's a good trade. I've had a good couple weeks. We just got back from the lake.

217
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,540
Neal's Lake House. Oh yeah we went to the lake. Had some much needed R&R.

218
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,900
I wore a ghillie suit. We both wore ghillie suits. I was shooting stuff with a BB gun.

219
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:10,300
Pat is like a... I forget because I haven't been around Pat for more than

220
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,860
like you know five hours at a time. I forget that he is like the worst

221
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,220
prankster in the world who loves it more than anybody. Like a prank to Pat is like

222
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:27,740
spitting on your ear and he'll be like "is that funny?" and everybody's like "no dude

223
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:35,140
that sucks dick" or he'll shoot a BB gun at your shoes. I didn't shoot anybody.

224
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:39,620
Why'd you shoot? Explain this big red dot on my forehead. I didn't shoot you. I did

225
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,140
not shoot you at all. You shot me in the head point-blank execution style.

226
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,980
Stop I did not shoot you. You did Benghazi to me with a BB gun. I made my

227
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,420
own targets out of the empty beer cans and the empty beer boxes and I made my

228
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,300
targets and I was a pretty good shot honestly. You sucked at it. I was very surprised at

229
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:04,180
how good I was at it. Maybe you should pick up shooting guns. You got a BB gun for the first time and

230
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:10,020
you took maybe 50 pictures in two days holding it. That's how I know you're not

231
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:17,020
destined to be a shooter. That's all I'm gonna say. That is not true. Absolutely true. I cannot count how many

232
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,420
pictures I received from you of you look at me I have a gun in the kitchen look at

233
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,900
me it's not that did not happen at all look at me I'm putting it in here look

234
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,940
okay that was funny it was funny he was just like I did all the time yeah I did

235
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,740
screenshot a lot of them so I can Photoshop you pointing it at homeless

236
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,140
people and such so you're gonna have to watch out for that in the future really

237
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:42,860
good I have those on my phone now I can see Pat becoming a gun guy yeah yeah I

238
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,300
feel like you have an obsessive enough you wait till he moves to New York to

239
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:52,180
become a gun guy. I know. Not where we lived in New Hampshire for 20 years. You know what the rule is with like

240
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,020
carrying a gun in New York? You can only you can only have it if you're a business

241
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:02,700
owner and you keep it at the business and it can only go between a business and a

242
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,000
gun range. Those are the two places you could bring your gun. Well I mean we

243
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,100
technically own a business. Yeah and the damn police department. All right. We own

244
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:27,560
a small we have an LLC we do walking down like like Myrtle with just like an RPG

245
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,820
like oh no I'm going to the range I'm going from the range back to my office

246
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,980
yeah you actually can't arrest me for are there any gun ranges here at all yeah

247
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,580
Yeah there's a couple.

248
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,720
They're probably like way out.

249
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,060
There's one in Queens I think.

250
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:44,460
There might be one in Brooklyn even.

251
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,780
I don't know.

252
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
This hippie city is bullshit.

253
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,220
This goddamn hippie city is bullshit.

254
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,740
I'm gonna show you the best gun range in New York City and go into the hotel room from

255
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,260
Taxi Driver.

256
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,620
It's funny to turn, I turned 24 and I felt like I got really old and then immediately

257
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:11,420
I was just like I gotta move to fucking like Texas or Wyoming like right now dude. Yeah

258
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,780
I was like I'm done with this this city slick and bullshit

259
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:19,960
I want to be able to have an entire I want to I want to have a whole layout dude

260
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:26,040
We already talked about this ATV. No that would never work for you. Why ATV?

261
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:33,660
I'm not even small doom big you are too small for me to puff bars to live in the in the

262
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,420
That's true. What do you mean?

263
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,260
- True.

264
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:39,220
- You are way too addicted to puff bars to love them with.

265
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,800
- I'll swap to cigarettes.

266
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,380
- You probably wouldn't have fast enough internet

267
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,700
to play your games either.

268
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,780
- True, too.

269
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,980
- I'd drop any of this any day of the week, dude.

270
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,820
- I'm sure you could.

271
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,580
- I'll drop caffeine, nicotine, video games.

272
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,420
I'll drop everything, dude.

273
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,740
You guys might never, I mean, I could be gone tomorrow

274
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,960
and you'd never hear from me again.

275
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,900
I could be a mountain man pretty fast.

276
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,500
- I'm back on the jewel.

277
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,220
I was smoking cigarettes for a little bit

278
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,800
and then I woke up and I didn't have any left,

279
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,600
So now I'm back on the jewel.

280
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,280
- That is one of the most exciting stories you've ever told.

281
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,200
That was, that's incredible.

282
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,000
- Well, I mean, we were, I don't know,

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,720
we were hanging out this weekend

284
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,520
and I just like kept buying cigarettes this weekend.

285
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,640
- Yeah.

286
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,480
It was nice.

287
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,880
It was nice to have somebody with cigarettes around.

288
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:22,760
- Yeah. Oh yeah.

289
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,540
But I had spirit menthols.

290
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,320
- Yeah. They were, those were not very good.

291
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,440
- Yeah. Those are the worst.

292
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,600
Spirits are the worst in general.

293
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,320
Cause it's just like you light that shit

294
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,260
and you're sitting there for like an hour smoking it.

295
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,580
Yeah dude, it's like a steak dinner of a cigarette.

296
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Yeah.

297
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,580
Yeah, it's still a little too much.

298
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
Feel full afterwards.

299
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,580
Oh yeah, dude.

300
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,580
Can't do it all the time.

301
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:46,180
But yeah man, I might disappear tomorrow.

302
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,740
I'll see you guys in like five years.

303
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
I have a full beard.

304
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Don't disappear.

305
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,740
Still with this patch going.

306
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
You would not have a full beard in five years.

307
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,740
Still with this little patch.

308
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,740
Yeah, you would not have a beard.

309
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,740
You would finally have one visible hair.

310
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
It would look like they talked to a baby's head.

311
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:56,740
Five years?

312
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,740
Five years, dude?

313
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,740
You'd get a Homer Simpson hair on your chin after five years.

314
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:01,740
Five years, you would look like me right now.

315
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,740
I bet if I was out there...

316
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,740
I bet if I was out there...

317
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,740
I bet if I was out there...

318
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,740
getting that vitamin D on top of my head...

319
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,740
getting that vitamin D on top of my head...

320
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,740
eating off the land, foraging, right?

321
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,740
Eating what I kill and shit.

322
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,740
You're not fucking foraging.

323
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,740
You are not foraging.

324
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
I could forage. You could not forage.

325
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,740
You guys keep doubting me.

326
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,740
One day I'm going to surprise you.

327
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
Anyway, if I'm out there living off that land,

328
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,740

00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,680
little bit we could get some bow and arrows in New York right I think that

336
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,300
New York is like Boston or like you can't even have like a like a long

337
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,220
pocketknife yeah legally yeah I doubt that they'd let you have a bow and arrow

338
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,940
Why not? That's like a gun. You can kill people. Yeah. That's better than a gun, dude.

339
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:29,380
It's more powerful than a gun. It can kill an orc. A gun can't. Untraceable. Mm-hmm.

340
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:32,860
Yeah, it's true. You can enchant it. You ever seen in a movie? What if that's the

341
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,260
law in New York is you can shoot a bow and arrow at anybody but you have to

342
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,380
have your name etched into the arrow. You're trying. The arrow has to be

343
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,900
traceable back to you otherwise not allowed. Yeah, that would make sense.

344
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,580
- Yeah, the thing is about an arrow is it can't be traced

345
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,600
'cause in movies, whenever somebody gets hit by an arrow,

346
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,860
they don't know where it came from.

347
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,320
- Exactly. - It's very sudden.

348
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,940
- It came from Legolas too.

349
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,500
- Yeah, or somebody. - We know,

350
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,220
people in the movie don't know, but we know.

351
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,940
- Exactly, nobody knows where that thing's,

352
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:03,940
it came from over yonder in the bush.

353
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,460
I guess that's the problem with having an arrow and bow

354
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,900
in New York City is that there's not a lot of bush to hide.

355
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,500
- You just do it from the rooftops.

356
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,340
- Yeah, I guess that would work.

357
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,340
But would you get like a, would it be like a,

358
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,460
like a wooden bow and arrow?

359
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,500
Or would you get like a big compound bow that's like a--

360
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,340
Probably.

361
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,020
Do you guys feel like that's cheating?

362
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:22,860
Yes.

363
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,900
Like that's too close to a real gun.

364
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,660
Anything that you have to like carry around

365
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,420
in a sniper case and assemble?

366
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,060
That's just, I mean, that's people,

367
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,580
bow and arrow people saw a crossbow and got jealous

368
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,420
and they made the big composite metal ones.

369
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,260
They can't just accept that somebody

370
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,540
invented a better version.

371
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,380
Exactly.

372
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,060
That you just click a button with.

373
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,020
Yeah, they're like, oh, we, yeah, oh,

374
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,540
I mean the crossbow is obviously cooler, more powerful, and better in every way.

375
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
Yeah, definitely.

376
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,860
It's half gun, half bow and arrow.

377
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:53,420
They were like, "We're gonna go a quarter gun, three-force, bow and arrow."

378
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,660
And it's perfect for vampire hunting.

379
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660
No, it's not.

380
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,660
Crossbow?

381
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:58,660
No, it's terrible for vampire hunting.

382
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,660
What are you talking about?

383
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,540
Because, you know, you need, you want wooden stakes.

384
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,460
Van Helsing has a crossbow.

385
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,860
Van Helsing's a horrible vampire hunter.

386
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:07,860
He's not, what are you, what are you, what?

387
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,060
I'm way better than Van Helsing at vampire hunting.

388
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,060
I have never seen you hunt a vampire.

389
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,060
That's why I'm so good at it.

390
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,060
Oh my god.

391
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,060
You know what? Good point.

392
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:20,060
Camera kills him with kindness.

393
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Yeah.

394
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,060
You know a vampire, that's their biggest weakness.

395
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
I walk up to their castle and I ring their vampire doorbell

396
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
and I say "I baked you some cookies."

397
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:30,060
They're never going to guess what I sprinkled

398
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
in those cookies before I baked them.

399
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
Holy lava. Poison.

400
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,060
Wow. Which kills them.

401
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
I thought it was something.

402
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:42,180
be killed with normal shit right yeah you could kill okay like why do they go

403
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,100
through why do they have to have this like special technique also a steak

404
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,100
through a heart will kill like me yeah you know like it's not like just for vampires

405
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:56,260
a gun could kill a vampire also enough garlic would kill a man right over time

406
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,180
they say if they're allergic those vampires vampires have been they've been

407
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,260
declining I mean it used to be originally it used to be that like you

408
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,100
have to like you have to put a steak through its heart and then chop off its

409
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,700
head and fill its mouth with garlic and then like put a horse over its grave or

410
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,540
something and now it's just like oh you can hand them a clove of garlic and

411
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,220
they'll melt away yeah yeah go to some of these fucking fast casual restaurants

412
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:24,100
they'll have enough garlic in that shit I mean it's burglary liberals that's

413
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:27,980
feminizing the vampires and and you know introducing chemicals to their body that

414
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,820
make them susceptible to sunlight yeah probably beyond meat might take one

415
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,260
One impossible whopper.

416
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,380
That's enough to kill two vampires.

417
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,540
Or at least turn them into sexy girl vampires.

418
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,100
Don't even get me started.

419
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,240
Oh my god, a girl vampire?

420
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,380
Why is that supposed to be hot?

421
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,100
I'm sick of getting seduced by vampires.

422
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,260
Why is it hot to have a girl vampire?

423
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,640
Is it just dresses?

424
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,640
Just a goth girl?

425
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,820
They have big dresses and long hair, duh.

426
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,820
Yeah, that is pretty hot actually.

427
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,820
That's the biggest widow's peak.

428
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,820
The hottest thing to me.

429
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,820
Long hair. Long white hair.

430
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,820
With a huge, a huge widow's peak.

431
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,820
Oh my god.

432
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
Your hair is so fucking long.

433
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,820
It's so long and receding.

434
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,820
You look so scary to me.

435
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
God damn that dress is big.

436
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,820
Please count for me.

437
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,820
One!

438
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,820
Two!

439
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,820
Oh the wooden scaffolding in that dress.

440
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,500
Oh my god.

441
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,340
Shame!

442
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:32,100
(laughing)

443
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,300
Goddamn, you lookin' like shit, girl.

444
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,140
(laughing)

445
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,700
Oh, you look horrible.

446
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,900
Goddamn, girl, you look like shit right now.

447
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,620
But you're a vampire, so it's sexy.

448
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,460
They don't have a girl sexy werewolf, do they?

449
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,560
No.

450
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,400
Well, I mean--

451
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,900
See, that wouldn't make any fuckin' sense, right?

452
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,020
Well, different strokes for different folks.

453
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:51,840
I think there's some people--

454
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,900
I'm trying to fuckin' stroke a girl werewolf.

455
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,740
There's probably some--

456
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,140
'Cause it looks like a dog, right?

457
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,980
And that's why you like it?

458
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:03,420
Not in the dog part you asshole. Are you seriously insinuating I want to fuck a dog?

459
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,900
You nasty crap ass. Man werewolves are so hot when they're not in their wolf form.

460
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:15,860
See, okay, well here's the thing. You look up sexy werewolf on Google Images and it's all men

461
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:22,740
showing up. It's because, it's because uh. Well okay, nevermind. It's because you try incognito and then search it.

462
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,540
(laughing)

463
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,940
Might be saving a couple of searches for you.

464
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,780
- All right, let me hit--

465
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:30,560
- And that's tailored specifically for you, so.

466
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:34,100
Oh, yep, all women, I can see it.

467
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,680
Yep, in the incognito.

468
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,380
- Oh, wow, that actually did--

469
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,620
(laughing)

470
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:50,580
I don't think that has anything to do with me, though.

471
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,940
I think that--

472
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,740
I think a gay guy's been using my computer all the time.

473
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,740
I think a gay werewolf has been on my computer.

474
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,740
Hey, you guys been using my computer?

You better not.

477
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
They better not be touching my computer.

478
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,740
Somebody's been using it, dude.

479
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,740
I hope no one's been touching my computer.

480
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,740

me. I gotta, you know, Christmas is for everybody. Here's a review, I'm looking at

508
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,580
reviews of a Cajun werewolf Christmas. Good story for a beginner reader of the

509
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:41,460
series. For a beginner reader? You started the last one? Dude, you're gonna miss all the sexual tension and buildup

510
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:45,380
Why is it I guess that's true. What is up with women and there's probably

511
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:52,640
5,000 romance novels about fucking a werewolf. Yeah, I mean it's the same thing as like when you go on like to be and there's a

512
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,340
Hundred like asylum movies called like giant spider versus ugly crocodile. Mm-hmm. Yeah, this is more sexual

513
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,380
This is the woman version of it is what I'm saying. Oh, yeah, that's fair. Yeah, but like do like

514
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,620
Do women want to fuck dr. Jekyll?

515
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,500
No, I it's weird women want to like like

516
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:19,220
Absolutely any monster. It's any monster who I try I went to I went to send send some of these two patches

517
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:26,040
And I sent him some about orcs and yeah, there's there's a very wide selection of what kind of monsters like dinosaurs or

518
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,380
There's a lot of dinosaur ones

519
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:33,380
Yeah, yeah

520
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,700
Fuck a dinosaur

521
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,460
I'll do this one.

522
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:38,460
With his penis.

523
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,820
Dinosaur erotic novels.

524
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
It's gotta be like a hybrid.

525
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,900
Taken by the T-Rex.

526
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,900
It's gotta be a hybrid.

527
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,900
What the fuck?

528
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,620
Space raptor butt invasion.

529
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,860
Ravished by the triceratops.

530
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,860
Oh they got the horns.

531
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:54,860
In the velociraptor's nest.

532
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,860
Kissing the coronavirus.

533
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Oh they got horns.

534
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,860
Woah.

535
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,340
I think women just love anything that's like evil.

536
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,340
Yeah.

537
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,340
Yeah.

538
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,340
That's what I'm saying.

539
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,340
A billionaire dinosaur.

540
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,340
Butt fucking alligator.

541
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,380
- A billionaire dinosaur forced me gay.

542
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,280
(laughing)

543
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,700
- What's wrong with that?

544
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:17,200
- Mounted by the many of us, is what I say.

545
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,660
- Oh, dude, that's a whole new genre I was not aware of.

546
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:25,320
- Yeah, there's a billionaire, first of all,

547
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,260
he's a dinosaur, but he's also a billionaire,

548
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,140
what the fuck? - Well, I guess that's like,

549
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,520
- Captivated by centaurs.

550
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,800
- Well, centaur makes sense,

551
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,440
They have a horse cock with a man's face conquered by Clippy

552
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,480
Clippy yeah

553
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:46,280
I'm just looking through that. It's gotta be just a goof the Amazon related. Yeah that one. I don't

554
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,120

555
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,680
Bread by the ogre King

Rescued by the Seder yeah, there's there's there's a lot here my hot night with the Haribo bear

557
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,600

558
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
*laughter*

559
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Hot damn, Toucan Sam!

560
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,600
You're fuckin' eatin' my pussy!

561
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
*laughter*

562
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,320
Oh, that's nasty.

563
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
That's not right!

564
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,600
Cleveland style, that's fuckin' nasty shit, dude.

565
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,600
Oh, Christ.

566
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,600
Oh, no!

567
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,600
Oh, no.

568
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Alright, um, we have a hip-hop list.

569
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,040
hip-hop list. Yeah, we have a list that's sure to piss Caleb off. Um, already fuming. I can't even

570
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,920
read the title. Somebody else to handle this bullsh*t. The top 10 worst things about rap music.

571
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,480
There's... Rap music is amazing in its influence and popularity. Far more than just a musical style,

572
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,640
rap and the sub-genres of rap have created distinct cultures with specific expectations,

573
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,560
status symbols, and norms. But while some rap artists have worked to buck the trend,

574
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,040
much of rap music seems to be heading down a scary path of intolerance, self-destruction,

575
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:03,640
and violence. This list seeks to identify the worst things about those forms of rap music

576
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,400
that do more harm to society than good.

577
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,760
That's Patrick saying that.

578
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,880
That's not me saying that.

579
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:09,880
That's Patrick saying that.

580
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,480
That didn't sound like me at all.

581
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,680
That was Patrick's voice. It sounded exactly like him.

582
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
No.

583
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:19,200
Why'd you read it that way, Pat? With your normal voice, I mean.

584
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,360
Stop looking like Wario. Knock it the fuck off.

585
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,360
Stop getting red.

586
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
Is that scary, Cameron?

587
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,880
I wasn't even looking. I didn't care.

588
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,880
Stop making that face, dude.

589
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
You're scaring Cameron, dude.

590
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
I don't want to do this list anymore, guys.

591
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,880
That's what you get. You messed with the bull, you got the horns, baby.

592
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:43,880
Now that's a good novel name right there.

593
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,880
"I messed with the bull and got the horns."

594
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,880
That's good. That is really good.

595
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,880
"Messed with a minotaur."

596
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,880
Number one, egotism.

597
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,880
I fucking hate egotism.

598
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,880
Ugh, one of the worst things in our society.

599
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,080
So, Alpha Q says, "Even good rappers like Kanye West has too much of this.

600
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,040
I think rap is going downhill real fast.

601
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:12,040
First you had a cool guy named Eminem and old Kanye and now you get a song about a vegetable.

602
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,040
What's so good about broccoli?

603
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,720
It ain't that good."

604
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,000
Oh, I just, I forgot about that fucking song.

605
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
What song?

606
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,320
That song, that was like Song of the Summer 2016.

607
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,320
Yeah.

608
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Broccoli?

609
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,320
Yeah.

610
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Oh, the Dram song?

611
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:32,720
Yeah, he doesn't go by drama anymore either. What does he go by the broccoli guy? Uh, I don't know he changed it

612
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,240
It's uh, no, I changed it to poop. Shelly Shelly FBA

613
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,680
Let's go he goes by Shelly now

614
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:48,400
That's a girl's name. Yeah, here's a comment. It isn't that I'm not tough enough to listen to rap

615
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:51,920
It's that I am tough enough not to listen to rap. Whoa

616
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,600
Here's a comment here says it depends if the person rapping can make it clever

617
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,320
I literally have no problem with this and that's from swag flicks

618
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:09,160
Someone says at least rockers are more respectful and respected

619
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:17,440
Thank you now I will win the debate for my class smiley face hashtag happy hashtag. Thank you hashtag if I knew you

620
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,040
I would buy you coffee

621
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:26,320
Here who thought by the way look at the kind of the more of the comments deeper down that these would be so insanely

622
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,960
Racist yeah, did you are you seeing the same one that I'm seeing?

623
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,520
Seeing a couple pretty fucking bad. Yeah

624
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:42,760
Here's one. Here's one. I love hip-hop music. I just hate the ego and that's a quote from ego by Macklemore

625
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:54,480
Always talking about themselves that and sex when you really think about it. It's gross. It's like glorifying crime, and I love rap

626
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,240
It's pretty good yeah

627
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,960
Yeah, oh my god. These are so fucking great. I really I don't know why I didn't foresee this yeah

628
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,100
Yeah, just think about like the most racist thing that yeah

629
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,420
- Pretty close.

630
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,720
- If you want to know what some of these comments look like,

631
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,560
text your grandpa right now.

632
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,320
Just say, "What do you think of this rap song?"

633
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,160
- Yeah, what do you think of this rap song?

634
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,600
- Scroll to Patrick's tweets from 2014.

635
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,440
- No.

636
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,320
- You're gonna find.

637
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,160
- Yeah, search.

638
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:25,980
- Come on.

639
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,520
- Why are you guys attacking me today?

640
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,960
- I'm not attacking you.

641
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,360
You want me to attack you?

642
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,200
- No.

643
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,020
- I'll attack you.

644
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,660
- Well then watch it.

645
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,640
Watch your tone, okay?

646
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,000
- Yeah, stop saying no when I say bad things about you.

647
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,680
And number two is sexism.

648
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,480
And here's the number one comment on it.

649
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,000
I'm a freshman in high school and I love jazz.

650
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,880
I'm a huge fan of John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy, Pharoah Sanders, Albert Ayer, Ernette Coleman,

651
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,760
Duke Ellington and several more.

652
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,960
Songs like Naima by John Coltrane, Namia?

653
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
It doesn't matter.

654
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,240
Naima by John Coltrane.

655
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,520
Talk about their love for that special woman in their lives.

656
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,060
Women inspire people.

657
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,060
This is too long.

658
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Never mind.

659
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,060
I give up.

660
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,560
What?

661
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:11,740
That is like a fucking paragraph.

662
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,460
I don't want to read the rest of that.

663
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,460
Why did you start reading it?

664
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,060
'Cause I thought it would get good.

665
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,060
*laughter*

666
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,060
Okay, wait, wait, blah blah blah blah blah.

667
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:25,560
These dumbasses can't see anything beyond a sexy body and a nice ass.

668
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,560
It's pathetic.

669
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,560
It's also insulting that people my age listen to this as if it's actually good.

670
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,560
If John Coltrane were still alive today,

671
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,060
he would be disgusted with what qualifies as music these days.

672
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,780
Oh my god if John Coltrane were alive today

673
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,220
John Coltrane yeah

674
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,940
If only dude if I could show young thug to John Coltrane

675
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,540
it'd be like showing a smartphone to a caveman dude he had me crucified

676
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,180
be fucking a nightmare

677
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,820
someone says uh horrifying

678
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:57,700
I am a mormon and I hate this so much

679
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,420
this is the reason I do not go to school dances

680
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,660
my mom even says it's talking about a party

681
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:08,540
But I know better when let's do it is repeated 50 times in a quote-unquote song so to speak

682
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,500
You sound cool, dude

683
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:14,280
Whenever a rapper makes a song about woman

684
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:19,600
It'll always be about having sex with them or the whole song will be focused on their boobs. I'm sick of it

685
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
I forgot to mention that I'm a guy

686
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,940
Although I am male I am sick of them using women only for sex

687
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:31,500
They just care about their backsides and breasts and I am sick of it

688
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,700
I hate songs like that and they make me want to do a violent protest

689
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:42,060
I refuse to touch the entire genre for fear of hearing something disgusting

690
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,540
I could appreciate it in spite of everything else, but not this

691
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:54,740
Surprise that no one has tried to ban rap yet. It promotes more violence drug use and misogyny than any other music genre

692
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:01,520
Yeah, yes, I'm not one of those psycho feminists, but I agree that some rap songs are bad to woman

693
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,640
They treat females like objects or decorations

694
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,040
You know how rap songs always talk about mounting a girl's head

695
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
Putting a star on top of a woman's head

696
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
Like a deer

697
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,040
Yeah

698
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
Wrapping a woman up in tinsel

699
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
Here's a comment here

700
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:21,040
Just three words

701
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
Women are meat hole

702
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
*laughter*

703
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:29,040
(laughter)

704
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,040
Rappers view women like slaves and have no feelings for them, only sexual attraction.

705
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
(laughter)

706
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,040
Oh, fuck.

707
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,040
Ugh.

708
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,040
Oh, fuck me, dude.

709
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,040
It's so good.

710
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
(laughter)

711
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,040
Uh, yeah.

712
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:53,040
I mean, I'm sure it's gotta just be like 11 year old kids, right?

713
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:00,680
No, this is all 20 year old men. That's what I can't tell they have the same type of the same the same rhetoric

714
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,320
It comes to this. This is a secret lives of the pitchfork editorial board

715
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:12,820
Let's say go give a chief Keefe album like a 10 out of 10 and they're like he's he has a he's he's creating a

716
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:17,960
Musical tapestry. Yeah, this is more like opera than rap. Yeah, then they go on here and they're like

717
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,040
Right by the way, I'm a guy and even I hate this sex bullshit

718
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,120
Number three pointless lyrics

719
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:33,240
Okay, so these people have obviously never heard of immortal technique MF doom

720
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:37,280

Farting

Xbox Preston Lacey again rest in Lacey's son

734

Woody Allen

00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,240
Spose the guy who made I'm awesome Roman Polanski

736
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:35,280
Salva Harvey Weinstein Bryan Singer is hard with fucking firefighters

737
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,960
Empties

00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:46,240
Yeah

740

You know, I mean I could go on but it was we could go on forever that's

741
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:05,920
People with with pointed lyrics guns and roses exactly Rosie O'Donnell

742
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,520
There's this comment here

743
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,640
Cameron, why don't you read this top comment?

744
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,440
I have always hated rap music.

745
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,800
I'm black, so everyone assumes I listen to this trash.

746
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:22,120
Nearly every rap song nowadays is consistent of controversial lyrics pertaining to sex,

747
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,680
drugs, racism, money, violence, and struggles.

748
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,000
I hate when people talk about struggles.

749
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,200
I listen to rock and roll.

750
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,120
At least they shift their style every once in a while.

751
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:35,080
I listen to bands like Saliva, Motorhead, Disturbed, Kiss, and AC/DC.

752
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,560
Dude, some of the kings of rock.

753
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,500
I mainly hate rap because of stereotypical views.

754
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,260
People assume that all black people listen to rap.

755
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,700
I don't and I never will again.

756
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,820
Even country musicians have some point of talent.

757
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,780
Throwing disturbed in there is so funny.

758
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,380
Like complaining about like they're talking like they only rap about money and violence

759
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,140
and struggles and disturbed just raps about like being hit by.

760
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,900
First of all they do rap in their music.

761
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
Yeah.

762
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,900
Yeah.

763
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,580
They have one they have a rap song about about dropping plates on your ass.

764
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,580
Okay.

765
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,580
So maybe study up.

766
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:09,580
ACD where every song is like, "Let's have a birthday party! Yeah!"

767
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,100
Disturbed is just about like, it's about either being at your breaking point to become a school

768
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,020
student or being hit by your mother or the Holocaust should never happen again. Those

769
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:21,020
are the three types of Disturbed songs.

770
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:26,020
They really are disturbed. Somebody needs to put them in jail.

771
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,780
Absolutely.

772
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,180
You would think with that name.

773
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,540
Remember when David Draymond from Disturbs did an acoustic cover of the Sound of Silence

774
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,020
for Blue Lives Matter?

775
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,020
No, that's shit though.

776
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,020
Didn't he do it on Conan?

777
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,460
Maybe, I don't know.

778
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,100
I didn't listen to it or watch it.

779
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:48,460
I just saw it and went, "Yup."

780
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,860
Rap music sounds terrible and the lyrics are absolutely ridiculous.

781
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,340
If you could even understand what they are, that's one of my favorite kinds of people,

782
00:38:56,340 --> 00:39:00,900
people who listen to English native English speakers who listen to rap and

783
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:05,940
they're like I don't know what they're saying that's one of the greatest things

784
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,300
of all time when I listen to music I can't hear the lyric like not like hear

785
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,100
the lyrics but like I paid more attention to the music than the lyrics

786
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:18,340
okay so you're telling me I just try to like feel it yeah I just like

787
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:22,580
immediately identify like I'm writing up the score in my head when I'm listening

788
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,940
so I don't really have times to focus on the words sounds like that's what you're

789
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,940
doing

790
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:50,740
favorite

791
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,400
Well I don't pay, I don't know, I don't really pay attention to the lyrics of songs.

792
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,200
I don't pay attention to the music dude.

793
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,000
Yeah, I'm all about the lyrics.

794
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
That's why I listen to PJ Masks.

795
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah.

796
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Yeah, they got a lot of good lyrics.

797
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,000
They have a lot of great songs on the PJ Masks.

798
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
The PJ Masks soundtrack, I mean, is untouchable.

799
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,560
Some of the greatest artists.

800
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,040
Bedtime is the right time.

801
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,760
Can't finish the rhyme.

802
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,760
Today's rap sounds like a bunch of down-syndromed crack babies mumbling random gibberish.

803
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,600
I used to like rap, but then I grew up and realized how mentally handicapped and warped

804
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,360
you have to be to think that mainstream rap content is a complete garbage.

805
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,080
You want real music today?

806
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:37,040
Try some jazz, symphonies, rock, or any other genre that requires talent.

807
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,280
Genres like rap and pop are nothing but talentless dancers and actors using autotune.

808
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,720
It's cancer.

809
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,720
Mentally warped?

810
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:50,400
be warped but then I got into symphonies because talking about how they're going

811
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,300
to do stuff to 50 girls and shoot up a bank sure isn't pointless I'm gonna do

812
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:10,460
stuff to 50 girls. In 2018 we have Kiki, Fifi, Bubba, Bebe, Sese, Billy, Kuda, Gummo. Do I

813
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:17,460
i need to say more and now we have no gumbo

814
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:20,500
no kiki no kura no hope

815
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:27,260
they just did exactly what we did

816
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:30,260
okay so there's a there's a comment here that's in some other language i just put

817
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,340
it's in turkish

818
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,940
i just google translated it

819
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:37,100
and it translates to ever heard kendrick fuck motherfucker three days grace

820
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:49,080
listeners. Number four, the sound. That's one of the worst things about rap

821
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:57,340
music is the sound. Yeah, the sound of it. Yeah, the volume in rap is way too loud.

822
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,460
It can hurt the eardrums as children.

823
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,620
It can be hard on their hearing early.

824
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:11,980
It's too loud.

825
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:17,100
Oh fuck.

826
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,260
It's too loud.

827
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:22,060
That's kind of the only good comment on this one.

828
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,020
Everything else is people, because what the fuck does this even mean?

829
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,540
Yeah, there's a response to that comment that says, "This is actually not an ignorant

830
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:35,060
statement, "Google the loudness war. This way of mastering music is found in other genres as well."

831
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,780
What is that? Just music got louder or some shit?

832
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,460
Yeah, I mean people just produced it louder gradually. I mean that's the kind of thing

833
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:46,500
you want. You'll want to go on YouTube and search like "the fall of music" and watch like a seven

834
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:51,620
hour documentary made by a 12 year old. Yeah. If you want to learn about that, there's, I'm sure

835
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:55,060
there's plenty of good videos. Yeah, where they have a 30 minute thing at the end thanking their

836
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,500
patrons yeah yeah and you're like how the fuck there's five how many yeah I do

how hungry are you for a two-hour video about the making of Half-Life 2?

843
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:35,860
I have to see how roly-poly only changed TV forever one day early. I need to find

844
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:41,520

847
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:56,140
please dude fuck number five glorification of the gangster mentality

848
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,380
that's one of the best things about rap music yeah dude we do that I feel like

849
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,980
we glorify in a good way I mean it's good dude every you know it's good to be

850
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,740
gangster it's true good mentality I'm we're basically three gangster gang

851
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:15,660
bangers with from the hood with crazy mindsets and that's like why we started

852
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:21,440
that's like how we found each other too. Yeah, we went on gangster.com and we searched for

853
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,280
gangsters in your area. Gangstermeat.me. We were on Gangster Bumble and we kind of all

854
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,360
linked up. And we all linked up and then we had a... We were on Hinge and we all listed

855
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:38,740
our interests as Gangster Mindset. Yeah, Gangster Mindset, being from the hood, being a swagged

856
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:44,580
out player and that's how we all met each other. Yeah. Yeah. Even though we were all

857
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:49,220
from different hoods. We still came and we formed our own. I mean that's why it's

858
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:52,800
such a success story. Yeah and now we're like I would say one of the top four

859
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,300
gangs. One of the biggest. MS-13, Crips, Bloods and then Sullivan the Frog LLC.

860
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:05,100
Yeah. Yeah we're like one of the biggest gangsters. We're the only one that's LLC.

861
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:08,940
We have the money mindset. We decided we were the first people

862
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:14,340
the first people to ever ever combined businessman mindset and gangster

863
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:20,220
mentality. Exactly. You gotta get the hustle in there. Our Instagram

864
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:26,260
quotes page went fucking gangbusters. Yeah, which we do not like the gangbusters.

865
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:30,740
We've been fighting them for a while. But then now we give back to the hood and we go back

866
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,940
into our communities and we show them how to be gangster as well. Which is one of the most amazing things about it.

867
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:41,100
amazing start a small business gangsters with small businesses yeah we teach them

868
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:45,580
how you can actually make a thug cry and it's actually not that big a deal yeah I

869
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:49,700
mean look at this comment here gangsters are a bunch of idiot crybaby ugly guys

870
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:59,460
they love praying for more weeds and crushing the cracks which that's true if

871
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,980
you listen to a real artist you might realize that they regret their actions I

872
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:14,060
I love this list it's 100% factual it's 100% factual what a joke shooting people

873
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,260
will get you nowhere in life but jail tell that to the freakin army exactly

874
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:23,700
this guy this guy supports the Holocaust he didn't want to kill the Nazis sheesh

875
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:29,180
that's guys evil yeah tells you a lot about people who who oppose the gangster

876
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:32,180
hustled business mindset.

877
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:34,380
This is, in my opinion, the worst part of rap.

878
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,060
It completely alienates anyone who isn't part of the gang culture and glorifies being

879
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,060
a criminal.

880
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:43,740
We know that's the number one consumer of rap in the world and not, like, people who

881
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,740
look like me.

882
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,060
Well, most of it, all of the mainstream at least.

883
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:50,700
The best part of gangster culture and media is the part where it shows the cons as well,

884
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:54,820
like the Godfather, where it shows Michael becoming evil and even killing his own brother.

885
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,540
This is nowhere to be found in rap.

886
00:46:56,540 --> 00:47:00,540
Again, they just got it all wrong. I didn't know Michael became evil.

887
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,540
Jesus. He's cool. He doesn't become evil, he becomes fucking sick.

888
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:08,540
I have seen The Godfather. Really? I've seen parts of it.

889
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:12,540
I watched it for the first time this year. Yeah, I'll have to sit down and watch it

890
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,540
sometime. You've watched it with my dad? Yeah.

891
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,540
That's a movie my dad used to throw on and then I would like

892
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,540
want to play GameCube or something. You guys remember, I mean

893
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,260
I mean, there's a, I mean, great, great impressions you get from the goth that are like

894
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,260
*goth noises*

895
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,260
*goth noises*

896
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,260
*goth noises*

897
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:35,260
*goth noises*

898
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:37,260
*goth noises*

899
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,260
*goth noises*

900
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,260
Remember how he had the cotton balls in his cheeks and he was sounding like

901
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,260
*goth noises*

902
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:45,260
*goth noises*

903
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,260
I loved him.

904
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,260
Do you know him? Yeah, he was good in that. I mean,

905
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,260
Who was that? *goth noises*

906
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,260
*goth noises*

907
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:54,260
That was Doodle Don Corley SpongeBob.

908
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,260
(laughter)

909
00:47:56,260 --> 00:47:57,260
Doodle Don.

910
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,260
I mean, yeah.

911
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,260
The evil Doodle version of Don Corleone.

912
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,260
It was genius. I mean, at first they had him without those cheeks and then, you know,

913
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,260
Dr. Godfather, the director, came in and he was like, "I want him to look more like a chipmunk."

914
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,260
And I wanted him to sound like an idiot.

915
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,260
Did you know that he actually put poop in his mouth for that?

916
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,260
(laughter)

917
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,260
And he kept it in his mouth like a chipmunk?

918
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,260
Yeah, the director wanted him to take it out, but he wouldn't.

919
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:22,260
Yeah, that was not even like an acting decision. That was just an addiction.

920
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,260
(laughter)

921
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,740
That's why you can tell at the end of all the shots he goes

922
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,740
*nom nom nom* and they have to cut that out.

923
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:33,060
They cut out the deleted scenes where at the end he does a big cartoonish swallow.

924
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,060
He says "I sure love crap"

925
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:37,060
"Delicioso"

926
00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:37,560
Yeah.

927
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,560
You know, cause the mafia.

928
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,560
Oh.

929
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:43,560
That's Italian for delicious.

930
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:47,560
Um, no, number six, no talent goes into it.

931
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,560
Alright.

932
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,560

I mean they'll do shit like that out there. It's tough.

960
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
Some of these gangsters are heartless.

961
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,320
[Laughter]

962
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,320
Except for us.

963
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,320
Uh huh.

964
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,320
Um, let's see.

965
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,320
Did we read the comments for this one?

966
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,320
These comments are too long.

967
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,320
Yeah.

968
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,320
Um, some of these are like

969
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,320
I mean, a lot of

970
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,320
these kind of repeat. Like number

971
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,840
Seven here, no variation.

972
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,680
That's kind of the same thing.

973
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,120
- Yeah, that's kind of what I'm saying about this list.

974
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,640
- Yeah, hey, you know, we should write a diss track

975
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:16,480
for this list.

976
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,300
- That's a good idea.

977
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,120
- Oh, dude, that'd be like the biggest one ever, dude.

978
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,760
- Yeah, number of the top 10 worst things about this list.

979
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:25,120
Number one, not funny.

980
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,560
- Yeah, some of these, some of these boys,

981
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,440
some of, they suck.

982
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,340
- Yeah, number two, they suck.

983
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:33,220
- Number seven, no variation.

984
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,560
- Yeah.

985
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:38,200
- Comments are way too long on this one.

986
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,040
- Yeah.

987
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,640
- You guys gotta cut it down.

988
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,920
- Have you noticed that rappers find it impossible

989
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,000
to make a lyric that isn't one, sexually explicit,

990
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,560
two, violence promoting, three, racist or sexist,

991
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,600
four, loaded with swears?

992
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:56,520
- Look, I just want a rapper who raps very fast

993
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,680
and doesn't swear.

994
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:00,680
- Yeah, I want a rapper who makes a one second song

995
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,760
where I can't tell if he swears or not.

996
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,000
And it's about nothing, it's about making,

997
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,240
about doing dishes. Ideally it has to be completely ambiguous whether the song is

998
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,800
about God or suicide. Yeah, that's the genre I want to be listening to.

999
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:20,760
Or bullying. Number eight, songs bragging about having money. For the love

1000
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,880
of God, no one cares about how much money you have. Music isn't about having money.

1001
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:32,240
I understand that people need to make a living somehow, but that's not the main

1002
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,320
idea music is about expression and inspiration it's there to explain

1003
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:40,600
something to you it has a deeper meaning behind it music music isn't just about

1004
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:46,040
making money that just isn't even music I have no tolerance for that why would

1005
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,560
rappers brag about money hanging out their butts

1006
00:52:50,560 --> 00:53:01,600
why no that was seven good you have money now use it for something other

1007
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:06,380
than you crack addiction. Whoa. I don't think there's any rappers except DMX who are

1008
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:11,340
addicted to crack, right? I don't know. I mean it's probably not something that

1009
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:17,320
many people would like to be public about. Right. Wait, wait you read one

1010
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:21,660
about money hanging out of the butt, right? Yeah. There's a second one that says

1011
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:26,140
I hate it when a rapper is all money hanging out of my butt. Peasants always

1012
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:31,240
screaming wait what? Peasants? What is that? Is something, is there is there like a

1013
00:53:31,240 --> 00:53:36,640
rapper I'm missing he raps about money hanging out of his ass. Sir Mix-a-lot.

1014
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:43,940
He's always talking about peasants. MC Vassal dude. He raps about these

1015
00:53:43,940 --> 00:53:47,440
serfs all the time. King Arthur. Can you let them, can you give him a break?

1016
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:51,720
King Arthur. Now I can tell number nine's gonna be really good. I mean I can tell

1017
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:58,280
there's gonna be some great comments. Number nine is racism.

1018
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:06,860
well I mean it just being used in a casual conversation one more time I

1019
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:11,460
think I'm going to go insane do they even know what it means it's not some quote

1020
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:18,340
unquote dope slang term god I'm surprised that we aren't extinct yet if people

1021
00:54:18,340 --> 00:54:21,540
talked that way back in the 20th century people would just absolutely be

1022
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:30,420
disgusted people hated using the n-word in the 20th century nobody used it back then

1023
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:37,140
here's a here's a comment here a lot of rap insults whites about being weak and

1024
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:40,900
getting life easy just because we didn't grow up in the ghetto I grew up in the

1025
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,780
ghetto we've already been over this mm-hmm I'd like to hear that say that to

1026
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:49,860
early Europeans Europe was a death trap it still is and imagine how Alexander the

1027
00:54:49,860 --> 00:55:13,780
crate the root of racism is rap hey this rapper thinks you're weak and he's like

1028
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:14,780
What?

1029
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:15,780
Excuse me?

1030
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,780
That's racist.

1031
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:17,780
I mean he would conquer them.

1032
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,780
Mm-hmm.

1033
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,340
He's Alexander the Great, that's what he does.

1034
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:23,340
Number 10, misinformation.

1035
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,340
I mean that's one of the worst crimes.

1036
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:31,180
I mean look at what happened in 2016 with the election.

1037
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:37,340
There was a rap song called the Pantsuit Anthem and it spread a lot of misinformation.

1038
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:39,620
Yo voting isn't till December.

1039
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:42,940
You guys remember that?

1040
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:46,720
Most rappers say things that are meant to rhyme, but it ends up sounding really stupid

1041
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,120
and gets a lot of people in trouble.

1042
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,620
That is, misinformation is when it doesn't rhyme.

1043
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:55,500
A lot of people get in so much trouble from these misinformed rap lyrics.

1044
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:59,100
Alright, these are the contenders.

1045
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:00,580
Unoriginal lyrics, okay.

1046
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,460
I mean, you already said that, I think.

1047
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,080
Songs about sex.

1048
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:10,940
Someone says, "You people do know that Crank That Soulja Boy's songs was about ejaculation,

1049
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,940
right?"

1050
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:14,200
(laughter)

1051
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,360
- Ejaculation.

1052
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:18,900
Damn.

1053
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:23,720
- Number 13, excessive profanity.

1054
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:24,560
- Yep.

1055
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:26,880
- Yes, using the same cuss word at the end of every sentence

1056
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,220
does help make everything rhyme,

1057
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,740
but really it's enough already.

1058
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,100
And it's not just that it is objectionable language.

1059
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,600
If you use any word that many times it sounds stupid.

1060
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,440
If rap lyrics are supposed to be an art,

1061
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:37,940
then excessive profanity is like

1062
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,020
only drawing pictures of vaginas.

1063
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:46,620
Maybe amusing at first and simple minds will have more tolerance for it, but eventually people are going to want to see a picture of a sunset.

1064
00:56:46,620 --> 00:56:48,620
*laughter*

1065
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,620
That guy has such a beautiful mind.

1066
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,620
I'm sick of these pussies!

1067
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,620
Can I just see a fucking sunset for once?

1068
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:58,620
Can I just search "porn" and find pictures of a sunset?

1069
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:00,620
Sometimes I want to jack off to something new!

1070
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:02,620
Can you turn one of these into a flower?

1071
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,620
Oh, come on!

1072
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,620
Christ almighty!

1073
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,620
This is the most disgusting vagina bullshit I've ever seen.

1074
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:13,000
shit I've ever seen. What happened to the moon and the stars? Can you just make this look

1075
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:20,000
like an orange or something? Just open an orange and make it look like a pussy, please? God,

1076
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I'm sick. Number 14. Number 14, it's just talking. Yep, if I want to hear talking, I

1077
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:34,580
would start a bloody conversation. Excuse me. No wonder both opera and rap are so popular.

1078
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:40,900
No wonder both opera and rap are crazy. Take your pick. Singing when you're

1079
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,660
supposed to be speaking or speaking when you're supposed to be singing? Fuck.

1080
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:49,700
That's like a... he's right in the center. Number 16. Kids trying to imitate real

1081
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:54,900
gangsters. I prefer to be a sad skinny geek than be a wannabe weed eater ugly

1082
00:57:54,900 --> 00:58:02,020
guy. Weed eater? When a five-year-old is throwing up gang signs your way and

1083
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:07,700
singing rap music you know you don't belong on this planet.

1084
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:12,140
I'm skipping around but number 59 is uh...

1085
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:13,700
pornography.

1086
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:15,860
There's only one comment on it that says

1087
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:22,860
"I don't think that's really rap music."

1088
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:26,580
Uh... songs about getting drunk, high, or intoxicated.

1089
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:30,700
Someone says if you take out the lyrics from rap music there are no words.

1090
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:41,380
really smart stupid dances invented by rappers every time I see one I like what

1091
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:44,900
the hell are they doing they look so damn stupid

1092
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:50,900
most modern phony rappers compare themselves to Tupac and Biggie

1093
00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:59,380
glorification of violence offensive lyrics sellouts hip-hop feuds negative

1094
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:05,100
messages it could send bad messages to unger viewers songs about strip clubs

1095
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:11,180
and then evil cute girl Jigglypuff says I hate that kind of stuff number 71 porn

1096
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:18,820
rap and the only comment is what is a porn rap I really loved number 74 yeah

1097
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:24,260
that is like that sounds like a fucking like substitute teacher it's cacophony

1098
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:28,740
and then the person says all they do is say a bunch of pointless trashy words

1099
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:32,100
with their hideous voices to a bunch of awful music in the background.

1100
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:39,860
Uh, crunk, wannabe gangsters, screaming, songs about rape. What the fuck?

1101
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:48,180
Alter egos. Dude, I fucking hate rap because of all the alter egos.

1102
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,940
Well, because I can't tell them apart, dude. It's fucking annoying, dude. Is this supposed

1103
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:58,580
to be Victor Vaughn? Who the fuck is singing? Who is this, dude? Is this MF Doom or King Ghidorah?

1104
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:06,780
