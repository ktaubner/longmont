00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,580
You don't have to say that.

40
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,580
You don't have to say that.

41
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,580
There's no legal reason.

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:05,940
Everybody do have to say this is the most beautiful song in the world.

43
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,860

He's a CEO by day and at night. He's a rock star. What's he the CEO of?

51
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,180
Have you found out he's a CEO? It's called like leapfrog.

52
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,140
What?

53
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:56,140
He's the CEO of not leapfrog. Hold on.

54
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,980
Well, why did you say leapfrog? You got me all excited. That's crazy. I was

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,660
like, I like my frog. He's been with me my entire life. I didn't know tree frog

56
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,440
it's on your frogs tree frog. I think it's called tree frog. What is tree frog

57
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,820

58
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,360

59
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,520
Show

60
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:20,380
yeah, that's definitely him warning a really long by. I was like huh, maybe

61
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,300
maybe this isn't him because I clicked on the web. It's like the first Google

62
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,880
result and I was like oh, maybe this isn't him and then it has a picture of

63
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:31,920
him. I know ain't no way that is not him right, because it's a picture of him.

64
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,500
Well I mean I have face blindness. I don't know if that could be him or not.

65
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,380
I've been taken I have face blindness recently. I've had face blindness since the day I was

66
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,540
born. I tried to remember what my wife looked like yesterday and I just couldn't picture

67
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:49,460
her at all. I can't picture anything in my head of a face. Holy shit this bio is crazy.

68
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:55,140
Wasn't he talking about Zimbabwe and stuff? What's the company do? I think they do tree

69
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:02,140
frog stuff. The switch to web is a big part of the bio. Holy fuck. Wait what do they do?

70
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,980
- Maybe not if I'm gonna patronize this business.

71
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,300
- They are based out of Canada.

72
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,000
They are the Swiss Army Knife of digital transformation.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
- Oh, okay.

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,340
(laughing)

75
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,300
- So, if you were wondering what he's the CEO of.

76
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,260
- That song is so good, man.

77
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,860
♪ Calling all unicorns, unicorns ♪

78
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,460
- He records every single video

79
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,900
promoting it in his car, which is so sick.

80
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,060
- I have listened to that song in the last two months.

81
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,100
I have listened to that song driving my car.

82
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,580
It made me better drive my car.

83
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,320
playing video games made me incredible at video games. I did I tried to do a

84
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,660
squat to a one time and it didn't go very well. Yeah, we're here trying to

85
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,900
dance too hard. It was not a good. You were like you were kicking out your legs

86
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:46,700
and doing can can yeah, exactly stuff. Yeah, in the squat that would be on it.

87
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,780
We gotta look into the science behind that as a workout,

88
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,780
the science of moving your leg, no, the science of doing the can can while

89
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,860
you're doing a squat. Well, maybe not doing a squat, but if you had waited,

90
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,980
you know, there's like waited the leg things, the things that make you better

91
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:04,020
Yeah, exactly. I feel like people do that. That's like aerobics or something,

92
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,180
right? No, we'll do stuff like that and swinging their limbs around. That's not

93
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,140
a really so I think that can't be so far off. Is that aerobics? That's basically

94
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:18,900
aerobics. Okay. Yeah, I think speaking of using those to get higher jumping. I

95
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,620
think that I'm going to try to dunk by the end of this year. Yeah, I think that

96
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,980
is my new goal. It's it's crazy that I've never dunked. I know. No, it's just

97
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,980
that you talk about basketball the same way I talk about skateboarding.

98
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,980
I'm better at basketball than you are at skateboarding. No, that is not true at all.

99
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,980
Yes, I am. We are the same skill level. No, no, no. I'm way better at basketball than you are at skateboarding.

100
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,980
Not at all. I'm so much better. That's not true.

101
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,980
You've never, you don't know. I've watched you skate. You've never seen me play ball.

102
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,980
You've never seen me hoop. I have seen you play ball. I'm nice. I've seen you hoop.

103
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,980
I've seen you hoop in college. I was fat in college.

104
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:59,300
in college. I seen you hoop in college in the all comedy troop basketball tourney

105
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,220
tournament. And we only lost because they had a, they had a Terminator on their

106
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,180
team. They did. They had that big Swedish kid. This kid, they had this

107
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,580
fucking kid. It was all supposed to be, it was me and Joe and then one of us.

108
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,580
Did you guys set that up? Was that your doing? I think Joe did it. Yeah. That

109
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,740
is, it makes so much fucking sense that Joe set that up. It was like all of the,

110
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,660
all of the comedy people in, in college and it was a three V three basketball

111
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,900
tournament and the first year I think we destroyed and then the second year one

112
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,940
of the troops got this like Swedish kid who had been in the Swedish army and he

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,100
was like six foot four and insanely jacked and he was like twenty six years

114
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,680
old. He was like way older than he was. He was older than he was older school.

115
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,320
Yeah, he was way, way old. I was old as hell. His name was like everybody

116
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,760
called him like thunk. I think his name was third. Oh no, everyone called him.

117
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,320
I thought I remember him yeah yeah, because he looked like a cave man. He

118
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,500
looked like a like a complete game. That's why they called him that and he

119
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,520
obviously destroyed us. He and he had no it was one of those things were like it

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,540
was so sad because he was from Sweden. It was clear that he was never had it

121
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,820
was sad. He had never played basketball before, but the fact that he was bigger

122
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:12,940
and stronger, he just by default one yeah. Well, it was also the comedy troop

123
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,980
basketball team. I don't think they were sending. I think they were the only ones

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,960
you say that man, if you think he's strong, you should have seen the other

125
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,300
guy in the Swedish Army. Yeah, two guys,

126
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,420
yeah, yeah, I just don't think that that's right. He was he's basically like

127
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,500
you know, you should have been barred from going to school. One he was trying

128
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,620
to win. He was trying to win. He wasn't trying to be comedic in his basketball

129
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,160
playing in any way, like some of us were you. He tried to do. He thought that it

130
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:45,200
was he didn't realize it was a car. I thought it was a basketball, a basketball

131
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,240
comedy show. We were doing Globetrotters. Joe is in here right now.

132
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Joe, we're talking about the basketball tournament.

133
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,240
Yeah. That Joe got really mad about it.

134
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,240
You got heated, I remember.

135
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,240
I was doing the Michael Phelps thing.

136
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,240
That's swimming. What is doing the Michael Phelps thing mean?

137
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,240
Come here. We can't hear you from over there. Talk into my mic.

138
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,240
Talk into Caleb's mic. Talk into Caleb's mic, I guess.

139
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,240
No, talk into everyone's mic. Yeah, just talk into one of them.

140
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,880
Michael Phelps did that thing where he was looking at the swimmer who was

141
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,800
who was like supposed to win the race in his last Olympics.

142
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,200
And he was doing like serious face and he was blasting music.

143
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,760
So I thought it was a funny joke if I could pretend I was like taking it super

144
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
seriously. I don't think you were pretending.

145
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,200
I don't think no, I think you're a psycho.

146
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,640
I think you just thought of that right now.

147
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,680
I think that the pretending of it was almost an excuse to take it really

148
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,820
seriously. OK, but I thought it was really funny and I was like kicking the

149
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,880
basketball. And yeah,

150
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,400
If there had been a ref, there would have been technical fouls ejected from the game.

151
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:52,680
It's also like, to set the scene, every other team was just like really tiny kids who clearly

152
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,680
have never touched a basketball before.

153
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:02,880
I was on a team and I thought we were supposed to do comedic basketball and I took, oh, the

154
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,720
actual basketball team of the school came in.

155
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,160
They started playing on the court with us.

156
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
On the other side.

157
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,320
On the other side, which they weren't supposed to do.

158
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,640
we were supposed to have the whole court to ourselves.

159
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,500
And their ball came into our game.

160
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,640
So I think I tried to shoot a basket

161
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,520
while somebody else was shooting a basket.

162
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:25,780
And I think that's what you're supposed to do.

163
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,300
- No, you were a dickhead, dude.

164
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,520
You ruined their game. - What do you mean?

165
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,360
- You ruined their game.

166
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,180
- Yeah, I ruined their game.

167
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,620
They weren't supposed to be there.

168
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,160
- We weren't supposed to be there.

169
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,440
- What are you talking about? - That's their domain.

170
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,400
- We had it reserved. - They weren't kind enough.

171
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,080
- We had the gym booked.

172
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,240
but we had the gym book. It's default that the basketball players get the

173
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,520
Hoopers to get the hoop. The Hoopers should have respected that day. We were

174
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,680
the Hoopers on that day. We were the Hoopers now and we were supposed to be

175
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,040
doing globe charter stuff and everyone was taking it too serious before I go

176
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,240
the

177
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,840
the one thing I remember really vividly is I walked. There's like a short kid

178
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,480
and I did a really low block like into the Julio's telling you to duck down

179
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,840
lower. I did a really emphatic block on this little kid little kid. He was a

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,200
senior in college and then I went to the crowd and I like you know really pound

181
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,960
on my chest and went I run this shit. This is my school. You are gay

182
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:25,080
and oh and then I also heard back that people who didn't know me thought I was

183
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,840
just like a really scary person after the yeah,

184
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,400
but I'm not I'm cool.

185
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,760
Yeah, Joe is a psycho. Anytime you play any any kind of sports with Joe. Yeah,

186
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
bye. You don't want to play.

187
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,080
When I used to live with him, dude, when he used to play baseball, he told me

188
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,280
that, like, he used to just try to hit people with the ball

189
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:56,760
when he was pitching. He was just trying to, like, set the tone for the game,

190
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,720
playing a fucking, you know, like a little league. Yeah. God damn, dude.

191
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,760
Trying to hit the batter with the ball. That's incredible. He said one time he

192
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:12,560
he played against two little person twins and he got like yelled at by the umpire

193
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,560
because he jumped over one of them.

194
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,560
(laughter)

195
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
He's so crazy.

196
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,060
Yeah, he's a very good dude. You play Mario Party with him, it's like, it's not even a party.

197
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,060
It's like Mario's, Mario's Detention.

198
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
It's like Mario's Funeral.

199
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,060
It's like Mario's Detention.

200
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
They should call it Mario's War.

201
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,060
Well, I watched the Mario movie.

202
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:38,940
was actually a blast. Yeah, I love you didn't like it. I didn't see it. I just

203
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,220
wanted to

204
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:46,300
you didn't see my nephew has become obsessed with Mario because of that to a

205
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,340
point that where like

206
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,780
my sister has sent me photos of him just on a weekday, dressed up like Mario.

207
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,020
He's wearing overalls now. He's got a red hat.

208
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,940
he's he's gone full Mario and how old is he he's like six, which is that's fine,

209
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,180
but it's like man. Yeah, I don't mean I don't have that low as a kid. I didn't

210
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,380
ask that in terms of like oh he's too old to be doing that, but more to said

211
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,780
would be funny to see a six year old kid walking does he looking exactly like

212
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:21,620
Mario? Yeah, he does he maybe think that you are Mario. He told me so much like

213
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,620
Mario. He told me I look like Mario. One time you look exact. You have the same

214
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,780
there the same like shape of your face, the same must the same little button

215
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:36,380
nose, you have the same like body to you move like yeah, you could jump and

216
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,260
you're not the only person that's my girlfriend has told me this that I look

217
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,140
like Mario. It takes a gamer's eye to recognize something like this.

218
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,660
That to this do this pose right now.

219
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,900
Yeah, that's Mario.

220
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:54,980
You are Mario yeah, that's a good person to look like I think yeah, it's better

221
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:59,160
been someone ugly and disgusting. I kind of look like one of the Goombas from the

222
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,720
the movie from the first movie that was Fisher Stevens. The what's his name from

223
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,100
a little little pencil neck motherfucker from succession that was him yeah. What

224
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:14,000
I thought it was a monster costume. No, no, his neck just looks like that man. I

225
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,820
think he had throat cancer. I've talked about it before. I think they removed a

226
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,740
bunch of muscle or something from his neck and I was, but I was like the time

227
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:27,140
you see somebody who looks just a little too crazy. Something is very wrong with

228
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,780
yeah, you gotta you gotta be kinder of a person, but you can think in your head.

229
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,420
You can think you can look at them and think in your head like you can think

230
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,740
whatever you want in your head. Nobody knows what your brain is. Nobody knows

231
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,860
what's going on, but

232
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:44,220
you can't say it. You can't say it out loud thoughts thoughts become feelings

233
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,460
yep feelings become actions. Actions become your character and your what is

234
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,120
your character, but your character defines your destiny. I can't as a

235
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,840
Mario thing. The only defines defines your destiny yeah, so I think a lot of

236
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,540
horrible stuff. What's the worst all you've ever had pussy?

237
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:07,820
If I see a guy wearing pink,

238
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,320
oh okay, I thought you were. Do you think we should bring back swag?

239
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,940
Speaking of guys wearing pink, bring back, bring back swag. You think that we

240
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,380
could start wearing like pink polos and like light wash jeans and ice creams and

241
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:27,980
Marty bringing that back already. Already. Yep. I had a thought today out of

242
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,700
fashion thought today. Yeah. You're gonna start wearing true ease. No. When you

243
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:38,660
should, I was driving around in my car and I saw a bunch of these construction

244
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,220
guys wearing all this high of is right. Yeah, but my first thought was not, oh,

245
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:46,740
they work in construction. My first thought was, oh, a couple of E. D. M.

246
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,040
the enjoyers right are plant doing doing stomp with a bunch of shovels and shit

247
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,300
over here on the side of you know your your actual first thought probably was

248
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,060
what oh my God. I can see them yeah. First thing I look at no no. So that's

249
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,780
the problem drawing attention to that okay. So now you guys these guys are

250
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,500
like this is my problem. This tree they were the second thing I looked at

251
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,680
because it was a bunch of hot girls going to a convention across the street,

252
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,820
but they were also wearing high vis. So yeah they were yeah, but all I think

253
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,040
Hi, this is not enough, because I if you are somebody there are people in this

254
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,580
world who they see somebody wearing neon clothes looking like they're going to

255
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,800
bar. I see what you're saying and they might even try to up you need an here

256
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,280
and what is going to catch your eye more maybe a helmet than a noise, only naked

257
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,240
body. Okay, so I think that construction workers should have to be naked. They

258
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,960
should have to be naked or wear a shirt that makes it look like they're naked. I

259
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:40,780
don't think because that would just you would think it was a funny shirt, though,

260
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,760
if they wear the pants to wear the big long white T shirt that has the bikini

261
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,600
by yes and that's got lights on all the polka dots on the bikini.

262
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,640
I don't think the or if they were just twenty feet tall yeah or they should

263
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,320
only hire

264
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:03,280
huge boobed humongous is twenty foot boobs humongous blue blur. Yeah,

265
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,040
humongously giant huge is on fifty feet.

266
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,280
there should be huge in the work place.

267
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,640
I agree there should be huge on the construction site. There should be huge

268
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,560
in the work place. There should be huge out of the out of this world huge.

269
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:26,800
There should be an asterisk on every dress code at every work place in

270
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,160
America. This is unless you have you need. Yeah, exactly. You need to cover

271
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,600
up, wear modest clothes, blah, blah, blah,

272
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,240
asterisk and unless you got a

273
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,820
gees you and the unless has to be in a special font. So you read it in your

274
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:46,220
head and you go unless you have huge is parenthesis. Let them fly. Let them

275
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:52,020
dang tang, let them thank you. Let them bring hang. Let them breathe man. Why

276
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,520
are we covering up these beautiful, beautiful things? The girls want to show

277
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,500
them the girls like to show their huge.

278
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,980
have you guys seen instagram recently? No, it's basically been what tell me

279
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:08,360
about it. What's on there right now? Been non stop hugies what's back to back

280
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,340
to back no hugies. What happened to the memes? It's huge. The memes are over my

281
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,620
friend done. They're done unless you play unless you play the algorithm

282
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:17,960
right,

283
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,600
because I basically just recipes it's recipes. Mine are all recipes. Mine is

284
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,840
whole memes yeah really means only mine. I open my instagram. It's three posts

285
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,940
that I already saw that are from a week ago from someone I follow and then

286
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,980
ten hundred thousand memes of raccoons about capitalism really because it's a

287
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:43,220
fairly it's a new ish instagram account and I'd have a really look at anything

288
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,440
on there. I found this. I think it just knows I like to funny shit. Summer ray

289
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,000
and look at her instagram five hundred times a day, and then you'll get a good

290
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,940
algorithm yeah.

291
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,680
if you if you let the reels just run, if you're just like swiping every other

292
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,260
video is like

293
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:06,040
if you do it right, every other video is just like an old man and he's made a

294
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:12,260
slide show of himself and it's like that's all fake his dinner and then like

295
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,980
a photo of him, then a photo of like his car and it's all set to like sweet

296
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,280
child of mine. It's great. That's a marketing department. I love I love

297
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:25,700
you're falling for it. How is that a marketing mark? Is that a marketing

298
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,100
that old man's old man's interns are putting together funny reels for you?

299
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,520
Yeah, and it's no, no, no, no. It's like I gotta, I gotta show you this one

300
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,920
guy. No, it's all fake. And the caption is if my boss said of this gets

301
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:42,580
5000 faves, I can get a raise. No, this these are videos that have like ten

302
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,660
like if I get less than 5000 face, I'll get erased. I'm getting I'll get

303
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,860
erased from the planet. I'm getting things with ten likes. It's an old man

304
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:56,100
showing off his dinner, showing off his car, showing off his puppy, just stuff like that.

305
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,900
And you don't think maybe this is an ad for puppies, cars, and food?

306
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,940
I think maybe it's an ad for Foster's Beer.

307
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,140
Why Foster's Beer?

308
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,900
There's a disproportionate amount of them drinking Foster's Beer.

309
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,940
I like Foster's. I don't know what these Australians are complaining about.

310
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,820
They make it too big.

311
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,380
Why would you...

312
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,020
The can is so big.

313
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:19,700
Okay, why would you claim Vegemite and shun Foster's? Foster's is a damn good beer and Vegemite...

314
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:24,740
That green can of Fosters tastes like dog shit. I like the blue can. The blue can's fine.

315
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,740
But that's a good beer. Why isn't every beer can that sized?

316
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:35,540
That's a good question. Why is it, why are all the other, it's just like, what is it? That's

317
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,020
a, that Fosters, is that a pint? Is that the blue can? Is that a pint? Have you ever seen

318
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:45,140
like a antique store, the old cans of beer that they're just like, they're, they're actual just

319
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:50,100
I found one the other day that was called like Africa beer or something and it had a bunch

320
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,740
of pictures of zebras on it.

321
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,740
That's cool.

322
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
Yeah and it looked really really cool.

323
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:57,100
That's like when Harley Davidson made cigarettes.

324
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,100
What?

325
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,900
Yeah there was a pack of Harley Davidson cigarettes and my uncle, my uncle lived with us, the

326
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,700
one who had like, I talked about him like two weeks ago, he had like back surgery and

327
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,620
was sleeping on a couch in, or like a bed in my living room.

328
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,620
he came back from like boot camp for the Air Force. He left his like locker out.

329
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:19,500
My brother, my brother and I unlocked it in, uh, with what?

330
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,820
I don't remember what, I think it was his key, but we knew he,

331
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,460
we knew he, my brother knew he had cigarettes in there.

332
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,500
And the first cigarettes he smoked was Harley Davidson brand cigarettes.

333
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,980
That's an honor. It was a black pack with the Harley logo.

334
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:41,540
I wonder who made the Harley Davidson cigarettes, because we stole that shit from him.

335
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,220
Oh, I'll tell you. Harley Davidson!

336
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,420
You think so? They think they got tobacco crops? You don't think they were like, "Hey,

337
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,700
Philip Morris, can we just put our logo on this?"

338
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,060
Dude, I don't know what the fuck you just said.

339
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,060
RJ Reynolds?

340
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

341
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,300
I'm talking about tobacco. I miss smoking cigarettes, bro.

342
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,580
Because you're just talking about which company's good, which one's...

343
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:02,100
No, I'm thinking about a pack of Camel Blues right now.

344
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,060
Why not just smoke them? You can smoke as much as you want until you turn 30 years old,

345
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,420
and then you have to think about it.

346
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,760
I did that early, 'cause I had the head start.

347
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,980
- You did have a head start, 'cause you started at 15, right?

348
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,820
- At 12.

349
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,940
(laughing)

350
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,740
- You are Tom Sawyer.

351
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,580
That is crazy.

352
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,700
Smoking cigarettes at 12 years old.

353
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:25,380
- Well, my mom smoked, so I would just steal them from her.

354
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,460
- See, my dad dipped, and I had no desire to have it dip.

355
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,100
- I had no, me neither.

356
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,820
My dad dips too.

357
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:35,020
I'm so worried about my parents getting cancer, it's crazy.

358
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:35,940
- I'll handle it.

359
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:40,380
yeah, you got it good. I got it you're going to take all their cancer. I got it

360
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,580
like that. You're going to suck all the cancer. I don't want you to worry about

361
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,220
that ever again. Yeah, buddy, you can do that. You came to the right guy. Great,

362
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm glad

363
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:57,420
I got it man. You're like I'm working on it. God, I'm actively working.

364
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:03,820
I've just been sitting around my house just thinking of different things that

365
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
could cure cancer.

366
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,300
I've been giving treatments to many people. Do you guys think that cancer is

367
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,260
basically just because we drink out of plastic things? I think it could be.

368
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:20,340
You can get Alzheimer's from aluminum. Really? Yeah. Well, you like that's a

369
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,900
maybe that was just a rumor. I need to stop smoking crack. Yeah. With that

370
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,540
aluminum pipe. What was it? People would tell you like, oh, if you smoke weed out

371
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,300
of a Mountain Dew can, it'll give you Alzheimer's. I think everything we do as

372
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,600
human beings will give us cancer. Really yeah, we weren't built for this world.

373
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,340
We were made for another play. I think that's the biggest proof that we have

374
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,200
that we are from another son gives you cancer. Oh, there is no solid evidence

375
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,820
that aluminum is increased in the brains of people with alzheimer's shut up

376
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:53,420
jubio's mate jubio's correcting me. We don't need a fact of Pinocchio fact

377
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,620
checker on this show. We do have one, though we don't need that. We need

378
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:00,260
somebody to look up Mario and look at his phone. Most of the episode. Yeah,

379
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,540
Speaking of facts, can I read you guys a news story?

380
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Yeah.

381
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
What are you looking at?

382
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,700

Please.

395
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:26,860
Okay, so this is a true story that I learned about this past week.

396
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,880
monkey foul creature haunting town captured by locals. So I don't know if

397
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,260
you guys have heard of a monkey foul. No, I've never heard of a bird monkey.

398
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,080
It is a monkey with

399
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,760
bird legs. It's a chicken monkey? It's alive, and it's alive.

400
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,300
It kicks around in the video. Do you have videos of the monkey foul? Yeah,

401
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,320
but I'm not gonna show them 'cause I think that actually they are some

402
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:51,060
horrific animal cruelty going on, but we can not think about that right now.

403
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what is, what is here? A monkey, let me read

404
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,060
you the news article. Okay, sorry. This is what really happened, and then

405
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,180
what these conspiracy theorists are saying is that probably these people

406
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:02,080
cut off a monkey's head and put it on a chicken for a video, but that's not

407
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,920
true. I don't believe

408
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,260
a monkey foul creature that has been terrorizing and haunting a French

409
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,840
township in Ivory Coast has finally been captured by locals after days of

410
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,140
tracking it. A French town. This is true from a viral video that has just

411
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,740
surfaced on social media as privy to us at occupied. G. H. Dot com in the video

412
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:24,420
the creature who has the face of a black monkey and the other body features of a

413
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,780
cowl was seen being held in front of a camera. The creature in a bid to escape

414
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,900
is seen flapping its feet in defense mode.

415
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:39,100
If it's a French township, I fully believe that they did. I fully believe

416
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:42,140
they chopped off the head. Are you kidding me? They eat snails,

417
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:48,780
but I think full snails. I think that this could be a real situation. I don't

418
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:52,580
think this is a real situation at all. There was another there was another

419
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,180
article that I found I have to search it again, but there's a lot of

420
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,840
information about this monkey foul. Apparently it was haunting the village

421
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,080
and there was days they took days to track it down before they captured it

422
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,740
in what world could a chicken bodied anything haunt anything yeah. The word

423
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,920
haunting is like hunting. Haunting is too broad. Haunting is a very strong

424
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,500
word and you should only use it when you're talking about ghosts. Yeah,

425
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,900
that's how I feel. Well, this this thing would you not say that you'd be haunted

426
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,280
if you saw a creature like this? I don't think I'd be haunted, but I would be

427
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,080
scared. I would be seeing it. I would certainly be seeing it, but I would

428
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,000
probably look at it and say, oh, that's an interesting one of God's many

429
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,920
creatures. I wonder I wonder what what is this please

430
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,200
that is definitely they've cut off a monkey's head.

431
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,080
Show the you don't have to show the video, but

432
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,840
they definitely put a monkey's head on yeah, that's so horrible. It's a monkey

433
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,320
now it's an animal. No, it's not a animal. They discovered in the ivory

434
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,120
coast. It was hunting villagers. It's a French township. Okay, if they cut off

435
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,880
a monkey's head and put it on a chicken, how are they able to track it?

436
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,960
They didn't track it. I don't think they're tracking it for days.

437
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:09,200
We have had to already put the monkey's head on it, but they were you know,

438
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,680
because the chicken can't see anything, so it was probably just running into a

439
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,160
fucking tree over and you cut off my head

440
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,880
sure if you cut off my my monkey's head and you put it on me and I I fucking I

441
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,840
would have no idea where to go. I'd have no vision. I would only have the

442
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,000
monkey's eyes in a video seen by docke's world. The young men could be

443
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,820

capseller. Oh, it's just a Googled ad link. It doesn't actually even go to

anything. I wanted to read an article called A Capseller on His Way to Market.

449
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,480
There's this capseller I read about who had too damn many of them. He had plenty.

450
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,420
He had too damn many caps and he was walking around town trying to fucking

451
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:06,880
sell them to motherfuckers. Is this one of these nursery rhymes that only you

452
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,120
two know about and I never learned? You never heard of too many caps? You get to

00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,280
the devil. It's something like that yeah similar a viral video available to

484
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:37,080
occupy gh dot com captures the exact moment drake was bombarded with all

485
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,180
sizes of bras from his female fans or performing on stage. It's all a

486
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:45,320
blurtor. The Canadian rapper who was taken by surprise had to pause his

487
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,080
performance to attend to the pandemic flooding his stage at one point. He

488
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,520
ducks to save his face from being hit by the bras. He is enjoying the best of

489
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,760
moments, the best of his moments,

490
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,060
would you guys let your girlfriend go on Drake's tour bus and watch no yeah,

491
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:07,400
no, I would you would let her. I'd let her marry Drake. If you wanted to do, I

492
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,600
love I would not let my girlfriend marry Drake. Are you lying me,

493
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:16,280
but then you get to be to get in a was Drake to listen to his music. Yeah, no,

494
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,080
because then you'd have all these songs called like like I

495
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,840
wait. If Drake could write a song,

496
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,040
song with the beauty of Drake's lyrics and music and it's about the love of my

497
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,600
life. That's amazing yeah, but that's like all the other songs. There's like

498
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:36,960
that's three songs on the album. All the other songs about our how good he is it

499
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,800
having sex with your girlfriend. All the other all the other songs are about how

500
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,360
girl. How good is it having sex with your girlfriend and how much of a bitch

501
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,600
you are? Why would he why? Okay, he let him yeah

502
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,880
lease Drake releases a song. It's like the

503
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,860
the paper work. There's a cause on the paper work. You can't write a song

504
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,300
about how much of a bitch I am. I sign the permission slip. Okay, well, if

505
00:31:59,300 --> 00:31:59,640
that's

506
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,240
she brought me a

507
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,720
back from the the concert yeah and I said yes, you are allowed to go on the

508
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,240
bus. Drake is having a wedding tomorrow. Can I go?

509
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:15,440
I said yeah, imagine, imagine you let that happen. Imagine you let drake have

510
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,400
sex with your wife or your girlfriend. You you sign the permission slip as we

511
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,400
we're saying just now this guy thinks he's in control of

512
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,900
to happen. I am in control

513
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:32,140
now, but imagine that happens right and then next drake album. All the songs

514
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,180
are like I don't want that root beer flow to get the get out of my tour bus.

515
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:41,080
Every single song is about how you're an overbearing weird guy, a root beer

516
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,240
flow like I'm walking in trying to give him a root beer yeah.

517
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,860
but I thought what I thought you were going to say the concept you said was a

518
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:54,180
so can that would have been funny. If you had told me what I jumped ahead, I

519
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:57,860
jumped ahead. I was what I what I thought you were saying is that the idea

520
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,220
of Drake writing a song about getting mad at me because I'm giving him too

521
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,400
many root beer. What I thought what I thought you were going, what I thought

522
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,940
you were meaning is like what if you let your girlfriend marry Drake and

523
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,940
they're together and then Drake releases an album and there's no songs about

524
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,440
love at all and it's just about to be a

525
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,640
floats of food and ran

526
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,760
that would break my heart. That would break my heart. Actually, you've been

527
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,160
waiting with bated breath for this album. You got every song is like my girl makes

528
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,480
me too many root beer float. He doesn't even say my girl. No, he doesn't talk

529
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,680
about her. I doing the way

530
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:35,640
so he's not even say yeah. He gave up on being cool at all. Drake Drake doing a

531
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,680
cover of salad. He's like okay, I'm ready to settle down yeah. Your

532
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,220
girlfriend's the only girl he has sex with for the rest of his life. That

533
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:47,540
would be so that would actually you have like a really long, hard conversation

534
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:50,540
with your girlfriend where it's like you know if this is what you want, you

535
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,780
want to leave me for Drake and live on his tour bus. I could tame Drake,

536
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:58,740
though it now if you if Drake, where every single song that comes out is

537
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:01,580
just like silly putty,

538
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,940
my favorite toy

539
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,940
is my favorite.

540
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,340
I can really putty. I can turn it into whatever

541
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,700
play with my leg.

542
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:24,540
Silly putty free play, make it whatever stick it to the wall. I got my own

543
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,820
custom mini figs stick it on the newspaper

544
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:30,020
free play. I got a

545
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,380
Whoa, you ever do that with silly putty. No, you can pick up. Oh yeah,

546
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:41,260
yeah, that would be a great song for drake to make drake. If you're

547
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,420
listening, because I know that you are, you should make sticky hand one

548
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:52,340
hundred one hundred song album about every single toy. You got at the

549
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:56,300
dentist, everything you to every single toy. You got from Dave and Buster's

550
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,420
white shirt covered in mustard.

551
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:04,180
I use the sticky hand to take tips off of people's tables.

552
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:09,700
What you take the sticky hand you go up to people's tables at David Buster's

553
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,260
when they're big and

554
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,780
they've been

555
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,060
even bastard

556
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:21,620
David Bastard sucks so bad, but the food is good, though. Nave Bastard, you got

557
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:25,900
tickets, you have parking tickets, yeah, Dave and Bastard's Dave. Honestly, when

558
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:30,080
I'm in Dave and Buster's the way that society degenerates in there. I feel

559
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,780
like I'm living in a medieval age full of knaves and bastards. I agree what's

560
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:38,660
a knave a fool. Oh, a just why it's called the naval, because when you're

561
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,240
no digging around in there, it's funny. Look like a fool. When you dig in your

562
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,460
navel, don't show me that I was I was disgusting body. I just came out. I

563
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,400
didn't do a porn. First of all, I didn't do a porn. Second of all, you called my

564
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,900
body discussed. You showed me your disgusting body. I didn't show you my

565
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,600
disgusting body. I was showing you what a naval it's covered in hair digging.

566
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:03,560
Yeah, you could save your belly before you show it. You could stand to do that.

567
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,160
I have so much hair, so shave it. I don't want to shave it. I literally I

568
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,280
think I need it. You know what I know? No, I'm not going to right now. Why I do

569
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,720
just by shaving material, I'm not going to go. Oh my God, Cameron, he's scared to

570
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,880
shave his entire body bald. I would never

571
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:30,120
I'm not going to shave my whole entire body bald, but I do think I do. I think

572
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:35,640
it would benefit me because I sweat pretty easy exactly and I'm starting. I

573
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,160
realize like I'll walk like you don't sweat you pant like a dog. You can't

574
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:43,960
sweat pant like a dog yeah. When you go, I you go police your teeth. Really it

575
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,600
comes off your tongue. Yeah friend my do I have a cud a cud yeah, and you true

576
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:57,220
cut do I is that not a part of the cow's body? No, no, it's gum cut is go. It's

577
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,940
gum. It's like the one is not call it gum. It's not gum. It's gum for cow.

578
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,260
No, it's a bunch of it's a

579
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:08,220
the stuff that comes back up from their stomachs. Yeah, I want it. Oh, so it

580
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,460
shoots back up, okay, and it turns in. It feels like gum. They chew it is

581
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:15,700
basically it's where the idea for it is going from

582
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:24,300
the original gum from God's green hand. It's normal world gum, and then we

583
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,020
natural. Have you seen that

584
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:29,300
have you seen that natural gum? No

585
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,300
have you seen that shit? The natural gum that's like pieces of like a crystal

586
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,180
and it's like yeah, usable gum. I've had that reusable gum sounds fire. I've had

587
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:43,140
that I run out of gum and I don't want to get more. Yeah, I've had the fancy

588
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:48,200
the real gum and it's not good. It's not good. It's not good. They put a flavor

589
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:52,340
with like honey and it's also like it's like five hundred calories a pack. Is it

590
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,100
reusable? Do you put in the flavor every time you're like you're maybe like you

591
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,880
chew it long enough, it loses flavor and then you put more honey in when you chew

592
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,260
it again, you can mix it up with another piece. You could just basically roll all

593
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:07,060
of them together into one big. I was a permanent. Here's my problem. Gum. Yeah,

594
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,540
gum

595
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,960
is no fun. No, I don't you can chew anything. I don't have to chew gum. Any

596
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,820
food that I like, I don't have to swallow it ever. I can just keep it in

597
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,760
my fucking mouth and chew it all I want. No, because it loses its texture. I

598
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,060
don't like textures. I like chewing. You can't chew it for so long. Yeah,

599
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,560
you can if you put baking soda in it.

600
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,520
What do you mean? Anything? You can just add baking soda into your mouth,

601
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,160
and it'll dry it out and make it a big ball again.

602
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,220
You can make your mouth a ball? You could do hamburger meat or something.

603
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,980
and then you could just keep adding baking soda when it dissolves.

604
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:47,920
This is a good idea. What are you talking about? You can just add baking

605
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:52,340
why not just have gum because gum doesn't take I don't like you like the

606
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,940
taste of baking soda and I don't that you just they have a natural gum that

607
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,660
tastes like baking soda. No, they don't. It tastes like honey. What are we

608
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:04,300
talking about gum? I thought we were talking about baking soda. No, I was

609
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,260
saying that you could add not just baking. You could add flour. You can add

610
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,900
any lower rubber gum glom glom is

611
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:18,140
gum is not rubber. What is it gum tree? Yes, it's tree. What is all of it tree

612
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:22,300
gum or some of I think only some of it is none of it is rubber Cameron. Some of

613
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,220
it is some of its plastic. Some of it is okay. No, I take gum and I is an

614
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,500
element. If I try to use it on a pencil,

615
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:36,380
is that an eraser? Yes, a racer gum it's called a racer gum. No, the content of

616
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,520
and a racer is called gum. They just call it that it's not gum. Then what is gum?

617
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:46,040
If you can call something gum and it's not gum is a more of a category right

618
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:51,500
so how is it? A go? Can you race is please like normal definition gum? No,

619
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,060
no, not gum definition. Look up what can you click around on this page? What is

620
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:02,260
gone? What is gum half naked man? What is go? Get guy back? What is guy? Wait

621
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:08,780
you guys got guys on the what is guy? What is what is gum? Okay, no go to the

622
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:13,240
all and no images yeah. We don't need that a viscous secretion of some trees

623
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,460
and shrubs that hardens on drying, but is soluble in water and from which

624
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,480
adhesives and other products are made. It's a race like say that again

625
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,560
gum. You sound beautiful today. You view gum, jubile, you have a beautiful

626
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,180
beautiful now is an eraser. What is gum made of right there first thing?

627
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:34,340
that's what we want to see tree, though we what is made of chewing gum made of it

628
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,960
consists thirty percent of the product, the remaining

629
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,860
thirty percent of it is seventy percent of it. Can you search is erasers gum

630
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:48,540
chewing gum contains plastic? Oh what the ingredient no as gum base in the

631
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,320
list of ingredients in chewing gum is largely made of poly vinyl acetate Jesus

632
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:59,260
gum. It's a plan rubber fuck dude gum is rubber is gum. Actually rubber. Most

633
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:03,220
modern gums are based on a synthetic equivalent, a rubbery material called

634
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:07,260
poly iso butylene. It's not rubber that's also used in the manufacture of

635
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:10,860
inner tubes rubber. Yeah, rubber comes from a rubber. It's plastic rubber, but

636
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:14,820
no you have to write chewing gum. I bet if you search that thing that it said

637
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:18,320
right there, you don't know what an inner tube is. I bet if you search that

638
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,220
thing that it said right there that chemical, I bet it'll say it's a type of

639
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,020
synthetic rubber.

640
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:22,520
you.

641
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:28,160
Fuck you, I bet it will. I don't like that. I thought I was gum plastic and

642
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,380
I was guessing I didn't even know that you have to know because that's like I

643
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:32,500
was guessing by the text.

644
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:37,040
That's like like like gum souls on a shoe, though

645
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,760
the class. No way that this is what chewing gum is made of. It's made of

646
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,060
this. They contain gummy solids.

647
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:50,420
They don't contain. It contains gummy. What is this? This is actually this is

648
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,040
you just hit me off to because this is not chewing gum. You have to look up

649
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,480
chewing. That was chewing gum. That's not chewing. It said it's a chewing gum

650
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,280
tube. Most modern gums. What is chewing gum made of

651
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,560
antioxidants? There he gets different. Okay, all right, it's antioxidants. Yeah,

652
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,520
it's completely does chewing gum rubber last emers has to be some kind of

653
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:18,200
plastic rubber thing. Yeah, most modern gums see a synthetic rubbery material

654
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,600
way all food. Oh my God, wait, it's actually rubber. That's what I'm saying

655
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,140
right about it. They put rubber because you're not even supposed to eat it. So

656
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:30,140
who cares they could put poisonous? Yeah, that's true. You're always going to

657
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:35,740
chew on it. They couldn't put spikes in. I when I was five years old, I ate a

658
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:41,480
whole thing of bubble tape, just pop the whole thing in my mouth and then I blew

659
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,120
a bubble and then I can't country. You've told us this story a hundred times.

660
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,340
No, I kept playing with the bubble because I was five and I know any

661
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:54,140
better kept playing with me. I supposed to play with the bubble. I was well,

662
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,500
no with my hands and fine. I got yeah. If you like being stick, I got a whole

663
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,300
thing of bubble tape in my hair and oh you were like putting it on your head.

664
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,460
Yeah, I was like like a home. I was like oh, there's a like a hat yeah. I

665
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:11,860
was doing shit like that and then I got it in my hair and my mom had to shave

666
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,580
my whole you literally were completely goofus. I was you had some kind of

667
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,740
divine guidance where you did all that you knew exactly the thing to do that

668
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:24,360
would be the most horrible thing to do yeah. Yeah, exactly how to how to mess

669
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,120
it up. I got my head stuck in a couch when I was a kid.

670
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:31,680
How do you get stuck in a couch? I got my head stuck in a recliner in between

671
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:35,640
the bars that recline so they just fucking on reclined it and put your

672
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,240
kids have to know what they're doing when they do that when they like stick

673
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,780
their head between the railing or something and they get it. They know

674
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,400
they're like they just want to see a fire. Yeah, they're like when you stick

675
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,740
your head in between the railing, it's because you want to see there's

676
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:53,880
manipulative calculus going on and that you want to think oh yeah, I fell in

677
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:58,880
well thinking I could I threw the remote at the TV. I didn't do that. I

678
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,580
would never do that, but when a kid does that I was really scared of falling in

679
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,920
a well. When I was a kid, I avoided wells at all costs. I never really saw

680
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,040
well me neither, but I saw a wishing well. I succeeded. If you fall in a

681
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,120
wishing well, it's not so deep. Pretty wells are deep main, a wishing well, a

682
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,420
wishing well, not that deep. If you fall in a wishing well, you can get out, but

683
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:26,360
you got to like get out over the wall of it. Yeah, where is that going with that?

684
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:30,760
It's going to be hard to climb out with all the damn pennies in my pocket. Yeah,

685
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:34,680
here's what I would wish for. Hey, I wish I was out of this well. I wish I was out

686
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:40,120
this world. I wish I was on a different world. Did you think when you were a kid,

687
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:45,040
did you have the thought in your head that one day you would go to space? I

688
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,620
still think I'm gonna go to space. I was too scared of space. I wouldn't even

689
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:51,640
look up at night. They're gonna do free space rides in 15 years.

690
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,160
That would be cool. The MTA is gonna give you a... You just do... 'Cause

691
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,960
we're all gonna die in 20 years, so in 15 years, they're gonna be like,

692
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,920
"Well, you can all just try going to space." You can tap to pay.

693
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,760
it's like a slide. Did you guys see that they're doing a simulation of a Mars

694
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:10,840
plant, not plantation of what do you call colony?

695
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:19,480
They're doing a simulated Mars colony, not colony, but like a, like a on the

696
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:22,400
computer. No, in a warehouse.

697
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,120
Can they do a bio dome 100 or something? That's a movie with Polly Shore.

698
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:32,080
but I think they didn't realize I think maybe that we should break into it and

699
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,520
pretend to be some kind of Mars. That would be a good idea. That's a pretty

700
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,760
good idea right. Yeah, I still think there could be aliens on the moon. I

701
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,260
agree. I don't think so. You know there's a face yeah. Well, there's a

702
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:46,440
face on Mars is what you're thinking on the Mars. Yeah, but I think that

703
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,880
between the moon and Mars, the moon is close. Mars is red and the moon is a

704
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,520
planet there. I don't think there's people who live on the moon. There's a

705
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:58,200
face okay. So you guys on you know that the face of face on Mars and the

706
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,360
other files episode about is also obelisks on Mars. Yeah, really there's a

707
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,300
super structure beneath the surface of the moon. To be honest with you,

708
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:11,220
basically what happened is fifty years ago. There was a huge, huge society on

709
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,660
Mars, fifty years ago or fifty something like either a thousand million billion.

710
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,300
I don't know, but some fifty years ago there was a a complete society on Mars,

711
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:26,600
and they built a giant face kind of structure that now the

712
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:32,160
NASA is saying that this is just this is just smoke and mirrors, but the truth

713
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:36,440
is that there was a society on Mars of alien life forms that was all wiped

714
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,800
out. There's a current society on the covered in water. Do you know this

715
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:43,880
pattern? Let me drop some knowledge on you. There is a they made a but there

716
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:49,220
when they invented remote viewing ESP being able to see using your imagination

717
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:49,720
you

718
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:59,700
they were able to this man named Ingo swan was able Ingo swan. I don't know

719
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:06,020
in I read his book. His book is his memoir is called penetration. Oh, by

720
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,740
Ingo swan, okay, and he

721
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:12,900
yeah, he goes one. He was able to imagine things across the world,

722
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:17,940
but what he saw about the moon when they were doing moon testing on him to

723
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,380
figure out what he could see that he was able to see an entire civilization and

724
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,540
structures under the surface of the moon, complete with water that are being

725
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,380
hidden from us by the surface of the moon that appears to be nothing, and

726
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,620
it's been hidden for a long time and it's all being covered up and there's

727
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:35,940
also aliens currently on the earth that are being disguised and you can tell

728
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,740
ingo swan said that you can that he was in the grocery store and he was picking

729
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:45,940
out produce at the grocery store and he saw a woman and he said this woman is so

730
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:51,420
beautiful that she cannot be human wow and that proved that she was from the

731
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:57,620
moon to so you're telling me that a pre Plaza is an alien. Yes, I look at the

732
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:00,780
it's in the it's a something else and something that you can tell from

733
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,060
community something you can tell about this guy. The reason you can tell this

734
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,380
guy's telling the truth and that he hasn't been corrupted by all these

735
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,820
three letter agencies is his book that I bought and the trace am penetration by

736
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,500
ingos one by ingos one

737
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,900
has a typo on the cover. Well, that's how you know nobody was getting their

738
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:23,340
fingers in there yeah, because the CIA, the FBI, they could they get in there,

739
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,900
they're going to change it. They're going to do your reading. You're right.

740
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,940
You know that it was all coming from his brain. Have you guys ever tried remote

741
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,820
viewing? Yes, yeah, dubious doing that right. Did you succeed? Yeah, I actually

742
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,220
can see my bedroom with my eyes closed at all times. I'm going to try it right

743
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,620
now. Okay, where are you going to go? Where should I go? I don't know you

744
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,620
let him go. You see where should I see okay the surface of the moon, okay

745
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:52,480
and usually you draw it. Well, I'm not very good at drawing Cameron. I'm my art

746
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:59,340
form is my words. Okay, then describe I see some seriously white ground

747
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:07,080
and I see a bunch of black crap out there, which is on my call space. Okay,

748
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:14,700
and wait what's that I'm oh God, I'm seeing a pale blue dot. Oh great dot of

749
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:15,080
pale

750
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:21,900
is very far away. I'm seeing some pale, but I didn't say which moon I was on. Oh,

751
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,900
oh, I guess you didn't say you were on a moon at all. Now, well about it now that

752
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:31,540
I think about it, I'm on a moon and I'm seeing a pale blue dot. Oh, but wait,

753
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:36,620
what am I seeing on the pill blue dot instead of love? I'm seeing hate and I'm

754
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:43,440
racial prejudice and sexism and worst of all misogyny and also kids being

755
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:49,880
unfairly treated by their parents. And also there's there's five or six green

756
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:57,520
monsters all around me and they are making something some kind of giant

757
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:02,640
weapon. A weapon? Yep and also I can tell that one of them is the most popular of

758
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,240
the six because the other ones are kind of just listening to what he's saying

759
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,240
and also he's the tallest one.

760
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:10,740
- But does he have like a special kind of hair?

761
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,240
- He has an Elvis hairdo.

762
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,440
(laughing)

763
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,680
Yeah, he has an Elvis greasy,

764
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:17,980
pomade hairdo. - That style?

765
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:20,080
- That slick back Elvis rock and roller style.

766
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:20,920
- That we all know and love?

767
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,280
- Oh my God, are the other ones bald

768
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,060
or do they all have their own distinct hairstyles

769
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,420
that define their personality?

770
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,800
- Well, basically, one of them has, okay,

771
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,860
so there's six of them, one of them has an Elvis hair.

772
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,700
- Okay.

773
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,460
- One of them has very long hair.

774
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,060
One of them has shorterish hair.

775
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,100
- But does he have glasses?

776
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:41,640
one of them is Bob very kind of cute. Okay, the bow and then three of them or

777
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,800
the remaining to

778
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,680
have no hair at all. Wait, let me go back

779
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:53,360
and they have a swimming pool, but instead of being blue, it's dust green.

780
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,360
Oh my God,

781
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,860
where were you? I was on

782
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:03,880
the moon. Holy, I told you there's water and structures and animals. What is

783
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,500
Literally all the things that I just saw what was that shit that?

784
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:14,040
Was it did Elon want to do it where he was gonna launch a nuke onto the two poles of Mars?

785
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,860
So that it creates water and ice I

786
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:23,720
Think that there are water from the ice that's there. I don't think anyone actually yeah

787
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:28,240
I don't think nobody no one wanted to do that, but it wasn't that like an actual like thing people talked about

788
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,100
That's like how you think so you would terraform Mars is with yeah, they're bombs

789
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:37,160
I don't know how that would work, but I also I don't know that much about nuclear bombs. I'm afraid that it might learn

790
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:41,540
How you buddy then I know in a couple weeks there will be a movie that teaches you everything

791
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:45,820
Does Mars have atmosphere when does that come? I don't know what that means

792
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,860
Atmosphere is not on Mars. He's on this planet. Yeah, he's a

793
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:55,060
Rapping the fuck out of some he's in Minneapolis, and he's rapping about his dad dying, huh?

794
00:51:55,060 --> 00:52:01,900
Was that song from the fuck was that that was Cameron, but it actually did sound like some kind of interference

795
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,260
Yeah, I know. I thought you broke the computer or something.

796
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:10,060
When I was a kid, I tried to do, what you call that? Leave your body?

797
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,940
Transcendental projection.

798
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:17,660
That was the one that Jerry Seinfeld's obsessed with.

799
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:21,820
All of the Hollywood elites do TM, the David Lynch Foundation TM.

800
00:52:21,820 --> 00:52:23,100
Thorough.

801
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:24,380
Bro, that shit.

802
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,820
Henry David Thorough.

803
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,620
But it pretty much works. I mean, these guys are really successful.

804
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:29,020
Yeah.

805
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,180
Yeah, you can do anything if you already are successful and it will make you

806
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,300
more successful. Do you know that in transit? Yeah, that's that's like the

807
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,500
one thing like Jerry Seinfeld and like David Lynch, like all the talking all

808
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,420
like yeah, this transit TM like change my life so much blah blah blah. It's

809
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:48,060
like yeah. What else do you have to do? All you do is just sit there. Stevie

810
00:52:48,060 --> 00:52:52,300
wonder does it well. He does it all the time. Yeah, it's all he does. Yeah,

811
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,700
he's got his eyes closed every day.

812
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:56,380
Yeah,

813
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:02,660
It's amazing that he became so successful despite being I mean blonde blonde

814
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,200
blind

815
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,820
blind. Yeah, he was one of the first blonde guys to blow up in in Hollywood.

816
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,860
He used to be all Brunette. He thinks he's blonde.

817
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:13,380
He still thinks he's blonde.

818
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,820
He thinks he's a beautiful blonde woman. That's like the fucking like like

819
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,580
transcendental meditation. You just sit there and you just wait for like a you

820
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,780
like all your thoughts to go away. You can do that if you got a million dollars.

821
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,260
- No, you make them go away.

822
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,980
- No, no. Transcendental meditation is mantra based. So they give you,

823
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,740
you go take a class.

824
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,740
- I'm not thinking, I'm not thinking, I'm not thinking.

825
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:39,820
- They give you a mantra, which is usually some variation of like,

826
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,660
I am, or I will, I will, or some shit like that.

827
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,860
And you just say that over and over and over again. And it's supposed to be like,

828
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:47,780
- That's just the secret.

829
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,260
- You let thoughts fall away.

830
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:50,420
- You say it out loud.

831
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:51,540
- That is the secret.

832
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,340
- That's the secret.

833
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,440
that's manifestation. That's vision board. This stuff works dude. That's why we

834
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,340
are so fail. We are not fail. We don't do this shit. I do it. I

835
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:05,920
Cameron does it and he's fail. He is does not do transcendental meditation.

836
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,560
He you didn't even know what it was. I was tricking you. I was testing you

837
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,920
to see if you knew what it was. That is actually very advanced.

838
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,280
That is very advanced. They don't teach you that until later on in the

839
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,960
program. Yeah, most meditation you think of a leaf and watch it fly away. No,

840
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:26,720
you're thinking of falling asleep. They should make a meditation movies about

841
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,480
cool stuff instead of oh, you should be one meditate about whatever you want.

842
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,140
You should be one with nature. You should

843
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:38,660
I want to meditate and think that I am like a bulldozer or something and I'm

844
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,740
destroying millions of things. I'm I used to do a

845
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:47,840
orphanage is what I want to think I used to do. I'm a why I'm bulldozing an

846
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:52,780
orphanage. I mean you can think I'm the guy who's going in and bulldozing the old

847
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:57,100
Yankee Stadium. I'm just I'm making I'm going to say that to yourself. I'm going

848
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:00,240
to meditate to think that I'm making a million people. You're thinking of

849
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,580
imagining, imagining all you want. That's different from meditation. What is what

850
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:11,180
is meditation even meditation is is is sitting quietly with your thoughts. I'm

851
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:16,100
not doing that and noting them. I am not doing that. I used to do a meditation

852
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,620
where I had to imagine I was as big as the entire universe. That was the whole it

853
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,160
was a guided meditation. It was like you had to start off, you're in your room,

854
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,360
and then you're getting bigger and you're the size of your of your house.

855
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,160
No,

856
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,680
and it didn't. It's not how I grew. You tried to suicide by cop because of how

857
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,920
small he was. Yeah. You just had to make sure you're never going to do this

858
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,360
again. You need to figure big. When you were a kid, they called you sweet pea

859
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,000
because you were so small. If I was suicide by, if I was so small, I wouldn't

860
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,120
even have the cops involved. I would do suicide by foot. Suicide by thimble. I

861
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,000
the cops foot. You drink one symbol full of whiskey, yeah, that's what I would

862
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,300
do

863
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:51,360
brush shaved with a symbol

864
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,000
that doesn't even make how you shave with a thing is the little things on it.

865
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,580
You ever touched a symbol? No, because I'm not a girl. The only symbol I've

866
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,420
ever can't resist monopoly me to that's the only reason I know what a symbol is

867
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:08,320
yeah. Thimble was used in many stories. Thimble are history

868
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:13,720
that is true. Thimble thimbles are for sewing right there in fairy tales. It

869
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,760
protects your thumb.

870
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,760
Matt: Yeah.

871
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,800
Oh, then I've used one.

872
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:18,800
I've used one.

873
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:19,800
I never used one.

874
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,800
I never used one either, man.

875
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
I've simply touched it.

876
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,800
I've never even seen one in my life.

877
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,360
I took a home-ec class in 7th grade.

878
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,400
You thought you were going to make food, didn't you?

879
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:29,400
No, no.

880
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,400
It was like required.

881
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,000
You didn't get to choose the, you didn't get to choose, in 8th grade you got to choose

882
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,440
between cooking and woodshop and I should have chose cooking because my teacher, Mr.

883
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:38,720
Hill, hated my ass.

884
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,720
You did woodshop?

885
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
I did woodshop.

886
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:41,720
I made a little truck, yeah.

887
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:42,720
I did woodshop.

888
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,960
Dang, school sounded so cool, man.

889
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,040
I wish I went to school.

890
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:49,360
I always forget you were homeschooled, but...

891
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:51,520
Yeah, 'cause I'm so not kinda homeschooled.

892
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,520
When I was in seventh grade, I made a gym bag

893
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:59,280
and I got a C on it because my stitching was terrible.

894
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,520
So I had to use the thimble and I tried to fix it.

895
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,200
That's my thimble experience, y'all.

896
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,960
I made a gym sad.

897
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,440
There was a guy named Jim and we used to make fun of him.

898
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,080
Yeah.

899
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:09,800
He wore a suit.

900
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,600
my uncle Jim made him sad because I made fun of his elevator. You were a

901
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:18,160
scared of brief. He was a suit and briefcase kid yeah now see these kids

902
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,800
who we used to make fun of are the CEO. Unfortunately, their lives are worse

903
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,680
than ever before.

904
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,380
You'd love to think that their CEOs now, but unfortunately they're somehow below

905
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:33,080
the bottom strata of society. Yeah, they've fallen through the cracks

906
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:38,160
completely. They have started an ebay store that does not go row. They're

907
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,160
living in a in a

908
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:44,400
bower. Listen, I'd love for them to be the king of the health care industry or

909
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,560
something like that. They are the size of an ant. I do know one kid that was

910
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:54,600
like kind of a suit to class kind of kid who had told me that he was buying

911
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,160
Bitcoin in like two thousand and thirteen. Yeah, that kid is definitely

912
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,360
rich. Now he probably sold it in twenty fourteen probably, but even then he's

913
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:06,640
probably made some money off it yeah and I made no money and I said Bitcoin. What

914
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:07,240
the hell is that

915
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:11,480
Yeah. Bitcoin? And he told me that I should start mining it because I had a

916
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,940
graphics card. I was going to try to, when I heard about the concept of

917
00:58:15,940 --> 00:58:20,080
Bitcoin when I was 14. I was like, I'm going to make my own. Me too. I thought

918
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,200
that I would get a Bitcoin miner. Well, I thought that I was going to get like a

919
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,640
Bitcoin miner on my computer and everything, but I was going to install

920
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,360
it on my laptop. I had a laptop from 2001 that was still running Windows XP.

921
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,320
It was a Dell with a little trackpad. You were going to grind coins on it? And I

922
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,520
thought that if I just ran that while I was at school, I would get free money.

923
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,160
I've watched probably thirty five YouTube videos trying to explain what the fuck

924
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:47,800
how that works and what that means. It means I just gave up means nothing. It

925
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:50,840
doesn't make any God damn sense. I thought that it was a cheat code for

926
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,880
unlimited free money. It kind of was for a couple of years. Yeah, and it probably

927
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,120
will be again. That's the thing. This is multiple times people. Everybody

928
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:03,560
bitcoins gone up and then down. It was C told you and then it just goes right back

929
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,840
up in a couple more years. It really makes no sense to me at all.

930
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:12,040
We need to have like Gary Vee on this show and have him explain that to us.

931
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:13,040
Bitcoin?

932
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:21,120
Yeah. We need to make a hard pivot. We need to do Gary Vee on here. Gary Vee, us three,

933
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:22,120
and then like the guys.

934
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,120
Two girls.

935
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,120
Two girls.

936
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,120
We need two girls.

937
00:59:25,120 --> 00:59:27,600
Two girls who do OnlyFans and then those two guys who yell at them.

938
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:33,360
Not musical pop stars, great talents. Not women who sell their bodies for what, a buck?

939
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:40,040
paltry sense and dollars. I mean it's that those pictures are forever. You can

940
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,920
water mark them,

941
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,680
but what

942
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:47,040
well, what do you mean you and water mark them, but what but just what you

943
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:49,200
know your children are going to see that if they sign up.

944
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:54,520
Imagine imagine you that's the thing. If my mom had one, I would have signed up.

945
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,960
I just want to support her yeah. I would yeah. I'm trying to support. I would I

946
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:01,240
would sign up and say mom. I'm not looking, but

947
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,180
I want you to have a you think there's people who do that mom. You think I

948
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,820
have an allowance for ten ninety nine every single month

949
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:10,380
in a visa debit card

950
01:00:10,380 --> 01:00:13,480
and she's a name that you don't know yeah

951
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:20,380
under name bits. What's the mom? What's the most attractive name in the world to

952
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:20,660
you

953
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:26,080
Sebastian Sebastian Sanchez has a

954
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,640
only fan

955
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:34,680
Yeah, but if I had an only fans, I wouldn't post any images. I would close

956
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:39,380
the account. Imagine my had one. If I had one, I'd immediately. I think we have

957
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:43,900
one for the podcast. I think you're right. I think we made one as a funny,

958
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:47,520
funny joke. You did a couple years ago. You did it and we had nothing to do with

959
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,740
it. No, because we have one photo on there and it's like you posted. It's

960
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:56,460
a picture you posted. I remember it's not a photo. It's a video. It's a video.

961
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,180
It's a video. Well, the title of the video. I mean, I don't think I think

962
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:02,780
it's not possible to sign up for it, because I don't think we ever finished

963
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:05,440
the account, but the video is titled Patrick changing

964
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:11,080
and I can tell you what it is, but it's it would be a spoiler for the video.

965
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:16,840
I think we should just say what it is because it was a video of Patrick

966
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,960
transforming into a werewolf yeah

967
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:25,520
okay, that's pretty funny yeah.

968
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,880
That is a funny

969
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,760
future change.

970
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,680
Wait, how do you transform into a werewolf? Oh, we had an app called

971
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:37,520
Monsterify.

972
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:42,200
Monsterify? Yeah. I think it was actually Face Story. Remember Face Story?

973
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:47,440
Face Story, yeah. I missed the first wave of facial apps. Me too. The facial

974
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,760
apps were amazing. Facial apps were a different thing. I had a phone. It's all

975
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:54,920
skin care and pornographic and gang banging. Yeah, exactly. I had a phone

976
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:00,760
that could run CamWow, if you remember CamWow from the iPod Touch.

977
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:06,560
And then I got a new phone, thought that it would be able to transfer over to this phone.

978
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,560
But it didn't.

979
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:08,560
It didn't.

980
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:16,380
Then you had the last surviving iPhone in my possession with CamWow on it and then you

981
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:18,160
needed a phone.

982
01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:19,160
And then I gave you that phone and then you broke it.

983
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:22,480
And you bit down on it too hard and you crackled the screen up.

984
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,520
which I completely have destroyed every phone except for this one,

985
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,080
because this one has a case on it. Guys, you copied my case. So I didn't copy

986
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:34,360
it. I got the cheapest one on Amazon. Yeah, you copied me. That's what I did.

987
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:39,240
Millions did this. I did it for a hundred thousand reviews on Amazon. Yeah,

988
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:43,160
did you scroll to see what the first chronological review was? It wasn't you.

989
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:49,080
Oh, so you did check. What was it? Then I checked it was Ben David, Ben David,

990
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:56,200
Ben Davis, nope, Ben David, Ben David, yep, Ben Davis makes pretty good pants.

991
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,840
You can find him. Well, this isn't that person. This is some other guy. He's

992
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:00,940
got a gorilla logo.

993
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:06,480
You would wear those. I do yeah. You like animals.

994
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:13,220
Don't ever say that you like animals. Don't you ever say that? Oh, one more

995
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:17,960
thing about monkeys. Is it called aping? Because like you'll say, oh, I ate this

996
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:23,340
that aped me copy monkey see monkey do because monkeys copied humans. No,

997
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:25,120
it's because of monkey see monkey do.

998
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,980
So if you are have a monkey and you go like this,

999
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:32,680
the monkey will do that because it thinks that you like it when I think

1000
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:37,500
copy, I thought it was monkeys copy humans by walking and creating tools.

1001
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:40,540
That's the other way around. I don't think I've ever seen a monkey's. We

1002
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:43,740
don't know that I was thinking about something the other day that I can't

1003
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:44,180
remember.

1004
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:49,940
that's a great place to end the show. You are useless, not useless. It was a guys.

1005
01:03:49,940 --> 01:03:55,100
If you love this high energy, amazing episode, yeah, you should travel back in

1006
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:56,340
time to yesterday

1007
01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:02,100
and do what Patrick's about to say, or you could go see me in Austin on the

1008
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:07,460
weekend of the 28th through the 29th through the 30th is when I take a flight

1009
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:14,140
home. I'm going to be doing four shows. I'm opening for Dan Lakata, so Dan

1010
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:20,180
La Costa. Go see me there. And then I'm also going to be on the bus later to

1011
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:25,380
make a bunch of shit. Got a frittata, a culotta. A miata. I'm going to drive a

1012
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,940
miata, drink a culotta with Dan Licata. I haven't had a culotta in a long time.

1013
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:34,500
You guys want to get culottas after this? Okay. Joe Pera, that boy's scared of a

1014
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:37,580
fucking... Do you guys know how to make the best smoothie in the world? How? No,

1015
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:40,660
I'm asking. Oh. Oh, we can figure this out once the show's done. No, I actually,

1016
01:04:40,660 --> 01:04:47,300
I said I know I know you also also in if you're if you're in Brooklyn, New York,

1017
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,300
you want to see me no no no. I know I okay, I got it instead of okay banana

1018
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:54,540
yeah, no ice instead of an instead of ice use frozen

1019
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:59,480
milk. No, you can't freeze milk. You can you can freeze milk. It's

1020
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:05,900
you didn't even let me finish my recipe. You use a fresh banana and then you use

1021
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:11,240
frozen berries. Yeah, I got those and you use I got those from my own. You can use

1022
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:14,060
I think everyone knows the smoothie, but if you know I need to hear this, if

1023
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:18,620
you're going for taste, though, here's my recommendation instead of milk, orange

1024
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:23,380
juice, orange juice, orange. Okay, that's a good that's and that's it and that's

1025
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:27,040
pretty three ingredients. Maybe a little honey if you need it right on protein

1026
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,540
powder. I'm going to try that also if you live in Brooklyn, New York, and you

1027
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:34,900
would like to see me at a bar show hosted by Pitbull impersonator, Stephen Vega

1028
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:38,840
that is on the twenty-sixth. And if you want to see me doing my laundry, come to

1029
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:42,380
my laundromat. I only go there for a short amount of time, because I just drop my

1030
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,540
clothes in the washing machine, then I go home and I come back to change it over,

1031
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:48,820
and I just come back to pick it up. So it's a small window, but I'll be there

1032
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,940
three times, one to bring it to the washer, one to switch it between the

1033
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:55,420
washer/dryer, and then one to pick up the clothes. And I will be in Morro Bay,

1034
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:59,820
California, visiting my family at the end of the month. Oh, yeah, and I'll be

1035
01:05:59,820 --> 01:06:02,900
leaving the country as well. I'll probably be walking around. He's gonna be in some

1036
01:06:02,940 --> 01:06:06,620
another part of the world. I can't reveal what I'll be out of the country at the

1037
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:09,200
end of the month. I'm doing none of us are going to be here to hold the office

1038
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,860
down. Somebody could break in. I'm doing the break in. You want to break into our

1039
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:18,220
office. The address is I'm going abroad to report on some issues going down

1040
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:23,620
and other parts of the world. I think you'd be an amazing war reporter. I'm

1041
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:27,380
going to send you guys some videos of your pressure. Okay, we will see

1042
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:30,580
Cameron's report when he doesn't be reporting. All right, wear the helmet.

1043
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:36,840
what helmet Caleb? Yes, sir. Let's record your vertical for your dunking goal.

1044
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,240
My vertical. Okay. Okay.

1045
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,740
Well, we're on the on this

1046
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:47,240
stand. Wait, stand next to Patrick. Go, go move the chair that way and stand

1047
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:50,140
next to Pat. Pat will be the match. So Pat sitting here. This is about two

1048
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:54,540
feet tall right here. This is not running. This is just my my yeah,

1049
01:06:54,540 --> 01:06:58,640
straight vertical. I would get a higher vertical, right? But that's not really

1050
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:00,540
how we're measuring this.

1051
01:07:00,540 --> 01:07:06,020
Oh, I heard that crack. That was a huge crack. Yeah, you have a huge crack.

1052
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:13,420
Jump. Okay, so you didn't even really bend your knees at all. So if you bend

1053
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:18,940
your knees, you can get a little more air. Well, you're just your feet could be a

1054
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:23,860
little higher up. See, like that doesn't make your yes, it does. You can go over a

1055
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:27,020
hurdle better like that. We're not hurtling. I'm trying to dunk that doesn't

1056
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,320
No, no, keep your feet straight at the bottom.

1057
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:33,060
You brought them up.

1058
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,960
- Well, it's just about the height of the vertical, right?

1059
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,520
We're not dunking, there's no hoop.

1060
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,480
- But your vertical is not how far your feet up

1061
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:40,920
are from the ground. - But for right now.

1062
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:41,760
- We need a hoop.

1063
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:44,000
We gotta get a hoop for the office.

1064
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,760
- We'll just see who can touch higher on the wall.

1065
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:47,880
That makes way more sense. - Okay, that's better.

1066
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,120
But that can't be seen by the camera.

1067
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,240
- Yeah, that, let's, what are we doing?

1068
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,320
We gotta end this.

1069
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,800
- I got higher.

1070
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,640
- Okay, bye.

1071
01:07:56,640 --> 01:07:58,640
Can we get one eye?
