You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Podcasts for the homeless.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
You're a crap monster.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,300
Lollipop, lollipop, oh lollipop, lollipop, lollipop

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,000
Bobo, Bobo, call me lollipop

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Tell you why, it's just as sweet as an apple pie

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,500
And when it goes to shaky rocky dips

8
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,000
Man, I ain't got a chance

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,500
I'll go lollipop, lollipop, oh lollipop, lollipop

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,740

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,580
- Sorry guys.

12
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:50,220
- That's the intro to the greatest episode we will ever do.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,100
- I couldn't look at Caleb doing it in that fucking suit.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,100
- It's the best episode we're ever gonna do

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,020
and I dressed to the nines for it.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:58,860
It's called Dressing Appropriately.

17
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:01,060
- I plan to do the best episode ever today.

18
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,060
- Cam texted us yesterday and said,

19
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,620
let's do the best episode we have ever done tomorrow.

20
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,340
And we said, you know what man, why the fuck not?

21
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,940
- I haven't really done that yet.

22
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,380
I'm wearing my shoes.

23
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,060
That's right, we're all in Miami right now.

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,320
Mm-hmm, I'm in Miami, I'm wearing my dress shoes

25
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,540
that I got for my brother's wedding

26
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,760
that he said are too red for his wedding.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,840
That's cold.

28
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,380
Mm-hmm, they're too red.

29
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,920
That's what happens when you're the best man,

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,900
you gotta be color coordinated with the groom.

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,740
You're the best man?

32
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,580
Me and my brother, we're doing best man duties.

33
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,100
Why don't you just get him redder shoes?

34
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,020
We're both best men.

35
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,340
We're doing best brothers.

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,740
You can't, so neither of you are best men.

37
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,580
Yeah.

38
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:40,400
No, we're best men.

39
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,340
Best, it's either one.

40
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,260
there's one yeah this is the best episode we can't hide best episodes so we're

I'm not the worst woman you are unless you kill your brother you're going to be

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,420
there's a certain iron lady who is the worst woman if you ask any British person

45
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,420
Yeah, your mom.

46
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:07,920
Yeah.

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,920
What? Who sneezed?

48
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,920
Who was that?

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,920
I think Jan is in the other room having a sneeze attack.

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Okay.

51
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,920
Having a bit of a sneeze.

52
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,920
Yeah, having a bit of a sneeze, so let's not bother her too much.

53
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,420
[Laughter]

54
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,420
She's busy.

55
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,420
Yeah.

56
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,920
But yeah, we're all dressed in the nines.

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,420
Honey, I told you not to come in here when I'm sneezing.

58
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,420
Can you fucking just give me five? Can I sneeze for five minutes in this fucking house?

59
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,420
Without you coming in here and saying, "Oh, having a bit of a sneeze, are we?"

60
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,120
- Ew, I'm having a bit of a sneeze.

61
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,580
- Oh heavens.

62
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,260
- Oh goodness.

63
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,940
- Mind if I partake?

64
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,220
- What's all this racket?

65
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,740
Are you sneezing again?

66
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,580
- Are you sneezing?

67
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,060
- Yeah baby, sometimes I'm sneezing.

68
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,820
It's one of my favorite things to do.

69
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,620
- Oh how delightful.

70
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,780
- Oh beautiful.

71
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,820
- Yeah, women love to sneeze dude.

72
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,660
They like it 'cause it's,

73
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,220
you know it's actually a miniature orgasm.

74
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,060
Did you know that?

75
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,900
That's the only one my wife's ever had.

76
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,100
- Here's an idea for a stand up bit for everyone out there.

77
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,940
- Okay.

78
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,300
- Women sneeze like this.

79
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,020
(mimics sneezing)

80
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,220
- Men sneeze like this.

81
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,100
(mimics sneezing)

82
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,140
- Yes, dude. - You could do that on stage.

83
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,160
- Yes.

84
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,860
- Men do scream when they sneeze.

85
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,140
- My dad, I think I've maybe said this before,

86
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,500
my dad one time sneezed when I was a kid

87
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,220
and I was upstairs and I ran downstairs

88
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,380
'cause I thought he had a heart attack.

89
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,780
I thought that's what a heart attack sounded like.

90
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,460
Was just like (mimics sneezing)

91
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,700
(laughing)

92
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,100
It's pretty horrifying, dude.

93
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,020
- Yeah. - Yeah.

94
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,960
I don't have a loud sneeze, I nipped that in the bud.

95
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,800
I think I had it.

96
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,340
I started developing a loud sneeze

97
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:39,060
and I was like, I can't be a loud sneezer.

98
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,780
- I sneezed at the beginning.

99
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,500
I sneezed at the beginning of the premium episode

100
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,500
we recorded and it just sounds like I'm screaming.

101
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,420
There's a sneeze at the beginning

102
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,300
and it's just you guys talking and then I just go.

103
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,180
- Yeah, but you do that on purpose though.

104
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:58,180
You guys know those girls who sneeze like a mouse?

105
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,020
- Yeah.

106
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,140
- They go, (squeaking)

107
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,980
- Yeah, they're faking.

108
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:08,980
yeah I think they sneeze like this oh you know why this is the best episode ever

113
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,060
might do dress to the nines every day. You should dress like this when you go to the bodega,

114
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:43,380
like with the headphones and everything. I might become, yeah, I might become like one of those,

115
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:50,340
like a Paul F. Tompkins type, like wear a suit every day and just be a miserable son of a bitch.

116
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,980
Yeah, those are cool shoes stop laughing

Parent roller backpack, I knew you could just see there's a monster energy and one loose Adderall pill

120
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,420
I knew a kid who was a new suit kid who brought a briefcase. Yeah

121
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:34,060
You'd be so different dude, I know I was like this suited skater I

122
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,500
Well, I would wear a suit cuz I thought it was funny

123
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,340
I would sometimes just like where like no, I mean what's funny about how I look right now

124
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:49,580
Say it to his face say it to my fucking face if you think it's funny that you look like a corporate cog in the machine

Yes, no

127
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:05,080
Yeah, cuz when I get home from the office, I hit the office every day, you know, and then I get home 9 p.m

128
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,480
At night, I worked one hour. Yeah, I I would I rock you listen to rage against the machine, dude

Yeah, I'm a business guy.

130
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,080
And then I look at my hands and I go, "I am the machine!"

131
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,120
And then I fucking strangle myself.

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,680
Do you guys know the secret message behind the song "Killing in the Name"?

133
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,200
Basically it says some of those that work forces, so that's like the workforce, like

134
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
workers.

135
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
So like everything.

136
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,200
So every, every workforce.

137
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:34,120
Yeah, well like some, like worker, yeah, the workforce are the same who burn crosses.

138
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,120
So it's basically like this, like, this kind of commentary on how many employees don't

139
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,000
like Christians and they like kind of fight back against Christian holidays

140
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,160
that's actually a really good point a lot of these like dog shit like minimum wage

141
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,480
workers burger flippers they hate Christianity and they want to they'd

142
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,260
rather work at McDonald's on Christmas then go home and hang out with their

143
00:06:54,260 --> 00:07:00,120
family yeah I was I was at McDonald's the other day and I actually heard one of

144
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,680
the guys flipping a hamburger say I love Muhammad he actually said that and I

145
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,120
made it I made a very serious complaint yeah cuz that was the manager's name in

146
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:16,400
sexual harassment in the workplace yeah exactly yeah no laughing matter yeah

147
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:21,880
that's not a joke man yeah yeah but yeah I was almost a suit kid what I did was I

148
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,120
would there was like a thing there was like a path near the dumpsters in my

149
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,480
neighborhood growing up and I would stand on the side of the road in a suit and I

150
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,660
would kind of jump out at cars like I

151
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,360
wouldn't jump out in front of them but I

152
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,000
would jump up on the side of the road

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,940
and start dancing so it looked like a

154
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,280
weird kid in a suit is like dancing it

155
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,240
would just look like that it would but

156
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,800
it wouldn't be that though it wouldn't

157
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,160
be a weird kid it would look like a weird kid

158
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,480
it would be the illusion of a weird kid dancing in a dumpster

159
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
it would be a normal kid acting weird

160
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,440
pretty cool for his age kid

161
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,880
actually very mature for his age

162
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:01,600
I bet you were a kid who got into British comedy pretty young

163
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,680
You may think I'm a weird suit kid, but actually I'm completely normal.

164
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,400
No I'm just wearing a suit to look like a suit kid.

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,440
You may think you're seeing a fucking little freak dancing in a dumpster wearing a suit,

166
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,080
but I'm actually a normal guy.

167
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,080
But I actually live here and it's an okay house to have.

168
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,520
Yeah, it's called a tiny home.

169
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,600
I stopped doing it because this one time a guy in a gold van saw me.

170
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,640
You stopped doing it?

171

00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,240
they're giving him an unplugged keyboard to type in Twitch chat he doesn't know

332
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,200
it's unplugged. By the way if anybody has my phone number and keeps calling me

333
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,920
every two minutes I had to turn my phone off because of recording please if

334
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,880
you're gonna call me don't if I answer which I don't answer most of them but if I do answer

335
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,960
don't just say I'm sorry and then hang up. You have to tell the fans of that

336
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,120
Fitz that streamer that leaked your number. That guy sounds to me like that

337
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,720
person who called you is a pussy. I got three calls last night in a row and I

338
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,920
just answered all of them it was like 2 in the morning and I was watching girls

339
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:49,980
and I was just like you know I'll answer a few of these whatever I answered the

340
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,640
first one the guy goes oh I'm just I just and then hung up the second one I

341
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,640
said hello immediately hung up and then the third guy I answer I say hello and

342
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:05,860
he goes I'm sorry and then hung up. If you're gonna call me can you just write

343
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,380
Oh my god. Just write something funny to tell me. Leave me a funny voicemail. Don't just

344
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,380
puss out dude. Come on. What is wrong with you? Yeah. Threaten my life. There's so many

345
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,500
people. Tell me you're gonna kill me. Six thousand people saw your phone number and

346
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,500
they're calling just to just to be anxious on the phone. Yeah. What is wrong with you

347
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:30,820
dude? I'm so sorry. Did I curse you instead? Back in my day prank, I mean prank calls were

348
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:37,380
just vicious dude. This is prank yankers era. Back in the 80s you'd get a random phone call you hear a guy on the

349
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,020
other end going "huh huh huh" yeah nowadays you get a random phone call you hear someone on the other

350
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,780
end going "huh huh huh huh" yeah am i right? mm-hmm yeah nowadays people just say i'm sorry to hang up it used

351
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,040
- It used to be you get a prank phone call,

352
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,380
they say, "Wazzup!"

353
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,580
- Yeah, that's right.

354
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,380
That's right, then you get a beer together.

355
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,580
- That's right.

356
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
- Prank calls used to lead to something nice.

357
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,020
Now it's just 'cause of COVID-19,

358
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,260
everyone's afraid to leave their house.

359
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,100
- Yeah.

360
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,300
Hey buddy, you don't have to social distance on the phone.

361
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,140
- Exactly.

362
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,640
- You can ask me about my penis.

363
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,360
Just saying, dude.

364
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,660
It's just absurd what these people,

365
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,500
what these kids expect from me.

366
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,540
- It's sad, it's honestly sad.

367
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,660
- It's honestly sad.

368
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,060
These people, these 6,000 people got such a layup.

369
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,900
- Yeah, exactly.

370
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,740
- Yeah.

371
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,940
- You can literally say anything.

372
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,980
You could just make a, you could fart into the phone.

373
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:26,460
- You could, if you fart into my phone.

374
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,740
- That would be a good one.

375
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,900
That would be so funny if you leave six fart voicemails.

376
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,640
- Everyone who had Caleb's number called him

377
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,060
and just started farting into the phone.

378
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,380
That would be really funny.

379
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,700
- 'Cause I actually have a very sympathetic sense of smell.

380
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,220
- You're a smell path.

381
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:46,500
- Yeah, so if you fart, I'm gonna imagine what it smells like

382
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,980
and you might make me vomit, which might be kind of cool.

383
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:49,980
- That'd be such a cool power. - I'm gonna vomit

384
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,820
over the phone.

385
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,100
- You can smell farts that you hear, like on TV and stuff.

386
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,660
(laughing)

387
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,020
- That's my only X-Men mutation.

388
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,980
- My grandma, when my grandma sees a fart on TV,

389
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,220
or a burp, she does go, "Ugh!"

390
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,980
(laughing)

391
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,900
It's like, you're not smelling it.

392
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,740
- Yeah.

393
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,500
- They're through, there's a window between you guys.

394
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,340
You can't smell that fart.

395
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,980
- Yeah, but what if the window opens?

396
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,900
I haven't taught her how to do that with the TV.

397
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,180
I taught my grandma how to open the TV.

398
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:24,980
Yeah, and pick out all her favorite characters.

399
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,580
It's so annoying, Scrappy Doo's at my house now.

400
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,080
Scrappy Doo as Mr. Bean.

401
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,100
She took out the entire cast of Days of Our Lives, but they're literally, they're six

402
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,460
inches tall, because that's how big, she has a very small TV.

403
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:43,580
Yeah, she's using one of those hand-cranked TVs that you use for emergencies.

404
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:50,280
with it with a stationary bike attached yeah yeah and now now the cast of the

405
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,900
days of our lives are running around my house and building little so stuff to my

406
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,940
grandmother how it's so strange the the TV soap but like they the soap opera

407
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,940
actors just kind of like switch out with every show like someone who's on days of

408
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,180
our lives can go into like all my children or General Hospital but they're

409
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:12,100
different characters or they're the same characters and sometimes the shows on

410
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,540
different channels. Soap operas are so sick dude. It's so weird. It's so funny. My

411
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,300
grandma who is basically at this point almost senile she would spend a lot of

412
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,820
our time of our at our house like last year we're just watching soap operas and

413

00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,740
I mean someone would be like I'll be like oh we have to like we have to get that

That's horrible.

00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,400
- Yeah.

458
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,120
I clicked on his profile.

459
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,480
This is Buzzfeed, by the way.

460
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,240
I clicked on his profile and it just says,

461
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,820
"Sam is a content producer based in London."

462
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,920
Pretty cool.

463
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,080
- I don't believe it.

464
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,760
- He doesn't follow me on Twitter.

465
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,520
- Oh my God, he's rude.

466
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,400
This is, "People are sharing the most bizarre fan theories.

467
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,720
they've ever heard about a TV show or movie. You should finish reading How to

468
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Read a Book. Well I need to read How to Read a Website. It's a different book that this guy made.

469
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,200
It's a different medium. Yeah. Recently we asked members of the BuzzFeed community about their

470
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,120
favorite weird movie and TV fan theories. Here are some of the best suggestions.

471
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:24,520
Number one, Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz is Phineas's father in Phineas and Ferb. Don't believe it.

472
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:28,040
there's no way he's evil he's evil and phineas is silly

473
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:32,280
mm-hmm those are opposite sense dude those are opposite on

474
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:36,200
on dnd alignment chart the thing is i guess they both have a kind of a

475
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,040
triangular head yeah but so does so does uh hey arnold

476
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,120
so maybe he's hey oh he could be hey arnold's dad too so does triangle head

477
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,560
from uh silent hill that's true resident evil

478
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,840
whichever one that's yeah so does crazy head from yeah

479
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,920
from day Z.

480
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,400
- True, yeah.

481
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,560
So I don't know, I don't think this one holds a lot of water.

482
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,080
- I mean, there are a lot of triangle people out there.

483
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,920
- Yeah.

484
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,760
- Yeah, that's true.

485
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,000
- I knew a guy whose head was shaped like a triangle

486
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
and we called him triangle head.

487
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,820
- Is that true?

488
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,660
- Yeah.

489
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,080
- Was he mean?

490
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:13,920
- No.

491
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,360
- He was nice and so he didn't deserve it

492
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,200
and you're a bully? - He wasn't nice

493
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,040
but he wasn't mean.

494
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,320
- He was kind of just, nah, he was kind of nothing.

495
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,440
He was annoying and you called him triangle head?

496
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,480
- Yeah, you heard me.

497
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,160
Was it annoying that his head was a triangle?

498
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
No, that didn't really have anything to do...

499
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,660
He...

500
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:31,200
One time he farted really loud in class.

501
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,400
That's one memory I have.

502
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,960
That's Savage, actually.

503
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,240
Anything else?

504
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:40,560
Yeah, I don't have many memories of him besides the shape of his head and his name.

505
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:45,520
Did you guys ever know those kids who had like a perfectly square head?

- Oh yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

510
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,820
There was a kid at my school who had a very long square head.

511
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,360
- There was a kid that we went to college with

512
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,200

513
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,040
I've ever seen in my entire life.

- As soon as you said there was a kid we went to college with

518
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,120
his face just entered my mind.

- Yeah, and I was like, anytime I had class with him

589
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:48,260
a Sith Lord this one I really liked when I first heard it yeah when I first heard

590
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,860
this one I was like 15 year old brother told me this but he couldn't be he

591
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,660
couldn't be a Sith Lord though because there can only be two right but but he

592
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:04,180
has red eyes in the photo exactly good point no but the the let me let me just

593
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:07,900
read the thing it said he appears to be a bumbling idiot but somehow everything

594
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,780
works out for him the battle droids chasing him always end up destroyed and

595
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:14,380
takes out a battle tank nobody seems to really like him and yet he somehow gets

596
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,660
elected to be a senator which hints at some Jedi mind control this no they got

597
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,700
the wrong person the wrong commenter commented this okay so get so lay out

598
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:30,820
your case against Jar Jar Binks the people versus Jar Jar Binks weird kind

599
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:37,300
of weird that's all you have yeah that's all you have for me I really I teed you

600
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,220
up so perfectly for the one thing that you know stuff about.

601
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:49,580
I think he looks like a bunny rabbit. Yeah, he does actually. I think my fan theory is

602
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:55,900
he might be the Easter Bunny for the Star Wars universe. Oh, shit. I like Easter Bunnies.

603
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:01,940
You can't have my theory. I'm expanding upon yours. No, you can't expand. It's my, I copyright.

606
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,500
Jar Jar Theory. Do you think Jar Jar Binks looks like the Easter Bunny? No I think he

610
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,440

Who cares? Absolutely nobody. So what, your honor? So what? And that's how they got OJ off. Yeah.

674
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:47,620
They said, "You know what? Who cares? What are we doing here?"

675
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:52,340
This is just kind of pissing me off. We should all be outside playing soccer on that field.

676
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,500
What happened to lunch? We could all be at lunch right now.

677
00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:00,020

Pee-you is what I'm saying. Pee-you.

680
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,420
What's that crazy wig you're wearing, man?

681
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,340
Yeah, why are you wearing that wig? Are you a girl?

682
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,780
if you're a girl then you can stay here but if you're a boy you probably need to let my man off

683
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,020
all right i and then the judge goes okay i move that all girls stay in here and all the boys go

00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:24,340
out to play and be and be cool that's right the girls have to stay in and figure out the case

685
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,340
and then the girls tried to figure out the case but guess what they broke a nail and then these

00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,740
Are you gonna kiss them?

691
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,620
The more that you sit here and agree with them, the more it seems like they're your boyfriends.

692
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,580
Hey, uh, your honor, why is that chair you're sitting in so tall?

Do you have a freak touching you?

00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,180
Yeah, is there a freak hidden in your quarters that you touch?

698
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,620

Your honor, does your mom know you're gay?

708
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,180

709
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,180
We got him!

710
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,180
Cause I have. I think I'm looking at one.

711
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:58,180
And everyone here in this court has. Except you. Why is that?

712
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Hmm. What is that?

713
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,180
Your honor, one out of...

714
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,820
It seems like one of us here hasn't done his research.

715
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,700
Your Honor, according to statistics, one out of every

716
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,060
one, two, three, four, five, six, fifty people is gay.

717
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:15,220
And I think the 49 of us in here aren't gay, so...

718
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,580
Your Honor, your shoe is untied and I'd like to call for a mistrial.

719
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,780
Your Honor, you're stuck with it. No further questions.

720
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:27,460
Your Honor, you just lost the game. Your Honor, guess what?

721
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:34,460
I motion for a mistrial as obviously the judge is in such dire

722
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:40,660
emotions due to losing the game that he cannot go any further in this

723
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:45,220
trial. OJ let's go fucking party baby.

724
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:52,220
Panama! Panama!

725
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:58,780
number seven none of the Rugrats actually exist the other cartoons yeah Sam

726
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:04,660
Cleo I'm stupid duh number eight an unbreakable Kimmy

727
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:09,060
Schmidt no thank you nope are the unbreakable clitty-clit

728
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:15,200
no not the crack who knows where it is yeah

729
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:37,300
the unfindable clitty clit. It's invisible!

730
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:41,300
It's like a fucking needle point. That thing don't exist.

731
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,300
Yeah. It's like finding a piece of hay in a haystack.

732
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:47,300
There's too many of them. Too many clitty clitty in there.

733
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,300
That's the problem. Yeah. Listen, I could literally find it right now.

734
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,300
This thing is covered in clits. I can't find anything.

735
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,300
My problem is that I've got homing vision and I can see it right now.

736
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,300
I know exactly where it is but I can also see every other clit in the world

737
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,140
world so it's really hard to focus and find where I want.

738
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:11,740
Yeah I don't I don't I've not seen maybe but two episodes of that show so I do not understand

739
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:18,100
I do not understand what this means as far as Lily and his Titus's biological mother.

740
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Number nine.

741
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,100
Sounds like it could be right.

742
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,020
Frozen, Tangled, and the Little Mermaid are all interrelated don't care.

743
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,020
They're interrelated.

744
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,020
Don't care.

745
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,020
Oh like twins?

746
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:33,380
In the first movie we see Rapunzel and Flynn attend Queen Elsa's coronation and we also learn the death of Anna and Elsa parents

747
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,340
aboard a sub to shank the shit

748
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:43,060
- and it's a senator to the oral science. Yeah, I don't care about that

749
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:48,220
Yeah, that it's hey Sam Cleo. You're writing doesn't make any fucking sense. You have to fucking dumb. Yeah

750
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,220
What the heck is this next one? Don't go bobo

751
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,660
Putting out this

752
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:10,220
What passes for journalism nowadays

753
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:17,620
A server has certain sound rights her in a town armor, and I don't even get so nervous

754
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,980
You just see smoke coming through a doorway in the background.

755
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,540
Yeah, it's like, "wellness check."

756
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:33,620
Yeah, do you see this on CNN? They're literally suggesting that Joe Biden...

757
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:45,380
Number 10, in Pretty Little Liars, Aria was actually A.

758
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:47,700
Yeah, A stupid bitch.

759
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,380
Her name starts with A.

760
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:51,380
Yeah, that's pretty clear to me.

761
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:51,880
Yeah.

762
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:58,380
In the first episode, Aria returns from a year of schooling abroad and the mysterious messages start soon after.

763
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,380
There are so many subtle hints throughout the show that she is A.

764
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,380
And at one point we're led to believe she has a dissociative identity.

765
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:11,380
I honestly think the writers planned for it to happen that she was A, but they scrapped it when it became too popular a theory.

766
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:12,380
Who cares?

767
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:18,380
That would suck. That would suck to be like writing a show and people just first episode guess exactly what you're gonna do.

768
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:25,120
yeah you're like ah fuck never I guess a sponge bob and yeah it's so funny to

769
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:29,520
like to like change it to to be like that like that's what they did with Star

770
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,000
Wars too many people muster like I think that's what they said is that too many

771
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,360
people figured out like all the they were like some of the fan theories were

772
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,520
better than what we were coming up with so we had to like adapt like it's like

773
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,320
just yeah just something like this some of the some of the Snoke stuff I think

774
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:49,720
didn't he just like die and never yeah he turned out he was just like a Palpatine

775
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,840
clone he's just like a guy that yeah my neighbors doing power bombs upstairs by

776
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:58,520
the way power bombs they're just like slamming against the ground right now

777
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,840
they're slamming for them dude neighbors crashes through the ceiling you got a

778
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,240
bunch of kangaroos above you man yeah Cameron's upside down Australia it's

779
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,920
interesting you see you would suggest they're having sex Caleb because they

780
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:18,680
actually it's children that live up there. Just children? Yep, only children. I don't

781
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,480
think that's possible. Did you hear that one? Oh my god. Yeah, I heard that one. I think

782
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,960
someone just fell over. Uh oh, someone just fell over upstairs. Number 11, Snowpiercer

783
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,240
is the sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The hell it is. Yeah, and Parasite

784
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:46,280
the sequel to Snowpiercer and anime I think is the sequel to Parasite. I've

785
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,440
never seen I've never seen Snowpiercer. I don't like Super Stupid. I think it's

786
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,180
really bad. I think people are blinded by his other good movies and they think

787
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:59,240
it's good but it's bad. I watched it I watched it once a long time ago and I was

788
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,600
like this is bad and then I watched it again because I was like maybe I was

789
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,560
wrong and I was like nope it's bad. He's barely even Captain America in that

790
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,440
movie he doesn't do any more shield shit he doesn't have a part of that movie is

791
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,980
there's a thing like they eat they eat like protein bars or like gel bars or

792
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,620
whatever and they also like they're like it's all about poverty or whatever and

793
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:22,360
their shit where they like they're like we had to like eat a child to stay alive

794
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:25,400
and then they find out that the protein bars they've been eating are made out of

795
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:34,640
bugs and they're all like oh my god yeah did you know that movie is actually

796
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,340
about school yeah it's all big it's a teacher that shoots at them with a

797
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:44,680
machine gun it's I mean it couldn't be more obvious the thing yes that you know

798
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,360
that movies about sports whoa yeah it's secretly about sports

799
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,320
that was about a big train yeah that's how they get nerds to watch movies about

800
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,360
sports yeah it's pretty cool they get a big Erica in it a Korean guy to make it

801
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:03,380
it. What I love about it is that the train is almost like its own character though. Yeah

802
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,420
it's kind of like the train plays itself. It's just like how New York City, New York City's

803
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:10,420
a character in it too. It's like yeah, New York City. LA is also a character in that

804
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,860
movie. There's a bunch of cities as they drive by them you're like wow that's like almost

805
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:19,940
a character to me, that city that you can see. And also they do drive the train. It

806
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:24,780
has wheels, it's just a big car. Number 12, season, I don't care, they're skipping that

807
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:26,440
- Just read it. - Just read it.

808
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:28,000
- Seasons four to six of Glee

809
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,460
were a figment of Tina Cohen Chang's Met, don't care.

810
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:31,900
- You love that? - Don't care.

811
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,980
I hate Glee. - I had a dream

812
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:35,420
that the Mohawk guy was a pedophile.

813
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:37,300
- Oh, your dream came true.

814
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,500
- What the hell?

815
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:39,500
- Yeah. - Yeah.

816
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,580
- I wished that he would be a pedophile on a star.

817
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,780
- And kill himself.

818
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:46,860
Didn't he just like immediately kill himself

819
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:47,860
when he was gonna go to jail?

820
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,060
- No, I think he waited a bit

821
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:53,980
and then once he was guilty, he did it.

822
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:55,440
yeah that's what i mean

823
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,280
yet was going to go to jail he was like

824
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,440
all right well give my best shot

825
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,040
yet that's it

826
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,880
dancing my way out of this one

827
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:08,560
so i have a look at the trial is that the newsletters

828
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,520
where

829
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,640
the

830
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,160
that that choice is that i have a man that i have a good a lot of the park

831
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,640
i wonder why

832
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,640
uh...

833
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,960
Number 13. He started singing Kyle's Mom is a Bitch from South Park and it didn't...

834
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:32,760
he thought that would let them... he thought that would let them off but didn't work. Number 13.

835
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:39,400
Ross lost custody of Ben and Friends. Good, I hope he dies. What the... Which one? Both.

836
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:45,720
I don't think I've ever seen... I don't know anything about Friends, yeah. I just know the

837
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,200
theme song. I've seen one or two episodes of Friends. I don't like it. I fucking hate that show.

838
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,200
Ross never sees his son Ben in the later season of Friends.

839
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,400
No, people love Friends.

840
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,440
I feel like Friends is the one, Friends was like the office but obviously it came before

841
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:06,120
it so it's more time for people to get mad about it.

842
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,880
Yeah, well the office is also the office for Gen X people so I don't know.

843
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,080
Yeah, but Friends is what-

844
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,880
This is one of the worst conversations we've ever had on this show.

845
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,440
No, it's not. It's the best episode ever.

846
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,960
It's the best episode ever, Caleb, you fucking moron.

847
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:19,240
I can't believe you would say that.

848
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,800
The office is like South Park.

849
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:22,800
Mm-hmm.

850
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:23,800
But white.

851
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,800
The office is like the South Park of Simpsons.

852
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,800
The office is white South Park.

853
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,800
Harry Piter is...

854
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,800
Yeah, just bail on that one.

855
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,800

857
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:34,800
Kind of like a spider.

00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,800
That was fascinating.

859
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:36,800

860
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,800

00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,800
I mean, the Harry Piter is kind of like a spider.

865
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:42,800
I mean, the Harry Piter is kind of like a spider.

866
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,800
I mean, the Harry Piter is kind of like a spider.

867
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:56,960
kind of like a spider. Harry Potter in the book he never drinks water yeah Harry

877
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:48,760
yeah it's like patch adams yeah he didn't patch anything i think he's the reason they say the

878
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:53,800
apple a day keeps the doctor away and they call him patch adams because he was a patch to the

879

the new update doctor number best episode best episode number 14 the man

882
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:19,600
Seinfeld actually died in the last episode I believe it didn't they go to

883
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,440
jail or something the main characters were actually in a plane crash and died

884
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:25,200
in the last episode instead of the plane straightening out and landing safely

885
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,560
then the following the Good Samaritan trial was actually them being judged on

886
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,360
who would go to heaven who would be sent to hell Jerry Seinfeld if there's one

889
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,400
don't know why you think he'd be going to hell I would I think is it because of

890
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,920
his belief system no I think maybe it's cuz the devil the devil wants the devil

891

wants to laugh the devil is getting lonely down you're like the best piano

900
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:41,520
descended from the Air Nomads. I don't know who that is. I can't believe that

901
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,440
people still will try and tell you with a straight face that Avatar the Last

902
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,400
Airbender, that you should have to watch it. Yeah. Like people, 24

year old people will look you in the eyes and say man you have to watch

904
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,440
Avatar the Last Airbender. It's one of the best shows ever made. Yeah. I can't

905
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,840
- Excuse me, watch a grown up show.

906
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,920
- Watch a grown up show like Cow and Chicken

907
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,200
or Cousin Skeeter or--

908
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,320
- Yeah, Barn House.

909
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,400
- How about you watch a show that's actually Japanese?

910
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,240
- Barnyard.

911
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,440
- Yeah, watch a Japanese show.

912
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:13,440
- Avatar is Korean.

913
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,760
- Yeah, no it's not.

914
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,600
- Yeah it is.

915
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:16,760
- It's Nickelodeon.

916
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,160
- It's American, what are you talking about?

917
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:20,960
- I thought, are you thinking of Snowpiercer again?

918
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:21,800
- Yes, I was thinking of Snowpiercer.

919
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,240
- Did you genuinely think that was Korean?

920
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,920
You just thought it was Korean?

921
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:26,060
- You think of Bulgogi.

922
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,400
- You just looked at that art and you were like,

923
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,440
that's Korean no I heard somewhere that it's a Korean team and an American team

924
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,040
worked together on it well yeah that's because they outsource their animation

925
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,240
to Korea probably they probably have like child slaves yeah Simpsons is Chinese by

926
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,500
that logic yeah that's how animation works yeah the Simpsons is a Chinese

927
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:50,880
anime you said it I'm not gonna say that you whispered it you whispered it I'm

928
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,840
not gonna say that it's it's technically a Chinese anime because they do have I

929
00:53:54,840 --> 00:54:00,280
I think that they have like a team of people that work in China. They just send them the

930
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:06,360
script like a year in advance which makes it even more impressive that they lampoon

931
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,560
Trump so much. Even more impressive. More impressive than it already is because of how

932
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,080
funny. Well you know the way that Trump talks about China those five-year-old Chinese slave

933
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:20,200
kids are really eager to rip him a new one so they get the episodes with him done extra

934
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:33,160
past

935
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,280
even pretend you think that word is I was just I just want to say if we skip this

936
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:43,960
one we'll finally get to one that we care about okay number 17 the whoa number 17

937
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,240
the briefcase in Pulp Fiction actually contains Marcellus Wallace's soul. Can I have a

938
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:57,160
burger? Can I have a humongous French burger? I got a motherfucking burger and

939
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:59,960
I'm gonna shoot this burger out my burger gun.

940
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,760
Eat a burger again.

941
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,400
Eat a sandwich right now.

942
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:06,640
Do they have a burger where you live?

943
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:09,160
Do they have burgers in French?

944
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:11,040
How do you say what in French?

945
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,680
Can I have a kiss?

946
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,400
(laughing)

947
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,560
The path of the righteous man

948
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:21,480
is always a French burger.

949
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:25,800
And God said the burger would come down from heaven

950
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:27,800
And you would eat the burger.

951
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,800
And you would see four burgers.

952
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,800
My brother is John Travolta.

953
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,800
My brother's a burger.

954
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,800
We're two brothers and we're here on an assignment to kill you.

955
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,800
We're the burger brothers.

956
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:50,800
And I'm gonna eat your burger.

957
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:54,800
I'm gonna get my friend's burger back and I'm gonna shoot your ass.

958
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,800
I'm John Travolta and I'm gonna drink some of your soda to wash my burger down.

959
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:05,800
I'm the soda brother. I'm the burger brother and I'm the soda brother.

960
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,800
And I'm here to drink your soda and he's gonna eat your burger.

961
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,800
I'm gonna dance with my burger wife.

962
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:17,800
I'm doing a French dance.

963
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,800
Damn, I'm hungry.

964
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,800
Oh man!

965
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,920
And she died and she had a milkshake on her.

966
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:24,920
We gotta pull the-

967
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:25,920
What happened to Jed?

968
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,920
Jed's bread, baby.

969
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,920
