1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,260
Hey everyone. Hey. Did you guys see those two crazy black guys getting a fight at the

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:17,880
Oscars the other night? That was crazy. That was gangsta AF. Yeah. Alright guys,

3
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:25,680
well welcome. Operation Frogtastic Voyage. Let's give it up. Yeah. Yeah. Big night.

4
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,220
Big night. You guys are about to watch a comedy show, okay?

5
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,860
But it's not your typical comedy show.

6
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,340
It's kind of weird.

7
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:39,200
You guys are gonna have to use your imagination.

8
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,240
I'll give you an example.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,120
Using the power of imagination, this is no longer Union Hall.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,380
This is an operating theater and you guys are no longer just losers in the audience.

11
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:59,320
Your medical students and I am no longer a guy with a penis problem. I'm a nurse

12
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:05,720
Pretty pretty crazy pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah pretty sexy

13
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:12,440
Yeah, so we're gonna get started in a bit but I just want to explain some rules

14
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:19,120
We're about to watch a procedure. Okay, and that procedure is going to be completely dependent on your

15
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,600
actions okay we're gonna be using a little thing called crowd work okay

16
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:35,480
I'll show you an example you sir where are you from oh my god I'm gonna come

17
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:43,560
there you go yeah so I'm gonna be holding a can one of you guys pass me

18
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:56,520
the thing. I'm gonna be I'm gonna be holding this fucking thing and it's

19
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:04,220
gonna be completely dependent on what you guys say so I'll demonstrate.

20
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,560
Okay, clap if you believe in Santa Claus.

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,800
(audience applauding)

22
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:23,600
I think we're getting presents this December.

23
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,840
(audience laughing)

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,500
Cool, does that make sense?

25
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,560
Did everybody get that?

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
- Yeah. - Yeah, it's a vibe.

27
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,440
Alright, and I guess just a couple other general housekeeping rules.

28
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,840
No talking during the show.

29
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,840
If any of you talk, this guy right here will be ejected from the theater.

30
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,840
Just this guy, no one else.

31
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,840
And this guy tomorrow is going to prison for the rest of his life.

32
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
For a totally non-violent crime. Wink.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,800
okay? So this should be, he should have the most fun ever tonight, right? So don't

34
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:17,240
talk and get him ejected. Yeah, no, no, no ugly people, no secrets, no getting too

35
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:25,200
scared. We should have like, we, if you're Italian you were, you should have

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,720
been stopped at the door. So if you're Italian just let us know so we can take

37
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:42,240
care of you. But I think that's about it. So yeah, strap in. Get ready because this

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,440
is Frocktastic Voyage.

39
00:03:49,280 --> 00:04:00,200
Amphibians. Small, wet, smelly, annoying, racist, rude to service workers. Or at least that's

40
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,720
what some say. I happened to find the creatures utterly delightful, full of vim and vigor,

41
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,680
strangely resilient. For example, the North American treehorn frog can withstand temperatures

42
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,000
of up to 127 degrees Celsius for nearly seven seconds, according to studies conducted by

43
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,880
by Jimmy O'Toole, researcher at Miller Elementary.

44
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,880
But today isn't about the ordinary frogs we encounter, the ones we eat, dissect, kiss,

45
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
and use.

46
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,040
Today is about a very special frog.

47
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,960
Today is about Sullivan the Frog.

48
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,000
Sullivan to many is just a weird little frog man, but he's gone on many adventures, the

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,320
face of a successful comedy institution that actually pays its employees, star of a bizarre

50
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,720
radio play and video game release date to be determined, but he is also a loathsome,

51
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,920
weak, simple-minded buffoon.

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,160
Always too kind for the world he's in.

53
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:02,280
And today, for a buffoon like Sullivan, nothing will go right.

54
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,280
Not without your help.

55
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,520
(laughter)

56
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,760
(applause)

57
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:23,560
- It's so hard, I've never been a director before,

58
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,740
it's hard to get into these seats.

59
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,940
- You're fucked.

60
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,040
- I'm gonna fall backwards,

61
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,680
the bat came off of my chair immediately.

62
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
- Nurse!

63
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,980
- I'm gonna break my neck.

64
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
We're gonna have to have a second operation tonight.

65
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,740
nurse that is my let me please let me I'm sorry it's okay the arm is falling off

66
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:42,980
- oh wait guys I have a whole thing I got to read you gotta let me please just this

67
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,940
one then pull it up patches pulling up pulling it up mm-hmm

68
00:05:47,940 --> 00:06:01,140
hey everyone hi exterior all of Brooklyn ah Brooklyn home of New York City the

69
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,300
The most beautiful city in all of Brooklyn City.

70
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,020
Everyone's hair looks normal.

71
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,900
Nobody eats more than 700 calories a day.

72
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,020
Coffee, latte, avocado, latte.

73
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,980
I'm gonna skip through this.

74
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,060
Freaking hips, okay.

75
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,140
Nevermind there's all those poor people around.

76
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,240
Does anybody here in this audience in particular

77
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,100
know where the poor people are going?

78
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Don't worry about it, yeah, okay.

79
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,360
So well, one such resident of this super awesome city

80
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,820
of Brooklyn, New York City is Sullivan the Frog.

81
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:33,640
He loves Brooklyn.

82
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,020
He loves to ride his bike in Brooklyn.

83
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,180
And he always wears a helmet.

84
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:40,140
He loves hanging out in Prospect Park, right?

85
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,580
And just watching all the people go by, he thinks,

86
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,320
wow, this is his voice, so you'll get used to this.

87
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:49,620
Wow, what an amazing array of people who live in Brooklyn.

88
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,640
Hi, Mr. Barbarino, hi, Mrs. Rabinowitz.

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,040
They never say hi back,

90
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,960
But I think they like that I say hi.

91
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,320
I think I...

92
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,360
Sullivan loves his 100 by 100 foot studio apartment.

93
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,080
He loves his landlord, Dmitry,

94
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,860
who makes him pay on the eighth of every month

95
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,520
for some reason.

96
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:14,040
And always in cash, which he hands to him directly.

97
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,220
Sullivan loves his little paper lanterns.

98
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,200
He loves his rock salt lamp.

99
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,240
He loves to eat authentic Brooklyn cuisine

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,520
like cold Popeyes.

101
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,960
He loves to watch Brooklyn TV shows like Broad City.

102
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,600
Glad I got this box set.

103
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,360
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha.

104
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,860
These girls are crazy.

105
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,940
(audience laughing)

106
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,340
- One day, I've never had hair this long.

107
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,760
One day, however, Sullivan woke up, 6 a.m. as usual,

108
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,960
so he can scroll through his phone

109
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,500
and sort of play around with the free weights he has,

110
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,040
when tragedy struck.

111
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,840
- Oh no, oh my God, I'm getting really sick.

112
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,820
- And he collapsed on the floor.

113
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,040
Is this turned around?

114
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,240
No, ooh, cool.

115
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,040
Lucky for him, Dimitri came into his apartment to steal his television

116
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,840
and then when he thought, "I can't have a dead tenant,"

117
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
so he stole his TV and called 911.

118
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,920
My name is Dr. Wizard.

119
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,880
I'm an accident in Party City.

120
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm also a professional doctor.

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:24,160
And today we're going to be operating on Sullivan the Frog.

122
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,160
Oh nurse!

123
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Oh nurse!

124
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,160
Yes, it's me, Nurse Conrad Murray.

125
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,160
Oh nurse!

126
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:39,160
Well this frog is fucked.

127
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,160
If we look at his day more closely, we can see that in the park he swallowed some kind

128
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:52,080
of fly, and then it seems he must have contracted a depressive disorder from a DVD box set.

129
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,160
You should all know if you spend more than $10 on any DVD of any kind, you're going to

130
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,060
contract depression.

131
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:05,840
As far as the STD, this frog hasn't had any sexual activity in at least 400 years, although

132
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,200
it says on his ID he's only 33.

133
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,880
But based on the distance between his eyes, he likely pulls his pants all the way down

134
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,560
when he's at the urinal.

135
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,400
It presses his penis against the cold, wet porcelain.

136
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,400
We're gonna have to take him into the operating room immediately.

137
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,900
Yes, doctor. Right away, doctor.

138
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
Thank you, Nurse Conrad Murray.

139
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,900
Absolutely. Time to go listen to Michael Jackson.

140
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Okay.

141
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,400
I'm not responsible for that bit.

142
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:41,400
And so they wheel good old Sullivan into the operating room.

143
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,400
And they get all the lights up.

144
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,900
They're trying to figure out what to do.

145
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,400
And they address you.

146
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
You are the med students who are here to help Sullivan.

147
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,900
We're gonna rely on your input at certain moments throughout the show.

148
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,900
Um, and so, get ready for that. That's what the applause-o-meter is for.

149
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,900
You'll start to get the feel of it as we go, don't worry.

150
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:08,900
And who is in, Sullivan? Who are these three fuckers? Huh?

151
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:13,900
My name is Toteria, and an hour ago I was laid back in a piss pool,

152
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,900
sipping on leftover stinky sperms from the urinal of a TGI frog daze.

153
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:24,220
Then, all of a sudden, I got sucked up by what looked like either a giant green clit or an

154
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,020
outie belly button, I'm not really sure.

155
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,700
Usually, I love being an STD.

156
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,260
I get to see the world and turn people's crotches into a bunch of crunch.

157
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,100
And boy, do they smell.

158
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:38,700
The weenies I work on make frog farts smell like toad tits.

159
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,140
Simple and plain, I love what I do.

160
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,700
So I never work a day in my life.

161
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,580
But this Sullivan guy is different.

162
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,080
The point of being a disease is to be spread, but I've seen his shitty wide body from the inside,

163
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:53,280
and there's no way he's ever gonna shoot me into a wife who loves him.

164
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,480
*laughter*

165
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,080
So basically, I'm gonna kill him.

166
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,980
*laughter*

167
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,080
Or at least try to.

168
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,780
Because he has a better chance of being fucked as a cold dead body sitting deep in the dirt.

169
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:05,880
Maybe an earthworm will wander near his rancid private parts,

170
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,680
mistaking them for an old box of Chinese food or a fossilized poop.

171
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,480
*laughter*

172
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,680
Or maybe a long buried rock will develop sentience and sexual desire along with arms and legs

173
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,480
and put Sullivan's lifeless penis into his mouth.

174
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,680
That is infinitely more possible than Sullivan the Frog ever touching the gangrenous genital--

175
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,480
his gangrenous genitals to another living thing.

176
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Sorry, Sullivan, but yeah.

177
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
It's not inaccurate.

178
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,480
And who else is here in Sullivan?

179
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Yup, I'm a fly.

180
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I love poop, I love rotting meat, and I love movies about flies.

181
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
I come from a very impressive lineage of flies.

182
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
My family is known for achieving great things, and for being flies.

183
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
My great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Fly

184
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,480
abandoned his wife and children and moved to Mike Pence's head, where he became a famous TV star.

185
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,480
He was killed shortly after, but the whole country knew his name.

186
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Fly.

187
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,640
My grandfather was also a deadbeat. He faked his death and widowed his busted

188
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,380
fly wife and moved to Italy where he built one of the seven wonders of the

189
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,760
fly world, the Leaning Tower of Poop. Flies from all over swarm to admire its glory

190
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,520
and eat little pieces of it. When I was two days old my dad told me and my

191
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,140
10,000 siblings that he was stepping out to get a molecule of potato salad but he

192
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,080
never came back. I should have guessed he was planning something by the way he was

193
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,680
rubbing his hands together. He ended up publishing a best-selling autobiography

194
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,600
about his annoying family. The men of my family taught me an important lesson. If

195
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,840
you want to achieve something great, you have to leave your family behind. And

196
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:52,040
that's just what I'm going to do. Leave home and become a famous superstar. I'm

197
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,680
either going to be a singer or a dancer, but I haven't decided yet. There's only

198
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:01,020
one problem. I don't have a family to leave in abject misery. The more children

199
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,380
that you abandon, the more famous you will be.

200
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:06,580
So, I set out to lay as many eggs as possible.

201
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,700
Inside this frog seems like as good a place to start as any.

202
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,180
I'm going to lay tens of thousands of slimy eggs

203
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,460
inside this stupid ass frog's organs,

204
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,020
or my name isn't Fly.

205
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,860
- That's right.

206
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,300
And there's one other disease in here.

207
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,820
- Yeah.

208
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:33,300
I'm seasonal affective disorder.

209
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,540
(laughter)

210
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,860
Yep.

211
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:39,860
Oh boy.

212
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,900
(laughter)

213
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,820
Yep, oh please boo me.

214
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,980
I love it.

215
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,320
The only thing that makes me happy is making people sad.

216
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:57,900
Yeah, people use me as an excuse to buy weighted blankets

217
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:03,740
and pad thai on Uber Eats and that just pisses me off.

218
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:09,960
My life is basically shit because I'm pissed the fuck off all the time.

219
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:16,340
And I make myself sick with a bunch of food and it just makes my shit worse.

220
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,620
Oh boy.

221
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:22,380
I'm such a piece of fucking crap.

222
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,980
Yep, I'm basically a shit sandwich made of shit.

223
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,100
And poop.

224
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,540
And the bread is seasoned with farts.

225
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,820
And instead of mayonnaise, it's jizz.

226
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,900
Yep, it's a sandwich made out of poop and jizz.

227
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,420
And that's my life.

228
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:49,100
Oh yeah, and the cum shot is from a fat bulldog.

229
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,540
The cum shot is from a fat bulldog named Craig.

230
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:57,100
Yeah, the bulldog is named Craig.

231
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,140
And he has a jizz problem too.

232
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,260
He has too much jizz that smells too.

233
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,580
And yeah, that's the mayonnaise on my shit sandwich of a life.

234
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,540
Oh yeah and guess what?

235
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,020
I have a cousin who just got diagnosed with cancer.

236
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Yep, my cousin is- has cancer in his brain.

237
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,020
Sorry if that pisses you off, I guess.

238
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,020
Yeah, guess what his name is.

239
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,020
It's Caleb.

240
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Caleb Affective Disorder.

241
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:40,020
I want Sullivan to stay home forever and eat chips until he eats his self to death.

242
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,020
Anyway, that's my shitty fucking life.

243
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,220
(audience laughing)

244
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,860
So, your job as the audience is to save Sullivan

245
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,100
while these three try to kill him.

246
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,580
We're gonna be traveling throughout his entire body,

247
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,700
starting with his mouth,

248
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,860
and then we're gonna go to his stomach,

249
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,800
we're gonna go a few other places, we'll get there.

250
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,060
There are gonna be certain moments

251
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,440
where I'm gonna yell for the nurse,

252
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,220
I'm gonna do something like, "Oh, nurse!"

253
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,740
- Yep. - Okay.

254
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,540
And he's gonna come out,

255
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,620
I'm gonna offer a couple of options.

256
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,160
you're gonna yell for which option you like.

257
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,980
He tested that audience thing earlier,

258
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,540
so I know that you guys got it.

259
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,220
And when that happens, there's gonna be some effects

260
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,960
to the enemies that these guys are fighting,

261
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,740
'cause it is Dungeons and Dragons.

262
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,920
They're gonna get buffed, maybe they'll get debuffed.

263
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,220
Don't worry about knowing what that is.

264
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,740
It means the enemies will get better,

265
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,840
the players will get worse.

266
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,000
With the goal of you guys killing them,

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,220
and each time they die,

268
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,360
before they finish killing the boss inside of each organ

269
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,000
is another point for you.

270
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,200
If you guys get three points of the five,

271
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,740
there's five organs total ever.

272
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:53,900
If you guys get three points, you guys win.

273
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,160
I have nothing for you.

274
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,860
It just feels good probably though.

275
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,260
And Sullivan lives and I've got a few different endings

276
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,320
for him, which is fun for me.

277
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,560
If you don't win and these guys win, Sullivan dies.

278
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,580
Sullivan's a sweetheart.

279
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,660
He doesn't deserve death.

280
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:14,540
deserves life wrong okay well you know there's juries out I guess I'm a jury's

281
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:19,900
out shut up can we just start got it okay you guys got it thank you let's get this

282
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,700
show on the road hmm so all right we're in the mouth okay you guys got that so

283
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:31,300
it's Sullivan's mouth it's in big you're in Sullivan's mouth you're all in

284
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:34,900
Sullivan's mouth I thought I was contracted through the penis you went up

285
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,900
to his mouth. That's how I have this written. Or maybe he used his mouth on the journal.

286
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:46,620
That's how he flushes it. He's got a frog tongue, he can just stick his tongue under

287
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:51,300
the handle. He was like, "Where are you?" and used his tongue and flushed it down and

288
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,180
then he got totoria on the mouth. Thank you. You're nestled in the crease of his tongue

289
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:02,820
actually right now. On either side of you are pink, sorry, sorry about that, slimy walls,

290
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,140
dotted with taste buds,

291
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,060
with these like microvilli that gently tickle the air,

292
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,740
right in front of you, thank you.

293
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,260
A bit ways away, you see saliva pooling up

294
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,100
in the crevices between his gums and the tip of his tongue.

295
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,060
Behind you is a long, slick, hollow shoot

296
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,860
that is Sullivan's esophagus,

297
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,900
the end of which is his stomach,

298
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,380
where he could start doing some real damage.

299
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,700
So, you guys are in the mouth, what do you guys wanna do?

300
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,420
- Yeah, I'm already like just farting out

301
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:30,980
clutches of eggs down his throat.

302
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,820
- Okay.

303
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,100
I'm using a giant straw to suck all his saliva up because I think it's jizz.

304
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,780
Okay the doctor's just like watching this happen like trying to trace what's going

305
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,980
on. They hear it. They hear the sucking noise. He's taking the what's that called

306
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,660
the stethoscope? Yeah. I studied a lot for this. He's putting it directly on

307
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,500
Sullivan's mouth. It sounds like like ground beef like rolling down a hill.

308
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,020
This sounds like ground beef rolling down a hill. He's taking notes on this and all

309
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,380
the other surgeons are all the other surgeons in the room are watching on.

310
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:11,060
Of course. Yeah you guys are doing that you guys see on the corner by Sullivan

311
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:18,900
some of Sullivan's teeth you see a piece of a popcorn kernel and it's like it

312
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,620
It starts to yell at you guys.

313
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,380
What's going on?

314
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:26,100
I've been here 50 years.

315
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,620
I'm never going away.

316
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,980
Who are you newcomers?

317
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,140
- Whoa, chill.

318
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,460
- Okay, sorry.

319
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,780
- Chill, dude, chill.

320
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,060
- Oh, does it sound like that?

321
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,220
It wasn't the, no.

322
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,740
- Have you ever seen the movie Hard Candy?

323
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,340
- No.

324
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:48,100
I mean, no.

325
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,860
Have you seen the movie Hard Candy?

326
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,380
I heard it's a bummer.

327
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,780
[laughter]

328
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,620
Okay, cool.

329
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,540
I get your deal now.

330
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,980
Um, yeah.

331
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,660
You guys want to go to Sullivan's stomach, you gotta go down the esophagus.

332
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,420
Oh, really?

333
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,860
Not everybody knows that!

334
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,340
Like you would fucking know, you're in his tooth!

335
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,780
Well, I like it here.

336
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,140
No you don't, how'd you--

337
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,700
You really like it here?

338
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,500
Well...

339
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,260
Roll persuasion on him.

340
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,980
What'd you get?

341
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,820
- I got a three.

342
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,140
(laughing)

343
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,300
- He's not gonna tell you what he actually feels about it.

344
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,740
He's like, "Yeah, I love it here!

345
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,420
"I actually really like being inside his tooth.

346
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,600
"I love bone marrow around me."

347
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,060
- I'm straight up chewing on him.

348
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,540
(laughing)

349
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,540
I'm gonna eat this fucker.

350
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,500
- Okay, roll your tackle attack on him.

351
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,540
It's 1D10.

352
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,380
- Just roll that?

353
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,200
- Oh, just the--

354
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,580
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's the one.

355
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,740
- That's seven. - The seven.

356
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,140
Okay, yeah, you're just gonna do damage to him.

357
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,380
Oh fuck you're eating me

358
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,900
For you

359
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,520
I should have known that was gonna happen

360
00:20:52,520 --> 00:21:01,140
Corn I would like to also my phone needlessly attack the popcorn. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. It's not that important

361
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,020
I'm gonna I mean was that the information that we go down his throat to get

362
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,440
But if you go too far you'll come out the butt that's the next thing he's gonna say right you should go he's dying

363
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,340
He's dying do I even have to attack him or you don't have to roll an attack. He's roll damage

364
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:23,060
Okay, we just drawn corner. Yeah, he's almost dead. I'll just tell you he has 10 HP

365
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:27,060
Yeah, hit it - and then but you have to add your strength, right?

366
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,460
You're the dungeon master

367
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,980
Okay, so five yeah, he's dead in the dirt. Yeah, how did you kill him? How did you kill him?

368
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:42,980

370
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:55,380
Thing to death yeah, and I'm evil, but he is dead that way exactly that way

371
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,900
Yeah, yeah after

372
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,620
I'm a fly. I'm just I'm clapping really slow

373
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,880
(laughing)

374
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,300
- Well done guys.

375
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,960
Well done, he had stuff to tell us,

376
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,460
but I guess we're just gonna eat him.

377
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,760
- All right, can we see his uvula?

378
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,600
- Solvents?

379
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,420
- Yeah.

380
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,260
- Very easily, yeah.

381
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,980
- Okay, I'm gonna use acid spit.

382
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,860
(laughing)

383
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,100
- We're still in the mouth, he's gonna throw us up.

384
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:26,940
- No, we'll dodge it.

385
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,780
- That's fine.

386
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,820
(laughing)

387
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,660
- Okay, you can try.

388
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,380
- We're gonna have to hold and dodge it, no.

389
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,220
- You are gonna have to hold and dodge.

390
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:35,220
I'm making a mental note that I'm gonna do that later.

391
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,220
Okay, if you find your way back to the mouth.

392
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,220
Okay, so what do you guys want to do?

393
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,220
You guys can just go down the esophagus.

394
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,220
I mean, that was, this was meant to be like a hub area kind of thing.

395
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,220
So...

396
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,220
A hub? There's only one place to go, right?

397
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:50,220
Yeah, but you'd come back. It doesn't matter. He's dead.

398
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,220
Just go down the esophagus.

399
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,220
Alright.

400
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,220
Sullivan's dead?

401
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
No.

402
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,220
We win!

403
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Yeah!

404
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
We win!

405
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,460
Okay, I will run into his mouth.

406
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,300
- All right, let's do it.

407
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,240
- You're in it, okay.

408
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,820
So yeah, you guys go down the esophagus.

409
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,500
You're the only one who can fly, right?

410
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,060
- Yeah, no, I can fly.

411
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,320
(laughing)

412
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,380
- How?

413
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,620
I'll give you 10 seconds to explain to me how you can fly.

414
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,460
- Wings.

415
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,700
(laughing)

416
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:28,020
I can see it, you can use the rest of my time

417
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:41,220
You can't fly. I can fly. But wait, Patrick, how can you fly? Wings. It's the

418
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:50,940
worst day of my life. Okay. Also, I can't fly. My wings are too wet. He can fly, but

419
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:55,180
not in here. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you can fly outside? Outside, yeah.

420
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,380
Okay, you need to really fly inside. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, so you're gonna take some fall damage and they won't is that yeah

421
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,220
Yeah, I'll take you know what I'll take that so okay

422
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:10,880
You guys slide down as a salvo you guys don't you slide down as a soft. Okay? I think I have the least HP

423
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,460
Yes, you do. He's cheating. Oh, this is

424
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:20,060
Happens awesome. Oh wow what does it say I need you guys all to applaud whenever he does that?

425
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:27,660
Every time here, so as loud as you can be six damage. That's half my

426
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:37,920
Yeah, okay my wings oh my god, I'm gracefully it's the one thing I like I look like Michael Wow

427
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,140
Mike Mike like John Angel

428
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,340
From the movie with John Travolta. I knew it. I knew it. I knew it immediately

429
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,140
Michael 1995

430
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,060
He's like he's like yeah, he's like an angel who smokes cigarettes and my mom hates it

431
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:59,380
He needs to get better as an angel he does I look like the bee from Bee Movie

432
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:07,360
Yeah, we know fly so as you yeah you guys land down the esophagus you splash

433
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,680
It's a sort of a caged off area of the stomach

434
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,360
There's a little bit of acid sort of trickling around you

435
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,780
and what looks like to be in front of you a loading dock of some kind you see a

436
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:22,580
a cell come out, in this case a parietal cell,

437
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,780
and it looks at you all.

438
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:24,620
- Excuse me?

439
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,440
- A what?

440
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
- A parietal cell.

441
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,120
- Bless you.

442
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,940
- What's that?

443
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:28,780
- It's a kind of a digestive cell.

444
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,620
- A cell.

445
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,440
- I knew what that was.

446
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,280
- It's a cell, right, yeah.

447
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,120
- Yeah, is that okay?

448
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:32,940
- You got it.

449
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,180
- I have not done, I did.

450
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,020
- Cell.

451
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:37,220
(laughing)

452
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,260
- Can I copy that later?

453
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,380
(laughing)

454
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,220
- I'll take a picture.

455
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,740
- Looks at you all and it says,

456
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:44,720
okay we got three,

457
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,020
you guys on food.

458
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,660
Well one of you is kind of food.

459
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,780
Hold on, let me get my manager.

460
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,820
I guess I'm kind of food.

461
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,300
And he kind of walks back and he walks back towards the dock.

462
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,060
Are you talking about me?

463
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,300
You guys are inside of this like sort of like little like caged off area.

464
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,380
And every... I start banging on the cage like a madman.

465
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,060
You guys take four damage of stomach acid.

466
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,820
All of us? Not well, you can you can't fly.

467
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,900
So really just you, right?

468
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,780
What's up?

469
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,820
So you guys don't don't worry about it.

470
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,820
All right, and I'm at 2 HP.

471
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,520
So I like this already.

472
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:29,420
So yeah, and as you guys look out you can see the vast town of

473
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,220
you're really you're going to take away all my fly jokes.

474
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,720
I have a thousand fly jokes.

475
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,920
You took away your own fly jokes.

476
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,320
You took all my way.

477
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
I let you take them away.

478
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:43,820
I have so many fly jokes written down.

479
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,420
So yeah, and you guys, you're in the stomach there

480
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,540
where it's a port town called Stomachville.

481
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,800
- Did you say pork town?

482
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,120
- A pork town called Stomachville,

483
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,560
where there are the four gland families that rule it.

484
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,500
The mucous family, the parietal family,

485
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,820
the chief family, the endocrine family.

486
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:05,440
And they're always vying for power,

487
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,860
warring over territories, crying a lot more

488
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,900
than I personally think a man should.

489
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,920
But they all have one thing in common,

490
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,920
which is they all defer to Don Gumbino

491
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,200
of the Gumbino crime family,

492
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,800
who's a stick of gum, piece of gum

493
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,200
that's been in Sullivan's stomach for,

494
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,160
I thought it was pretty good.

495
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,760
- I like that, it's a good one.

496
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,600
(laughing)

497
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,000
- That's 'cause he eats gum, he swallows every piece.

498
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,040
(laughing)

499
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,120
That makes sense.

500
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,400
- Yeah, the doctor can't even chew, just down the hatch.

501
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,240
- He's better than littering.

502
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,080
- He looks like he, it's a mint pill.

503
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:40,240
- Oh God, he swallows every piece of gum he's ever had.

504
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,240
I can tell with my gum meter.

505
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,240
He's able to tell.

506
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,240
Yeah.

507
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,240
One word.

508
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,240
Thank you, man.

509
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,880
I'm trying my best, which is not good enough.

510
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,960
And they all defer to Don Gambino of the Gambino crime family.

511
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,420
All these different families.

512
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,800
Right now, you guys are stuck in sort of this docking bay while they're waiting to assess

513
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,760
what kind of foodstuffs you are.

514
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,840
I'm going to tell you now, for your sake in particular, they are going to take some time

515
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,120
to do that.

516
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,840
So if you want to try to get out, I would try to help him get out before he dies, at the

517
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,840
very least.

518
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,720
I'm just gonna sit here and wait.

519
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,520
Guys, we gotta kill Sullivan, we're getting out of here.

520
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:23,720
Grab my penis.

521
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,720
Grab it.

522
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,640
All six hands, right on your penis.

523
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,640
I don't know, I'm more of a...

524
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,640
I don't know what I look like.

525
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,880
I don't fly you out, I just sit...

526
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,720
Nice, yeah.

527
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,880
I'm pulling you into the cage with me.

528
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
Nice, yeah.

529
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,160
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,240
All right, I fly you out.

531
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,080
So, well, hold on.

532
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,440
There's, I gotta--

533
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,480
- We are, we're out, yeah.

534
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,640
- No, no. - Yeah, we're out.

535
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,760
- We decided we're out.

536
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,720
- Roll a-- - We're at the heart now.

537
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,940
(laughing)

538
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,780
- The heart is coming.

539
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:54,800
Roll a strength check, just a straight strength check.

540
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,120
So I think for you-- - You should do it

541
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,960
with a pencil. - I love when he's,

542
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,840
I love when he says that and I pretend I know

543
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,680
what I'm supposed to do.

544
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,000
- You're doing this for so long.

545
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,560
What I did for like two years. - Doing the die.

546
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,880
- This one? - The one you always,

547
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,280
people paid money for this.

548
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,120
- Yep.

549
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,940
(laughing)

550
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,780
- Oh, oh.

551
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,620
- Oh, let's try it again.

552
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,440
- Boo him.

553
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,280
- Boo him.

554
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,120
- Boo him.

555
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,940
- No.

556
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:13,780
- It's a 15 down there.

557
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,620
- This is good, this is a good sort of--

558
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,440
- I'll take that.

559
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,280
- 15.

560
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,120
- 15, okay, yeah.

561
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,420
I mean, you can pretty easily carry him out.

562
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,760
You're pretty strong.

563
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,920
And so yeah, you're able to carry him out.

564
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,960
Are you gonna just vibe in the cage?

565
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,040
- I guess I'll go.

566
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,600
- Yeah, you don't have to.

567
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,960
- I didn't wanna go, but I guess I will.

568
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,560
(laughing)

569
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,280
- Can I say that by being carried out,

570
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,320
my wings have dried off from the rush of air

571
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,380
and I can fly again.

572
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,880
- You've taken enough damage, I'll let you do that.

573
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,720
I'm a nice guy.

574
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,480
- You guys don't have wings anymore though.

575
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,320
That's done.

576
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,440
- I was gonna say my wings, they shrunk.

577
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,440
- Your wings are done.

578
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,280
- I took mine off.

579
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,100
- Please.

580
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,440
- Okay, the wings are gone.

581
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
Whatever, the wings are gone, man.

582
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,840
It's fine.

583
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,120
- Okay, cool.

584
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,920
Yeah, so you guys are in this town.

585
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,840
You guys kinda got out.

586
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,600
I didn't know that two of you would be able to fly, so.

587
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,040
So you guys got out and you kinda can start

588
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,480
overhear conversations from members of the different members of the family

589
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,080
talking about what they're going to do about Gambino, he's gotten too powerful,

590
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,920
all these different things you know the this the town has like all these

591
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,640
different little shops with their own like kind of like they're kind of their

592
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,240
own storefronts for each of the members of the family so they seem to be looking

593
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,840
to overthrow Gambino so there's kind of a way there because he's clearly the boss

594
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,960
of this area but the manor the manor sits way in the back of the stomach by

595
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,960
by the pyloric sphincter.

596
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,440
- Woo!

597
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,260
- Oh hell no.

598
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,100
- Well done.

599
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,560
- You didn't have to clap.

600
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,440
- It's fine, but I need that more than you know.

601
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,280
- And what does the pyloric sphincter do?

602
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,040
- It's where the stuff goes out.

603
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,880
- Yeah.

604
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,720
- And so, which is where Gambino is.

605
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,560
He's sitting at the very end,

606
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,680
kind of holding himself back

607
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,680
from ever falling into the small intestine.

608
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,240
So getting there though,

609
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,880
there are gonna be people who are gonna be suspicious of you.

610
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,600
You are pretty obviously diseases.

611
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,600
I will say.

612
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,800
Sneaking.

613
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,120
He's a fly.

614
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Sneaking.

615
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,440
He could fly over to it.

616
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,480
Yeah, there's probably a bunch of

617
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
flies in his stomach.

618
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,920
He's like just the only alive one.

619
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,120
You're the only one that's alive.

620
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:14,760
Yeah, that's true.

621
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,260
I could also disguise myself as a

622
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,880
fly.

623
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,800
I'm just a concept.

624
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,320
Physically, what are what are you?

625
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,420
Yeah, give us a visual description

626
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,200
of yourself.

627
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Peter Griffin.

628
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:31,400
I look exactly like Peter Griffin.

629
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,720
You do look exactly like him.

630
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,000
- You sound like Droopy Dog.

631
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,880
- White shirt, green pants.

632
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:37,840
- I think that's good.

633
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,280
- Yeah, looks like Peter Griffin.

634
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:40,520
- Yeah, that works.

635
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,160
- So yeah, I mean, there's a few ways that you can,

636
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I mean, there's a few ways you can go.

637
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,000
Again, there's storefronts you can visit.

638
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,640
There's, obviously, you can try to sneak towards the manor.

639
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,280
- I go to FYE.

640
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,280
- There is an FYE, I decided now.

641
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,120
Okay.

642
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,920
And that is where, I guess I'll swap them for that.

643
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,840
I think that is funny.

644
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,680
That's where the parietal tomb will be.

645
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,120
- Is that too regional of a, do they have FYE here?

646
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,240
- I don't know what the fuck that means.

647
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,080
- You don't know FYE, dude?

648
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,920
- You don't know FYE's?

649
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,240
- It's only us.

650
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,240
- Bruh, bruh.

651
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,880
- Don't, you know I hate getting bruhed.

652
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,880
- Okay, I go to Spencer's Gifts then, how about that?

653
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,720
- For your entertainment.

654
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,400
- Everyone knows what Spencer's Gifts is.

655
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,400
- Yeah. - Yeah, all right.

656
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,160
- Yeah, you see a member of the family that looks so cool.

657
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,000
- I feel like FYE's not regional.

658
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,840
- It is.

659
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,760
- I think it is regional. - It's regional?

660
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,860
- It's regional, yeah.

661
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,600
- You guys are just dumb, you guys just don't know it.

662
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
(laughing)

663
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,400
- You guys thought it was called Fi.

664
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,880
(laughing)

665
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
- So yeah, do you guys wanna go to one of the store?

666
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,360
You can go to the Spencer's Gifts.

667
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,560
- I go to Spencer's Gifts.

668
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,080
- Oh my God, I'm gonna have a good time at Spencer's Gifts.

669
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,720
- I run straight to the back.

670
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,040
- Yeah.

671
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,800
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy buddy, where you going?

672
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,640
- I don't even know anymore.

673
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,600
- Okay, are you doing all right?

674
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,320
Is there anything I can do for you?

675
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,000
- I'm laying so many eggs in here.

676
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,560
I'm filling it to the ceiling.

677
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,240
Okay, can you control your friend at least if you're gonna be sad?

678
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,800
I walk past everybody into the back and like wave at you like, "Hey Geoff, how you doing? How are the kids?"

679
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
"Oh, they're doing alright."

680
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,800
"Wait a minute, I don't know who that is."

681
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,800
They slowly realize.

682
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
When you go to the back you do see like,

683
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,800
suits that belong to the members of the Parietal Gland crime family.

684
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,800
So you could, those would be your disguises.

685
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,800
I'm about to look sexy as hell.

686
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,800
So the problem is that I think I'm a giant ball of cells.

687
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,880
How would I suit?

688
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,880
Aren't we all?

689
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,560
They're all.

690
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,160
That was some Adam Savage ass shit.

691
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,800
He just said that's real shit.

692
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,320
In this crazy world we call life.

693
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,400
That's real shit.

694
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,320
There's nothing I can say, bro.

695
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,520
That's true.

696
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
That's facts.

697
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,560
OK, so we'll ignore.

698
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,680
We'll put on the suits.

699
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,800
Yeah, I put the suit on.

700
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,000
They're all form fitting.

701
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,280
So do you put the suits on or are you just.

702
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,440
I just put on the jacket.

703
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,040
Like a loose tie.

704
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,120
Yeah.

705
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Mmm

706
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,800
Yeah, I'm still I want to save money

707
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Okay, cool, I'm

708
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,160
Actually, this is something where you guys ran to the back and that guy is sort of like

709
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:19,000
Would watch you guys put on the suits it would try to figure out what's going on there. Well. I'm already in the suit

710
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,720
So I'll just be like yeah, I'm actually one of the crime guys now me too

711
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,360
Yep, so we're three crime guys, and you're just not gonna want to mess with us anymore roll deception, okay?

712
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:35,080
We play fast and loose here folks do we all roll deception or just him just him just him

713
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,860
19 no oh

714
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,160
Don't clap for him

715
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:48,360
Maybe do never happens. I always get zeros you do it's live. It's the energy. Oh my god alright

716
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:53,420
Yeah, that guy's just like oh you guys seem pretty tough now, but I think now that I think about it

717
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Especially this one look at him. Yeah, I mean he doesn't seem as tough, but yeah, I'm gonna kill you I

718
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,800
Actually believe him

719
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:10,000
Okay, yeah, I guess I guess go through go nice nice to see you guys in you know salute. You know what?

720
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,160
Yeah

721
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,760
That's how you sound

722
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:22,560
Alright, yeah, you get away with it. Okay, so now they're disguised. They're dressed up as the

723
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,760
as the parietal cells so you guys can start to make your way to Gambino's

724
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,120
Manor. As you're doing so, the doctor is starting to trace the traces of the

725
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:40,640
infection. Trace the traces. And he says, "Oh nurse Conrad Murray!"

726
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm here, I'm here!

727
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
[Cheering]

728
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
Sorry, this hospital is crazy.

729
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,640
They just let you go into any room and do whatever you want.

730
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,640
whatever you want.

731
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,900
(laughter)

732
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,140
- That's, okay.

733
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,340
(laughter)

734
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:01,900
Well, there's some gastrointestinal activity.

735
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,860
It's hard to-- - Oh shit!

736
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:04,140
- Yeah, that's right.

737
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:07,180
It's hard to tell if it's idiopathic or not.

738
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,380
- Of course, idiopathic.

739
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:09,940
- Mm-hmm.

740
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,180
I think we can either provide an H2 blocker,

741
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,220
though that might be overlong,

742
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:16,740
or we can start the antacid in case the blockers are overkill.

743
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,660
- The blockers are overkill.

744
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,700
- That's right.

745
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,340
No, I wrote that down too, don't worry.

746
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,700
- I just saw it in your notes.

747
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,200
- Okay.

748
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,640
So, to the audience, you can use the antacid,

749
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,640
and if you use that, it's sort of a milder,

750
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,880
you know, milder option.

751
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,580
Hi.

752
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,880
(audience laughing)

753
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,480
We didn't work this out that well.

754
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,680
Just put it in front of me.

755
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,520
- Yeah, just go in.

756
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,320
- Just put it in front. - Stand right in front, yeah.

757
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,840
- You don't need to see our ugly bugs.

758
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,880
- If you use that, there's a good chance

759
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,840
that something good will happen,

760
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,380
but there's not a great chance that

761
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:48,920
something great will happen.

762
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,960
If you use the H2 blocker, I'm gonna roll,

763
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,360
and something really good or good but kind of bad happens.

764
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,920
So, the antacid.

765
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,080
Am I saying that right?

766
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,480
Well, people don't want that.

767
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,320
- Whoa.

768
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,200
- The H2 blocker?

769
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Oh my God.

770
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,880
So it was the antacid, right?

771
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:20,880
They picked the antacid.

772
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:21,880
That's what I heard, yeah.

773
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:22,880
Up to you, nurse.

774
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,880
They picked the antacid.

775
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Okay, the antacid it was.

776
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
Okay.

777
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
He's impartial.

778
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,880
He's the one with the device.

779
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:28,880
I don't know what he's doing.

780
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:29,880
He's the impartial judge.

781
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:41,560
We tried to tell him that it's when they cheer loud, but he doesn't get it, so it's fine.

782
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,560
Okay, cool.

783
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
The antacid it is.

784
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,960
All right.

785
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,640
So enemies will have resistance to non-physical damage going forward.

786
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:53,240
So that means your assets spit, they're gonna have resistance against some of your moves.

787
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,520
They'll have resistance against...

788
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,960
I don't know about your moves.

789
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,640
I have to double check your sheet, but I think you have one or two moves where that will

790
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
be a problem.

791
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,640
No.

792
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,640
But it's not that big a deal.

793
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,640
So yeah.

794
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,280
So now you guys know to cheer for the opposite, I guess.

795
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,920
So now, you wanna approach the manor or what?

796
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:11,920
Yeah.

797
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,920
I'm approaching.

798
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
You're approaching?

799
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,920
Okay.

800
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,920
Yep.

801
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,360
I'm guessing we have shoulder pads on our suits and stuff, right?

802
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,080
So we're like, walking like...

803
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,280
I'm like flying, but I'm hovering like, just a few inches off the ground,

804
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,760
so I look like I'm the fly equivalent of 6'6".

805
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,200
I'm just like straight Charlie Brown, like I don't...

806
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:34,720
And I'm flying two of my wings, so we're going up to the thing...

807
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,000
Yeah, we're going up, we're walking up to the thing.

808
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Everyone has wings, they're all fucking flying.

809
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,200
You get to the manor, and...

810
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:48,400
Gumbino walks out and he is as advertised a big ball of gum and he looks over you all he says who

811
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,800
The fuck are you three?

812
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,440
What are you doing in my stomach?

813
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,200
Well Sullivan stomach, but you know, it's my this is in your stomach. I'm your

814
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,680
I'm your son

815
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:10,960
I'm his son and this is I'm fly

816
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:23,240
I'm gonna be honest I'm not really gonna let that work on tackle initiative

817
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,080
- Let's do it.

818
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:24,900
- Okay.

819
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:25,740
(laughter)

820
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,580
- Let's go.

821
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,080
Rolling initiative means we start the combo.

822
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
- I got a 15.

823
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,920
- Yo, natural 20.

824
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,120
- Oh my God.

825
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,680
- Oh!

826
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,520
- That's insane.

827
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,680
What are the odds of that?

828
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,520
- One at 20.

829
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,340
- Oh my God.

830
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,680
(laughter)

831
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,000
- I got a 17.

832
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,280
- All right, let's see how--

833
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,120
- Oh great.

834
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,840
I'm gonna last again.

835
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,720
(laughter)

836
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,240
- Gambino also got a natural 20.

837
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,080
What's your dex?

838
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,960
- Oh, yeah.

839
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,460
- 1000. - One.

840
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,080
- It's one, okay.

841
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,920
- No.

842
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,160
- No, you're reading that wrong.

843
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,000
- That's 12.

844
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,320
- That's 12, okay.

845
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,160
You are faster than him, actually.

846
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,120
He's slow as fuck. - Damn right I am.

847
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,960
- So you're gonna go first.

848
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:00,780
What'd you get?

849
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,720
- I got a 17.

850
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,560
- Oh, wow, okay.

851
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,760
Everyone got really high rolls.

852
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,920
Okay, you're up.

853
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,720
- Okay, I'd like to use my ability, seduce.

854
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,600
(laughing)

855
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,080
- I didn't think you'd use it in this context.

856
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,880
- Which I don't know what, well, I said I was his son.

857
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,520
I don't know what it is.

858
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:17,000
(laughing)

859
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,260
Oh, that makes no sense to use,

860
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,360
but I already said I'll use it.

861
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,640
- Okay.

862
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,720
- I'm gonna use it.

863
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:26,720
So, okay, there's a DC of 13.

864
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,680
You're gonna roll, I'm gonna roll against that.

865
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,600
You're gonna sexually approach this man.

866
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,720
Yeah.

867
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,280
What do you do and say?

868
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,840
- Like I said, I'm your son pretty much, so.

869
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:47,400
I'm gonna suck your penis in one second.

870
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,000
Let's go.

871
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,520
(laughter)

872
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,060
- I'm wearing a wizard outfit.

873
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,560
Okay.

874
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,040
- What do I roll?

875
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,400
- You don't roll shit.

876
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,760
- That's right, I just get to suck it, let's go.

877
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,280
- Check what his wisdom is.

878
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,880
What did you, oh your DC's 13?

879
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,120
Fuck, it worked.

880
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:11,000
(laughter)

881
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,200
This sucks.

882
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,840
Okay, all right.

883
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,100
(laughter)

884
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,340
(laughter)

885
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,900
- Okay, forgive me father.

886
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:23,740
- I didn't know what this did.

887
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:24,580
- I have sinned.

888
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,340
(laughter)

889
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,220
- You read seduce and you're like,

890
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,460
I have no clue what this could possibly do.

891
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,300
- I thought it was just like a name

892
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,220
for like a punch or something.

893
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,300
I didn't know, okay, I struck his dick, whatever.

894
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,260
Yeah, let's get it.

895
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,780
- Oh yeah, maybe it's like seduce, like Hadouken.

896
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:40,060
- Well I'm not really, I would like to say,

897
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,700
I'm not really his son, he's gum.

898
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:43,020
- Yeah.

899
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,220
- He's a ball of gum.

900
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,500
- You're basically gum.

901
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,740
I'm nothing like gum, I think I'm gonorrhea.

902
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,680
So he's turned on, we gotta move from the stomach

903
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,920
at some point, so he's turned on,

904
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,560
and he says, good God, okay,

905
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,320
I hit him in the back of the head.

906
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,000
- He's distracted, he's distracted.

907
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,600
- So he is right now like, oh, all right,

908
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,260
wanna be one of my gumas then, huh?

909
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,960
- Nope, I wanna be your son.

910
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,080
- This is extremely confusing.

911
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,480
I mean, he can't attack you.

912
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,560
He can attack the other people.

913
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,240
It is gonna be his turn.

914
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,200
I'm gonna give him a disadvantage

915
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,320
on trying to attack you guys though

916
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,440
'cause he's so turned on by his child.

917
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,960
- You're welcome.

918
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,920
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

919
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,360
- Wouldn't be this show

920
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,160
if we didn't do something like that.

921
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,440
Okay, that is pretty good.

922
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,480
Yeah, he's going after you, Fly.

923
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,040
- What the fuck?

924
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,200
Does he know I have two HP?

925
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,040
You didn't tell him.

926
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,080
- I didn't tell him. - I have two HP.

927
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,560
- Somebody tell him.

928
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,200
- Who's told?

929
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,000
- Oh, you take, 'cause you like misery.

930
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,840
You like sadness, anyway.

931
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,600
- All right, give it to me, how much damage am I taking?

932
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,440
- You're out.

933
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,260
- Yeah, I'm dead, okay.

934
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:54,960
- You're dead, your first character is dead.

935
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,200
(cheering)

936
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,960
- What attack is he using on me?

937
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,800
'Cause I'm gonna describe it to you.

938
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,120
- So he has hardened pieces of gum on him,

939
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:05,680
and he has sort of like a stringy bit,

940
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,160
he attaches to them, and he whomps on you.

941
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:09,620
- So it hits me, and I just like,

942
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,920
you know like the scene in Scanners when the head explodes?

943
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,120
like my whole bodies like that which is eggs discover your everything

944
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:21,320

Ugh, I take it out of my mouth and I point it at him and I just fire.

Okay, you can hit him with the gun.

978
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,620
We didn't give you a ranged attack with the gun for this reason.

979
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:44,620
You didn't bring any bullets?

980
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,100
There's no bullets in the gun?

981
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,100
No.

982
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,100
Yeah.

You forgot your bullets.

984
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,100
You forgot, you left them at home.

00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,100
Oh my god.

Alright, yeah, you got him. Okay, yeah, so we're back to the top of the order.

So you're out. He's not gonna attack you right now, so you can do what you want.

1007
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,900
I'm doing him a favor. I'll use my, um...

1008
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,900
My itchy stick.

1009
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:40,900
You're gonna use your itchy stick? Yeah.

1010
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,900
Yeah, go up to him. Go whack him with it.

1011
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,900
What do you mean up to him? His penis is in my mouth.

1012
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,900
I didn't say that was happening.

1013
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:50,900
I thought it was. I thought it was this whole time.

1014
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,900
Okay, I guess that's happening.

1015
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,900
You get advantage, just do it. Just roll the dice.

1016
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,180
It's how it's done. - This sucks, just roll it.

1017
00:45:58,180 --> 00:45:59,660
- Okay, so I-- - He's so quick.

1018
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,420
- What do I roll, this? - Just suck a guy's dick.

1019
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:02,660
- It's the same one every time.

1020
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,940
- 20. (laughing)

1021
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,920
What is going on tonight?

1022
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,200
19, 20, 20, that's all I've rolled.

1023
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,360
- All right. - And then one other one

1024
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,200
I forgot. - So.

1025
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,460
You're gonna roll damage for that,

1026
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:22,500
so you're gonna roll your itchy stick, one D8 twice.

1027
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,940
- Yeah. - Just a D8, no.

1028
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,980
- Yeah. - Just a D8.

1029
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,980
You got it right in the first one, yeah.

1030
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,300
That's a six.

1031
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,140
Wow.

1032
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,860
And that's another six.

1033
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,700
God damn.

1034
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,660
And you get to roll again for doubles like Monopoly.

1035
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,500
No.

1036
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,780
(laughing)

1037
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:38,340
All right, he's not looking good.

1038
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,180
Okay.

1039
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,000
I was like.

1040
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,540
You're right, his son is sucking his dick

1041
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:43,100
and there's a stick up his ass.

1042
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,500
He's not looking very good.

1043
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,780
He has disadvantage on his next attack

1044
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,780
because he did the itchy stick,

1045
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,340
so he's scratching his body all over.

1046
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:50,180
Okay.

1047
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,460
He's gonna try to attack you,

1048
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,380
'cause he still can't attack you

1049
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,860
'cause the dick's soaking. Fucking do it.

1050
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,460
So good, okay.

1051
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:56,420
Your joke's better.

1052
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,540
It's just you and me.

1053
00:46:57,540 --> 00:46:59,660
We had to kill him.

1054
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,660
I don't care.

1055
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,660
I'm running out of things to put in him.

1056
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,940
So what?

1057
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,660
Basically this is what happens in my life.

1058
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,620
All the time.

1059
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:11,460
God damn it.

1060
00:47:11,460 --> 00:47:12,300
Oh, what does it say?

1061
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,120
What does it say?

1062
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,620
(audience cheering)

1063
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,460
Well he got it.

1064
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:18,180
He got it, but it fell also.

1065
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,020
My hat, that's fine.

1066
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:20,260
No, your dice.

1067
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,100
Oh.

1068
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:21,940
Why did you assume something else fell?

1069
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,780
All right, he swings at you and he misses.

1070
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,900
He must be in a euphoric state.

1071
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:28,780
He's gonna try to swing at you one more time.

1072
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:30,380
What's your AC?

1073
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,220
- My AC is 12.

1074
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,340
- Oh, that does hit you.

1075
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,780
- Oh, I actually like that.

1076
00:47:35,780 --> 00:47:37,820
(laughing)

1077
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:39,340
- Okay, he does eight damage to you.

1078
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,460
- Oh, shit.

1079
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:41,300
- Yeah, uh-oh.

1080
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,140
- I gotta do math on paper.

1081
00:47:42,140 --> 00:47:43,700
- You have built the most unplayable

1082
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,260
Dungeons and Dragons character ever.

1083
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,260
(laughing)

1084
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,700
- What's 24 minus eight?

1085
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,540
- The card is up though, too.

1086
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:51,900
- 16, Pat, it's 16.

1087
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,740
- 16.

1088
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,580
(laughing)

1089
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:54,420
- Let's see, okay.

1090
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,240
- 16. - You got it, dude.

1091
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:56,420
All right, you're up, dude.

1092
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,260
- Me?

1093
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,080
- No.

1094
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:58,920
- Oh.

1095
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,020
- Did I say dude?

1096
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:00,860
- You did say dude.

1097
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,960
- All right, it's usually you.

1098
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,700
(laughing)

1099
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,900
- You're up. - I guess I...

1100
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,100
You only gave me-- - Just kill him.

1101
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:07,940
Just kill him.

1102
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,500
- You only gave me a gun.

1103
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,800
(laughing)

1104
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,220
- You have some other abilities.

1105
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,620
- Okay, hold on, let me check them.

1106
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:16,140
- The gun is probably your best ability in this case.

1107
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:16,980
- Do I?

1108
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,220
- You can use that-- - You only gave me a gun.

1109
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,460
(laughing)

1110
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,460
I have nothing else on here but gun.

1111
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:24,700
- I gave you three other abilities.

1112
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,020
That makes me sad.

1113
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:26,860
- Okay.

1114
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:27,680
- That makes me really sad,

1115
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,740
and that makes me really, really sad.

1116
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,620
And that second ability is your damage dealing.

1117
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:34,900
- You see a force ghost of the fly saying,

1118
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,620
"Use the gun."

1119
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,620
- Okay.

1120
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,220
So I throw the,

1121
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,700
I have to go find the gun.

1122
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:43,700
'Cause I threw it.

1123
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:47,340
- Okay, this is interesting because it's stuck to him.

1124
00:48:47,340 --> 00:48:48,160
- Okay.

1125
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,000
- He is gum.

1126
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,980
I have another thing he does,

1127
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,220
he'll probably kill him before he does it.

1128
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:55,380
but it is stuck to him, so you can try to run up to him,

1129
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,880
grab it, I'll make you do a strength check,

1130
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,920
and I'll also make you do, you'll do a dex contest first

1131
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,920
and then a strength test.

1132
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,260
- Okay, then I'll do that.

1133
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,420
- Okay, so roll a d20, and we're gonna just add your dex.

1134
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:13,100
- It's a two.

1135
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,860
- That's not gonna be good enough.

1136
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,500
He's able to sort of dodge out of the way

1137
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,900
with the gun inside of him.

1138
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,740
- I'm running out of moves here.

1139
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,560
- That's your action.

1140
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,900
- Yeah, I-- - That's that.

1141
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,300
- He only gave me a gun.

1142
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,220
- You're up.

1143
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,060
(laughing)

1144
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,860
Usually hitting him breaks the charm,

1145
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:27,380
but I guess I decided not to do it,

1146
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,560
so he's still not attacking you, so you can go again.

1147
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,400
You can hit him again.

1148
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,220
Not that you couldn't anyway.

1149
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,060
Don't be jealous about this.

1150
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,360
- I guess I'll use the itchy stick again.

1151
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,200
- Yeah, go for it.

1152
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,020
- Yeah, okay.

1153
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:38,860
- Can I have another gun?

1154
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,660
(laughing)

1155
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,540
- Four.

1156
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:42,380
- That does not help.

1157
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:43,300
- This guy's gonna kill us, man.

1158
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,460
- Yeah, he's probably gonna kill you.

1159
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,980
- Oh my God.

1160
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,820
- Pat.

1161
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:50,100
He attacks you again.

1162
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:56,400
that's gonna hit you no it's not you can't say that anymore all right it

1163
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,580
does another 10 damage to you you're up again

1164
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:06,720
combat's the best part of D&D I'm up again yeah you're up again I guess uh you

1165
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,100
can summon your counselor Martin to help you yeah I'm gonna do that right now

1166
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:14,020
okay yeah so you summon Martin your counselor he'll talk you through your

1167
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,380
feelings offer guidance insight he's Martin's invisible to everyone but you

1168
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:23,380
Um, if an enemy tries to enter within 15 feet of you during your conversation with Martin,

1169
00:50:23,380 --> 00:50:25,380
they'll start crying and take 1d8 damage.

1170
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:25,880
Okay.

1171
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:29,380
So he is within 15 feet of you, so Martin's gonna show up, he says,

1172
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,380
"Hey, Sad, how's it going?"

1173
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,380
"Bleugh."

1174
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:35,380
"That's how I cry. Bleugh."

1175
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:37,380
"I know, I know, you cry that way."

1176
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,380
"Basically I'm a piece of shit and I only brought one gun to this."

1177
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:48,620
Well, Martin, we talked about you starting to write things down a little bit more often.

1178
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:53,420
Mmm, what? You think pen and paper's gonna kill this guy? Mmm?

1179
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,100
No, so you can remember things.

1180
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:58,700
And so anyway, this goes on, and then he takes a d8 damage, he starts crying, he's like,

1181
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,180
"It's so sad! This guy! He just can't get his fucking shit together!"

1182
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,060
Shit, you do 8 damage to him. Okay!

1183
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,660
I'd say one more hit, he's dead at this point. Good God. Okay.

1184
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,780
Is it his turn or mine?

1185
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:11,340
You're up.

1186
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,380
[Gasp]

1187
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:14,380
I would like to...

1188
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,380
You... what?

1189
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,380
I'd like to bite his penis.

1190
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,380
(laughter)

1191
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:22,380
(laughter)

1192
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:24,380
It's not a move I have here, but...

1193
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:26,380
But it does make a little bit of sense.

1194
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,380
It makes a lot of sense. I've been doing other attacks

1195
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,380
with his dick in my mouth. I guess it's...

1196
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:32,380
I guess it's...

1197
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,380
An unarmed strike with advantage.

1198
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:36,380
Thank you. Just say it. So roll two d20s.

1199
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:38,380
Come on. That's a six.

1200
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:40,380
You're telling me that this guy's been

1201
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:43,860
and all these other six and what and you're saying one bite to the penis

1202
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:45,180
will not kill him

1203
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:48,420
I'm not saying I'm saying it well they should kill him instantly

1204
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,260
no even thought of even me thinking that I should do it we should kill him no he's

1205
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:54,540
made of gum

1206
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:58,860
what I'm chewing his penis then you're doing his penis

1207
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:04,740
it does 1d for damage roll 1d for I love it's making you do you love that

1208
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,260
- Two.

1209
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,100
- This doesn't kill him.

1210
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:07,920
- God damn it dude.

1211
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,000
- Oh my penis!

1212
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,840
(laughing)

1213
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,160
- But, but, that does hurt.

1214
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,620
- It does hurt him and he is also breaking though

1215
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:15,940
out of his stupor.

1216
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,400
That was what broke him out of his charm.

1217
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,240
- Ah, okay.

1218
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,080
- So now he's mad I'm sucking his dick.

1219
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:20,900
- You're up.

1220
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:21,740
- Okay.

1221
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,580
(laughing)

1222
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,420
- Yeah, he's mad.

1223
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:26,940
- So, did, okay, the gun is still in him?

1224
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:27,780
- Yes.

1225
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,580
- And he's still sucking his thing?

1226
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:30,420
- I think so.

1227
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,240
- I'm chewing it now though.

1228
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:33,660
- Can you get the gun for me?

1229
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,500
- No.

1230
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,300
yeah but you're yeah I do that it's your turn now

1231
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:44,340
okay can I tell him to get the gun for me I mean yeah but that doesn't just you do

1232
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:51,300
something we I literally have to go just go home to do an unarmed strike I I take

1233
00:52:51,300 --> 00:53:00,780
off my white gloves and I roll attack roll okay it's d20 yes 11 plus your

1234
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:05,940
strength which I think is a minus yeah I'm gonna say we're running out of time

1235
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:12,080
guys okay so he kills him I think you lost this one oh running out of time you

1236
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:20,380
guys won fuck man the doctor is trying to save the stomach and he realizes the

1237
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:24,700
stomachs kind of a lost cause but he does think that there could be a potential

1238
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:33,780
replacement that could save Sullivan. So we have... NURSE! Sorry I should have said

1239
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:39,660
that before I... Thanks sorry no it's mostly my fault. We have two choices for

1240
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:49,740
a replacement stomach. We have the hungry hamster and then we have the Jewish

1241
00:53:49,740 --> 00:54:07,340
woman's stomach. Hungry hamster! A tri-state area Jewish woman's stomach!

1242
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,600
(cheering)

1243
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,760
- I really don't know what to write.

1244
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,100
Let me have a go.

1245
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,020
- Okay.

1246
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,180
- Oh yeah, you got a couple.

1247
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,180
I was gonna put it on.

1248
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,020
- Yeah, that's right.

1249
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:21,260
(laughing)

1250
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:27,140
- All right, Sullivan feels a sort of stirring in him.

1251
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,740
Thousands of years of history leading to this.

1252
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:31,980
(laughing)

1253
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,420
Why do I feel so guilty?

1254
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,260
Like I got a shit at the worst times

1255
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:45,940
And that's what's happening and speaking of which no

1256
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:51,260
All right, you guys are gonna travel to the lungs now. Well. We're gonna be reborn in the lungs

1257
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:56,920
You're reborn as a lungs as your new characters. Yes, okay, your new characters. Oh, I'm good. We're all getting reborn yes, okay

1258
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:02,180
You already died fool. Yeah, well. I mean, but you guys didn't so I'm considering you dead. We faded out. Yeah

1259
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:06,140
Yup, I'm a caterpillar

1260
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:15,480
You will not believe how many legs I have or how many eggs I lay or how beautiful my adult butterfly form will be

1261
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:22,220
Yep, I'm a child, but I lay eggs. I'm going to have about a thousand children before I grow up like a Mormon

1262
00:55:22,220 --> 00:55:26,120
You know, I love Mormon jokes, dude

1263
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:34,180
What's up? My name is hop a titus see I'm what happens when a frog gets a tiny piece of poop in his mouth

1264
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:41,220
But Sullivan's different. He's a little bit different. I won't get into it, but our hero gorged on a Thanksgiving size helping of doo-doo

1265
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,900
Anyway, I'm gonna kill him. Okay

1266
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:51,340
I'm chronic fatigue, and I'm so tired all of a sudden oh

1267
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:58,060
Dear all this bullshit in my life made me so tired

1268
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:06,940
Oh does anyone have an Adderall for me? Does anybody have an Adderall? Does

1269
00:56:06,940 --> 00:56:18,140
anybody have Adderall? So I can stay up and be a piece of shit? Oh geez. Okay. I'm

1270
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:27,580
gonna kill Sullivan with sleep. So we're in the lungs. Yes. We are on top of the

1271
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:30,700
The Bronchi Mountains.

1272
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,700
That's right.

1273
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,660
The Bronchi are, they bring the air to the lungs.

1274
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:35,660
Right.

1275
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:37,820
There's a couple temples on there where the alveolus.

1276
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:42,300
Listen, Patches, this sounds really cool, but I'm going to stop because you actually

1277
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:43,300
gave me an ability.

1278
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:44,300
Oh no, fuck.

1279
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,020
It's called Burrow Level 2.

1280
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,860
And let me just read this out to you guys.

1281
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:54,060
Once per live show, the fly can burrow so deep into Sullivan that they can free travel to

1282
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,940
any organ they wish in his body.

1283
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:04,140
So I think that we're going to skip the boring lung shit and I would like to go to his wiener.

1284
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,140
Immediately.

1285
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,140
Now.

1286
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:07,980
That's fine.

1287
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:10,700
If you do that though, you sacrifice the win here.

1288
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,380
I don't give a fuck.

1289
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,860
I want to see his wiener.

1290
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:16,580
His lung succumbs to asbestos.

1291
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,340
I had a whole thing where there were two different kinds of monk clans and they had like sort

1292
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:21,340
of a-

1293
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:22,340
Yeah, I definitely want to do the wiener.

1294
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:23,340
Crystals.

1295
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:24,340
Okay.

1296
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,100
I love that the crystals for asbestos, there's like a tiger eye crystal.

1297
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:30,980
I don't want to hear it, you may as well double gun for 30 minutes.

1298
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:32,980
Yep, yep, that's true.

1299
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,980
Oh nice!

1300
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:39,620
Sorry, the cadence of this is very weird, yeah.

1301
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:42,580
There's a guy, there's a patient with like melanoma in there.

1302
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:44,580
He looks crazy.

1303
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,580
(laughter)

1304
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:48,580
Yeah, he'll be fine.

1305
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,860
Okay, lungs time.

1306
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:57,460
Alright, they won they won they saved his lungs for running out of time so we have two choices

1307
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:01,700
Used bagpipes

1308
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:07,060
Or gills which our artist Joey I love him very much

1309
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:13,220
He said I don't know how I'm gonna do gills so I think two fish kissing would be kind of dope so

1310
00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:18,540
That sounds about like that sounds like Joey yeah, so

1311
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:24,180
Used bagpipes, that's what I thought the kills

1312
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:29,980
Your call

1313
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:34,940
Okay, all right wow you guys did a really good job with this thanks nurse

1314
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,500
Okay

1315
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,500
So hot oh

1316
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:46,160
God doctor immediately realizes that he only has gills available and no spells despite being a wizard

1317
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:48,900
- It's a family name.

1318
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,380
- Yeah, it is.

1319
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:51,220
Mother's side.

1320
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:55,220
And he's picked up and dunked into a fish tank,

1321
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:56,500
Sullivan that is.

1322
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,980
And Sullivan is sort of woken up with a start for a second

1323
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:00,380
and then they use the,

1324
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,660
the anesthesiologist uses a hammer,

1325
00:59:01,660 --> 00:59:03,020
knocks him out, he's knocked out again.

1326
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:05,220
So, now we're in the penis.

1327
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,820
I guess we're going to the penis.

1328
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:12,500
So yeah, you probably would have been traveling--

1329
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:13,700
- Billions of eggs.

1330
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:15,740
- Right, through the kidney,

1331
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,780
down the ureters into the bladder.

1332
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:19,060
It's very dark where you are.

1333
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:19,900
You're waiting in urine.

1334
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,700
There's a prevailing smell and slight,

1335
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,740
there's no world here.

1336
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,220
It's just a penis.

1337
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,340
- Just a real penis?

1338
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:26,460
- It's just a real penis.

1339
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:27,700
- Okay, take a bite.

1340
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,140
- Yep.

1341
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,380
- It hurts Sullivan.

1342
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,580
- I'd like to join him in that.

1343
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,780
- What sound does he make when he bites him?

1344
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,220
(meows)

1345
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:36,820
- He meows?

1346
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,220
- No, he's like (meows)

1347
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:40,060
- He meows.

1348
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:40,880
- No, he doesn't meow.

1349
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,020
- It sounds like a passionate kind of noise.

1350
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:45,140
- Wait, he likes it?

1351
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:45,980
- No, he doesn't.

1352
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,820
- It sounds very gentle.

1353
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,060
- We'll roll to see if he likes it.

1354
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,220
- A wiener bite.

1355
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,620
- More than 10, he likes it.

1356
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,000
Shit, I got a 10.

1357
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,220
Less, oh, so then he doesn't like it, huh?

1358
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,660
(laughing)

1359
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:58,860
- I had to think about it, but I got what I wanted.

1360
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,580
- All right, fine, I keep biting his penis then, whatever.

1361
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,480
- Okay, yeah.

1362
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,060
Yeah, this one is literally was meant to be like,

1363
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:07,300
you guys just kinda win this one.

1364
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:08,140
- Yo! - Yeah!

1365
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,180
- This is gonna work.

1366
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:12,820
- That's right!

1367
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:15,260
- Yeah, I wrote all this text.

1368
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,660
- It's just useless now.

1369
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,420
(laughing)

1370
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,460
- Bitch. - We don't need the nurse

1371
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:21,860
for this one, we can just sort of rip this off, I think.

1372
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:22,700
There's his penis.

1373
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,020
(laughing)

1374
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,660
- Is it disgusting?

1375
01:00:26,660 --> 01:00:28,140
- Oh, show the world. - You guys not see his penis?

1376
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:28,980
Oh yeah.

1377
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,300
He's very embarrassed.

1378
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,300
- Why'd you give me this?

1379
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,740
- Okay, that's fine, yeah.

1380
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:38,940
- Cover that thing up.

1381
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,700
- I know I need to. - It's been staring at me.

1382
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,500
(laughing)

1383
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:49,780
So yeah, you guys are now going to ride the Millard-Fillmore Tunnel.

1384
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:51,140
So a lot of people don't know this actually.

1385
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,100
You guys move out of the way for a second.

1386
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:54,100
Oh, okay.

1387
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,100
Oh, okay.

1388
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,100
Just a little second.

1389
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,100
Okay.

1390
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:58,100
What?

1391
01:00:58,100 --> 01:00:59,100
Can you slide show?

1392
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:07,420
Okay, so a lot of people don't know this about the Millard-Fillmore Tunnel.

1393
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:10,400
So there he is, right, Millard-Fillmore Highway.

1394
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,400
So Miller-Fillmore Highway was discovered in 1924.

1395
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,760
His last name's Highway?

1396
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,760
Yes.

1397
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,040
Researchers at Tapioca University.

1398
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,880
Research team led by Dr. P. Waters Simpson.

1399
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,480
It was the Roaring Twenties, right?

1400
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,280
So they were actually trying to make a chemical that could destroy jazz.

1401
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,340
Jazz was invented by a precursor to the INR, themselves a precursor to the CIA.

1402
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:31,560
But things got out of hand, black people started doing it, so the CIA got nervous.

1403
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:33,800
Anyway, they discovered the tunnel instead.

1404
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:36,040
Here is actually him when he was younger, and here's him now.

1405
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,040
Isn't that amazing?

1406
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:40,960
And so you can see there that rainbow sort of tunnel there, that's the tunnel.

1407
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,680
Okay, we get a little bit closer we can see the rainbow connection there.

1408
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,760
Here's the oldest corpse, Ootsie, I believe Jack you helped me correct me on that earlier.

1409
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:53,400
And so there's actually, you can see here in Tootin' Common he's got the tunnel there,

1410
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:54,920
there's the mummy from Fortnite.

1411
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,760
The David not in the front but on the back, the Vitruvian man on the back.

1412
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,880
Some celebrities now have the tunnel, they've been sporting it around.

1413
01:02:01,880 --> 01:02:03,680
Some of them get them removed, Timmy.

1414
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:10,680
Okay, Betty White, RIP, Board Ape has one, Kevin Hart doesn't, Seth Rogen, there it is.

1415
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:13,680
Okay, a few of these.

1416
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:24,680
[Laughter]

1417
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:27,680
We have the Neversoft.

1418
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,680
This is cool, this is all the Neversoft intros.

1419
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,680
You guys ever play the Tony Hawk games?

1420
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:33,940
(laughter)

1421
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:42,240
Oh, we don't have to watch, I'm sorry, okay.

1422
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:43,200
All right, yeah, so I just wanted to,

1423
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:44,800
so you guys ride that tunnel.

1424
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:45,720
Come on, get back, get back.

1425
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,120
- Oh, okay, yeah, yeah, sure.

1426
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:53,040
- So you guys ride that tunnel up to Sullivan's brain.

1427
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,040
We're gonna just fucking skip the heart.

1428
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:57,880
We don't have time.

1429
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:03,480
So Sullivan's brain is composed of his id, his ego, and his super ego.

1430
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:08,000
You're going to have to go past each one to fight the final boss.

1431
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Okay?

1432
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
It's going to be easy.

1433
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,300
Has anything happened to the heart?

1434
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:14,720
It was a game show.

1435
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:15,720
It was kind of fun.

1436
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,400
You shouldn't have said that.

1437
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:18,400
I'm sorry everyone.

1438
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,400
It wasn't a game show, he's lying.

1439
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:22,800
It sucked.

1440
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,320
It was a lame show.

1441
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,160
It was a lame show.

1442
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:28,000
Thank you.

1443
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:28,820
- That was fire, Pat.

1444
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:29,660
- Uh-huh.

1445
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,500
- Holy shit.

1446
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:31,320
- No applause for that?

1447
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:33,560
All right, I guess you guys want me to die.

1448
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,080
- That's good, you're in character still.

1449
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,120
- Yeah, that's a character.

1450
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,120
(laughing)

1451
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:37,960
- All right.

1452
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:38,780
- It's a character choice.

1453
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,680
So, Sullivan's id is just,

1454
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:43,200
Sullivan as a little kid,

1455
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:45,100
a little propeller hat and a lollipop.

1456
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:48,040
He's just enjoying everything.

1457
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:49,080
He's just so happy.

1458
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,560
- Everybody's being really nice.

1459
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:53,800
I love that everybody's nice.

1460
01:03:53,800 --> 01:03:54,840
- Eggs on his face.

1461
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:56,840
*laughter*

1462
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,340
*inhales*

1463
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:00,340
He's like, "Oh! Oh no!"

1464
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:02,340
"That's not how you're gonna get-" "More, more, more."

1465
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:04,340
"That's not how you're gonna get-" *laughter*

1466
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:06,340
"That's not how you're gonna get past this at all!"

1467
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:08,340
"One billion!"

1468
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:10,340
He's like a little kid. "Sullivan, yeah."

1469
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,340
"Can I sit this flight out?" *laughter*

1470
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,340
*laughter*

1471
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:16,340
*laughter*

1472
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,340
You don't have to interact with him in any way you don't want to.

1473
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,340
Okay.

1474
01:04:20,340 --> 01:04:22,340
I just never- *laughter*

1475
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:24,340
*laughter*

1476
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:33,520
he just says oh wow three new friends Santa is not real what tooth fairy is

1481
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:15,100
looking at a giant terminal filled with all gizmos and widgets and buttons and

1482
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,660
all these different things and he's looking over it and he doesn't know what

1483
01:05:17,660 --> 01:05:22,780
to do this Sullivan's perpetual state of being like I don't know there's a lot of

1484
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:26,260
stuff going on why did somebody put me in charge of all this and he's running

1485
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:30,980
around back and forth trying to figure out what to do and he looks to you three

1486
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:36,940
and he says can you guys help me please there is there a can I can I roll

1487
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:40,580
perception real quick yeah go for it what are you trying to what are you in

1488
01:05:40,580 --> 01:05:45,980
particular you trying to notice well I can't notice shit I got a six okay well

1489
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,260
- Well, whatever you're trying to notice, you can press--

1490
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,780
- I was looking for like a big red button.

1491
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,500
- You don't notice any big red buttons.

1492
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,860
- Okay. - No.

1493
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,700
What do you guys wanna do?

1494
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,700
There's a few options you can start to go down here.

1495
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,500
- Or a big switch.

1496
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,740
- Okay, I'm gonna look for a big switch.

1497
01:05:59,740 --> 01:06:00,860
- Okay.

1498
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:01,780
- Okay, let's see here.

1499
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:02,900
All right, that's a two.

1500
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:04,140
- Okay, yeah.

1501
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,420
- So is there a switch?

1502
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:06,260
- No.

1503
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,100
- Okay.

1504
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,660
- No, the buttons look even more confusing

1505
01:06:08,660 --> 01:06:09,500
than they already did.

1506
01:06:09,500 --> 01:06:11,300
- I'm gonna go for a lever.

1507
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,380
I'm gonna go for a lever.

1508
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:13,300
I'm gonna see-- - Is that where it's

1509
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,340
gonna run down the--

1510
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,340
Maybe there's a lever somewhere in the room.

1511
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:18,340
I don't think that's the issue.

1512
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,340
I got a two, so...

1513
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:22,340
I'm gonna roll for a racing wheel.

1514
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:24,340
I wanna see if there's a steering wheel.

1515
01:06:24,340 --> 01:06:27,340
I'm gonna roll for an outlet, maybe, that has a power strip plugged in.

1516
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,340
Can you guys keep rolling?

1517
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:31,340
I'm gonna see if there's a solo cup with a string attached to it.

1518
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:33,340
Yeah, can you roll that too?

1519
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,340
I'm gonna see if I can get some help. Fourteen!

1520
01:06:35,340 --> 01:06:37,340
That's pretty good. I'm gonna roll also, though.

1521
01:06:37,340 --> 01:06:39,340
I got a twelve.

1522
01:06:39,340 --> 01:06:41,340
So...

1523
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,340
I just wanted to roll I started

1524
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:46,860
Okay

1525
01:06:46,860 --> 01:06:51,560
Perception check you can kind of tell that part of what Sullivan needs is just some confidence

1526
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:54,960
Okay, some way you guys can like hey

1527
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,020
You should try looking for a lever or a wheel or a button or a switch roll persuasion

1528
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:04,780
That's it

1529
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:06,820
Nine

1530
01:07:06,820 --> 01:07:12,700
It's a nine. Oh, I don't know those all sound really complicated to find plus four, baby

1531
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:20,720
It's pretty good, but I don't know still maybe the DC is a little higher in the brain. You're perfect to lay eggs on

1532
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:28,600
Yeah, my it told me that earlier let me roll for it you can roll for that

1533
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:34,020
What are you trying to persuade him that he's good? Yeah? Oh, that's at 18 Wow yeah, I get that makes him feel pretty good

1534
01:07:34,780 --> 01:07:42,260
That's kind of nice none of this matters anyway. We're all gonna fucking die. I wish I had eggs so I could lay them on you

1535
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:44,540
well

1536
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,540
Just is there a way to

1537
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:49,140
Do you as any of you guys know how to work?

1538
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:52,740
Work this terminal at all. I'm pressing random buttons

1539
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:58,220
Yes, oh all of your role role deception

1540
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:02,260
20

1541
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,900
Sullivan sort of looks to you

1542
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:10,300
Juicing hard tonight. Totaria or hop hop hop a Titus a hop a Titus. I bet I is he goes down

1543
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:15,420
He goes see you said you seem to really know what you're doing. What do you think?

1544
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:20,060
What do you think I should do when you're just pulling all the shit, and I think you should help me pull all this

1545
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:23,180
He starts helping you along with it

1546
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:27,500
and you can start to see that the gears are turning and things are just click and clack and start to work and

1547
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:32,100
You see it opens up a door and he says wow. Thank you guys

1548
01:08:32,660 --> 01:08:34,900
It's the first time I've ever felt like I could do anything.

1549
01:08:34,900 --> 01:08:36,500
I mean, I still needed help and stuff.

1550
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,500
I spit in his mouth.

1551
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,500
Alright, okay.

1552
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:39,500
That's about it.

1553
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:40,500
Okay.

1554
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:41,500
We already won.

1555
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:42,500
Just shut up.

1556
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,500
Okay, yeah, that's fair.

1557
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:44,500
No, I understand.

1558
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,500
I do the worm out.

1559
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:53,220
You guys go out and you end up with Sullivan's super ego.

1560
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:54,620
He believes in the good of all people.

1561
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:58,700
He believes that kindness and naivete are good things.

1562
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,540
He wants to give the world light and graciousness.

1563
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,660
sees float he's floating

1564
01:09:02,660 --> 01:09:05,840
he says uh... there's no challenges here

1565
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:11,140
one eight a hundred miles per hour

1566
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,960
roll the tack roll

1567
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:15,500
just straight at your decks

1568
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:20,140
uh... fourteen

1569
01:09:20,140 --> 01:09:22,260
yeah roll a d6

1570
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:24,700
for damage and add your decks

1571
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,260
uh... six yeah

1572
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:28,420
he's just floating around

1573
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,660
(laughing)

1574
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:38,700
- From behind, Sullivan's super ego rages his soul.

1575
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:42,720
It's massive, it's Kaiju-sized motherfucker.

1576
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,280
I need you all to roll initiative.

1577
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,880
This is your last fight. - Nope.

1578
01:09:45,880 --> 01:09:48,480
- I got a 19.

1579
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:49,560
- Ooh, I got a 13.

1580
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,320
- I got a 10.

1581
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:52,320
- I got a 10.

1582
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,160
- Sullivan's soul--

1583
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,360
- Oh wait, no, I got a 14.

1584
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:56,600
- Sullivan's soul sucks.

1585
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,960
Okay, so we got a six.

1586
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:00,240
- Okay, who got a 19?

1587
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:01,080
- Me.

1588
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:01,900
- You up?

1589
01:10:01,900 --> 01:10:04,600
- All right.

1590
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:08,640
- If you don't use the gun, I'm gonna kick you off stage.

1591
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:09,840
- You have other moves.

1592
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:10,680
- Yeah, I have other moves.

1593
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,500
- You should not be reading at all.

1594
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,600
You should be saying the word gun out loud.

1595
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:14,600
(laughing)

1596
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:15,920
- Well, okay, okay.

1597
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,040
- Close your eyes.

1598
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,440
- Can negate the, okay, okay, that makes me really,

1599
01:10:19,440 --> 01:10:20,280
really sad. - Patrick, close your eyes.

1600
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,100
It's the best for your reaction.

1601
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:21,940
You're really, really sad.

1602
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:23,800
- Close your, literally close your eyes right now.

1603
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:26,200
- Okay, I pull out the gun and I throw it.

1604
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,040
- Yeah.

1605
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:30,040
- I wind up, I wind up like fucking--

1606
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,120
- It's crazy, this was a melee attack.

1607
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:32,960
- Huh?

1608
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,680
- Nothing, just keep going.

1609
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,080
- How big is the gun?

1610
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,320
- It's regular sized.

1611
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,160
- Okay, then I swing it.

1612
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,560
- Yeah, like six or seven feet long.

1613
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:43,680
- Yeah, I swing it like a bat.

1614
01:10:43,680 --> 01:10:44,640
- You do?

1615
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:45,480
- I guess.

1616
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:46,800
- You swing it at Sullivan's soul,

1617
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,840
it's this big black inky thing,

1618
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:50,040
it's like (growls)

1619
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,240
and roll an attack roll.

1620
01:10:51,240 --> 01:10:54,880
- So nine.

1621
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,120
Okay, yeah, that does not hit Sullivan's soul.

1622
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,400
It sort of just phases through it in a weird, queer way.

1623
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,240
You're up.

1624
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:02,060
Don't do that.

1625
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:05,680
I say queer like that, I don't know why I do.

1626
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:06,640
I don't know what books I read.

1627
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:07,680
He's a wizard.

1628
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:08,520
Yeah, thank you.

1629
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,760
(laughing)

1630
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:14,040
Interesting choice.

1631
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:14,880
Good God.

1632
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,600
All right, you're up.

1633
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:19,200
I'm gonna use my love tendrils.

1634
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:20,040
Oh, okay.

1635
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:22,760
So this move, this move's pretty intense.

1636
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:27,760
So, out of your body spews your nastiness, for real.

1637
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:33,000
And these tendrils will just attack anything within range

1638
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,520
and do a huge amount of damage.

1639
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,320
You're susceptible, obviously, if Sullivan Soul dodges it.

1640
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:43,180
So, he's going to have to roll a Dexterity saving throw,

1641
01:11:43,180 --> 01:11:46,120
which your DC for that is, I gave you 15 for that,

1642
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,060
that was stupid.

1643
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:49,120
Okay, I should've just actually calculated it

1644
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:50,360
and would've been lower.

1645
01:11:50,360 --> 01:11:52,600
(mumbling)

1646
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:53,440
(laughing)

1647
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:56,000
- Okay, he is able to dodge it initially.

1648
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,460
But your tendrils are flying out of you.

1649
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,780
He's gonna have to try to, you know,

1650
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:02,500
not get hit by it next time too.

1651
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:03,820
You are up.

1652
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:04,760
- Okay. - Fly.

1653
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,780
- Can I like try to-- - He's a caterpillar now.

1654
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,580
- Caterpillar, I'm so sorry dude.

1655
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,560
- I'm basically a fly.

1656
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:11,000
I'm a butterfly now.

1657
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,940
- I transform while you guys all hang around.

1658
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:15,480
- Whoa! - And I am sexy.

1659
01:12:15,480 --> 01:12:16,320
- Yeah!

1660
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,340
- That's right dude!

1661
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:20,200
- Describe the pattern on your wings.

1662
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:28,160
red. Okay, I'm going to it. Can I can I try to just like corrupt his soul with

1663
01:12:28,160 --> 01:12:32,280
evil thoughts? Oh my God, that was my plan and you guys told me to use the

1664
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:38,960
gun. That's true. Yeah, so I do it for that. Yeah, I mean, let's figure out how

1665
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:47,680
that would work. Okay, I do acid spit. All right, six. Okay, that's not gonna

1666
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,520
- Yeah.

1667
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:49,360
- Just phases right through him.

1668
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,200
- It's butterfly acid, so it's not very good.

1669
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,860
- It's worse than fly acid.

1670
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:54,700
- Yeah.

1671
01:12:54,700 --> 01:12:56,960
- I mean, Sullivan's soul tries to like,

1672
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:58,500
do a massive swipe at you all,

1673
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,300
and you all were able to dodge it out of the way.

1674
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:04,160
So we're gonna go back to the top of the order.

1675
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:05,000
- We're gonna beat you.

1676
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,340
- Back to the top of the order.

1677
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:07,640
- We're gonna get the prize at the end.

1678
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,480
- That's right.

1679
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:10,740
- Alright, so it's his soul.

1680
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:13,240
Maybe I try this one more time.

1681
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:14,920
(laughing)

1682
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:16,420
- Santa's not real.

1683
01:13:16,420 --> 01:13:34,420
Roll persuasion. Actually sorry roll deception. 18. Oh shit. Yep my mom told me

1684
01:13:34,420 --> 01:13:41,700
when I was one. Maybe your mom is wrong. I grew up 18 so I don't believe in

1685
01:13:41,700 --> 01:13:47,540
anything fun. Oh no. Oh okay. Maybe. Maybe.

1686
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:50,580
Santa's not real. Please stop. Please stop saying that.

1687
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:53,620
Peter Pan's not real.

1688
01:13:53,620 --> 01:14:03,220
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, not real. Robin Williams, not real.

1689
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:08,660
Okay. Peter Cetera, not real. You're gonna have advantage on attacks against him. I'm

1690
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,660
I'm gonna let that happen. That's pretty fun.

1691
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:12,660
Okay, then I do I still have an attack roll or?

1692
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:13,660
No, that was your action.

1693
01:14:13,660 --> 01:14:14,660
Oh shit, okay.

1694
01:14:14,660 --> 01:14:16,660
So I can only use my love tendrils.

1695
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:18,660
Unless you want to stop using them.

1696
01:14:18,660 --> 01:14:19,660
But you can keep using them.

1697
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:20,660
They're pretty strong.

1698
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:22,660
I'm just kind of wiggling them a little bit.

1699
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:25,660
At first I'm like, I like tried to hit him and I had to play it off like,

1700
01:14:25,660 --> 01:14:29,660
"Yeah, but that would have sucked really if I hit you, huh? That would have sucked big, yeah."

1701
01:14:29,660 --> 01:14:32,660
Okay, I mean he was not able to dodge it this time. Roll 2d6.

1702
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:33,660
Yes.

1703
01:14:33,660 --> 01:14:35,660
You know where they are.

1704
01:14:35,660 --> 01:14:36,660
That's the normal one.

1705
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:37,660
Okay.

1706
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:39,920
(laughing)

1707
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:41,100
- He said D6 instead of Monopoly dice.

1708
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:41,940
- Four.

1709
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:44,260
- Okay, all right, yeah, you do four damage to him.

1710
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:45,620
That's not bad.

1711
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:46,820
Okay, you're up.

1712
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:47,660
- Thank you.

1713
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,540
Me?

1714
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,380
- I hope so.

1715
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,580
- Okay, I'm just gonna do the acid again

1716
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:52,940
'cause it's gonna work one of these times for sure.

1717
01:14:52,940 --> 01:14:54,100
- Yeah, it's gonna work almost definitely.

1718
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,580
That's how D&D combat works.

1719
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:56,540
- Yeah, let's see here.

1720
01:14:56,540 --> 01:15:00,620
Oh, oh, okay, that's a six again, I think.

1721
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:01,460
- You just whiffed.

1722
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:02,280
- The second time, yeah.

1723
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:03,120
- All right, he's gonna try it.

1724
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,060
- The acid is hitting other parts of Sullivan's brain

1725
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:06,220
and they're just like turning off.

1726
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:07,060

He's thinking about Peter Griffin, I'm thinking too hard don't think too hard too hard about Peter Griffin no stop

01:17:28,580 --> 01:17:30,580
Does he have like ears in him face?

1767
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:36,420
It's like a giant like sort of shade version of Sullivan's what I'm okay thinking, but didn't describe

1768
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:40,580
Okay, yeah black Sullivan. Yeah, well yeah, okay

1769
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:42,980
17 that is a dodge

1770
01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:45,980
He does it yeah, he died again. I play it off

1771
01:17:45,980 --> 01:17:50,300
I like I like shoot the tendril out it misses and I bring it back like kind of comb my hair back

1772
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:55,540
Pretty cool, I have the tendrils in the first place so yeah, yeah

1773
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,340

01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:10,140
All right, he's gonna he's gonna try to attack you Pat he misses he's really mad at you though for trying

1775
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:14,940
You can keep trying to convince him. No, I'm gonna let I like this. I like this a little parachute I gave you

1776
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:19,300
I think it's good and let me just go we're two two with the audience right now, right?

1777
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:23,040
Cuz we got the wiener. I feel like we get the heart by default, right? So we

1778
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:32,200
Yeah, it's - - so it's - - it's game point yeah, yeah, cuz like we we totally got

1779
01:18:32,200 --> 01:18:39,020
This is your last chance if you take out a loan you got paid back

1780
01:18:39,020 --> 01:18:50,080
Yeah, all of us in real life

1781
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:57,420
That's an 11 plus. Oh wait. Yeah. Yeah, wait. What do I add to that?

1782
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:00,660
Deception oh oh true

1783
01:19:00,660 --> 01:19:05,580
Let's say come on. I'd say that's a 13

1784
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:12,900
Adding a 2 to an 11

1785
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:17,100
No

1786
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:20,060
He evaporates

1787
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:23,540
Fuck you

1788
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:33,140
One what huh okay, all right, so there's not like you don't have a secret thing at the end where they win oh

1789
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:37,880
Okay, okay

1790
01:19:49,140 --> 01:19:51,140
We need them to pick the heart in the brain

1791
01:19:51,140 --> 01:19:56,540
Okay

1792
01:19:56,540 --> 01:20:00,140
For the heart

1793
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:07,340
Let's see we have here a the Grinch

1794
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:16,100
And a time bomb that's a tough one

1795
01:20:18,460 --> 01:20:20,460
Wonder what the audience will choose

1796
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:23,380
ranch

1797
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:29,820
People people like the Grinch these days. I don't know the kids these days time bomb

1798
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:43,420
We hate that we don't like that actually and we want to change it to the other one

1799
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:46,000
I'm one of the audience members, and I hate the grill

1800
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:50,880
My name is Brian, and I hate that nurse the brain

1801
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:58,580
Nah you wrong for that jack-in-the-box

1802
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:07,020
Or a magic 8-ball that only says outlook not good and reply hazy those are your options

1803
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:10,620
Jack in the box

1804
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,620
You should listen to him

1805
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:16,700
Magic 8-ball

1806
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:24,900
The pro to you. More like a magic one ball. What up? That's what's up. Jack in the box

1807
01:21:24,900 --> 01:21:36,940
or magic eight ball? Jack in the box. He's the worst nurse ever. How many patients have

1808
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:41,540
you killed? You're like one of those, you're the one of the nurses who makes the dancing

1809
01:21:41,540 --> 01:21:47,180
videos while the guy dies a fucking mono. I think I saw a true crime documentary on Netflix

1810
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:54,180
about you. Alright I've got the ending here based on your choices. So. You can still,

1811
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:59,260
you can go, you can do whatever you want bro. Just put the applause meter down I guess.

1812
01:21:59,260 --> 01:22:06,260
Alright so the gills ending. Bring it with you I guess. Just go. Leave the venue. I'll

1813
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:12,000
you guys tomorrow Sullivan immediately dies into the nearest body of water so

1814
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:17,580
he can continue breathing and then what was the stomach it was IBS thank you oh

1815
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:24,260
this one's fun okay yeah he starts shitting up a storm

1816
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:32,060
you have to check the notes for that what does he do with IBS what's the joke

1817
01:22:32,060 --> 01:22:37,580
here the angle propelling him far too wide across the sea until he reaches

1818
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:44,340
London where being the best-looking person in England he is immediately a

1819
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:49,780
celebrity Sullivan the handsome sea frog goes on to have an illustrious career as

1820
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:53,820
a personality and then would you pick for the heart Grinch okay but the hatred

1821
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:58,060
instilled in his heart means he wants more not just an acting career he needs

1822
01:22:58,060 --> 01:23:03,220
to do singing he needs to be a director he is bad at both of these things he has a

1823
01:23:03,220 --> 01:23:08,420
Hasselhoff style downfall with no end in sight finally he gets a call it's Elton

1824
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:11,780
John who always seems to be there when a celebrity is on the brink of killing

1825
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:16,740
themselves in case you haven't noticed okay and what is next what else do we

1826
01:23:16,740 --> 01:23:22,900
got here got Jack in the box and we got talk about his penis oh yeah that doesn't

1827
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:28,620
affect any of the endings. Elton John, Sullivan, I love you. I love you. You're

1828
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:36,260
my Tony dancer. You wrote a script, but you need to take a dance break and dance

1829
01:23:36,260 --> 01:23:38,980
back to your roots. That's confusing.

1830
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:47,100
Elton John says, no, Sullivan says to that, he starts humming the only thing he

1831
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,100
can say now with his new brain.

1832
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,100
(mimics the tune of the song)

1833
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,100
(laughter)

1834
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,100
Oh, did you guys pick the 8-ball? No, you didn't. Good.

1835
01:23:55,100 --> 01:23:57,100
Elton John says, "I like that

1836
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,100
Sullivan." That's a

1837
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:01,100
hit. And it is a hit.

1838
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,100
His 'Pop Go the Weasel' tune spreads

1839
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:05,100
throughout the nation of England and he's back

1840
01:24:05,100 --> 01:24:07,100
on top. The hatred in his heart melts

1841
01:24:07,100 --> 01:24:09,100
away. This is the best ending!

1842
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,100
You got the best ending! (cheering)

1843
01:24:11,100 --> 01:24:13,100
And then he dies!

1844
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:15,100
And then he dies eventually!

1845
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:17,100
Later in his life.

1846
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,100
That's way later in his life.

1847
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,100
DM me if you want all the other endings.

1848
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:23,100
Thank you guys so much.

1849
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,100

You want to try it out? You've been working on it a bit, right?

1854
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:37,100

1855
01:24:37,100 --> 01:24:39,100

01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,100

1858
01:24:43,940 --> 01:24:46,980
[APPLAUSE]
