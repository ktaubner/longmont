1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Come here, come here, come here, let me see your butt.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,180
(upbeat music)

3
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,280
(explosion)

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,280
- Naruto, poster, sorry.

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,960
- Have you watched the rehearsal?

6
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,840
- Thank you, thank you.

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,160
- Yeah, I have.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,000
- Blew my mind.

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,080
- It's, yeah, I mean, it's pretty great.

10
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,920
- The shit when he's like--

11
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,720
- Have you guys seen the show about the show?

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,800
People know about that?

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,920
Do you know the show about the show?

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Is it called the show about the show?

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,760
- It's a guy, this insane, I think he's a narcissist,

16
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:39,440
but he seems very talented.

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,720
Old guy, like kind of cult director in New York

18
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,480
made this show about making the show,

19
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,580
and each episode is about the previous,

20
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,000
making the previous episode.

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,840
- Whoa. - Whoa.

22
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,240
- What's the first episode about?

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,480
- It's about what he's about to do.

24
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,320
- Oh.

25
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,680
- And apparently John Wilson showed that to Nathan Fielder,

26
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,880
and I think that probably, is this, are we recording?

27
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,880
We have started recording.

28
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,880
Oh, God.

29
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
This is depressing.

30
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,880
No, it's good.

31
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,520
I don't think that guy's a narcissist.

32
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:09,080
I think he's great and if he ever wants me to help him out or--

33
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,320
We started recording right after he said the narcissist thing, so now it seems like he's

34
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,320
dead.

35
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,320
That's awesome.

36
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,320
I do think he's a narcissist then.

37
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,320
I'm tripling down.

38
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,320
Triple down?

39
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,320
That's a double negative.

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,320
You cancel it out.

41
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,320
That's right.

42
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Double jeopardy.

43
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,320
Yeah.

44
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,320
Welcome to Podcasts About List.

45
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,320
Hey, guys.

46
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
What up?

47
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Caleb, Cameron, Patrick.

48
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
Yup.

49
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
I'm Caleb.

50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:35,000
And Cameron at the helm and we always announce our names because we're the famous three amigos. Yep, which everyone calls us

51
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,440
Yes, and I the leader. Mm-hmm. Okay

52
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:44,800
Um for now for the leader I with the crown atop my I'm pretty sure Patrick's the leader of the I'm the leader of the

53
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,760
Three amigos, I'm pretty sure that Cameron I think Cameron maybe although he's not the most vocal all the time

54
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:57,960
Speaking in the third person, of course, right? Right, which we do every once in a while every now and then you gotta yeah

55
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,160
Yeah, absolutely.

56
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,000
I think that I--

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,900
Caleb agrees.

58
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,720
I think I am the glue that really bonds us

59
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,880
as both friends and as business partners.

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,220
That's really beautiful.

61
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,200
That's interesting.

62
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,920
I would agree, I would agree.

63
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:15,640
I think I'm like the wild card sexual thriller guy.

64
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,360
The wild sexual thriller guy.

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,200
The wild sexual--

66
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,160
Yeah, I'm sort of like the goofball.

67
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,980
Yeah.

68
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,400
So like a lot of time people will be like.

69
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,280
(laughing)

70
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

71
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,200
I'm like, "Ugh, you're so funny, man."

72
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,040
- Yeah.

73
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,040
- Dude, what's up?

74
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,800
- What's so great is that at the end of the day,

75
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,820
we're all goofballs.

76
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,160
- That's true.

77
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,760
- And we are bonded by our goofiness

78
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,720
and we're bonded by our love for one another.

79
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,560
- Yeah.

80
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,040
There's a lot of love in this room.

81
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,360
- There's a lot of love in this room.

82
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,200
- A lot of love.

83
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,560
- You best believe post-recording.

84
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,400
- Oh my God.

85
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,220
- We're gonna show that physically.

86
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,320
- Holy shit.

87
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,320
- I'm ready.

88
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:49,720
- I'm ready too.

89
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,800
I was ready before we started recording.

90
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,700
I'm ready while we're recording.

91
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,040
- What's great about this desk is you can't see below.

92
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,340
That's right. So we're all just popping boners. Yeah, I'm rock hard. Yeah, all two and a half right now

93
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,160
Just just hanging out. Yeah, if only my arms were a little longer. Ah, I could jerk you guys off

94
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,820
Yeah, I came your arms are so long - that's one of my favorite things actually about you

95
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:18,120
I think I do have a longer torso and arm set than legs. Mm-hmm as a tall person. Yeah, it's sort of a Polish thing

96
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,060
Yeah, I think so. Yeah, I'm pretty I'm

97
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,600
You know me

98
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,600
Five seven.

99
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,320
I'm like very compact.

100
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,320
Yeah.

101
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
I'm very...

102
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,320
I'm built like a fucking tank.

103
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,320
But like a tank.

104
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,000
Dude, you can barely fit through the office door now.

105
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I know.

106
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,360
I'm so like stocky and wide.

107
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,320
Do you guys know that Caleb's been going to the gym every fucking day?

108
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
It shows.

109
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,320

110
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
I mean like how could you not know?

Thank you for noticing.

112
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,920
You see when Caleb pops off his shirt, you're like...

113
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Yeah.

114
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,800
And he's always has his shirt off, which is so awesome for all of us here.

115
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,800
You charmers.

116
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,680
He's got that he's got that 50s strong man built kind of right like right you

117
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
Yeah, what is that like like?

118
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,280
Like I try to run into him do people love that sound on the mic

119
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:15,360
That works yeah, I'm not gonna do that that reads that's awesome, but yeah, so this weekend I

120
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
My brother got married

121
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:26,820
Patrick's brother. Congratulations. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, your brother. Yeah. No, it was a lot of fun. And where was it it was

122
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,400
somewhere in New Hampshire

123
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,920
What's the exact address sure it was one two three. You're about to say it on the podcast

124
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:46,180
Yeah, no is what it was in New Hampshire though it was really fun

125
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,080
Yeah, I like highlight number one

126
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,960
Honestly, the DJ was like really great. He was this sort of like

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,360
Like a really annoying Italian guy, but he was so friendly and handsy with all the women there. That's cool

128
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,160
Yeah, did he like runs? That sounds like a nightmare. Yeah. No, it was really great. No all the everyone

129
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,600
like

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,920
What do you think handsy means? I think he's grabbing the girls, but no no

131
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:22,820
He's like leading them around he's like showing them where he's high-fiving them. He's using his hands. That's what hands

132
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:29,980
I feel like he's doing ASL hands. He has a very different association than no, but New Hampshire means something different waving your hands around

133
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,020
Yeah, no, he just was very handsy like waving his hands around

134
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:41,000
Your coastal elitism is showing right now jazz hands. Mmm. Yeah, you know left to right hands, right?

135
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
Hey, oh

136
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,920
He was catching a lot of stuff - have you guys have you guys been to a wedding yet?

137
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,680
I'm gearing up for a wedding this weekend. No kidding. Where you going?

138
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,800
Upstate New York, that's very nice. I'm best man. No kidding. I got a cam. It's amazing. It's amazing

139
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,440
And what's crazy is that I do not know the guy that's awesome. Cameron does not have you ever met him

140
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,200
Yeah, all I mean sort of like it sounds kind of like it's kind of like a magical like thing, you know

141
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:13,000
Yeah, it's gonna be kind of like I appear in a portal right I jump out after a little spell

142
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,920
I did a runescape chalk draw sir. Okay. Yeah, and I hop out. I forgot how much cam plays runescape. It was great

143
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:25,120
Yeah, it was a great game. Did you play 2007 or do you play like the new one?

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:32,240
You stumped me. There's two there's two there's two editions of runescape that are out right now. There's one being maintained

145
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm getting I'm getting the somebody's giving me the waving me off signal

146
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,120
What is runescape? I don't know. You ever played runescape? It was like a free-to-play MMO that was around

147
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,040
Oh, is that where you're like an ear? So Patrick's a lot older than you guys

148
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:53,360
I played runescape hard. Yeah, yeah. I've heard of it. I went to the trading grounds. Mm-hmm

149
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,240
That place I got I would trade my mind

150
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,600
materials

151
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:05,040
For weaponry. I mean that's like I feel like that's like real life though and Romeo and Juliet were weirdly a part of it. Whoa

166
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,620
that your wound hasn't healed yet. It is scary. Your roommate Alex is kind of

167
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,920
concerned. Yeah no yeah no I've been talking to Alex about that and patches

has also been like a little bit concerned but like doesn't know how to

169
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,760
express it. It's not really their the way that they're you know they love each

170
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,920
other but it's not how they're friends. Maybe when you come back from your trip

171
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:39,120
you'll it'll be healed. Oh yeah I can't wait to see my girlfriend. Yeah it's pretty

172
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,480
exciting you must be having fun right now. Yeah I'm having a lot of fun. Where

173
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:47,440
are you guys? We're in modern technology bro. We can be anywhere.

174
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:56,800
Bro. Yeah this I am I remember doing like like when there was Skype and then Skype

175
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,400
Skype stopped being a thing. I don't know how that happened.

176
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,640
Yeah, Skype got fucked.

177
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,280
What happened? Do you guys know?

178
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Skype? Zoom, bro.

179
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
I think Zoom took over, yeah.

180
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:08,120
Was it really just Zoom? That's not how shit... Shit doesn't just happen like that.

181
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:13,080
The pandemic. Zoom got the... 'Cause Skype, I don't think, had the... Skype didn't have

182
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,920
the big conference capabilities.

183
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,920
Oh.

184
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,560
So Zoom took it and just fucked it up.

185
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,760
What was the other one?

186
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,400
I think someone owned Skype, too.

187
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Like a company?

188
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,560
I think it's like a Facebook kind of...

189
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,560
Billy's Skype.

190
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560

226
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,180
hope not. He, I think he wanted to move here for a while and then just did it.

227
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,920
Everyone wants to move to New York these days and it did not help that the deal went bad. Yeah, and all the deal went bad

228
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,280
Yeah

229
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:28,560
Antonio is after him. No kidding. And you know how Antonio gets you do not want to get on his bad side

230
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,560
Oh my god, Antonio

231
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,460
The thing about Antonio is you don't want to get on his bad side, but even on his good side

232
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,180
He's like also kind of like yeah, you know what I mean?

233
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,700
It's like it's like ah like stop like, you know player cards wrong. You're gonna get fucked, right?

234
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:47,860
It's like you feel like you feel like he's keeping a mental ledger of everything that's going on. Yeah, so it's like well

235
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,820
What is the good side always calculating? Yeah, he's always running the numbers. It's always buying me drinks

236
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,860
He's getting me lap dances, but I'm like, okay, but when am I gonna like look at you wrong?

237
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,180
Yeah, then I'm gonna have to like hear about it late or like when am I gonna touch like your girl?

238
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,860
Like you didn't tell me that this was your girl, right? Yeah, exactly

239
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,580
Yeah, it's like and like and that's and that's annoying because he has so many girls

240
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:14,680
Yeah, when we go to pumps you expect to have some freebies, you know exactly but he's like he's like no, that's my girl

241
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,300
That's my girl. That's my girl and it's like all right. It's like you can't just call dibs on every fucking whore in this club. Yeah

242
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:23,100
It's not cool

243
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,240
It's not and he does and I get why he does that because of like the thing that happened with his mom and like yes

244
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,040
Her knees very

245
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,940
It's pretty brutal. Have you ever been to a strip club?

246
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,800
Patrick I don't know

247
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:45,500
Patrick, yes. Me, no way. I've never been, no. I would just get way too horny, so I can't

248
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,300
go to the strip club. Yeah, it's fair. I have such a big, fat penis that it would just burst

249
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,300
out and then I would get in trouble. Mine's small and shit, but I wouldn't, it's not for

250
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,060
me. I think it would still burst out though. Yeah, it would still burst out though. No,

251
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,300
I've never been, I don't think I've had any, I would go to like meet people maybe. Sort

252
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:09,860
like hang out yeah otherwise I mean I would give I don't know like I don't

253
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,700
want to be like I want to be like it's weird to do this like I think the strip

254
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,900
clubs kind of an all-or-nothing I don't want to go there and then be like oh I'm

255
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:23,220
I'm a nice guy I don't want to fucking do that you could maybe do that if you

256
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,300
went to one in like Atlanta where that's like a big club you know the food is

257
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,740
renowned yeah exactly yeah like that would be kind of use no bed as the food

258
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:41,380
is so what was I supposed to go one other restaurant 1000 wing stops or

259
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:50,300
naked what what what and I suppose so eat these with my clothes on but yeah

260
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,420
it's like you know how you feel bad after watching porn something like you

261
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:58,500
like that when you finish. No, I feel good. I do feel bad. I'm not gonna lie to you and

262
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,140
tell you I feel good. I was raised Catholic. I could not imagine the shame of like leaving

263
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:08,140
a strip club just after like an hour and a half. I don't know. Maybe. I know it's like

264
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:12,060
it's one of those things where it's like I don't know like what the right opinion is

265
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,700
to have kind of thing but like I don't really care. You know I'm not I'm not even gonna

266
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,980
focus on what's right and what's wrong. Yeah. I just think it's hot. Right, wrong, who gives

267
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,040
As long as I'm getting off. I wanna see some pussy. I do want to see pussy

268
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,000
Hmm, I would like to see pussy. What is like the minute though like when you're at a strip club

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,580
What do you think that second minute or when when you're like?

270
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,040
Yeah

271
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,060
You should keep going I'm just like when you're just like let's go like oh, yeah, this is it

272
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,980
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna be clear

273
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,300
I feel like if I was in a strip club like it would take like I think it would be like a minute

274
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
I'd be like oh geez and like

275
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,820
and then like

276
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:57,820
I don't know if I could simply continue to wear a wedding rose.

277
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
I'm gonna be on the bed.

278
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,820
I don't know.

279
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,820
But yeah, then after a minute of that kind of thing, I think I'd be like, yeah!

280
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,820
I think I would just immediately, I think I'd be, 'cause it's like, what are you, again,

281
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,820
like, what are you gonna do, like, go there and be like, oh, I don't, I don't know if this is for me.

282
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,820
Yeah, fuck you.

283
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I think the only thing worse, like, fuck you.

284
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,820
The only thing worse than going to a strip club is being a guy at a strip club who's like,

285
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,540
like I don't actually agree with yeah right please go yeah fuck you man I'm

286
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,420
exactly that's what I mean it's get away from my wife yeah get away from my get

287
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:34,020
away look at my wife get away from my wife bro his wife chased him in there

288
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,220
you shouldn't get away that's the most fun GTA game when you go in the strip

289
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:41,580
when you go to the strip club and you try to touch her boobs and then the

290
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:46,060
bouncer like looks in every five seconds and then you have to stop. It's pretty fun.

291
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:58,740
I never did that. You never did that? I've only played GTA. So growing up, growing up we're very strict on like my my my dad was an

292
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,260
extremely unfortunately very thoughtful about like you can play M games like

293
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,780
God of War because it's fantasy and like it's not real. You can't play COD

294
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:14,120
Because like that looks scary like it's recruiting you. Yeah, and so he's a fucking nerd and so like GTA

295
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
He was like, I do not want you to play

296
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,820
and so like I

297
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,880
Had that and so I only played it at like friends houses

298
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,460
Yeah

299
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:28,380
and so I never experience I didn't experience that like that moment where like

300
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,140
Cuz I was like when you steal a car for the first

301
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,580
I definitely feel I don't feel I don't feel robbed. I'm okay, but I do feel like like oh man

302
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:45,200
That sounds that sounds first of all hysterical. It was pretty lit. You know I mean also it is kind of it's a weird thing

303
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:50,400
I mean especially the age that I am mmM. It was the first 37 yeah

304
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,460
It was the first when I was like when I was like 28. It was the first time I ever like saw

305
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:02,820
Pretty sick. Do that's like so young to see boobs though. That's amazing. Yeah, I mean

306
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,820
They are incredible.

307
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,820
Mad Fientist Yeah, I saw boobs when I was a zero dude.

308
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,820
Justin: First time I saw boobs I was...

309
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,820

00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
Justin: I think I was like...

311
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,820
Mad Fientist I've never seen my mom's boobs.

312
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:11,820

Mad Fientist They were doing...

324
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
It was like a performance art thing and you had to walk into...

325
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
Justin Sex!

326
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Mad Fientist To walk into the exhibit.

327
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
There were two people...

328
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
Justin It's too like...

329
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,720
- Like, do you know how most people fucking?

330
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,380
Oh son, it's just performance art.

331
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,220
- Yeah, my dad--

332
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,040
- We're gonna go.

333
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,200
- My dad left me outside the museum.

334
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,040
I saw a bum fucking another bum.

335
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,440
Oh my god, his boobs!

336
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,100
It's just a fat bum.

337
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,640
(laughing)

338
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,480
It was awesome.

339
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,920
- But yeah, it was like a performance art thing,

340
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,760
and that's--

341
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,040
- And you had to walk through a doorway,

342
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,880
and it was really skinny,

343
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,800
'cause two naked people were on either side.

344
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,640
- Ugh.

345
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,460
- Oh my god.

346
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:54,300
- I was like, "Yeah, this is cool."

347
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,140
(laughing)

348
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:55,960
I was like, "No problem."

349
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:04,600
time I saw like nudity in person was my my grandparents accidentally took took me

350
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,360
and my brother to a nude beach oh okay and it's kind of cool when you open with

351
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,480
grandmother I thought that you're snow that's nightmare that's worse case

352
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:25,400
I've done that. You have? Done it! Next! Give me my aunt.

353
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:38,640
Give me my aunt. Dad I love your family. But yeah that was that was like it was

354
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,440
mostly like just kind of I mean like I don't know if I had like the the

355
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,160
framework to call it this but it was surreal in that I was like I've never

356
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,560
like looking at like a dick flopping around you're just like like you know

357
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,560
there's no way to like you're like five there's no way in the real like

358
00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,920
interpreting that like in any normal way like in any like like I'm not aghast a

359
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
A soft dick is not that.

360
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
Okay, you're not gay.

361
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Cool.

362
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:04,920
We get it.

363
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:10,600
A soft penis is pretty inoffensive, I feel like.

364
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
A soft dick?

365
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Yeah.

366
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,880
Like, I feel like if I'm in a room full of just a bunch of soft penises, I'm like, not

367
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,880
that worried about it.

368
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,880
Right, yeah.

369
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Me too.

370
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,340
Alex, I mean, whatever.

371
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:26,160
Are you ever worried about being in a, like, if you were in a room full of soft penises,

372
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,680
would you be like me and Joe and not be worried about it?

373
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,360
Well, it depends on the context, of course.

374
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,120
Locker room, I don't think so, but yeah, I think it'd be fun if I woke up in the middle of night

375
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:43,680
What if those your friends though, yeah, I was all your friends yeah, and they said happy birthday, all right, then that would be cool

376
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,360
Yeah, you're also all right. And then then that's my god. I've been sleeping buck. You said that though

377
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,440
They said it's interesting recently. I don't have an AC. How is it? It's great. I've got nervous

378
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,760
About what? I don't know. I think I've accepted that like if someone in a window across from me is gonna see me naked

379
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,660
They're gonna see me naked. I'm not that oh, it's not even that it's like a it's like a

380
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,520
Supernatural concern that makes no sense. I'd never lived alone before and I think

381
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:18,440
You wouldn't understand I see things I go ghost I

382
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:27,200
Get that though, you know, but but I think that's probably very comfortable though. It's incredibly comfortable just a fan on me, too

383
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,660
Just get a little oscillation going. Yeah

384
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:38,100
Feel every inch from my toes to my head. I don't usually sleep naked, but when I have done it I it is very comfortable

385
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,380
I'm like, oh, this is great. I just love my pajamas. I don't know

386
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:45,940
I love in comfy clothes and like settling in but the thing I don't like about a pajamas

387
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,640
You put them on and then you sweat yeah

388
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,980
I don't want my like the butt of my pajamas to be sweaty because then I'm just gonna be trapped in like a little

389
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:58,380
Little swamp blanket. Yeah, I guess that's true - I like to sleep cold though. Well. You don't have an AC

390
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,460
That's what that's what's happening. That's rough man. I just might do you have a yeah

391
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Do you put one in your window or anything?

392
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:09,500
No, I need to I need to like procure one really do but it is scorched or the supper

393
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:15,440
Yeah, I want to get the you have you seen the you sorry the you yeah

394
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,480
Yeah, you close the window down on the middle of it.

395
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
The letter?

396
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Did you see the letter U?

397
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,480
It's really cool.

398
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
No, wait, what do you mean?

399
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
So it's like a...

400
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,960
You shut your window and the box is...

401
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,620
It has a U, so there's a small sliver at the bottom.

402
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,480
So the control panel goes down, you shut the window down on the whole thing, so you're

403
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,480
not like...

404
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Oh!

405
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,480
That's nice.

406
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
It's pretty sick.

407
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,800
Yeah, because I have a lot of shitty memories of being in this stupid city and like trying

408
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,840
to like get one in the window and it falling out.

409
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,480
Whoa, that's happened to you? It's fallen out of the window?

410
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,840
Yeah, but it was on the first floor.

411
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,280
Oh, that's still crazy though.

412
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,640
Did it hit like a small person?

413
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,920
It hit like a small cat.

414
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,080
It hit a bug. Did it break when that happened?

415
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,880
No, it didn't, which I was very concerned about.

416
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,840
AC is pretty sturdy.

417
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:03,240
AC is very sturdy and my wife does not know about that.

418
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,680
And so she'll never listen to this though, so we'll be okay.

419
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,520
She doesn't know that they're sturdy.

420
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,280
No, I dropped the AC once.

421
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,280
Oh, you still use it?

422
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,360
She also has no idea that the AC is hurting.

423
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,960
And we're going to keep that between us, okay?

424
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,240
All right, boys.

425
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,120
Please cut that out, bro.

426
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,080
Yeah, yeah, please.

427
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,480
I really don't want that knowledge getting out there.

428
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,160
It is a weird thing. Like, I didn't notice until I moved into the place I live now.

429
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:27,800
Yeah.

430
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
And then this guy put my AC in for me.

431
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,400
Oh, that's nice.

432
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:31,960
By the way.

433
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,440
No problem.

434
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,760
But I did that happen and then I just was thinking about ACs a lot.

435
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,120
Why just cuz it was a big ordeal and also my girlfriend at the time

436
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,320
I put her AC into like the same week and then I helped Neil put his AC in so it's like a big AC week

437
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,280
Wow, I just was walking around looking and it's crazy that uh

438
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,960
Just they don't fall out of windows more and kill. Yeah. I know cuz you look at that everywhere

439
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,080
You're thinking like structurally this doesn't make sense. I did not do a good job putting in Neil or

440
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,280
My girlfriend's one and say her name

441
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,120
Say her name

442
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:13,880
Cameron Diaz. Oh my God.

443
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,080
You hit that bro? Yes, I did.

444
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,000
This dude's dick got her out of retirement, bro.

445
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,280
All right. I think it's time for the list.

446
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:22,520
Sure.

447
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,400
If these guys have made it through this.

448
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,040
That's crazy.

449
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,480
Oh yeah, they deserve a list.

450
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,080
Just talking about A/Cs.

451
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,120
Yeah, we're just hanging out.

452
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,640
Okay.

453
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:37,160
Sorry, sorry, sorry to the boys. We tried.

454
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:37,400
Yeah.

455
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,160
We're not lost yet. No, I don't think so. I guess. Nah, nah. We're screwed. So yeah,

456
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:56,040
you're the cam. So, okay. Okay, list time. We got this list from the top 10s, our favorite website.

457
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:03,880
And the list is top 10 worst things to be magically turned into. Okay. You know,

458
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,080
kind of surprised that this list hasn't been hit yet. Maybe it has. And we don't know that.

459
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,280
Oh, yeah shit. I mean we're doing um

460
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:18,120
But I feel like I think you guys will like that though. Yeah, this is gonna be a fresh take on this list

461
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:24,760
Before this is a by Fremantle Dockers with a profile

462
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,160
Heart he's

463
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:32,220
classified top-secret Australia from

464
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,080
Australia. Here's his TBH, I'm not going to be active here. The winner of the best

465
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:43,440
music genre tournament is rock and roll. Favorite artist, this is all in his bio.

466
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,880
Oh wow. Alphabetically and songs from each. And he goes on the list upwards of.

467
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:56,960
That's cool for someone to not be active. And there's a giant Yoshi image. This is for Yoshi

468
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,440
dude. If you want a copy, go ahead. This guy's very, this guy seems very sweet. He's a cool guy.

469
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,520
I'm very excited to see his list. The idea of magic is totally awesome, but the idea of magic being used against you

470
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:13,560
It's totally not awesome. Correct. One prime example slash stereotype of magic is the power of turning an object into something else

471
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:18,080
Which again may sound very awesome, but you wouldn't want that power being used against you

472
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,480
Mm-hmm. So without further ado, here's some of the very worst objects that you could ever turn into. Okay

473
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,520
This guy's favorite Michael Jackson song is beat it

474
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:34,020
That seems standard. That's his favorite song his favorite Michael Jackson song beat it. I think it's a great song. What would you pick? I

475
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:39,420
Wouldn't pick beat it either I'm picking ABC

476
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:46,700
Well, but that's like is that that's Jackson 5 though. That's pre-corruption though. Yeah, it is white freaker

477
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:52,160
Before I went to the light side bro. Mm-hmm. I would pick

478
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:58,860
Yes, yes, all right number one on the list is

479
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,460
Toilet would not want to be a toilet the toilet not only you have to grab

480
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:09,300
You know what and forced to be sat by people it'll be very boring standing in the bathroom restroom all day

481
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
I think that's the probably the problem with any

482
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:19,580
Stationary object you can't move around can't move around you have to grab. You know what's though. I don't know how toilets are really doing

483
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:29,580
It would be it wouldn't be bad being like a toilet in like a cool like have you seen those like

484
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:35,140
Things like and a millionaires like crazy thing where it's like the toilet is like moving

485
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:46,180
You get rich enough right? Yeah, you know what I mean? Like I feel like I know like so far

486
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,840
I don't like a bidet toilet. No, like I saw someone on Instagram

487
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,940
I know posted like a thing where they're sitting in a bathroom in the window. There was a window in front of it

488
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:00,400
That one so you're saying a toilet with a view not so bad. Yeah, you got toilet

489
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,840
I mean if you had to be a toilet, I would want to be a toilet with the view. Mm-hmm

490
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,520
Yeah, don't think that's crazy. It's a great comment number two. Yuck. I would not appreciate people rubbing their butt on me. Thank you

491
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,720
Ginger for PS I would vote poop too, but I don't have enough votes

492
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,800
- Thanks for letting us know.

493
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,160
- I didn't even know you could live in on boats.

494
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,920
- Did not know that was a limited resource.

495
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,840
Yeah, I mean, I think the real downside of the toilet

496
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,520
is piss and shit. - Poopy.

497
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,480
- And butts.

498
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
- Oh my gosh. - Dirty butts.

499
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,080
- Butts I think is the least of my worries.

500
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,000
Butts, I guess, is very good. - The shit is the worst part.

501
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,960
- And I guess you're eating it too.

502
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,800
- Are you eating it?

503
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,280
- Well, so the image-- - Why are you assuming

504
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,320
that's your mouth?

505
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
I guess I'm-- - I think that--

506
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,900
- Is that the mouth? - I think out of anything

507
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,600
to be the mouth, I would assume that is.

508
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,280
- I mean, I guess like any drawing I've seen

509
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:44,480
of a toilet-- - It's your asshole.

510
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,440
- A toilet with eyes on it?

511
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,720
- It's the mouth and then you have to talk, yeah.

512
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,560
- That makes sense to me.

513
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,280
- Honestly, if I'm a toilet that can talk

514
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,840
and look around and stuff, I'm probably--

515
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,200
- Please don't shit in me.

516
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,040
- Hey, stop it.

517
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:56,960
(laughing)

518
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,720
- Hey, knock it off, pal.

519
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,560
(laughing)

520
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,380
- Right?

521
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,200
- That's how a toilet would talk, right?

522
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,840
- Really, you're only wiping twice?

523
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,720
Come on, dude, sit down more.

524
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,560
Wipe more, bro.

525
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,160
- You're a freak.

526
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,000
- Shit in me.

527
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,240
- I mean, honestly, if I was a toilet,

528
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,040
I'd probably be into it at a certain point.

529
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,880
- You kind of have to.

530
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,720
- You have to be, right?

531
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,560
- You pass the breaking point.

532
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,380
- Yeah, that's sort of--

533
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,760
(laughing)

534
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,600
- Yes!

535
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,420
- Hey, buddy!

536
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,260
- Woo!

537
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,000
- But Marge, I don't wanna be a toilet.

538
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,320
Please, I don't wanna pee and poop in me

539
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,600
from someone else's body,

540
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
especially if they smear it all over me.

541
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,760
Yeah, I mean, people--

542
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,680
- Do you guys ever put down,

543
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,240
do you guys put down the toilet paper

544
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,600
when you go to a public toilet or no?

545
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,920
- I almost never see these public toilets.

546
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,760
- Oh, really?

547
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,600
- Not for poop.

548
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,680
- That's pretty nice.

549
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,880
I'm of the belief that my butt,

550
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:48,360
the butt that sits on the toilet seat is not that dirty.

551
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,920
- Yeah, I'm in your camp.

552
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,640
- So I'm not really that worried.

553
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,720
- Like other people's butts aren't that dirty?

554
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,200
- I don't think that the thing

555
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,160
that the toilet ring sits on is that dirty.

556
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,400
Because I don't consider my piece, my ass and stuff,

557
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,800
like my surrounding ass. - Your ass piece.

558
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,600
- My little ass piece.

559
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,760
I don't consider that to be filthy dirty.

560
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,160
- I don't even know if it's a dirty thing.

561
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,680
Like I just don't want it to be like touching somewhere where someone else's but yeah, I'll give it a read

562
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,560
You know, I'm very much like in the belief of like people

563
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,340
I mean, I and I keep my my shit very very clean

564
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:26,960
but I also do believe in but I do believe that like things are more sanitary than we

565
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,960
Act like they are at least in the United States. It's like most shit is like

566
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,280
Pretty clean relatively speaking a gas station. I'll throw it like a shitty gas station. I'll throw down some paper

567
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,960
Do you guys wash your hands when you use like bathrooms at like bars?

568
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,280
Well, I got the of you like a dirty bar or a dirty gas station if you pee do you wash your hand?

569
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:51,160
Yes, every time I almost never if I'm not like a bar and I'm going in the covert era

570
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:55,880
You're not washing your hands after using I just don't I try I'll roll up the sleeves or something and just try not to touch

571
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,000
As a little as possible. I just feel like my touching your penis though

572
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,520
Well, my penis is cleaner than whatever that been touching those faucets. You know, I mean, okay, that's what you mean

573
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,360
door knob um generally I just touch this because you know what you touch the

574
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,560
fucking thing and you wash your hands and I guess you're touching it off do it

575
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:18,160
after you wash your hands to turn it off I think about that and then you opening

576
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,200
the door again I think I have like gangrene or something everything's a

577
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,560
read get yourself checked out if the sink is nice enough I'm gonna wash in

578
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:31,400
the sink mm-hmm full body yeah number two is pinata pinata is based on llamas

579
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,080
- May look cute, but if someone tried beating you up

580
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,640
with a weapon in a game,

581
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,900
that would have been extremely painful.

582
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,080
- Clearly this guy has never been to battle.

583
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,480
- Ow, ouch, stop hitting me with that.

584
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,960
That's what you'd be thinking as your insides spill out

585
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,360
and you take your last look at the world.

586
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,860
It would be last breath, but well,

587
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,760
I don't think pinatas can breathe.

588
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,480
- So this one brings up a very good thing,

589
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,200
which is if you are being transformed into a new object,

590
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,360
you probably want to go out pretty quick.

591
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,360
That is true.

592
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,640
And I think the pinata is kind of giving you that quick out.

593
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,920
The question is here too, I guess in this case we're assuming you have nerve endings,

594
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,400
like you're feeling all this stuff, right?

595
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,760
And once your body breaks open, you're probably dead.

596
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Okay, yeah.

597
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Right?

598
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,760
I mean it doesn't make sense.

599
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,120
Or it's a slow death and you're just on the ground like...

600
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,160
Yeah, you're ripped in half like a chicken.

601
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Yeah.

602
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:29,400
It's like if you turn into a pinata, just imagine all these kids beating you with sharp

603
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,440
objects such as baseball bats until they finally slice you in half for candy.

604
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,840
Pinata there's some joy involved though and maybe the factory you're in all the

605
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,920
other pinatas are also sentient. You're giving joy to people. Yeah. I'm thinking about a Viva

606
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,680
pinata. Were they scared that they were pinatas or were they like was that game

607
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,520
trying them trying to... I have no idea what that is. I didn't play the game but... You know what I'm

608
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,100
talking about. I know exactly what you're talking about. Viva pinata. You ever play Viva pinata for

609
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,780
Xbox no I'm pretty much pretty much I think it's a flea yeah sports video

610
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:05,540
games oh really never really got into this shit where it is a sport you're

611
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:10,860
waiting Madden or FIFA or what MLB the show NBA 2k no shit pretty good

612
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:17,420
showing did you play NFL 2k5 I played NFL 2k2 I got in the bargain no kidding

613
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:24,260
game stop when I was a kid k5 was unbelievable I've made the I made the

614
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:28,580
like convicts and the police guards from the longest yard I custom made all the

615
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,660
different players oh that's right I would just play as Nelly and cheeseburger Eddie

616
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:38,940
and I would beat the guards is anybody else falling asleep I think some people

617
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,140
would relate to that I think anybody who's still listening would relate to

618
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:46,860
that I feel like once we got to the list I'm feeling people can people came back

619
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:55,080
We'll start it off in the list. Yeah. All right. Number three, food. You get chewed on

620
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,700
by someone, go into their body, come out as you know what, and then get flushed

621
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:03,220
down the toilet. Sorry, this is gross, but that's what would happen if you were a

622
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:09,900
Super Mario fan. I would love to be food. Yeah. Are you kidding me? Again, it depends on the food. I would

623
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,620
like it if I could be like a pig and I could live the life of being a pig and

624
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,460
- That's a different thing.

625
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,460
- And then dying and turned into food.

626
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,580
- That's a pig though, that's not food.

627
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:20,460
- Well pigs can be our food sometimes, you know?

628
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,300
- I guess, yeah, it depends on your definition.

629
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,340
- But if I'm like, that's a bunch of bags of chips,

630
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,900
I wouldn't wanna be a bag of chips.

631
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,940
- Well people are not--

632
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:27,900
- Especially around this guy.

633
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,740
- I love chips.

634
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,580
- Oh, he does love chips. - Just devour some chips.

635
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,060
- I love chips.

636
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,700
- Dude, honestly, that would be fucking terrifying.

637
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,340
Like to be a tiny little bag of chips

638
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,540
and you're like, crushing.

639
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,660
(laughing)

640
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,300
I'd be like, you would not wanna be

641
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:42,540
buttered popcorn around me, I'll tell you that right now.

642
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,380
- I don't even wanna be around you

643
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,900
you're eating butter pop. Peanut says hmm I'm not sure if I would like this or not.

644
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,780
So the jury's out for him. Yeah I think he's probably not given one of his

645
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:57,380
precious votes up to this one then. At least he would smell good. Imagine being

646
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:04,500
eaten by a hot girl. Hmm. That's what somebody said. Be a banana. Oh my god I

647
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:15,140

657
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:17,300
earlier on the profile Yoshi dude Wow asked what is a tampon oh and then

658
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,940
discord one responds with you don't want to know clearly wants to know okay I

00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,940
don't know either though yeah it's nasty you don't want to know

660
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:32,100
- There's four people that don't know what a tampon is.

661
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,240
- People really are not into the idea of a tampon.

662
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,580
I feel like no one's even having the fun in--

663
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,420
- God no!

664
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,040
How is this not number one?

665
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,300
I'd rather be turned into a toilet than a tampon.

666
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,040
Yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

667
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,500
- That's five capital yucks.

668
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,740
Yuck, yuck, yuck.

669
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,600
This should be number one for those who left a comment

670
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,740
saying what it is.

671
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,480
You do not, or who's saying--

672
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,280
- Yeah, no, you read that right, unfortunately.

673
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,400
- Okay, there we go.

674
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,600
You do not want to know.

675
00:35:56,600 --> 00:36:01,360
Because when you think about being turned into what a tampon is, eww, how is it not in the

676
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
top ten?

677
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
I would hate that.

678
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,520
I'd rather be turned into a toilet.

679
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:08,760
Seriously, how is it not number one?

680
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
I would not be.

681
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,920
These people are so dramatic.

682
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,400
I feel like tampon, there's the funny thing of like, well, at least you're going to a

683
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,400
pussy.

684
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,400
Right, at least you're going to a hoo-ha.

685
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,400
That's right.

686
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:20,280
I mean, I wouldn't love it because that shit is stinky.

687
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,800
I wouldn't love it because yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.

688
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
Eww, God, no.

689
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,880
But being in a pussy is pretty cool.

690
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,880
What if you were that tampon that uh...

691
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
A toilet?

692
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
That sucks.

693
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
You're just getting poop in your...

694
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Yeah, that'd be a tampon.

695
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,240
What if you were the tampon that that girl ate?

696
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,680
You remember that video?

697
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
The girl like sucks the blood off her tampon?

698
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
No, I don't watch.

699
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
What is that?

700
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,680
That was like in high school.

701
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Is that a life time?

702
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,680
No, it was um...

703
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,680
I feel like that's not that crazy.

704
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,680
I can't remember.

705
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
It was like a viral video.

706
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:48,280
But yeah, it was like a girl just like has her tampon and then like...

707
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,520
She eats it or like sucks it or something?

708
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,920
I would hope she just sucks it.

709
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Some shit.

710
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,920
I don't know.

711
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,680
It's awesome number four is bubble which I think is pretty cute. I'd be a bubble

712
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,440
This is one of the only items on this list on

713
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,400
This rather not very funny list. I'm willing to vote

714
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:10,920
There is certain way bathroom whom humor can be executed and the other entries are how you don't

715
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,080
Fucking inscrutable just absolutely

716
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,680
I was waiting for it to make sense

717
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,660
This is one of the only items on this rather not very funny list. I'm willing to vote. Okay, kind of clear

718
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:32,780
Yeah, there is a certain way bathroom humor can be executed and the other entries are how you don't do it

719
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,560
Oh, I do get it now. Okay, it's very clear. I might read your read blue my mind

720
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,520
I think on this website you kind of anticipate

721
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,320
Yeah, fucked up Graham. I think it's yeah

722
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:48,200
I was there's there's there is a lot of like sort of pop last thing I see is a kid's finger

723
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,500
You will die very quickly you will die in eight seconds Liam coaster fan

724
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,540
Should we take a trip down Liam coaster fan? Yeah, absolutely do it. Oh

725
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,380
My god, this message is super important. Please do not ignore this message and read it the whole way through

726
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,900
Do not take this message lightly. Please don't bully me for this

727
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:12,940
I'm trying to help you by saying this long message God and Jesus are real

728
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,620
For our sins and rose from the dead true. There's bad news and good news

729
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:23,920
Okay, what's a good news? I'm not gonna read the whole thing. Oh, hey guys, I'm Liam an elevator enthusiast

730
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,480
You may think this is an odd interest, but I have had it since I was a kid

731
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,020
I film in elevators and post the videos on YouTube. I joined the site in 2020. I think it's pretty nice

732
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,840
People really like to put their favorite songs

733
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,700
Music is awesome. Dude. Tell me you don't like music

734
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,120
Okay, bubble pretty good one pretty guy be bubble. I'd be bubble

735
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:55,340
Any second of the day you're with a bunch of other bubbles, and then you're just done no bubble

736
00:38:55,340 --> 00:39:00,600
I mean, I guess bubble on the quick death line. Yes, pretty smooth. Yeah, but bubble on the

737
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,600
Existence thing because you only are your your life is very short and well

738
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,220
That's cool, too

739
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:11,140
If you're a bubble that doesn't get popped and you get float up, but that gets popped eventually yeah

740
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,820
But then you get a nice little view I guess that could be terrifying -

741
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:20,780
you. I mean maybe you won't be alive long enough to really know, because it's the

742
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,900
minute the wizard turns you out, you're a bubble, and you're gone. The wizard

743
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,940
turns you out.

744
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:33,860
He fucks you, then he turns you to a minute fucks you're done. Yeah, the

745
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,740
many fucks you like you're going to be a bubble

746
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:42,940
spell on you. Your ass is going to be a bubble Frodo. That's pretty sick. This

747
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,840
So fucking twisted I'm about to make you a bubble boy dark. We like the wizard scrolling this list to figure out what to do

748
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:58,120
Punching bag punching bag is a stupid one. That is stupid. So you can hit it's like yeah, but you're you're putting your blue

749
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,920
You're indestructible. Yeah, it's not a problem. It feels good probably and people are wearing boxing gloves

750
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,600
139 is a thong which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Of course you want to be a thong

751
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,120
deodorant.

752
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh, toilet paper, that's pretty rough.

753
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Deodorant.

754
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
No, no, no.

755
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,080
I don't want to rub off my skin onto some smelly kid's armpits.

756
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,080
That does suck.

757
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,080
That's a slow death.

758
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,080
That does suck.

759
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,080
Just a little off the top.

760
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:28,240
But you could be, I feel like I have a couple sticks of Dio that are kind of lost to time.

761
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,120
You know, they just kind of roll to the bottom of the bag.

762
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,840
Oh, I didn't even think about that.

763
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:32,840
Maybe you get a-

764
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,840
So you can just kind of hang out.

765
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,840
You get a nice little Toy Story life.

766
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
Oh, yeah.

767
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Oh, we didn't even think about that.

768
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,640
These guys like Toy Story guys.

769
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,740
Are they, are we, are you alive and moving around?

770
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,520
- That's what I'm saying, like do you have friends?

771
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,940
Like do you have like an inner life?

772
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:48,060
Like do you have, like if you're a toilet,

773
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:51,460
which we all agree on this list, it's number one, right?

774
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,440
- Yeah.

775
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:54,360
- I think toilet paper is worse than toilet.

776
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,200
- Toilet paper is definitely worse than toilet.

777
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,400
- 'Cause you get flushed down,

778
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,600
but you get to meet new people that way.

779
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,540
- I think being,

780
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,760
I guess that's true.

781
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,600
I'm not someone who typically wants to die.

782
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,880
Like I don't have that at all.

783
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,240
- No, me neither, I love life.

784
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:10,840
So I would like to be a solid object that stands.

785
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Yeah, I would love to be...

786
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
The test of time.

787
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,840
Yeah.

788
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,840
So a toilet is better than...

789
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,840
I'd love to be a diamond.

790
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,240
A diamond would be pretty sick.

791
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:23,440
So the wizard, if he's really trying to, like, fuck you up, he's probably not gonna let Toy

792
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,440
Story rules apply.

793
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
I see.

794
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,840
Is he just trying to fuck you up or is he trying to teach you a lesson?

795
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,120
Is this a wizard?

796
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,080
I think that the whole conceit of it is magic.

797
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:32,080
Oh, right.

798
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,800
The idea of magic is totally awesome.

799
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,520
But is it like a funny, like, thing?

800
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,520
I forgot.

801
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,920
Of course the idea of magic is totally awesome, but I'm gonna not is it okay funny thing

802
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,520
So this is a way to get a funny is it a wizard like you know

803
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,320
It's just like a light-hearted romp or is it like a scary?

804
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,720
Who is this wizard if the idea of magic being used against you is the cut right?

805
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,720
But sometimes that happens to teach you a lesson Joe is assuming if there's an agent using magic against you in this case

806
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,480
It's a wizard. I'm just trying to get my yeah

807
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:04,640
I mean, I don't know where the magic is coming from if there isn't some sort of a wizard. Yes, okay fine

808
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,040
So the what are we who do we who is this?

809
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,480
So this wizard is trying to fuck with us is well

810
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,480
Is there a way to turn yourself back into a part like let's say what if it's like an uh?

811
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,480
Quest like a nine lives with Kevin Spacey situation

812
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:19,800
Yeah

813
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:23,960
You're into a cat turn to a cat and he has to get back to Christopher Walken

814
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,880
So he turns him he could turn into a human

815
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,200
Yeah, so he can be back in time to make the deal exactly with the Japanese. Yeah, is it like that?

816
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,560
Well does he make a deal with the Japanese in that movie?

817
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:36,440
I think he's probably a businessman who needs to shake a hand at the end of the movie, but

818
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,320
I know but it's crazy that like it was still the Japanese in like 2009. I'll level with

819
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:45,600
you. I have not seen the movie. I believe it's a Japanese though. I do believe. I feel

820
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,880
like a lot of people were stuck with thinking that you're gonna make business deals with

821
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,840
the Japanese. It was a very strange time for sure. It was very much. What's that in? That's

822
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:58,360
in click yes to do that right? I think click yes, I think it's a Japanese also. Yeah and

823
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:02,800
definitely a lot of jokes just on the level of like these guys don't have a clue what's

824
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,680
actually going on. It's just like being like, "Yes, of course."

825
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,480
Yeah, just thinking it's a regular business deal.

826
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,000
Yeah, because that's how it goes.

827
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,120
That's a funny joke in some movie where it's like that and then they're just like, "We

828
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,800
can speak English." It's funny.

829
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:16,800
Is that it from a movie?

830
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
I think it's got to be. If it's not...

831
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,280
That's a funny joke from a movie.

832
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,440
It's probably in a movie.

833
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:30,620
That's facts. But I think of a wizard... I feel like if I were a wizard, I would feel

834
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:35,360
feel very bad about turning people into stuff. I think I would. But I think the

835
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,120
kind of eternal being thing, maybe you just need to do some stuff to. So this is

836
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:43,820
an eternal wizard. This is like the third assumption you've made. So wizards also

837
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,560
live forever. I'll put the story together in my head. Yeah. If you're a wizard, the

838
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,420
first spell you're casting is an invincibility spell. Right. As far as I'm

839
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,720
concerned. It's eternal life and eternal youth. Because there's that Greek myth

840
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:59,520
about that guy who had eternal life but he didn't have eternal youth. And he

841
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,460
decomposed. Well then you get the other the twist side of the kid who became

842
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,760
eternal or whatever as a kid and then all his friends die and he's still a

843
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:14,460
little boy. And he sits in the chair. Fuck that shit! You get to live forever! Who cares?

844
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,560
You make new fucking friends! Yeah but I mean. You have the capacity to love so many

845
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:24,000
people. I feel like I'd also maybe turn some people into eternal beings or are

846
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,640
you so poisoned by the fact that you have to live this eternal life you think

847
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,160
bit as a curse. So the idea of turning the love of your life into an eternal being

848
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,360
as well is the cruelest act you could possibly do. So you turn her into a

849
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,240
toilet instead. So you turn her into a toilet and shit in her. Which will be destroyed soon.

850
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:48,480
You turn into a bubble and you pop her. Yeah I'd love to pop a woman. I'll be honest I

851
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,240
got I got lost in there. We're just setting up the backstory.

852
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:56,560
Okay so we are now operating under the assumption that this is a

853
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:05,280
a wizard and we are in the love of his life and this is him trying to not have

854
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:16,400
us exist right no no he's trying to okay so is he so it's a he so we know if it's

855
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,400
a wizard it's a boy and a girl it's true that's facts I'm stupid it's a warlock

856
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
Warlock is also a boy.

857
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,400
I'm just kidding.

858
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:27,400
It's a gay wizard, he's right.

859
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:29,400
I do the D&D stuff.

860
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Warlock, what is warlock properly?

861
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,400
A warlock is like an evil

862
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:35,400
like wizard.

863
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,400
In D&D it's a warlock

864
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,400
consorts with a

865
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,400
patron. But I don't know

866
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,400
what a technical warlock is

867
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,400
outside of the Forgotten Realms.

868
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:47,400
So all warlocks

869
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,400
are wizards but not all wizards are warlocks.

870
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:54,200
potentially. Let me look this up. In my head a warlock is like a wizard troll.

871
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:58,760
So Miriam Webster says a man practicing the black arts.

872
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:05,440
Oh, that's so... The black arts. Yeah, that's a little... I don't know Miriam Webster.

873
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:17,160
So like Basquiat. Yeah, Jean-Michel Basquiat, the OG warlock. A warlock is a

874
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,440
male practice. It's of witchcraft specifically. So wizardry is using magic,

875
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:28,040
right? Witchcraft is using like devil's magic. Huh. And a warlock is a guy who

876
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:33,200
does devil magic. So I would assume that someone doing this is probably ranging

877
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,000
on the territory of dark arts. No, dark arts is like, uh, like you're a devil guy.

878
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:43,400
You don't think that turning someone into a fart is a dark art? Polymorphing isn't

879
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,780
Necessarily a dark art. Yeah, it's like it's polymorphing. I thought that was when it's yourself not other stuff

880
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,120
No, you can polymorph other people when I think like turning someone into something

881
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,240
I think like a like Disney like zap and then right baby. Bobby boo. Yeah

882
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:01,800
Turning someone into anything is always gonna be on the magic side of stuff

883
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,920
Feels like a slippery slope depends on the thing. Yeah a good point

884
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,960
I'd say most of this stuff pretty is basically how Nazi Germany happened, right? It was like something like this

885
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,560
this. I don't know. Farts. It was with first start with farts. Yeah,

886
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,960
I think if you first it came for the farts, then they came for

887
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,060
it. No, I think it's a good point that like maybe we should

888
00:47:23,060 --> 00:47:25,760
like sort of take a step back and see is this guy a warlock

889
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:27,960
and not a wizard. Yeah, I think if we need to do anything we

890
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,460
need to take another step back as far as possible really. Yeah,

891
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:37,360
fart is another one is far another one. What does it say?

892
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,260
It doesn't say anything. That's a newcomer really, but I'm going

893
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:45,860
vote for it. I would say fart would be like nine votes remaining. Oh, wait,

894
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:51,420
there's a vote limit. Yeah. Okay. Just like the USA ash. Imagine being turned

895
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:57,580
into imagine being about to be turned into a beauty or a unicorn or any animal

896
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:01,660
or object of your choice. But the magic trick fails and you get cremated.

897
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,540
Justin Bieber. That's great. Justin. Justin Bieber is like, I would love to

898
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:09,340
be just to be there. I wish I was just a neighbor right now. I'm married to a

899
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,580
Baldwin that sounds fucking lit as fuck drums

900
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:17,460
That's kind of fair. It depends on the drum set if I'm if I'm you know

901
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:21,660
Frickin the killers drums, right? I think that'd be pretty cool

902
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:29,180
I'm the big so much condoms a booger you would be stuck in someone's nose and then sometimes eaten homework

903
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:37,260
Homework is cool, but then homework you get the camaraderie of a classroom adora DVD

904
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:44,440
That's interesting I think this list was made like like last year.

905
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:48,940
Mmm Kenny from South Park. That would be bad. That would be cool you get to come

906
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,740
back. Oh he does come back right. And you get to live in the magical town of South

907
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:57,600
Park. Donald Trump. As much as I love Kenny McCormick from South Park I really

908
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,340
wouldn't want to turn into him. Plus the idea of dying all the time would be

909
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,260
extremely painful. A Barney DVD. Give it up guys.

910
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:11,500
a Katy Perry ended 11 years ago and you are still complaining a Katy Perry album

911
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:16,580
would rather die depends on the album from person one two three four president

912
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:22,540
too much responsibility says McDonald's whoa

913
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:27,260
Donald says being president would be too much responsibility

914
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:31,980
Patrice Wilson a Nigerian American musician who is best known for being the

915
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:35,500
writer and producer of Rebecca Black's infamous song Friday. Oh,

916
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:38,020
that guy would want to be that guy that came drawing on I would

917
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:42,020
love to be Kim Jong. Are you fucking kidding me? I am Kim

918
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:42,500
Jong.

919
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,380
Dildo

920
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:51,620
Adolf Hitler porno magazine. Cockroach. Amber heard. That's

921
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,540
not funny. Once once you get into the sorry, sorry, sorry.

922
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,420
Once you get into the people, ooh, a Justin Bieber doll.

923
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,220
I guess Varg Vikernes I wouldn't want to be. P.

924
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,220
Who is Varg Vikernes?

925
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:07,940
He's a, well he's sort of one of the um

926
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,940
Oh my god you guys went so far.

927
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:14,420
Varg is one of the founders of Black Metal. He's part of the band um

928
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,420
Oh god what's that band called?

929
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,060
They had this singer Death and Varg would kill the guy and he's worse than this.

930
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,060
Burzum?

931
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,060
No it wasn't Burzum.

932
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,060
It was um. Oh he's a convicted murderer in our case.

933
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:29,060
Yeah he's a murderer.

934
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,540
Mayhem, Mayhem, Mayhem is the band.

935
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:38,420
And so he was in that band and it's part of the Norwegian black metal movement.

936
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:39,420
Everyone was burning churches.

937
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,820
Is that the one with the album cover was the picture of the dead guy?

938
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:43,820
Yes.

939
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:44,820
Yes.

940
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,820
Yes.

941
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:46,820
Yes.

942
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,820
Yes.

943
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:48,820
Pretty hardcore though.

944
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:49,820
Yeah, it's extremely hardcore.

945
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:50,820
Justin Timberlake.

946
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:51,820
I think any...

947
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:52,820
I would love to be Justin Timberlake.

948
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,820
Any person, pretty sick.

949
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:54,820
Isn't he married to Jessica Biel?

950
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:55,820
What is wrong with people?

951
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:56,820
A goomba.

952
00:50:56,820 --> 00:50:57,820
A deer.

953
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,820
A deer.

toilet squidward's pretty low on the list

967
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,640
I feel like Squidward, I mean, any time that you're being asserted...

968
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:58,940
I would definitely not want to be Squidward.

969
00:51:58,940 --> 00:51:59,940
I think actually Squidward...

970
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,220
Bro, the living, wicked bottom, bro?

971
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:05,980

972
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:08,700
"Hey, SpongeBob, we may have had our differences in the past, but I'm willing to look past

973
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,700
them."

974
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,700
That's a good point.

975
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:11,700
How many bubble in your damn face...

976
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,540
I wouldn't want to be Squidward if I had Squidward's personality.

977
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,900
But you're right, if I just became Squidward, I would patch things up with all the guys.

978
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,740
Yeah, I would look around and be like, "Wow, look at this beautiful town."

979
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,740
Look how lucky I am.

980
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:26,820
said than done you try working a shift at the Krusty Krab see if you don't want

981
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,300
to blow your brains out. That's true because Mr. Krabs is kind of a freaking jerk.

982
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:37,780
But if I'm able to afford A) a beautiful stone house. That's true. B) I'm able to take

983
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:44,700
my time and play my music and C) I'm able to do whatever else I do like bike

984
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:50,140
around on my little bike. He fucks kids. He forgot that he does that dude.

985
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:55,980
You did peanut you peanut probably pretty upset about this. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry peanut

986
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:01,100
No, I don't know. I don't know cuz like I feel like Squidward is

987
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:05,720
Like definitely one of the most attractive characters

988
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:17,900
They have the entire South Park cast on this list I wouldn't want to be any of those kids

989
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:22,160
I think kidding me those kids have so much fucking fun. I think that's maybe to counteract the

990
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,180
The toilet humor they're saying like oh you think that's all funny. Well, I wouldn't want to be your favorite cartoon character

991
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:32,920
But I was sum it up. You know, I think I'm happy being myself

992
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:35,620
Caleb Michael Pitts

993
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:39,980
There's no name. I think Michael Pitts is an actor - right? I

994
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:45,980
Don't know Kyle Pitts is a football player. I think Michael Pitts is an actor or it's a Michael Michael Michael

995
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:52,820
Michael, then you're thinking of Brad Pitt. No, there's Michael Pitt Sean Penn not the game of Sean Penn. I never thought about Sean Penn

996
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,820
Chris Michael Pitt is an actor

997
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,600
PIT it's PITT

998
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:04,200
Drop the ID B. He was in that um Kurt Cobain

999
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:09,140
Thing I remember the montage of heck no

1000
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:12,980

Haven't seen it. He was in funny games to remake. Oh

1003
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:24,140
Is that the dude from boardwalk Empire? Yes. Yeah

1004
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:29,420
He looks like a me Dharma D. He's like a young Leo kind of guy. Yeah

1005
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,180
kind of like unfortunately like was

1006
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,500
Around during that time and you know

1007
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:38,260
Be he was good on

1008
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:45,300
I remember watching all of Boardwalk Empire. This is a spoiler, but I stopped watching after his character died. No shit

1009
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:51,860
You liked him that much. I just was like I didn't I wasn't I didn't love the show and I was just like I never watched

1010
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,620
It I can't I get like kind of like turned off by like the the like

1011
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:01,460
Dude, Scorsese, bro. I know but it's really good. I'm like, I don't want to do this again

1012
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:08,280
It's a lot of another shit thing about people being like criminals. Yeah, it's like the Sopranos but like not as fun

1013
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,600
Yes, I know like she's amazing which is you know, there's no real like levity to boardwalk

1014
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:19,600
I'm really just kind of also I stopped watching it the soundtrack pretty good though. I've got some soundtrack saved

1015
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:25,940
I feel like it's all like Eddie Cantor like they get like new artists to do old songs. No, really? Yeah

1016
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:29,880
Got a couple saved like Beyonce does like um

1017
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,560
Does ragtime?

1018
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,720
Hello, my baby

1019
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:43,440
is Michigan J frog. I'm a baby. I'm a honey. We sick you hear that new

1020
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:47,620
Michigan J frog album. It's the same thing as looney tunes, but they just

1021
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:48,580
say it's bouncing.

1022
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,420
She does it at the super ball,

1023
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:56,780
but I don't phone. I'll be sick

1024
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:05,360
a queen bee. I don't do you think we should do? We should spare everybody

1025
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:12,720
five minutes. I just I I have no conscious way of knowing how like I don't know

1026
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,880
why. I think it was just us talking. Yeah I don't think there is a whole lot of. I

1027
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:19,960
would not listen to this episode. I wouldn't listen. I probably would have

1028
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,360
turned it off and I think we've had this conversation a few times. I think only

1029
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:29,880
one other time on record. Yeah I mean like what were we gonna do? You know what I mean?

1030
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:34,200
I mean we can you know we have ten minutes that might not be released. Should this be

1031
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:38,000
the reflection the last five minutes. Yeah, this is us reflecting. We can go over the five

1032
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:44,160
minutes too, because I'm like, let's do three hours. I mean, let's get real. So, you know,

1033
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:48,200
they couldn't, they were having trouble coordinating their schedule because a lot of them, the three

1034
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,480
guys are going to go away. You know, you guys know them, Caleb, Cameron, Patrick, and we

1035
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:57,000
just thought we'd fill in. Actually, they thought we would fill in. Yeah. That's not.

1036
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:01,000
Glad to do it. I think they... Yeah, absolutely. We love doing it. We love the fans. And we're

1037
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,160
We're gonna be back every week. We're not going anywhere, guys.

1038
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:10,480
I think this was just us hanging out. I'd be like, "Why would we?"

1039
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:16,120
'Cause it's hard to try to do this. We can't be them.

1040
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:18,600
We're not gonna pretend to be them. Yeah, no. We're just gonna be three guys.

1041
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,200
I don't wanna be them. I'm happy as me.

1042
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,520
On this list, who I wouldn't wanna be turned into?

1043
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,440
Caleb, Cameron, Patrick. Honestly, I wouldn't want any of us to be

1044
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,760
anyone but ourselves. That's right. Me too, man.

1045
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,560
What's the lesson we learned from doing this?

1046
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:36,480
Number 217 is giant hogweeds.

1047
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,480
What is a hogweed?

1048
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,480
I don't know.

1049
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:39,480
I'm gonna look that up right now.

1050
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,960
I know what hogwarts is.

1051
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,480
I don't know what hogwarts is, man.

1052
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:43,480
Come on.

1053
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,480
You don't know what hogwarts is?

1054
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:45,480
I'm just fucking kidding.

1055
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,480
Okay, I almost lost my shit.

1056
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:54,920
But yeah, no, I think I'd rather be a giant hogweed is a monocarpic perennial herbaceous

1057
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:58,400
flowering plant in the carrot family Appia.

1058
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,840
In the carrot family?

1059
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,840
Appia...

1060
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,840
Appia...

1061
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,840
I love carrots.

1062
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,840
Appia...

1063
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,840
No cap.

1064
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,840
Yeah, you know, I mean...

1065
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,840
I had that bomb made.

1066
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,840
I know, it looked really good.

1067
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,840
I can't believe you didn't even give me a piece.

1068
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:19,840
I ordered it.

1069
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:21,840
What was that?

1070
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,840
APACIORE.

1071
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,840
APACIORE.

1072
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,840
There's no way that's how that's pronounced.

1073
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:28,840
What is that?

1074
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:29,840
Is that hogweed?

1075
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,840
A P I A C E A E.

1076
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:31,840
Okay, let me see.

1077
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:32,840
Patches, what's your social security number?

1078
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,840
Uh, 2 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 2 baby.

1079
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,840
Do you guys have yours memorized?

1080
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:35,840
I do have mine memorized.

1081
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,840
I have mine memorized.

1082
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,840
Of course.

1083
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,840
Of course.

1084
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,840
Makes forms so much easier.

1085
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,840
Yeah.

1086
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,840
I got a pretty good one too.

1087
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,840
I'm not going to say it, but it's a good one.

1088
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,840
I think I have the numbers in my head, but they're out of order.

1089
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,840
Mine is regular.

1090
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:45,840
I got a couple repeated numbers in it.

1091
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,840
Oh, that's very useful.

1092
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
Yeah.

1093
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
I'm going to go ahead and get my phone.

1094
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
I'm going to go ahead and get my phone.

1095
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:50,840
I'm going to go ahead and get my phone.

1096
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:51,840
It's a good one.

1097
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:54,320
I think I have the numbers in my head, but they're out of order.

1098
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,400
I got a couple repeated numbers in it.

1099
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,120
Oh, that's very useful.

1100
00:58:58,120 --> 00:58:59,120
Yeah.

1101
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,280
Which narrows it down pretty good.

1102
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,280
I don't.

1103
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:05,400
You don't know your social.

1104
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:06,400
I think I do.

1105
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,400
I don't know my debit card.

1106
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:10,960
If I put a gun to your head, you will not know your social.

1107
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,160
I'm going to kill you.

1108
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,040
I can probably.

1109
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,480
What's the most damage you could do with someone's social?

1110
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:17,680
Open a credit card, right?

1111
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:18,680
Yeah, pretty much.

1112
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,680
Yeah.

1113
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,160
sign something. Yeah, I mean there's a lot of stuff you could do with this. Oh, for sure.

1114
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,680
I mean, I would never give. I would never give. No, I would never give somebody my social...

1115
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,440
that's a good point, Joe. I wouldn't do that. Where's my list, bro? I mean, if I fill in

1116
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,720
a W-9, I'll have to, but other than that... Anytime I... because I do like freelance stuff.

1117
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:40,640
Anytime I do that, I feel really like stupid. Oh, yeah, it's crazy. You're sending it over

1118
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,440
email. You feel like a fucking chump. I'll take a screenshot of the number and send it

1119
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:48,840
to someone. Oh, yeah. No, I have it not written down. It's not written down anywhere. My phone

1120
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,200
or anything. I hate having to send it when we got our apartment just having to send that

1121
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:57,840
to a guy. Yeah you feel fucking weird man. It's like a weird thing that like we all,

1122
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:01,240
cause you hear all, I mean I don't know it's a little bit of boogeyman kind of shit. I

1123
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,040
mean like I guess it's probably pretty bad to get your identity stolen but like I imagine

1124
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:12,080
you could figure it out. Did you see the, there's like an ad that someone did, like

1125
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:15,720
- Like it was like a protection company,

1126
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:18,560
like we protect your shit or whatever.

1127
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:19,400
- Okay.

1128
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,220
- That's the whole thing.

1129
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:22,480
So you pay them a monthly fee and they do it.

1130
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,760
And the ad that they did was the CEO of the company.

1131
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,960
And he was like, "This is my social security number."

1132
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,440
And they gave out his actual social security number.

1133
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,800
And like 10 people committed identity fraud against it.

1134
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:37,120
Like the product did not work to stop it.

1135
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,940
- That's crazy.

1136
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:39,040
What was that product?

1137
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,720
- Oh my God, what is that, Easy Bake Oven?

1138
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,460
- Yeah, it was a strip club.

1139
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,760
(laughing)

1140
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:49,200
Identity theft company.

1141
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:50,520
- It was like a--

1142
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,560
- CEO.

1143
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,440
- It was a guy, like the CEO of the general.

1144
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,260
Just something that was--

1145
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,440
(laughing)

1146
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:56,920
- LifeLock.

1147
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,760
- No shit.

1148
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,580
- Oh, I've heard of that.

1149
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,000
- Richard Todd Davis, also known as Todd Davis,

1150
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,640

based in Tempe, Arizona.

1153
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:14,120
I think this is him. Maybe it's not. What does he look like?

1154
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:18,000
I would say

1155
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,800
long skinny head.

1156
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,240
Honestly he looks freaking freaky.

1157
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,680
Long skinny.

1158
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:34,400
He kind of looks like a combo.

1159
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,560
He looks like a cop.

1160
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:39,800
