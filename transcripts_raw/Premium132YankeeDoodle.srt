00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,760
You just ran out of coins by hanging up, you idiot.

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Accept.

54
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,760

Stop sneezing, you disgusting animal.

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,760
What the hell is that?

62
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,520

Don't do it again.

65
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
It's rude.

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Why'd she hang up on us, man?

67
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,440
Okay, we have to earn coins.

68
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,440
Now we're out of coins.

69
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,440

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,440

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,440
Yeah.

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,840
I guess that's an app where you can get a JOI from a random person.

75
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,680
Yeah, smile.

76
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,240

77
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Yeah.

78
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,240
I got smiles from all those people.

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,240
There's a beep.

80
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:49,240
I got a J.O.I. notification. Limited time offer, 75% off.

I love the coins. Yeah. I really, really want to get some coins.

82
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,240
You're here playing a YouTube video to your TV.

00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,240
Dude, I miss yours already. He was so tiny.

00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,240
He was really small.

86
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
Nobody wanted to talk to us.

87
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Maybe because our name was crummy doobie.

88
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Their picture was Amber Heard.

89
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Yeah, and then you click yes.

90
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,240
Maybe if we put a picture of all three of us.

91
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,240
Yeah.

92
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
Trace Amigos.

93
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:28,240
Yeah, one of us has to make a new account because I am not giving up my spot as crummy doobie.

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
Yeah, that's if somebody could take that and impersonate you.

95
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Yeah, no one is going to impersonate.

96
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,240
That's a good at to have.

97
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,240

00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:02,540
never heard that before well I just I just came up with that so

168
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,260
Methuselah was two years old that you can't put that yep I just came up with

169
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:10,060
with that new theory and he was the oldest yeah, but he was really young and

170
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,220
he died from the name that disease after him.

171
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,420
That's also the thousandth the leoma. I was taught that mosquitoes were really

172
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,460
big back. Everything was bigger yeah. All the animals, the dinosaurs were bigger

173
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,620
back then too. Yeah, they're really small now yeah, because they're chickens

174
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:32,500
yeah and birds, yep and geese and turkeys. You think if you plant bird

175
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:37,940
seed yes yes you get a bird you think you could make a good food out of bird

176
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,700
seed yes I think you would make a sunflower right well can't you like like

177
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:47,580
if you ground up all the bird seeds seeds and so many different foods they

178
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,380
put if you ground up that stuff and turned it into like bread yeah turn it

179
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,780
into a type of bread do you think that bread well that's what the little red

180
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:01,420

182
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,420
Well I'm not going to take the time to educate you. You can look it up if you really want to.

183
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Yeah, it's not our job to educate you about the Little Red Head.

184
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
Was she cool?

185
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
I know, it's really not our job to be talking about her.

186
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,420
I mean I'm not going to expend my time and labor to talk about her a little bit.

187
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,420
I've heard of the Stinky Cheese Man.

188
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,420
I've heard of the Stinky Cheese Man.

189
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:19,420
Oh, okay.

190
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,420
And I know what you're going to say. You've heard of the Stinky Cheese Man

191
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,420

when you go to the store and you ask for default. The original recipe. It's blue.

208
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,260
This allergy season has been crazy. Yeah some crazy allergies coming through. Do you have

209
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,100
allergies? Do you usually get allergies? Yeah I'm allergic to fucking gay nerds.

210
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,100
You're talking to the gays. You said you're allergic. Well you just said the allergy season

211
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,260
has not been bad for you at all. Ever since I walked into this room, it's been awful for me.

212
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,900
Ever since you walked into the room. Ever since you walked into this room.

213
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:50,100
No. No I'm just kidding. I don't have allergies.

214
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,700
I can't wait to take this and then get so drowsy in the middle of the episode that I'm like

215
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:01,460
It should make you rowdy instead I wish dude. Yeah, they should start putting caffeine in zyrtec. It should make you crowsy

216
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:08,500
You're not even saying words anymore. It should make you crowsy. It should make you crazy. Yeah, like

217
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,340
Yeah, like like crowsy he went crow

218
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:17,940
To high school with a kid named don crowsy I went to high school the guy who ended up

219
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,780
I went to YouTube with watching a woman named Rhonda Rousey.

220
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,780
You're Don Krausey?

221
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,780
I just made that up.

222
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
Yeah, she was on YouTube.

223
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:24,780
Yep.

224
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,280
I went to YouTube with watching her.

225
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,280
Yeah.

226
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,380
Went to YouTube with watching Don Krausey.

227
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,460
You remember when they got Rhonda Rousey to voice a Mortal Kombat character in whichever

228
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:36,460
game, I think MK11?

229
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,460
Yeah.

230
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,460
And every other--

231
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
I'm gonna do a fatality.

232
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
Yeah.

233
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,100
She sounds like Droopy Dog.

234
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,100
She did.

235
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,780
Every other character, they just got real voice actors and then it's just her.

236
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:51,540
she's like okay guys we're gonna go to and fight now yeah it's so funny yeah

237
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
do that and then when they get like the

238
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,980
nobody use her body yeah nobody cares about ronda round people cared about

239
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:04,220
ronda rousey for like two months yeah when she was she got beat up yeah when

240
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:09,220
she she's in the entourage movie and she pegs turtle what the hell I'd like to I

241
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:12,220
don't know with that turtle. I don't think that's true like the peg her in

242
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,500
her face with a turtle shell. She dates her. She would be so good at Mario

243
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,300
Carter smash, bro. Yeah, she's a turtle. She's a turtle. She everyone knows that

244
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,140
about Rhonda Rousey. She's a little snapping turtle. She does have that. She

245
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,780
has a snapping turtle dad and then like a I just don't find her personally. I

246
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,820
just don't find her very lady like I just don't think she's all that strong

247
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,760
either. Yeah, I think I could be

248
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,700
she's either lady like nor strong. Honestly, do you I do you think you could

249
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,920
up around a rousing yeah yeah yeah I think yeah easily yeah she's like five -

250
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,620
maybe five blindfold on I could see what is 60 pounds let me check her stats yeah

251
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,360
she's the biggest woman who ever lived yeah hold on let me check you use one

252
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,680
thousand did you ever see that one fight where she's what thousand pounds old if

253
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,400
you watch her the footage of her fights she bounces around the arena like she's

254
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,640
on the moon really yeah cuz she's alright dude she's a hundred and thirty pounds

255
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,860
what yeah five way five foot seven I weigh more than that I mean if I had a

256
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:16,780
machete and she had a feather if she had a machete and I had just my actually my

257
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:21,560
when was a feather if she had a machete and I had a confetti I could fight her if

258
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,220
I had one fetty if I had fun fetty cake I could eat myself if she was pointing a

259
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,340
gun at me I could disarm her from a hundred feet away to probably point it

260
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,420
at the wrong direction, you could run towards her. I could run towards her

261
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,900
fast enough she wouldn't be able to react in time. Yeah, run to around her,

262
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,220
see her, run to around her. I do think I could beat up around her,

263
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,820
Rousey, and it wouldn't be an issue. I probably wouldn't even notice.

264
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,100
It'd be like, spotting a fly off of my shoulder. Yeah, I would do it by

265
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:49,540
accident. Yeah. I think I could, I think one person I could definitely beat

266
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:49,820
up,

267
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:54,820
probably my nephew. I'd probably make her smell my butt in the fight, too.

268
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:58,380
Yeah. I'd probably, like, do an arm bar. You see in the fight videos where

269
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,980
- People reach into their butt and they put it on people's face.

270
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,780
- That's the best part about the UFC,

271
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,980
is that every once in a while,

272
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,580
you'll be watching these two people fight

273
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,980
and one of them gets their face completely smothered

274
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,060
in the other person's butt.

275
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,780
- Or one of their legs turns into a goat leg,

276
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,740
revealing that they are the devil

277
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,820
and they should be beaten.

278
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,660
- That was a problem.

279
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,480
- And Ronda Rousey is--

280
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,300
- I'm glad that guy's evil, he has a cloven hoof.

281
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,140
- Yep.

282
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,620
- That was a problem in high school wrestling, I guess.

283
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,460
It's like kids would be in matches

284
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:26,380
and they'd do this move called checking the oil

285
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,540
and they would stick their finger in the opponent's butt.

286
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,380
- Yes, it's one of the legal moves.

287
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,500
- It's an immediate disqualification if you do that.

288
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,340
- Not, no.

289
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,000
- Which, it may be an immediate disqualification from that,

290
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,220
but it's an immediate qualification for the extreme UFC.

291
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,060
- Yeah.

292
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,900
- Yeah, which is a new league that me and Cameron have been

293
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:43,740
working on.

294
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,860
- It's a qualification for the high school wrestling coach's

295
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,700
private match.

296
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,180
- It has one more side on it than an octagon.

297
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,020
- Yeah, it has nine sides.

298
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,140
- It's a nonagon.

299
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,980
- It's a nonagon, it's got nine sides.

300
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,780
- That's the funniest high school sport.

301
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:55,700
- What, wrestling? - Wrestling.

302
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,060
- Yeah, it's pretty funny.

303
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,900
- My little brother did it.

304
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,780
- I would say unicycling.

305
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,100
- He was a good wrestler.

306
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,420
- I would say a clowning maybe.

307
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:05,780
- Yeah, unicycle juggle racing might be the funniest.

308
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,620
- Square dancing.

309
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,020
- Mm-hmm, yep.

310
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:09,060
- Yeah, maybe.

311
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,020
- Team square dancing.

312
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,580
- Yep, the fart parade I think

313
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,320
might be the funniest one actually.

314
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,460
- Y'all ever go to the fart--

315
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,280
- Where did what?

316
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,120
- The fart parade?

317
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,420
- Y'all never drank under the bleachers at the fart parade?

318
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,240
- We had a--

319
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,540
- Bring a clothespin, brother.

320
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:26,980
We had this thing at my elementary school, they called it the carnival.

321
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,780
There was no...

322
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:29,780
[Laughter]

323
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,780
It was like a night where like you would go...

324
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,780
It's a carnival.

325
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:34,780
Yeah.

326
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:37,780
You would go, you would buy tickets and then you would go around the school.

327
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,780
And there was candied apples and clowns and rides.

328
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,780
That's normal.

329
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,780
There was no rides.

330
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,620
Of course not, it's at the school.

331
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,620
They would, you would pay...

332
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:47,980
They're gonna bring a carousel into the school?

333
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,100
They had a fucking like a playground that they could have put like one of those carny

334
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,100
Ferris wheels.

335
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,800
school. You think they're going to they're going to have money to spend on

336
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,540
a ferris wheel? You guys ever go to a fall festival? We had old home days

337
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,500
because we didn't have like in in London, dear my church old home days on

338
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,380
Halloween to dissuade you from doing devilish deeds. They would have a fall

339
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:15,940
festival where instead of fucking summoning

340
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:21,660
civil war generals, you could go and you could bob for apples as a teenager.

341
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,540
It's pretty cool.

342
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,860
- Yeah, we had Old Home Days was just about

343
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,140
how all the houses are old or something.

344
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,460
I don't know why it was called Old Home Days, but--

345
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,420
- Well, you just said it. - Sounds like it was

346
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,380
'cause the houses were old.

347
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:33,140
- Yeah, it's the most obvious name I've ever heard.

348
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:36,100
- No, 'cause they would shoot off fireworks and shit.

349
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,500
They would shoot off fireworks at the high school.

350
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,540
So if you could shoot off fireworks there,

351
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,660
you could put a carousel in.

352
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,380
- Can you kill someone with a firework?

353
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:44,500
- Yeah, easily. - Yeah.

354
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,340
- Do you ever see that?

355
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:46,340
Do you remember that video where--

356
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,180
- Back up, Terry.

357
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,620
- A guy was-- - That's a video.

358
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,420
- A guy had a firework rocket launcher.

359
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,340
mounted on his bicycle oh yeah something and he was like running people down with

360
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,420
it yeah it's a real candle thing like yeah like try to cut him off whatever

361
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,260
you know I think the Roman candle like the Roman candle thing hits you it's

362
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,020
just like he just dies right it goes to the issue I think that there are

363
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,820
definitely fireworks so you can kill people with yeah I'm sure you could kill

364
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,780
someone with a Roman candle in the right conditions you can kill someone with a

365
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,580
the pencil I guess he's a joker didn't you made him eat it or you put in their

366
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,500
mouth yeah oh dude you know do you remember the fucking what's this I lost

367
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,540
it the fucking the knife-throwing DVD oh you lost it dude I gotta find that

368
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,940
what's the smallest thing that you think you personally could murder somebody

369
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:39,500
with thumbtack thumbtack who's a directs yeah I was gonna say the smallest amount

370
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,900
of poison probably the smallest nuclear bomb but Patrick is such a brute he may

371
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:47,540
not understand such things a thumbtack how what would you how would you do it

372
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:54,540
with a thumbtack to the jugular and you and you you follow the vein down yeah

373
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:59,380
yeah the person is asleep so they're actually completely not well I got I got

them my terror ball and they might lose their mind from insanity yeah yeah

378
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,660
insanity is pretty small - like a fan has a ball but it says it's got a sticker on

379
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:26,980
it that says Caleb's terror ball yeah it has a jack-o'-lantern face yeah I was

00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,900

388
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,860
that South part there there does they're not afraid to go blue with it. It's

389
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:11,620
true. They're really not a blue, but the creators are red. The characters in

390
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:15,060
South part must be pretty blue because of the how cold they are. Yeah, the part

391
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,860
that they live in. Yeah, tally is blue. That is actually true. Yet his eyes are

392
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,740
red. Yeah, explain that. Yeah,

393
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,860
explain why he's blue but his eyes are red.

00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Have a hard time explaining that.

395
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,860
It's Tucker Carlson.

396
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:35,860
The towel is blue yet his eyes are red.

397
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:38,860
Why is that? Why are his eyes red?

398
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,860
We need a new wave of adult animation.

399
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,860
Because of Democrats.

400
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
I think you guys agree.

401
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
No, no, a new wave.

402
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,860
Okay, a new type.

403
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
Without all this depression shit.

404
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,860
There needs to be no mention of mental health

405
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,900
through children's penises unless it's unless it's really funny and this is

406
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,500
like it's about really the character who's so depressed all the time that

407
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:05,500
he's like I'm gonna kill myself maybe it's like a show about two smiling

417
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,220
- You're a flounder.

418
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,340
- No, I'm not floundering,

419
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,780
but I do have both of my eyes on one side of my head.

420
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,620
- Sounds like you're floundering.

421
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:56,260
- It's just easier to see like this.

422
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,100
You asshole.

423
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
- It's harder to see like that.

424
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,660
- It's easier to see one side.

425
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,720
- My stomach just grumbled, I'm so hungry.

426
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,500
- Oh.

427
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,980
- Stop rubbing your belly like that.

428
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,820
- Oh.

429
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,300
- That's nasty.

430
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,540
- Oh, I wish I had food right now.

431
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,640
- No, stop.

432
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,300
You've never been so hungry

433
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:25,480
you've rubbed your tummy. No you're not being chocolatey. Are you a pirate?

434
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:32,820
They don't eat mutton? They eat mutton. How would they get mutton on the...

435
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,060
They have hardtack. They eat fish. And horse meat.

436
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:44,540
I'm so hungry I could eat a horse. What do pirates eat? Horse. Pickles. Horse. No. They eat horse and bread.

437
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:48,940
eat pickled horse. I don't think they had a horse. I swear to God, you saw it.

438
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,500
Well, if he swears to God, that's probably true. Yep. I remember well,

439
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,160
yeah, I just heard they salt their meat so that it never goes bad or whatever

440
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:02,380
and it's usually horses meat. That could not have always worked. I bet a lot of

441
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,800
the times you're silly. It's all dry age. And you're like, I mean, I think that I

442
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,560
think that fifty percent of the food that people ate back then was rotten

443
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:13,480
anyway. Yeah, that's probably why everyone was dying all the damn time. Yeah,

444
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:18,460
Could be. Can you imagine how bad it would have sucked to live any time other than like

445
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,540
ten years ago? Yeah, you had to like, back then you're eating like the saltiest horse

446
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,460
meat in the world and you also have to figure out what... And now you get Cheez-Its, Cheetos,

447
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,240
and Doritos. Yeah, and you at that time, you're eating the saltiest food in the world and

448
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,340
you also have to figure out what to do with that drunken sailor. Mm-hmm. To early in the

449
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,540
morning. Yeah. It's fucking horrible. I hate when you wake up early in the morning. Early

450
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,780
in the morning is the worst time to wake up. I've been learning about medieval history.

451
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:46,140
They didn't figure out what to do with the drunken sailor either and one way it

452
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,880
really sucked to live back then. I've got something to tell you. Is apparently

453
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,780
the way that marriage worked back then is that it was a man and a woman.

454
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,460
Oh that's how it worked back then. Oh yeah, that's right. But you had to it was

455
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,540
like a phrase that if you say if you both said the words like the like words

456
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,380
of a marriage you're just like you were married legally. Really? Like it's like a

457
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:12,380
magic spell where like if both of you said the thing then you're married so

458
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,280
so that it would be a thing where people would would trick women into marrying

459
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,480
them by like and then they're to like the woman would take them to court and

460
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,640
have to be like no. I said it, but I like I got I was joking. I didn't meet like I

461
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,080
was I got tricked and they're like sorry you're married. Whoa you could just do

462
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,720
that you could just be like can you read what this paper says and they'd be like

463
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:35,080
no I'm I'm a peasant. I can't nobody but nobody invented lying. Oh Ricky Gervais

464
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:41,240
and Rick yeah, so so you couldn't just say no. I didn't say it yeah. Well there

465
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:45,360
yeah, it's just funny that imagine that you could just get someone to say you

466
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,020
could also. I guess you could also just say like oh yeah, they said they said

467
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,660
the thing and then they're yeah, okay, but then also if you lie, you would go

468
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,080
to hell yeah yeah, those people so believed in that way. You have a

469
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,240
background, then you can lie. I guess, yeah, I feel like hell's full now. You

470
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,560
think healthful, I think hell's full now because everyone's twerking and being

471
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:10,500
gay, but they're not dying yet. So you need to go kill all those people who are

472
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,120
being gay and twerking, Patrick. Okay. This is your mission. Okay. And also I'm just a

473
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,880
dog. You just said my activation phrase. Yeah. Your activation phrase is you need to go kill

474
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:28,920
those people. It's genius. It was actually Patrick. Yeah. Patrick, I could see you being

475
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:34,040
a son of Sam type. Yeah. Yeah, well, not so much killing people, but if you did kill people,

476
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,240
I do think you would blame it on a dog. Yes. Yeah, maybe. You'd be like, no, a dog told

477
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:46,600
me. I was tired. I was tired and I was so tired. Yeah, well, that's the thing.

478
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:52,840
Nobody would suspect him. I mean, if he was a sleeper, if he was a yeah, let me

479
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,400
tell you, I'm a sleeper right now. It was boring me. Yeah, I was talking about

480
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,160
what a better murder. It's boring to you. So it's normal and commonplace

481
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,920
because it's boring. So it's so it's something you experience. Okay, I did it

482
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,400
and you're an evil murder killer. Which murder did you do? Who did you kill?

483
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:18,140
Subway subway couple weeks ago nobody died so yeah not my best work okay well

484
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,720
you use it was a murder that you were confessing I think you murdered you

485
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:30,360

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,900
Paul Wall.

500
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900

00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,060
see that's not a jank

548
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,060
we just do a copy

549
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,060
different things you can't copy both of us at once.

550
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,060
You can't say it differently.

551
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,060
Yeah, you got it.

552
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,060
You just wish that you had a-

553
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,060
Stop rubbing your tummy.

554
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,060
Stop, you're not being- I can't tell if you're

555
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,060
jolly or hungry.

556
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,060
You're really confusing me with your body language and language.

557
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,060
That's the type of

558
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:58,060
rub you could do.

559
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,060
Don't jiggle your belly

560
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,060
like that. I don't know what

561
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:04,060
to do with that. You could do that type of

562
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,060
rub after you eat too.

563
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:09,900
kind of it's that's counterclockwise clockwise is I want food counter

564
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,860
clockwise because you want the clock to move forward to when you're eating

565
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,580
counterclockwise I want to go back and I didn't have this much food in my stomach

566
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:27,620
so much. I want to turn the clock back. That's genius. And yeah when you pat it that's pause. Yeah. Pause time.

567
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,580
Oh that's so smart dude I never thought about that. Yeah yeah you don't think

568
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,540
about that kind of thing you don't think about a lot of things. What if you go up and

569
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:36,880
- Up and down, what's that, volume?

570
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,620
- Up and down, that is, you know,

571
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,100
you're trying to get stuff to throw,

572
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,700
you're trying to throw up.

573
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,220
You get too much to try to throw up.

574
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,300
- That does, hmm.

575
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,400
- Really, that's how you make yourself throw up?

576
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,080
You move your hand from the bottom of your belly?

577
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,060
- I can't make myself throw up with the uvula.

578
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,040
- You can't pull the trig?

579
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,220
- I can't pull trig.

580
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,060
- Damn.

581
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,460
- I've tried to, it doesn't work.

582
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,180
- I lost the ability as an adult.

583
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,020
- Yeah?

584
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,860
- As a teenager, you used to go around

585
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,420
just vomiting on people.

586
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,500
- That's cool.

587
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,340
- Yeah, it was cool.

588
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,160
- That's cool.

589
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,000
- Yeah, I'd walk around.

590
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,840
Let's kill you, waiting around vomiting on people.

591
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,080
- Man, I hate throwing up.

592
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,040
- I hate throwing up.

593
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,880
- Basically, I probably hate throwing up

594
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,800
more than anyone else.

595
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,280
- I love it, I'm basically addicted to it

596
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,680
and I do it after every meal.

597
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,800
- I hate pooping.

598
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,640
- Really?

599
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,480
- I hate it.

600
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,680
- I'm not a fan of pooping.

601
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,160
- Dude, I literally like--

602
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,240
- We've talked about that, right?

603
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,160
Like pulling the butt trigger.

604
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,120
- The butt trigger?

605
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,180
- Sticking your finger up your butt to make you poop.

606
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,800
- Doesn't work.

607
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,640
- But you like--

608
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,960
- I know it doesn't work, but I like doing it.

609
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,840
- It makes me shoot something out,

610
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,040
but it's it from the front.

611
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:39,880
I'm saying yeah, yeah, I mean I've had to put my finger up my butt to get poop out

612
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,040
before I've never had really I used to get really constipated and I was like I

613
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,480

614
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,240
would just be like a black rock in my butt and I'd have to dig it out.

615
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,860
Okay,

616
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:59,800

643
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:06,120
Thanks. I think that there's plastic in people's brains that makes them afraid all the time. Yeah, that's probably true

644
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:13,520
There's plastic in people's brains that are making them fucking bisexual. It's probably it's probably the plastic that come that's from Halloween masks. Yeah

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,280
every we had these I've talked about this haven't I we had these micro machines

649
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:36,680
Star Wars things that came with little characters and he would just take like I

650
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:41,320
watched him eat Chewbacca he would that's that is my little brother

651
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:45,960
life as a child yeah he would just pick them up because he thought it was candy

652
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,640
and he would eat them. He sounds stupid. I used to just chew on bottle caps all the time. I did that

653
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:58,440
too. Yeah. My little brother, his thing, his like, he would eat his thing. His party trick I guess was

654
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:06,520
that he could chew the top of a can off like a goat. I don't think I have any microplastics in

655
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:12,120
my body. I watched my little brother. I don't think there's any chance anything's going into

656
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,120
my brain stream or stomach or whatever.

657
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,120
It's a pure metal, see-through metal water bottle.

658
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:18,120
Yeah, well it's safe. It's...

659
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,120
It's from Nalgene.

660
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Yeah, and see the way that

661
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:24,120
the printing is wearing off? There's no way

662
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,120
that's happening on the inside. True.

663
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:28,120
Yeah, that doesn't happen. Do you guys think that

664
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,120
microplastics are the reason why I'm bald?

665
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Yes. Yeah.

666
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,120
When my brother was 14, I watched him

667
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:36,120
chew the top of a

668
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,120
soda can off. That's pretty cool.

669
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,120

704
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,000
The first time I saw when I watched a porno for the first time.

705
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
It's like putting my body parts down the sink.

706
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
No, thank you.

707
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I thought that like.

708
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
There's mold in there.

709
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
There's a baby in there.

710
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,840
I saw a vagina for the first time and I went, "Oh!"

711
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,840
There's a baby in there.

712
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,320
On a video.

713
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,240
There's blades in there, I heard.

714
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
There is.

715
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,120
I didn't see for a long time. I only saw the front of the vagina. I never saw that

716
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:27,640
fucking underside the undercarriage part. You know the part where it's like you're

717
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:30,360
looking under a car. Yeah. You see like actually how it works. You're like oh

718
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:35,280
fuck I need a expert. I saw a lady in a video with big lips. I would just see the front and I'd be like oh it looks like a

719
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,160
vending machine. I would see the belly button and be like that's too small. Yeah.

720
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,360
Yeah. There's no way my huge penis is gonna fit. Yeah it's not gonna work. No.

721
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:50,520
I straight up I I was like I didn't see I saw I think I told you about this I my

722
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:55,840
brother got mad at me or we got into an argument at like a family barbecue and

723
00:40:55,840 --> 00:41:00,860
then I was being annoying and then I got sent to my room and I threw all the

724
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,160
porno that he had in his in his underwear drawer out so that he would

725
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:09,720
get in trouble and I wouldn't and I and there's one of those books that your

726
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,980
brother had physical pornography my uncle Kevin when he lived with us left

727
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,680
it in our basement oh that's cool yeah he for like he was like leaving and like

728
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,360
forgot that he left all of his porno. But one of them was like a book that was

729
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,360
like it was like a photographed like Kama Sutra and I like looked through it

730
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,800
and I was like they don't even show the like what does it look like there's no

731
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,960
okay they have to they have to use the butt. I was like 10 I was like okay I

732
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,640
guess it's just a flesh mound down there and you put everything in the butt.

733
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,040
Everything goes in the butt. Yeah. It's a pretty good theory actually. I straight

734
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,000
up I didn't make sense that the vagina is underneath no it's like why no it

735
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,160
doesn't make right put it right where the penis is yeah put it right it should

736
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,480
be facing it's only hands to stand up he's actually be facing the world mm-hmm

737
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,720
you know you could have sex and nobody would even notice and girls should have

738
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,000
the same fly it's it's energy it's it's meant it's like that cuz they're

739
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,560
supposed to when we're supposed to suck up dirt and dust from their chairs when

740
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,020
they sit down oh that's a caveman times when they were just loincloths or

741
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:19,980
robes that had no undies under there. They would sit on a log and they'd suck up termites

742
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,580
for nutrition.

743
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,300
They also can articulate the flaps to move around like a snail.

744
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,300
Who invented clothes?

745
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:27,300
They can use it to crawl.

746
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,300
Who invented clothes?

747
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,300
Adam and Eve.

748
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,300
John clothes.

749
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
What? Adam and Eve.

750
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,300
John clothes.

751
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,300
I don't think-

752
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,340
Those aren't clothes, those are fig leaves.

753
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,460
I think that the loin cloth and everything-

754
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,460
Tarzan, sorry.

755
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,940
I don't think clothes, like, yeah, I don't think there was, I don't think that shit was

756
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:47,060
you. I don't think anyone work clothes. A loincloth is funny because I think the

757
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:51,620
only point the only point of wearing clothes if you're like you know you're a

758
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:56,380
caveman pre-society or pre like taboo or whatever is just to be warm or not to

759
00:42:56,380 --> 00:43:00,020
like get rained on or something yeah and just wearing a loincloth it's just like

760
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:06,140
taboo great board game oh my god dude don't get me started any board game is a

761
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:12,480

763
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,040

764
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,920

765
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,080
yeah, so I don't know how to play it either. Yeah, nobody knows how to play

766
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:29,560
mouse trap. I didn't even know there was a game. I thought it was a like a Lego

767
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:33,360
set. Basically, it basically is should play scategories on the podcast. I'm

768
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,640
getting a serious desire to do something right now. Yeah, want to play

769
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,840
scategories? No, that's not that I don't know if I should, but I need should I do

770
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
but yeah.

771
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
What?

772
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:43,880
Pat said yeah.

773
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,880
Why?

774
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,880
I just really wanted to throw my crock at you.

775
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:49,880
That was rude.

776
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:50,880
It was so much fun.

777
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,880
You hear that upstairs?

778
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
That's what I'm doing on the inside.

779
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,880
That was so much fun.

780
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:54,880
You hear those kids crying?

781
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:55,880
Nobody can hear it upstairs.

782
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,880
Those kids always wanted to throw my shoe.

783
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:57,880
Yeah.

784
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:58,880
I've never done that.

785
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
I threw my shoe.

786
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:00,880
I told you about this.

787
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,080
I threw my shoe at a kid at a football game in high school.

788
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,880
I just threw my shoe at you and you just had no reaction.

789
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,880
Yeah.

790
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:07,880
Why?

791
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
I got a lot of stuff thrown at me.

792
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:09,880
You have to do it again.

793
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:13,320
I need you to react to that. If I threw that at Cameron, he'd be up here, he'd be tickling

794
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:18,960
me. So like, why aren't you tickling me? Don't want to. I threw my shoe at a kid and

795
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,040
it started a fight. It's microplastics. It flattens the affect. But now he's going to

796
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:26,600
be scared every time I have a shoe on him. He's depressed from microplastics and he can't

797
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,920
even, he can't even, he can't even feel anything. He can't even react to a shoe hitting him?

798
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,880
Yeah, he has no, he has no emotion. I'm not going to react to anything hitting me. Anything?

799
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,080
What about a million dollars? You're that serious? You're those kids that get beaten

800
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,080
up all the time? Hitting your wallet. That's what I'm doing. Yeah, you wouldn't even feel

801
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,120
know that like you would have a reaction to a million dollars hitting your

802
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,920
account. I thought you were a smiler. If I had a million dollars hit my account

803
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,520
right now. Yeah,

804
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,840
probably by a PlayStation. What was that's a reaction. If you won the

805
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,080
lottery, what would you do with the money? I would do. I that's a pretty

806
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,560
good point. I would spend it, but I would do the like over time.

807
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:05,760
You would spend the money over time. I would not take the lump sum. I would

808
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,880
I take the lump sum. Wait for real? I think no the lump sum is the way to go. You go lump

809
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:16,000
sum and you put it all in like an investment portfolio and it grows more interest than

810
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:21,320
if you end up with more money. No. Yeah. You do that. No because the thing about the lump

811
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:26,280
sum versus the like pay every month or whatever is if you choose the month thing like the

812
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:31,800
way that the year thing. The whatever. It's like thirty years. It doesn't matter the interval.

813
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,840
God is going to strike you down. You're going to die after one payment. Yeah. Everyone that

814
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,000
wins the lottery has like a bad like it's just like how that not Bill Gates that

815
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,880
book it's just like how that is yeah oh yeah the lottery yeah it's exactly the

816
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:50,120
same way you win that lottery the same way I hate when I bought when I try to

817
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,480
buy a lottery ticket at the gas station I accidentally buy a lottery ticket for

818
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:57,320
the Shirley Jackson lottery and a bunch of a bunch of Midwestern Hicks come and

819
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,240
beat the shit out of me and kill me and they say this is what America's like

820
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:04,680
like wait what is the lottery you know you're home never right yeah never you

821
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,160
never read great American literature like the law it's like a short story they

822
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,440
make you read in middle school that's it's pretty good but it's like about

823
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,200
like like it's like they keep talking about like we're gonna play the lottery

824
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,320
today where everyone draw like these pieces of paper we're gonna get the

825
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,840
lottery who's gonna win the lottery and you're like oh the lottery sick and then

826
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:29,960
and then the end the twist is that whoever wins the lottery gets killed to

827
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:33,160
to prevent like overpopulation or something it's to it's for the crops.

828
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:37,060
Yeah, it's a kill one person and that prevents overpopulation. That's some

829
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,400
bulls. No, no, so you have a good hard rocks at them. I don't know what it is

830
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,040
for a good hard. It's a metaphor about America is the point. Oh, it's a

831
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:48,280
metaphor for America. It's making perfect sense yeah, but yeah, I know

832
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,200
that that that was one of those short stories where it's like you know. I

833
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,840
don't know, maybe it's just the type of kid that I was in middle school, but

834
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,600
whenever we read like a story where someone like died violently or something,

835
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:00,360
I would just be like a sick yeah that I'll do their their London's read this in

836
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:04,120
school. I forget what I was a mass. They think they're making me learn about

837
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,440
America, but I'm actually learning how to kill some but throwing a video game

838
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,040
yeah forget what I read.

839
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,600
It's did you get to you like the World War two stuff a lot then oh oh we read

840
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:21,160
we read the Scarlet Ibis and I hate it so much. I don't know what that one is

841
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,980
the Scarlet Ibis is like story about like this guy who just like hates his

842
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:29,980
disabled brother. We read a bunch of books about the Taliban. Yeah. Yeah. I had like

843
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:35,540
three straight years of World War Two stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And a friend of mine, he got out

844
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:41,020
of reading about World War Two because his dad died. And so he was like, I don't, he's

845
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,260
like, I don't want to read about something so like depressing because my dad died. And

846
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:50,300
my my teacher is like, okay, and then made him write a paper on the Great Depression and

847
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:55,580
people had to eat their dogs. I remember in like I can't remember if it was

848
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:59,000
elementary school or middle school or what we're just like we're doing we're

849
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,960
learning about the the civil war or something and it's like I can learn

850
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,260
about that really have interest you you're not allowed to in the south

851
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:11,620
you're not a lot of the northern aggression. Yeah, that's what that's the

852
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,860
other thing that's so funny. Their teachers and it would tell us like yeah,

853
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,540
you know in the south, they call it the war of northern aggression. It's like

854
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,440
it's not true at all. Yeah, it's so funny yeah, but they were just there. I

855
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:25,040
remember there's one assignment. It's like all right, we're going to like

856
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:28,720
some randomly split the class in half and you guys have to write like these

857
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,660
journal entries from like for the perspective of people from the time

858
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:36,960
like this has to write a like a diary entry from the perspective of a slave

859
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,640
and this has to write a diary entry from the perspective of a slave hunter,

860
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
slave

861
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:48,600
like a video like his job was to like hunt down runaway. So

862
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,100
we did do that for

863
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:55,000
tell me it wasn't slave on a slave hunter.

864
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,100
Do you have that your mom keep that and we read it on the show?

Another day hunting for sway.

867
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,300

00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,300
like third grade.

869
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,540

and was like, "You were putting out cigarettes on your son."

966
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:31,700
(laughing)

967
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:34,140
My mom had to fight the school and be like,

968
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:37,140
"No, I'm not like burning my kid."

969
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,980
Like I'm like, no, he's just stupid

970
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:42,700
and he sprayed nail stuff on himself.

971
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,500
- And they were like-- - Child services stuff

972
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,380
is so evil, they're always trying to take away a kid

973
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:49,820
just 'cause a mom is trying to get a little more use

974
00:56:49,820 --> 00:56:51,860
out of her own house. - Yeah.

975
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:53,380
- Kids should be like Swiss Army knives.

976
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,900
yeah, no it's like my mom was working all the time and she did not lock up

977
00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:00,980
anything with chemicals. He's not doing any. I mean my my my second grader is

978
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:04,280
easy as a child. He's not doing anything past nine PM. It's okay for me to use

979
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,620
him as a night table for my glass of water. You shouldn't if you take him

980
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,540
away from me, I'm going to shoot up the school.

981
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:16,460
I will come here. I am a great parent. I do not abuse my son. I would never

982
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:19,900
hurt a child, and if you continue with this case, I will shoot up the school

983
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:20,300
until

984
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,560
(laughter)

985
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,100
- Can you imagine the shit Steve Martin's mom got?

986
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:26,940
- Oh my god.

987
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,400
- Can you imagine that prank you little kid?

988
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,900
- You shoot your son an arrow.

989
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:33,820
- You put an arrow through your son's damn head, okay?

990
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,280
That is unacceptable, Mrs. Martin.

991
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:38,780
- Yeah, dude, that's Carrot Top's mom, too.

992
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:39,780
- Oh my god.

993
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:41,860
- Are you kidding me?

994
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,540
I don't know any of his famous props.

995
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:45,500
- Well, who's that other guy?

996
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:46,340
- Amazing Jonathan?

997
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:47,920
- No, the other guy?

998
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,540
with the watermelons?

999
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,380
- Oh, Gallagher.

1000
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:53,760
- Hey, you put watermelon on your son.

1001
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,280
- Oh, you did you cover your son with watermelon

1002
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,520
and send him to school?

1003
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,840
- Hey, I mean, any of these stand up comedians,

1004
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,840
it would be easy to accuse their parent of abusing them.

1005
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,000
It's like, hey, you make your son

1006
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,320
wanna be a stand up comedian?

1007
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,140
- Come on.

1008
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:08,560
- Come on, comedy?

1009
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:09,480
Seriously?

1010
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:10,320
Come on, dude.

1011
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,000
- These people are actually,

1012
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,520
honestly, comedians are broken.

1013
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:14,360
- Did you?

1014
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:15,180
- They're broken people.

1015
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,020
- Uh-huh.

1016
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:16,860
- They're all in therapy.

1017
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:18,920
- Have you ever considered that maybe like comedians

1018
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:22,480
they're like depressed and they crash on each other's couches. I think we need to

1019
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:28,280
make it weird. Yeah, I think that's how we roll. I think we make it weird. Yeah,

1022
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:42,280

1023
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,460

It's amazing.

1029
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:52,660

I've got to get a divorce or something.

1035
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,960
No, he doesn't get a divorce.

1036
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,260
I think this show's about being divorced.

1037
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:04,260
No, it's not about divorce.

1038
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:05,260
